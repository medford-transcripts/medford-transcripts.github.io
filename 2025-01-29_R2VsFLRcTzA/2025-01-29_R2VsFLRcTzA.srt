[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is in order.

18
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: First thing we're going to do is work on and approve, potentially approve the monthly, the, sorry, monthly newsletter.

19
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:25,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Just gonna really quickly share my screen.

20
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:36,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to thank Councilor Lazzaro for drafting this month's newsletter and sending it out to folks.

21
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:54,517
[SPEAKER_04]: drafted a couple of changes to this, just a few minor changes to the, excuse me, just a few minor changes to the blurb, as well as some minor grammatical changes.

22
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Do y'all have access to?

23
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my Outlook is just freezing up right now.

24
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Outlook doesn't work.

25
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

26
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:07,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put,

27
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:17,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just going to make sure that in terms of one moment, I can put the link to this one in the zoom chat if you're on zoom.

28
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

29
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:22,794
One moment.

30
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:26,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to share this.

31
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:29,278
Link view.

32
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:40,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoom again.

33
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:43,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

34
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Share.

35
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now I'm just gonna paste the sharing link into the chat for this one.

36
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:01,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna look over the edits.

37
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:10,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so basically it's just a, I think this is getting pretty routine right now, by now, which is great.

38
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically just clarified the only edits I made to Councilor Lazzaro's text, which she sent out to the committee yesterday was to,

39
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:32,636
[SPEAKER_04]: have the was to clarify the status of the Salem Street Corridor rezoning, um, its status and the Community Development Board, um, as well as on the Governance Committee.

40
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:41,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify that mainly what we talked about were changes, um, to City Council composition, since that was probably the most, uh,

41
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: that we probably spent the most time discussing that particular topic.

42
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:52,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just figured for clarification purposes, I wanted to add that in there.

43
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:59,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that is, that's about it.

44
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I added a the in there, the calendar year 2025.

45
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:06,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, oh, I see Councilor Tseng put his,

46
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:12,657
[SPEAKER_04]: put his up first, I'm just going to turn his mic on.

47
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:13,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

48
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:14,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

49
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,201
[SPEAKER_06]: A few notes.

50
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:29,051
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one about the governance committee item, I like the edit that you suggested about putting in the, including discussions regarding the change of city council composition.

51
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:36,658
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could put in something about how we will make, we're keeping discussions open.

52
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:50,263
[SPEAKER_06]: and taking a final vote in a future committee, that would be, I think, helpful for residents to know that we haven't made any final changes to this document.

53
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:56,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we should also clarify exactly what was referred out of governance in that case?

54
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:59,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not for sure.

55
00:06:59,227 --> 00:06:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

56
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:19,733
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard anything out of governance, but maybe we could say something like the committee adopted a number of edits which continue to be up for discussion and can continue to be on the table pending a final vote in a future committee of the whole meeting.

57
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say the committee referred

58
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:43,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the only thing I would say is we didn't just refer discussion of this matter or any edit.

59
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:49,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So of any potential or any edits, I guess, instead of this matter.

60
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:52,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Refer discussion of any potential edits.

61
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something along those lines.

62
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:03,725
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could capitalize committee since proper now or proper now.

63
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, but to me, that is a little, like, I would not get from that what I think you mean.

64
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:11,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

65
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:11,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:12,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to, yeah.

67
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, that sounds like when you push this off to the other, whereas we're still discussing it internally.

68
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:23,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just be, if you want to probably say no decisions have been made yet, I would say that.

69
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:23,767
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

70
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:25,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that makes sense.

72
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little more direct, yeah.

73
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:27,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little more direct.

74
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:27,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

75
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:30,028
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

76
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:41,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can also move on from this and I can suggest some language in the meantime.

77
00:08:42,734 --> 00:09:01,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other main question or point I had was, I'm noticing in this version of the newsletter in particular, there's a lot of like, in the general business, there's a lot of points that start out with the same like, at the December 17 meeting, at this meeting, at this meeting,

78
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:20,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if we could do one big bullet point, or one big header that's just, not header, but like, one big point that's just like, at the December 17th meeting, cold, and sub-bullet points for the rest, just to like, make it a little bit more readable, and to make the context stand out a little bit more.

79
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,632
[SPEAKER_06]: But Councilor O'Trella, I mean, you know more about how this is gonna be formatted than I do.

80
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:27,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would, I would say, um,

81
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:43,317
[SPEAKER_04]: combined, it would probably make it a little bit cleaner to combine the points about CCOPS and the welcoming city ordinance from the January 14th meeting.

82
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one way to sort of shorten it a little bit.

83
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We also so that that's yeah and then January passed a resolution for more activities.

84
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:14,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We approved.

85
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a good way to describe it.

86
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,346
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

87
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:45,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lemon, do you think you could share edit access to me?

88
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

89
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

90
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:57,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to unshare the screen to keep some emails private, but I'm not gonna

91
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:13,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I just added your emails to this.

92
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:17,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

93
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:18,415
Yep.

94
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:52,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean we really did just do a lot of January 14 meeting.

95
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And i'm also just going to go and combine the two liquor licenses.

96
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:03,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

97
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:09,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two separate meetings if we don't if we're not bothered by when the things are happening.

98
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bother me either, but I mean.

99
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:14,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

100
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:17,709
[SPEAKER_01]: The previous newsletters had them separated by date.

101
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:19,149
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

102
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think this is overall pretty good.

103
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:37,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to wait on Councilor Tseng to finish his thoughts on the City Council composition.

104
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think what you have right there is fine, Councilor Tseng.

105
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

106
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

107
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

108
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Just two minor edits.

109
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is under planning and permitting.

110
00:12:51,864 --> 00:13:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we just found out today at planning and permitting that they're not going to be, the CDB is not going to be talking about Salem Street on February 5th.

111
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:03,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

112
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they, do you know if they pushed it off?

113
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:05,655
[SPEAKER_02]: They pushed it.

114
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

115
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just don't want to put February 5th because I'm pretty sure that

116
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,425
[SPEAKER_02]: they are not talking about it on February 5th, so.

117
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:14,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll just put it a later date.

118
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that would be great.

119
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second one, and this is very minor, but under public works, the last sentence, we also heard from the commissioner and city engineer on the possibility of, the city engineer did not chime in and had nothing to say, so we just removed the city engineer part of that sentence.

120
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The city engineer was really there to talk about the roads.

121
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,663
[SPEAKER_04]: We also, wait, so just from the commissioner,

122
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last sentence should read, we also heard from the commissioner on the possibility of, yeah.

123
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:46,356
Perfect, thanks.

124
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:48,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair, let me, just one more thing.

125
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:57,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could just note that we are beginning work on developing an open data policy at today's meeting, just for the last point.

126
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

127
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: January 29th meeting.

128
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

129
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

130
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're developing an open data policy.

131
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:31,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we don't need to get that specific.

132
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think just just saying we began our work developing an open data policy or January 29 the meeting is sufficient.

133
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:38,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you should be really quick.

134
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:42,314
[SPEAKER_04]: bullet points.

135
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We also haven't actually had that discussion yet.

136
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:50,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have yet to, um, but no, I think that what we have now is we have now is fine.

137
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

138
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:52,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like something like this.

139
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:52,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

140
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:53,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

141
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:53,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

142
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:57,167
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have.

143
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay.

144
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments from Councilors?

145
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we could, we could put in camera commemorations.

146
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, the lunar new year.

147
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:12,086
Okay.

148
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: January 28, we passed the resolution.

149
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Lunar New Year or the Lunar New Year?

150
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:37,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Lunar New Year or the third?

151
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:37,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

152
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, it's just Lunar New Year.

153
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:42,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I think other cultures also have Lunar New Years, but on different days.

154
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

155
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:44,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

156
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:45,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments from councilors?

157
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a motion on the floor?

158
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:50,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a second?

159
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

160
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:52,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

161
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,520
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to approve

162
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,934
[SPEAKER_04]: the current draft of the newsletter.

163
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Including edits, right?

164
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Including edits by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

165
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, will you please call the roll?

166
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:09,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is also a motion to distribute the newsletter?

167
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

168
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I can't hear the clerk.

169
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:21,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what?

170
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:22,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry?

171
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,195
[SPEAKER_01]: The clerk said something I can't hear.

172
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:29,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

173
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:30,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

174
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:34,048
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk is he's still he's still preparing the notes.

175
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:35,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

176
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Your apology is accepted.

177
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

178
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:45,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

179
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:50,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll call vote.

180
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:51,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan.

181
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:51,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

182
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:53,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

183
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:53,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

184
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

185
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Tseng?

186
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

187
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair Leming?

188
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

189
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Affirmative.

190
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative.

191
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,104
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

192
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:14,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing we're going to discuss is the development of the open data policy.

193
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So we

194
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: introduce this as something to refer to committee.

195
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:44,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, Councilor Tseng and myself, and prior to the meeting, after Councilor Tseng and I did a bit of research on this, we distributed a sample ordinance from the city of Cambridge, as well as an executive order from the city of Boston, which gives sample language of other open data policies.

196
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:58,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we also drafted a couple of questions to, uh, give out to, uh, department heads to just basically get some more information about what kind of data they're sitting on.

197
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:09,462
[SPEAKER_04]: As we, uh, uh, develop some of the parameters of this policy, uh, Councilor Tseng, is there anything you'd like to say?

198
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:19,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, just to give my fellow Councilors and anyone who might be watching at home, a general idea of what an open data policy is.

199
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:32,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a modernizing practice that a lot of municipalities have adopted to let residents access data and information from the city quicker.

200
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,040
[SPEAKER_06]: and to let them help us with policy development.

201
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:49,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I know all of us know of residents who are really eager to help out and really excited that a lot of residents are so eager to help out with policy development here.

202
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:54,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Councilor Callahan does a lot of work with residents on this as well.

203
00:18:55,303 --> 00:19:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this very much falls in line with the City Council's goals of greater transparency, greater modernization,

204
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:09,477
[SPEAKER_06]: being more proactive and inclusive when it comes to developing policy too.

205
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:31,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, you know, members of the public have brought up that with the policy changes in the city, there are, you know, XYZ questions that they wish they could have asked or XYZ pieces of data they could have had before making decisions on those or before giving public feedback about different items, or even after with,

206
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: helping us generate, you know, how to make our processes better in the future.

207
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:43,108
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that Cambridge, Boston, I believe some other municipalities too,

208
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:58,223
[SPEAKER_06]: have taken on themselves, onto themselves, of passing a policy or via ordinance or executive order to create some structure, some framework of doing that.

209
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:09,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the Cambridge sample ordinance that we have in front of us and in our inboxes is an example of

210
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:14,614
[SPEAKER_06]: of what this might look like in an ordinance form.

211
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:22,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there are very different structures of government between Cambridge and Medford, so that's something to keep in mind while we're reading the draft.

212
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:31,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it would be helpful to give Councilors some sample text to work off of to give us more concrete idea of what this policy might look like.

213
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:36,830
[SPEAKER_06]: The Boston executive order is also in the document.

214
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:45,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, executive order is very different from an ordinance, but it's still worth, you know, seeing what other municipalities are doing.

215
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:55,361
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, giving us inspiration as to maybe like what goals we should aspire to, what possible paths policy-wise can we take to get there.

216
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:06,207
[SPEAKER_06]: With the questions that, the bullet point questions that we have in front of us and in the inbox, and maybe I should read them real quick.

217
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I can read them.

218
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:08,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the chair can read them.

219
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:13,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But to give context, Chair Lemme and I have been talking

220
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:19,657
[SPEAKER_06]: for a bit about what kind of information we might wanna gather and put publicly on our website.

221
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:23,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the questions that we came up with.

222
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to add more questions from other Councilors to this list.

223
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:36,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as we develop this policy and as we work on this, we can keep asking more questions to the administration and to different city departments too.

224
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:41,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I did forget to mention is that oftentimes an open data policy is,

225
00:21:43,382 --> 00:22:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: is introduced alongside a committee to work through this data, to help clean up this data, to help think of more data in the future, to make sure that this is a recurring cycle, not just like we're doing this at once and then we have to revisit this as a city council every few years.

226
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:13,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, also with putting data online, we also have to be aware and cognizant of security concerns with that conversation as well.

227
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:23,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I go to other Councilors, I'm not going to read through the entirety of the Cambridge and Boston sample ordinances.

228
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:45,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Given that Cambridge and Boston tend to be a lot more well-financed to support things like this, I developed a list of questions for some of the department heads that I think have relevant data sets, along with just inquiries about their

229
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: staff capacity to implement these things.

230
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:59,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question goes to the mayor, which is just what is the administration view as practical concerns to enacting an open data policy along the lines of Boston and Cambridge's policies?

231
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:05,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is because it is the mayor is the person in charge of department heads.

232
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:12,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So they will, they do have a lot of ability in overseeing this, even with the ordinance enacted.

233
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:23,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The general question for department heads, the general request for the mayor is to request that city departments report to the resident services and public engagement committee on what data or records are currently

234
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:31,415
[SPEAKER_04]: commonly requested them, what data or records they collect and what data or records they would feel open to sharing with the public and why or why not.

235
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:42,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I also thought of six or five other departments that I know I've specifically worked with or tried to work with their data in the past.

236
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are just kind of more targeted questions.

237
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,661
[SPEAKER_04]: First, the elections office.

238
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:52,365
[SPEAKER_04]: How far back does elections data historically go both in a digital format and paper archives?

239
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:58,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have the staff capacity and resources to digitize Medford's election data from before 2005?

240
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:05,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one in particular is interesting because the elections website just kind of posts PDFs and sort of inconsistent formats.

241
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And the data only goes back to 2005.

242
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:15,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that they have paper records in the basement that go back further, but

243
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I do need to respect the staff capacity of the elections office when it comes to their ability to go down there and write down all of those data points from previous generations.

244
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: even though I personally would be interested in seeing it.

245
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:37,333
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Finance Office, how far back does Medford digitized budgetary data go?

246
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there legal or ethical concerns with publishing the bulk data in an analyzable format?

247
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the staff capacity and resources to publish bulk budgetary data consistently for public use?

248
00:24:48,646 --> 00:25:06,421
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea behind this one is that usually budget data is published in either different meeting records or in a big PDF that's released every year, and that's excellent, but it would be useful to have data in a

249
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:20,964
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of more of a spreadsheet format so that could be analyzed with software so that residents can track if they wanted two different uses of the budget over time and how that's evolved over the years, which I think would help inform the public conversation around this.

250
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: From the assessor's office, how far back does Medford's historic assessor's data go?

251
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:30,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there legal or ethical concerns to publishing bulk property value assessment data in an analyzable format?

252
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:35,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have the staff capacity and resource to publish bulk assessor's data consistently for public use?

253
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So the assessor's data right now publishes everything via the Vision Government Solutions website, which is actually, so all assessment data is available online.

254
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:59,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you wanted to analyze like the average assessment value of all Medford property or the all Medford property in like West Medford or something like that, it would be very difficult to do that via what's currently available.

255
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that the assessor's office has internal data.

256
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:10,308
[SPEAKER_04]: that they use that they could just put online in spreadsheet format, so I don't think this is big ask.

257
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:16,713
[SPEAKER_04]: From the DPW, does the DPW use spreadsheet data internally to keep track of road repair streets and so on?

258
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,414
[SPEAKER_04]: How far back does this data historically go?

259
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any legal or ethical concerns with publishing this data openly?

260
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:29,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just residents want to see how what roads are being repaired and just being able to analyze that historically, so that's more of an open-end one.

261
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And from the building department, the same question about

262
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: inspections, permitting requests, and so on that would be publishable as a database for the properties around Medford, legal, procedural, ethical concerns with publishing the data, how far back they decided to go historically, and the staff capacity question.

263
00:26:49,611 --> 00:27:03,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion on the floor would be to send these questions out to the mayor and the relevant department heads, but I'm also interested in hearing if my colleagues have any

264
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts or anything that they would like to add.

265
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:19,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro.

266
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:21,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these are great.

267
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:27,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fact that you're for each one of these, you're asking, does staff have the capacity?

268
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see any ethical concerns?

269
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these are, these are great questions to ask to everybody.

270
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:44,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just ask the mayor's office as well, what other data aside from these she thinks would be interesting, or might be helpful to the to the community.

271
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if the health department has data that would be interesting or helpful to the community to understand over time.

272
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there are maybe other departments.

273
00:27:53,003 --> 00:28:03,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we have our housing department is incredibly small, not even a department, but you know, with housing data that we have over time, like there are other things that might be useful.

274
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just adding that one question to the mayor's office would be good.

275
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:07,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

276
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, would we be able to just, um,

277
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:19,114
[SPEAKER_04]: add that because in the second line, the general request, I think, um, covers a lot of what you mentioned.

278
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:27,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a request to the mayor and city departments to report to this committee anything that they think would be interesting.

279
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, Councilor Lazzaro.

280
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:34,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

281
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bringing this forward.

282
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:49,758
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I'm not very familiar with, so I appreciate people with greater awareness and understanding of these topics to bring it to the floor and bring it to the departments in the city where it's appropriate.

283
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:56,902
[SPEAKER_01]: My hesitation comes from the awareness that our city hall is pretty

284
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:23,608
[SPEAKER_01]: minimally staffed kind of bare bones to some degrees and that if a project like this would be difficult to pull off or would ask city hall staffers to engage in something that's beyond their capacity or we would have to, or really is this like a,

285
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:26,495
[SPEAKER_01]: budgetary thing?

286
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we have to add this to the budget?

287
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there going to be a cost associated with it?

288
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:34,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking because I don't know.

289
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:43,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I could take that, but I see that Councilor is saying also, did you want to address that or do you have your own?

290
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so

291
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:55,753
[SPEAKER_04]: This does come with the caveat in a lot of these questions about staff capacity.

292
00:29:55,833 --> 00:30:12,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are asking that, and that is a concern, especially if, I mean, we can't just copy the open data policies of cities that have a much larger budget than ours wholeheartedly.

293
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:16,342
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are, the point of these questions is to sort of figure out if there are,

294
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:30,499
[SPEAKER_04]: low-hanging fruit, I hate that term, but it is used to describe the situation, that they could just easily post to their website.

295
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know, for instance, that that's the case with the assessor's office.

296
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:47,867
[SPEAKER_04]: They already work with spreadsheet data internally, and it really wouldn't be any skin off their back to just put it onto the website instead of the typical databases.

297
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:54,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the elections office, it's really not that much data.

298
00:30:54,479 --> 00:31:02,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just typing out the spreadsheets that they normally publish in PDF formats into something that's a little bit cleaner.

299
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor?

300
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,747
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that is a concern.

301
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:07,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng?

302
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

303
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:10,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

304
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

305
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think that more or less captures what I was thinking.

306
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:36,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think as we, as this becomes a bigger thing, as you know, once we've gotten past that step of low hanging fruit, I, I, I, this is something I haven't talked to councilor lending about, but I do envision in an ideal world, this becoming a bigger project after that step.

307
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I got, I alluded to this earlier.

308
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:41,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a lot of,

309
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:46,285
[SPEAKER_06]: cities will do something called an open data review board.

310
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might be staff members who get a stipend.

311
00:31:51,848 --> 00:32:04,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be community members who we appoint and who have some interest slash work experience dealing with this kind of stuff, organizing data and whatnot.

312
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps that is the path that we

313
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: we reach, you know, that's the path that we take moving forward.

314
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:19,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also think that, you know, that question is the kind of farther future thing.

315
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:24,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it'd be a little premature to take on that discussion right now.

316
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro.

317
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:30,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

318
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:33,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro, I so appreciate you bringing that up.

319
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:40,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that that's a real concern given the skeletal nature of many of our departments.

320
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what I would say is staff capacity is a question people can answer many ways.

321
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,792
[SPEAKER_02]: People could say, well, if you pass it, we have to do it.

322
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:49,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, you have the staff capacity.

323
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They could say, no, we don't have the staff capacity because we're already at our max.

324
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:56,866
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's five minutes, right?

325
00:32:56,986 --> 00:33:10,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think adding a question of a rough cost estimate would be more helpful because that would, some people might say, yeah, that'll, you know, it would take me two hours to do everything.

326
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:11,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing.

327
00:33:12,014 --> 00:33:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And another person might be like, yeah, that's gonna be like five hours a week for the next six months, right?

328
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:18,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think having an idea

329
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:25,882
[SPEAKER_02]: of what each department thinks might be the cost to putting it up for the first time and or keeping it maintained.

330
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be helpful information.

331
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess something we could add to that question.

332
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro was... Oh, sorry, that was just writing.

333
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Could I?

334
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:37,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

335
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Councilor Lazzaro, something we could add to that point is just in addition to the staff capacity and resources,

336
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:46,758
[SPEAKER_06]: question.

337
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:48,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just like what?

338
00:33:54,343 --> 00:34:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we could add that as an additional boil point under General Councilor was our.

339
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

340
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:05,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my point

341
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:34,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important that we, this is sort of a big picture issue, but I think it's important that we as a council, and I'm not saying that this is not an important issue, but I think it's critical that we focus our attention to the greatest degree possible on the things that are most critical for our residents.

342
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,369
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the resident services committee.

343
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that this is important, but also if we have an extra,

344
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,337
[SPEAKER_01]: extra time available in any department.

345
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:59,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine that anybody has extra time because Boston and Somerville and Cambridge all have staff in all of their departments that are like many times larger than the staff in our departments.

346
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have many more departments than we have.

347
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:06,247
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an Office of Housing Stability, for instance, which we do not possess.

348
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:08,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Councilor Callahan just said, like we don't have

349
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,629
[SPEAKER_01]: any departments to deal with housing at all.

350
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:25,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as as good as it is to have open data and things posted online to help people when people are like, not able to find a place to live, they don't have anything that they can do to help.

351
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:30,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the data wouldn't really necessarily be as critical in that moment.

352
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:37,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am curious to hear if this is something that we could put a dollar amount on, I would like to know what it would be.

353
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:43,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if there's something, if there's, if there's funding that we need to find for it, we should find funding for it.

354
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:52,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, I want to make sure that we're not, um, giving anybody on funded mandates because there's enough of that statewide.

355
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all of that stuff is just difficult to manage.

356
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:58,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm just putting that out there into the universe.

357
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, I think this is still a good initiative.

358
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:01,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's not good.

359
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:05,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, I'm thinking about that stuff more and more lately.

360
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:05,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

361
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

362
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:15,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Respectfully, I worry that we're putting the cart before the horse and missing the forest for the trees.

363
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how they're missing?

364
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a long day working.

365
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Missing the horse for the forest.

366
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, missing the horse for the forest.

367
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting the cart before the trees, something like that.

368
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:35,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Leming and I are just really thinking big picture about this right now.

369
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:47,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of your concerns are captured in the questions that we're asking, plus the one that I just added about like general capacity and resources that we need.

370
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:58,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I will also say it is my view that this level of transparency should be the standard that municipal governments are putting out.

371
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:03,210
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, governments at all levels should be putting out and that

372
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:16,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the idea behind doing a policy like this is also that many hands make light work, which I also have a problem with that saying, but I think in this case is true.

373
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:28,662
[SPEAKER_06]: work that I think our residents want to see our departments doing, but we don't have, our departments don't have that capacity right now.

374
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:36,063
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe if we put on, you know, put some of this data out in public, they could do that work and propose the policies for us.

375
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:44,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can, you know, enter these policy discussions at a level where, you know, residents have done the research and we can, we can start engaging with them.

376
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:50,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'll address some of Councilor Lazzaro's points.

377
00:37:50,738 --> 00:38:03,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thinking on this is like when residents are discussing a budget, oftentimes those discussions do get a little bit, let's say,

378
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:20,513
[SPEAKER_04]: misdirected because it is, unless you've dug through those giant PDFs before, it is a little bit difficult to find them, whereas if hypothetically a bunch of Excel sheets of budgetary data were available for multiple years,

379
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:28,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you could get like a few residents who are very interested in that to just like comb through those and like really be able to find out what the patterns are.

380
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:34,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the state does a very good job of providing that data at a very bird's eye view for the city.

381
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:36,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I think that

382
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:49,530
[SPEAKER_04]: staff capacity to support this would really come into play when like if we're like asking departments to develop these databases or APIs and stuff like that, which is mentioned in the Cambridge's open data policy.

383
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:59,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think that we have the software engineering capacity to do that, but if it's something as simple as asking the assessor's office to publish

384
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: their PDFs, or sorry, their Excel spreadsheets of historical assessment data openly so that that can be combed through.

385
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:08,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good place to start.

386
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That wouldn't have too much task capacity.

387
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro?

388
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I

389
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with that and I also wanted to say that I think that having even if you have a list of best practices and like a like a goals document um or like a phase one phase two phase three kind of document I think that's um a really good thing to have um my work in non-profit in the non-profit sphere I work in a the warming center where it's

390
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:50,096
[SPEAKER_01]: we're extremely scrappy, we can't actually achieve a lot of our best practice goals operationally.

391
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we have like, this is what we would like to be able to do.

392
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,699
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're actually doing because this is what we're capable of.

393
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I think that that's still, it's still good to start some place.

394
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,663
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I just wanted to put that out there as well.

395
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:12,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I always appreciate good conversations here about staff capacity because we do need to be

396
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:20,252
[SPEAKER_04]: realistic about that, and that does tend to dominate a lot of conversations in this room, so it's always welcome.

397
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, Councilor Tseng, did you record in a master document all of the proposed edits that we've been speaking about so far?

398
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,391
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I think that was that was about it.

399
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,532
[SPEAKER_04]: There was requests.

400
00:40:52,992 --> 00:41:02,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that the mayor and city departments, I suppose, would capture Councilor Callahan's initial comment on that.

401
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:03,937
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be an additional one.

402
00:41:03,957 --> 00:41:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, I think that that's pretty much everything.

403
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:08,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry?

404
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I think that that's all the edits that we discussed so far.

405
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, yep, yeah.

406
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:24,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I can send this to you, Mr. Chair, first, and the clerk, too, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

407
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:26,866
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we have everything.

408
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:27,127
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

409
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:31,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You going to email it to me?

410
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:33,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

411
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:33,072
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

412
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:47,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I would I would motion then that we, um, send these questions to, uh, to the department heads and city administration.

413
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:56,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as we've directed, um, and since families are online, I would also motion put in that motion, uh, motion to adjourn.

414
00:41:58,525 --> 00:41:59,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a second?

415
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:00,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

416
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

417
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: On the

418
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, oh, amen.

419
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:17,175
[SPEAKER_04]: One moment, I'm gonna, sorry.

420
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's, okay.

421
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm like doing a, I'm doing a, okay.

422
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, for the amendment, just.

423
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:29,639
[SPEAKER_02]: For the amendment, can we send it to the mayor first?

424
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:33,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, give the mayor a heads up before we send it to the department.

425
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

426
00:42:34,563 --> 00:42:36,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

427
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:40,054
[SPEAKER_02]: My assumption was that it was going to go to the mayor first.

428
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I jump in?

429
00:42:43,232 --> 00:43:02,000
[SPEAKER_00]: The protocols would be either for me or for the committee chair to send it to the chief of staff with a request, which means it would go to the mayor if we said, or we can copy the mayor on that, and the further request would be that it would go to department heads, and they might direct it back to us saying, you can send it to department heads.

430
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

431
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:11,383
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the general protocol, is that either I or the committee chair would send it out to the chief of staff

432
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:20,869
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so in other words, the mayor would get it as part of the process, either through the chief of staff or directly on the email.

433
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:22,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

434
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:22,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

435
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to amend it?

436
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:25,951
Okay.

437
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:36,516
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Tseng, I believe I actually heard Councilor Lazzaro second that one.

438
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I seconded it from over here.

439
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:46,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, Councilor, I think, I feel like people who attend on Zoom often miss the valuable seconds.

440
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:51,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna say that it was Councilor Lazzaro who seconded it this time.

441
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,059
[SPEAKER_04]: With apologies to all.

442
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:54,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

443
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you.

444
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,180
[SPEAKER_01]: No more Zoom erasure.

445
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

446
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:02,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan?

447
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:02,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

448
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro?

449
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:05,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

450
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Councilor Tseng?

451
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:09,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

452
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:09,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair Leming?

453
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:10,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

454
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:17,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Four in favor, one absent, motion passes, meeting is adjourned.
