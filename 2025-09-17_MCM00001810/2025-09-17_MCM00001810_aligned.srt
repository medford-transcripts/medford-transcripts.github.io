1
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,900
I'm going to hit record.

2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,101
Recording in progress.

3
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:54,562
All right.

4
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:55,963
Hey, everybody.

5
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,545
Yep.

6
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:04,709
All right, so we got to the agenda today is to discuss 44 Bradley Road.

7
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:15,996
We want to continue forward with accepting that as a potential single property historic district.

8
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,018
Review the drafted legislative letter

9
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,318
in opposition of, yeah, you have the copy on the back side there.

10
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:35,760
And then discuss the logistics of the meeting in the South Street District to talk about the signage, which would be on the 16th, which is coming up.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,662
And then to get the meeting minutes adopted or voted on.

12
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:42,702
Accepted.

13
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,462
Accepted.

14
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:44,002
Yeah.

15
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:45,482
All right.

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,863
So we'll zoom back up here.

17
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,883
For the folks on Zoom, you'll have to forgive me.

18
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:56,264
It's like using a giant 56-inch second monitor.

19
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,845
So sometimes it gets a little clunky.

20
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,745
So I appreciate your patience here.

21
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,325
So now we can see everybody.

22
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:06,587
So do we have a representative from the 44 Bradley Road property with us?

23
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,828
Yes, we are joined by the property owner, Kit Nichols.

24
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,608
Kit, why don't you introduce yourselves?

25
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,601
Hi, everyone.

26
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:26,227
My name is Kit Nichols, and my husband Duncan and I live at 37 Governors Avenue, and we also own 44 Bradley Road, which is diagonally in back of our home.

27
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:30,409
And first of all, thank you so much for

28
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:40,179
considering our application to make 44 Bradley a single family historic district.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,001
It's a pretty special house and I can get pretty passionate about the history of it.

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:52,103
So if I go too far, if it's too much information, somebody should sort of cut me off.

31
00:02:53,859 --> 00:03:01,762
It is 44 Bradley Road, is the Henry, Bradley, and Hefsa Hall House.

32
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:10,885
And let's see, that is how it looked in 1948, but it was built between 1845 and 1850.

33
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:29,223
Hefsa Hall was one of the three children of Dudley Hall, and 44 Bradley is one of the three Hall homes that were built by the three children.

34
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:37,289
So there's only one other that still exists, and that's the sort of gingerbread house that's on Governor's Avenue.

35
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,590
That was one of the other brothers.

36
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,192
The house was lived in by the

37
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:51,216
Hall-Bradley family until the early 1900s when it was sold to Charles Buss, who was the treasurer of the Medford Savings Bank.

38
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:58,002
His brother, whose first name I can't remember, was an alderman in Medford.

39
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:15,392
And he, the Buss family lived in the house until 1943, including their daughter Kate Buss, who was a author and a journalist, who was also a close friend of Gertrude Stein's.

40
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:23,318
and was involved in getting Gertrude Stein's first publication actually published.

41
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:38,421
And there are letters from Kate Buss to Gertrude Stein at the Beinecke Library at Yale, and Kate Buss's letters are actually, all of her correspondence actually is at Temple University Library.

42
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,662
So it, and

43
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,702
she lived in the house I guess after her parents died until the early 1940s when she died.

44
00:04:49,722 --> 00:05:06,271
The house was then empty for several years and then it was bought by Alberto Simonetti who was an immigrant from Italy and who was and it was unfortunately during the seminary reign of this house that the aluminum siding went on but we'll get to that.

45
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,314
Alberto Simonetti was a food importer.

46
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:24,337
He had a salt cod business and he moved here, actually moved to Medford and lived in a variety of places before they bought the Bradley Road house.

47
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:45,955
Before the war, I mean, he actually brought his two war-aged or draft-aged sons from Italy to the United States because he felt that if his sons were going to have to fight in a war, he wanted them to fight on the side of the Americans, and both of them did.

48
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:55,638
Both of them came home, and the house was lived in by the Simonettis, including Adriana Simonetti, who was the littlest sister.

49
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,619
She was quite a bit younger than her older brothers.

50
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:13,276
And Adriana lived in the house from the time they moved in in 1948 until she went into assisted living in 2021 and Adriana was a dear friend as well as our neighbor and she

51
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,014
loved this house.

52
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,135
The house was incredibly important to her.

53
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:18,595
She understood the history of it.

54
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:25,179
And she did everything that she could to preserve it the best way she could.

55
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,080
So very little actually has been changed on the inside.

56
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,901
It's spectacular on the inside.

57
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:34,263
And I'm happy to take anybody who wants to take a tour through.

58
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:36,024
Be careful.

59
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,125
Someone's going to take you up on that.

60
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,746
I would be happy to.

61
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,107
It's quite an extraordinary place.

62
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:57,245
So when Adriana told us that she was going into assisted living and she and I had had multiple conversations about what was gonna happen to the house because she was really afraid of what development in Medford could do to it.

63
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:05,512
And when she said she was going into assisted living, I looked at my husband and I said, we're gonna have to watch whatever happens there.

64
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,375
And it's also, it happens to be on almost a 14,000 square foot lot.

65
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:13,313
So.

66
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:22,819
And so actually, can you advance, Teresa, to the next slide?

67
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,139
I would love to.

68
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,041
Thank you.

69
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,422
So this is how it looked when we bought it.

70
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:36,847
And sometime probably in the 50s or 60s, one of Adriana's older brothers

71
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:46,192
decided that aluminum siding was probably cheaper to heat, so they clad the whole thing in aluminum siding.

72
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:58,063
And it didn't look so great from the outside, which is why I didn't want to lead with these photographs, because I thought you all would be like, why in God's name would we want to preserve it?

73
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:07,351
But so we bought it and the first thing that we did was we decided that we wanted to restore the outside.

74
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,877
So this is what it looks like now.

75
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,764
We had 3,000 pounds of aluminum siding stripped off.

76
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:24,213
And we had all of the architectural details that had been removed, put back.

77
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:29,557
So I can tell you that there are 163 corbels on this house.

78
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:40,084
And they were all, it's actually kind of neat because now there's a sort of another part of local history, which is all of the millwork was milled in Somerville.

79
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,445
Yeah, by John Moriarty.

80
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,801
is an incredible millworks there.

81
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,483
And we also had both of the porches replaced.

82
00:08:53,683 --> 00:09:05,287
So the porches, the front porch originally wrapped around on the side, this porch originally wrapped around on the side, and we didn't do that.

83
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:12,350
We didn't replace it, restore it to exactly the way it had looked because the neighbor's fence is so close and the driveway goes there.

84
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,212
And one of the things that we're hoping that we can also do is replace

85
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:21,753
There was a carriage house in the back that also came down after the Simonettis bought the house.

86
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:30,535
And what we're hoping to do is replace the carriage house as best we can in the back.

87
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,316
And there just wasn't quite room enough.

88
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:37,297
So the porch isn't an exact restoration, although we tried really hard.

89
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:43,420
And we are using as many of the original windows as we can.

90
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,802
Unfortunately, a number of them have been replaced.

91
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:53,105
But what we're planning on doing is putting all of the whatever originals we can at the front of the house.

92
00:09:53,465 --> 00:10:01,530
So when you actually look at the house, it will look as much as we can make it look as it did when, well,

93
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:07,388
It was actually renovated in 1875 so it's probably it will probably be closer to an 1875 restoration.

94
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:25,299
And our thought was if people could see what an incredibly beautiful house it was underneath all of that aluminum siding and the way it was supposed to look, then they would want to come in and see how spectacular it was inside.

95
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,761
So our plan, it's a 5,800 square foot house.

96
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:35,482
We have never thought we would live there.

97
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,844
So here is the renderings of

98
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:47,553
that actually Ryan Hayward did of how it will look when it's totally, the exterior will look when it's totally finished.

99
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,014
So that's the front.

100
00:10:54,096 --> 00:11:01,499
That's actually the side looking up Bradley Road.

101
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,440
And yes.

102
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:15,381
Yeah, so the porch that you see there on the left was not original.

103
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:21,144
So we decided in the end, we were gonna stick with what was as original as possible.

104
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:25,806
So the porch on the right, we've replaced the porch on the left.

105
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:32,450
Well, if I'd won the lottery last week, it would have been different, but that one at the moment, it's not going back on.

106
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,032
Or actually it was never there to start with.

107
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,353
And then if you keep going,

108
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:43,468
Yeah, that's the side.

109
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:44,849
Sorry, one of the others was the back.

110
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,995
And the next one should probably be... I'm missing one.

111
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:54,757
I've got right, left, front, and back.

112
00:11:55,257 --> 00:12:00,821
Yeah, and you should also have one that is the rendering of the carriage house.

113
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:04,678
Okay.

114
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:05,239
Okay.

115
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,799
Well, it's it.

116
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,581
I'll double check and make sure I sent that to Teresa, maybe.

117
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:11,102
Yeah.

118
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:15,104
And if you keep talking, I could probably pull it up on another screen.

119
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:19,606
So let me, let me set that up over here.

120
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,888
And then is there a better

121
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:28,376
landing page to have as a talking point here that you'd prefer while I'm doing that?

122
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:29,616
No, I don't think so.

123
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:35,098
I mean, is there any members of the committee who'd like to have a closer look at any of these images?

124
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:36,778
Some questions?

125
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,559
Well, to look at the architectural drawings?

126
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
No, I can see them fine.

127
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:45,962
or anything.

128
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:51,943
I mean, there, there, Teresa has them also in a folder.

129
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,864
So you can look at them at your leisure.

130
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:59,705
Yes, really, that's, that's really the end of what we were end of the images.

131
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:05,526
I mean, I think we could probably just so we're so it's under construction now.

132
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:13,967
So where I didn't, I actually put it in my GPS to drive by, but it kept sending me to Arlington.

133
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,243
And I was running late anyways.

134
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:29,459
So where are you at with the construction as it relates to the outside front facade, the outside facades that are visible from the street?

135
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,601
Where are you at with that?

136
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,644
So it's scheduled to be probably finished next spring.

137
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:44,110
The builder really didn't want to do the windows until we had a good sense of what was going to happen to the interior.

138
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:51,695
And our thought with the interior was, you know, again, if I won the lottery, we would restore it to a single family.

139
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:59,245
But the fact of the matter is, there are very few families these days who need 5,800 square foot homes.

140
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,786
And so- I don't know anyone that needs that square foot.

141
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:05,187
It is enormous, I have to say.

142
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:19,171
And so our thought was to do a sensitive project in which there would be two condos

143
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:25,692
in the house and then a separate unit in the ADU.

144
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:30,997
Yeah are you now seeing the carriage house restoration or is it still?

145
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,439
No so oh there it is.

146
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,841
So unfortunately actually the

147
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:46,660
Alberto Simonetti had wanted to move into it himself, but the city of Medford wouldn't let him.

148
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:53,047
So this was way back in probably the early 50s.

149
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:57,871
And so eventually it just fell into disrepair and had to be taken down.

150
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:14,746
So that building is not in existence, but we have a good enough sense from photographs of what actually was there that I think what Ryan has put together is a pretty good approximation of the carriage house that was originally there.

151
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:39,003
So this is a very long-winded answer to your question, but essentially, the exterior, the builder wanted to wait on finishing off the exterior renovation because until he had a sense of window placement, I don't actually think that, well, the windows in the front wouldn't change at all.

152
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,824
I mean, the front will be exactly as you see it.

153
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,805
It may be that some of the windows in the back

154
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,358
get moved around a little bit.

155
00:15:49,379 --> 00:16:00,006
But frankly, you know, we're financing it ourselves.

156
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,928
It is a labor of love.

157
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:15,778
And I think, you know, what we would love to do is find somebody who would actually finish off the project in a sensitive way.

158
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:23,200
But if not, then it might take us a year or two, but we would go ahead with the two units in the house.

159
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,524
Unfortunately, right now it's a zoned single-family residential, although you could put most of Medford on that lot.

160
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:34,487
Yeah, so that's a very big lot, so that means like

161
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,696
That means like a double lot.

162
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:47,043
That should, you know, not, you know, just saying I would definitely go for that because it has the criteria where I would be very surprised if they didn't allow you to do it.

163
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:50,225
Is the front of the house that was stripped?

164
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:53,987
So all those sidings is removed from the front of the house right now.

165
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:54,527
Is that true?

166
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,148
Yeah.

167
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:16,177
So really, I mean, what will happen to the front of the house is we'll move the, what original windows we can, we'll replace the vinyl ones that we can't, you know, that are not original with either wood windows or, you know, as close approximation as we can get.

168
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:24,260
And then we'll finish off all of the architectural details in the front and then it will be painted.

169
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:34,846
And we will do a, probably the yellow that you see is actually the original color that was under there.

170
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,687
The color's not a problem.

171
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,530
We don't have jurisdiction over the pink color.

172
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,711
So do you have a permit for the carriage house as well?

173
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:41,992
Not yet.

174
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:42,752
No, not yet, okay.

175
00:17:55,052 --> 00:18:10,424
The permit that was granted from the city for this work through the other board, does that stipulate which windows are going to go where?

176
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,625
Is it as strict as what we do?

177
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,267
This was strictly an exterior renovation.

178
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:27,511
Okay, so yeah, they were there has been no, you know, really no stipulations about what what we do with it.

179
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:37,200
So the historical commission since you're not really changing the roof line or anything, the historical commission didn't weigh in on on that.

180
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay.

181
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,639
We bought it so somebody wouldn't tear it down.

182
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,442
This is great.

183
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,683
I'm very interested in this.

184
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:49,628
I'm just trying to look at the logistics of it.

185
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,495
I want to hear everyone else's and the board's opinion, but I think the front

186
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:13,807
the front facades that are visible from the street would have to be complete before we would move forward with it as a historic because otherwise, if we were to accept it now, we would have to then meet and tell you and tell you how to

187
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:28,391
do what your renovation, which I'm fine with that too and I'm very interested in helping you give them whatever it is, I'm just looking at the logistics for you and the project and all that and how you like to go about it as well and like the carriage house.

188
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,012
So when this just just you know it's like when this.

189
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:45,363
If everyone in the board decides to proceed further with this and all that, putting the carriage house in and everything that would be done with that would then come through this board to then determine what's going to happen with that.

190
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:49,526
For anything that's viewed from the street.

191
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:56,858
So that being said, I think it's great.

192
00:19:56,898 --> 00:20:06,026
I think all the ideas and everything that you're saying are great, but I think we'd have to discuss the timing on this and when to do it, because I'd like to see all that stuff in place.

193
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:35,109
you know if we get started with it like and i know that you have good intentions but it might be you know you could very well vinyl side it we could be very we could be far i know you're not going to i'm just looking at it like objectively yeah objectively like i think that we we want to be part of this but we need to have the front we need to have the parts that are that we would be in charge of done or

194
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:41,003
we would need to then stop the project at this point and then start being part of deciding it.

195
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,504
So whichever way we would want to proceed from there.

196
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:47,565
I mean, and that was actually going to be one of my questions.

197
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:56,807
I mean, we've known right from the beginning that we wanted it to be, because frankly, it's the only way I can think of to protect it.

198
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:58,688
Oh, I think it's great.

199
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:05,855
I mean, we haven't discussed as a group, but I'm definitely excited about it and want to protect it with you.

200
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,496
I'm just thinking of at what point we jump in and do that.

201
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:10,196
Sure, absolutely.

202
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:21,380
And I mean, and we, and you know, our thought all along has been, you know, we want it to be, we want it to be a single family or a single building historic district.

203
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,281
And we just weren't sure, like, at what point

204
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:42,172
you know, and is it, frankly, as the project has sort of dragged on with this, the whole, it's been zoning, it's, it's just, it's, as all projects, construction projects do, it's taken a lot longer than we thought.

205
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,719
But it never happens.

206
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,440
I know, it never happens.

207
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:49,903
And so, you know, we've sort of been like, okay, well, what comes first, the chicken or the egg?

208
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:56,147
And I thought, well, you know, the first thing is I'll have a conversation with the Historic District Commission and find out if it is of interest.

209
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,630
And, and, you know, and figure out with you all, like, what makes sense?

210
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:11,017
I mean, assuming it's something that it's a project that you would ultimately want to proceed with, you know, what makes sense, what makes sense to you all, and actually, frankly, get some guidance from you on that.

211
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:23,677
All right, well, maybe we should, let's get everyone's opinion, I would say, on this to see when they would think would be a good point to get started with this.

212
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,179
When they should, on their plans?

213
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:40,907
So when should, so first of all, does this look, I guess, first of all, we have to all talk and decide, are we interested in this house and making this a historic district, a single,

214
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,992
single, is it a single unit?

215
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:47,195
Because it's a single building historic district.

216
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:50,318
So I guess we all have to go around and talk about that first.

217
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:57,064
And then after that, discuss at what point we jump in and do this.

218
00:22:57,765 --> 00:23:01,389
The houses on that street were built around 1920.

219
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:01,849
Am I right?

220
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,633
There's no other way.

221
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:13,675
I mean, originally it was it was it was gifted as a 10 acre lot.

222
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:26,040
And at the end of the 1800s, I think actually after Henry Bradley died, it seems like maybe the family fell on some more difficult times and they started splitting up the land.

223
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,962
And that's actually when they sold the parcel that became the old Medford High School.

224
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,498
Oh, OK.

225
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:35,960
And at that point, it was all subdivided.

226
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:46,288
There's actually a really interesting map on the Form B that shows the three hall houses sort of set with nothing around them.

227
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:47,469
OK.

228
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,673
So yeah, I mean, from a zoning standpoint, I think there was no zoning.

229
00:23:52,693 --> 00:24:01,079
I'm sorry to scroll, but I just wanted to pull that up there, what you were just talking about.

230
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,762
I'm trying to place where that is.

231
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:08,165
It's off of Governor's Ave?

232
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,767
Yeah, it runs parallel.

233
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:15,470
It runs between Forest Street and Governor's Ave.

234
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,252
Forest Street and Governor's Ave.

235
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,234
Okay, well, you know, I'm looking at it.

236
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,076
I think my sister lived in that house when she first got married.

237
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,238
Yeah, I remember the house.

238
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,640
Is there a little apartment upstairs?

239
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,222
No, I believe it was on the first floor.

240
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:38,924
So hopefully folks can see us.

241
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,706
I don't remember exactly, you know.

242
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,668
So here's the Chevalier Theater.

243
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:46,048
Yeah.

244
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:49,790
And Bradley runs behind it.

245
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,871
And then there's the property there.

246
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:55,393
And here's the governor's border.

247
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,576
That's not the house she lived in.

248
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:18,486
Teresa, if you scroll one more page on the Form B, and you can see the, it's actually a drawing.

249
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:20,747
Right there, yep.

250
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,187
That's more visual.

251
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:30,209
Yeah, so the one, obviously the one with the red arrow is the Bradley, our Bradley house.

252
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:34,233
The one in the middle isn't there anymore, as far as I know.

253
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:39,776
And the one sort of up on the right hand side is the one on Governor's Avenue.

254
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:44,658
And I can't remember what number it is, but it is the other hall house.

255
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:52,561
So do you think we should proceed with

256
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,596
Are you open to adopting this as a single property historic district?

257
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:04,538
I don't know.

258
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Explain to me.

259
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:14,886
Does this house... That's a good point.

260
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,889
I don't think there's a criteria that we have to meet.

261
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,030
There's not like a checklist.

262
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:29,606
miss Nichols, you know, she gave the presentation of the historical significance of it to do we do we feel I feel that it warrants.

263
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:36,631
Okay, so that's what they're calling it is deceiving to me, you know, a single historic district is that.

264
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,532
I know it's the wording, there's nothing we can do about that.

265
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:48,875
It's just used, I mean we call them local historic districts, right, so you can technically if we were to go forward with 44.

266
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:52,416
I don't think there's any of the old houses on that street, is there?

267
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,918
The one next to it is no, I mean the one next to it

268
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:04,652
what, number 38 was built around 1890, I think.

269
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:10,578
And that has been, within the last couple of years, it was bought and completely gutted.

270
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:16,282
There's nothing, there's nothing original left in that house.

271
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,866
Just curious, what's the interior of the house like?

272
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,027
What of that house?

273
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:22,608
What is it?

274
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:24,089
Of Bradley?

275
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:24,910
Yeah.

276
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:33,826
It is, the first floor is actually, you know, a beautiful, elegant Italianate.

277
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:38,108
The ceilings are probably 12 feet.

278
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,170
The rooms are enormous.

279
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:51,415
Beautiful marble fireplaces, parquet floor with an arch in the front hall.

280
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,132
and a really amazing stained glass window at the top of the stairs.

281
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:14,937
So it's, you know, the inside and it's, you know, I want to do whatever we can to preserve those rooms and not see them cut up.

282
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:23,720
So, which is another reason we don't want to put six units in this, keep it as intact as we possibly can.

283
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:28,836
And I would also just like to share, because I know we have some newer members.

284
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:35,340
Medford, I believe, has four other local historic districts that are single properties as well.

285
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,744
Like Grandfather's House is a perfect example of it, you know, over the river and through the woods to Grandfather's House we go.

286
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:44,406
That is its own single family district.

287
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,547
And a lot of other towns have

288
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:48,714
have tremendous amounts of them.

289
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,455
Islington is pretty well all.

290
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:55,557
Is South Street a historic district?

291
00:28:56,017 --> 00:29:00,338
It is, but Grandfather's House isn't part of the South Street district.

292
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:04,339
And I think it was put into a district in like the 80s or something like that.

293
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:09,501
So there is precedent for it here in Medford, and there's certainly precedent for it, you know, across the Commonwealth.

294
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:15,983
It's a great way to protect individual properties, especially, you know, we tried and

295
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:22,899
perhaps we should try to pick it back up again, but we tried to establish a district on Forest Street because of all those old, beautiful homes over there.

296
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:27,121
It wasn't well received and it didn't move forward at that time.

297
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,582
But this is like a great example of like- This is a great example.

298
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:40,646
We have a homeowner that's, the homeowner with a, A, with a beautiful house, which is what our job is, and then B, is generous enough to, generous isn't the word, with, yeah, it's generous.

299
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,987
It's generous enough to, you know, protect this

300
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:47,263
the future going forward, which is excellent.

301
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:53,708
Okay, so would you be on board with moving forward?

302
00:29:53,888 --> 00:30:00,032
Does this meet the criteria of becoming one of those homes, one of those?

303
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:00,653
Okay, perfect.

304
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,233
I believe so.

305
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:03,414
All right, Charlotte, what's your opinion?

306
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,899
Oh, you're muted, Charlotte.

307
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:31,373
I'm going to hit the ask to unmute button, and I might pop up a notification on your screen to unmute.

308
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:41,280
Or if you heartily support the idea, we'll take an enthusiastic thumbs up.

309
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:44,563
All right.

310
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:45,804
We'll go with that.

311
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:46,645
We'll go with that.

312
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:47,946
OK.

313
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,527
So that gets us past that part.

314
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,649
And we have enough for our viewers, right?

315
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:52,869
OK.

316
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,710
So do we take a vote now?

317
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,791
How does that?

318
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:10,214
I would say that we should take a motion from a member on accepting this as, let me think of the wordsmithing here, because it's not a formal application here, right?

319
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:14,995
You know, it's just that, hey, is this something the commission would be interested in partnering with the homeowner on?

320
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,436
So maybe a motion to accept this as a potential

321
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,899
historic district and to start the process.

322
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,920
Could you make a motion for that?

323
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:27,661
Yeah.

324
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,522
Okay, so let's take a vote.

325
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,363
And you vote yes, correct?

326
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:33,004
And Charlotte, do you vote yes on that?

327
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,945
Okay, I can lip read.

328
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,067
All right, so we'll go with the yes on that.

329
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,087
I'll vote yes on that.

330
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,548
So that moves forward.

331
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:46,871
So then let's discuss the time period on that.

332
00:31:51,631 --> 00:32:03,504
Do we discuss that at this meeting or do we... So in the paperwork, does it have... A timeline or anything?

333
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:08,410
No, it's... I'm trying to think how this would work.

334
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,630
Yeah.

335
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:24,495
I think in your best interest, because you've already gone through with the other board and everything, and you're in process, that it would be once those facades are finished, then we'd move forward.

336
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,856
I think that that would make the most sense to me.

337
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:28,157
Are you comfortable with that?

338
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,599
Is there a reason why you'd want us to start earlier?

339
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,619
What are your thoughts?

340
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,101
No, I'm perfectly comfortable with that.

341
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:39,729
Well, I guess I have a question.

342
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:46,293
I mean, I know it's the front facade, but if it's anything that you can see from the street, is that the sides as well?

343
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:49,254
Because you can see the sides from the street, depending on where you're standing.

344
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,137
Yes, it's anything that's visible from the public way.

345
00:32:53,157 --> 00:33:00,401
But not including, so the landscaping is encouraged to be

346
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,653
period, but I'm terrible at words.

347
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:06,874
I'm going to apologize.

348
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,435
Period specific.

349
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:12,097
Period specific, but it's just encouraged, but it's not required.

350
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:22,444
So I mean, it would basically just be like, if you get the siding on, the windows in place, the siding windows trim, that type of stuff.

351
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:23,965
It doesn't have to be painted because that

352
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:29,446
You can do whatever you want with that.

353
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:37,989
You know, a chimney, even though the chimney, if it came on the other side of the roof, if it comes up and it's viewable from the street, that's still covered.

354
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:44,231
Yeah, unfortunately, they took the chimneys down to the roof line.

355
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,132
I know, it's sad.

356
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:53,768
We looked into having them replaced and decided we'd send our child to college instead.

357
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,050
Oh, it's exceptionally expensive.

358
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,114
I was going to say this bottom right rendering here, that is essentially from the street.

359
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,875
So this is the, there's a fence line here.

360
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:07,176
That's the driveway.

361
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,957
So that'll be the ADU back there.

362
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,998
So this is the view from the street here.

363
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:18,483
And your intent, your intention with the, with the carriage house ADU just

364
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,770
So I get this straight.

365
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,092
You don't have a permit for it now.

366
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:25,994
You're not intending to do it right this minute?

367
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,155
Or when's your thought on when you want to do that?

368
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:40,181
Well, as a matter of fact, we're having conversations with the lawyer about this, even as we speak, because we were doing sort of a hurry up and wait until Medford figured out zoning.

369
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:45,904
And at this point, you think what we're likely to do is, because it is right now,

370
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:54,591
It, I mean, right now it is a single, so what is it?

371
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,272
SR1, single family residence.

372
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,252
SF1, yeah, single family.

373
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:06,494
And so, I mean, we'd need to go before the Zoning Board of Appeals and get a variance.

374
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,875
Okay.

375
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:14,176
I think, though, that we can, the ADU, we can do by right at this point.

376
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,436
Correct, correct.

377
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:22,628
As long as it has to meet the setback requirements, but if you can make that, I mean, you have a huge lot.

378
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,509
I'm sure you can.

379
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:25,610
The setbacks and stuff.

380
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,330
That's not us.

381
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,913
It's just whatever, whatever, whatever siding and the finish.

382
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:31,594
Yeah.

383
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,014
Right.

384
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:32,594
Yeah.

385
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:33,255
So

386
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:45,289
So when you finish the front facade, if you're not continuing with the carriage house right away with that, then we'll start at that point.

387
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:56,257
But if you're going to continue with the carriage house, I'd also want that to be underway, started, have the facades that would be us, that would be under our jurisdiction, so we can look at it, make sure that it's okay.

388
00:35:56,558 --> 00:36:02,022
I'm sure it's going to be okay, I just... Yeah, no, I mean, you're doing exactly what you should be doing.

389
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,649
just on the siding.

390
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,733
So are you going to be doing wood clad wood siding?

391
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:11,294
It is.

392
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,117
Actually, what's up there is in great shape.

393
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:17,000
Those are the original clad woods?

394
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,480
Uh-huh.

395
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:18,461
No way.

396
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,424
The house was... Oh my gosh.

397
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:22,265
Oh, wait a second.

398
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,187
I thought that was the board sheet.

399
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:24,948
I'm sorry.

400
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:35,284
No, so it had originally the back and one side was clabbered and the other side... I'm going to just walk up close to that, I'm sorry.

401
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:39,188
That looked to me like, it looked like it was all stripped down to the board.

402
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:46,416
So originally when the house was built, it probably was more Georgian than Italianate.

403
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:51,539
And so it was all flatboard.

404
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,701
It wasn't clabboard, except on one side in the back.

405
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:57,922
And that was always clabboarded, one side in the back.

406
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:05,306
But the front and that side that you see that's yellow were always flatboard.

407
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:09,908
And essentially, it was because it looked more like marble.

408
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,189
OK.

409
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:16,847
So this is finished siding material.

410
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,128
You're just going to be painting this at some point.

411
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:19,788
Right.

412
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:28,052
So we'll go all over it and they'll work their magic on it and make sure it's sealed and so forth and so on.

413
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:31,453
But it's actually in really great shape.

414
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:33,314
OK.

415
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:40,677
So your scope of work for the facades that we're looking at then would just be changing some of the window sash

416
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:52,339
And rebuilding the window sashes because when they put on the aluminum siding, they stripped off everything.

417
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,882
I mean, like of all the times you wanted somebody not to be really thorough, but there was nothing left.

418
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:07,767
So the next thing, depending on what the windows are, is to actually finish all the window frames as well on the outside.

419
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,788
The front bay was actually put on in 1875.

420
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:18,777
Okay, so they they and I'm not quite sure.

421
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:28,085
I think they added a back addition to put in a different kitchen stove, which is actually still in there and dated 1875.

422
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,950
And I think probably the first indoor plumbing to that point.

423
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,192
Do you still have the original stove you're saying?

424
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:39,414
Wow, that's beautiful.

425
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,134
That's awesome.

426
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:41,135
I love that.

427
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:47,008
And, you know, Adriana and her family really didn't touch anything.

428
00:38:47,289 --> 00:39:03,799
So even, you know, there's a, they made two little apartments upstairs and there's a fireplace that's been, that's covered up that I know is still in there because Adriana wouldn't have taken anything out.

429
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:11,244
So, you know, it just, it was always owned by people who really cared about the history of it.

430
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:15,186
So inside, it's amazingly intact.

431
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,874
it's all pretty well there.

432
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:28,595
So this isn't, this isn't got, this isn't stripped down.

433
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:32,677
It was just the vinyl, the aluminum siding was stripped off, all the original stuff there.

434
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:35,159
So this is essentially what you plan to look at.

435
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,599
So, okay.

436
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:45,604
So do you- The flat board the way, I mean, the front had clapboards on at one point, but what's there now is the original board that was underneath.

437
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,486
That's original also on that yellow side with the porch.

438
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:54,249
And your intention is to leave that and someone's evaluated that and said that that can stay and that it's,

439
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,109
It's okay.

440
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:55,750
All right.

441
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,631
So this is, this is really actually ready to go then the way it is.

442
00:39:59,072 --> 00:39:59,372
Okay.

443
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:06,036
Do you, would you be looking for us to get started in the process now then?

444
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:09,598
Or do you want to wait to finish or what do you want to, what do you want us to do?

445
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:12,119
Well, how long is the process, I guess?

446
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,081
Yeah, it can probably six months.

447
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:15,622
Yeah.

448
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:17,523
I would say six to six to eight months.

449
00:40:17,823 --> 00:40:18,163
It's good.

450
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:21,265
It should be pretty, it should be pretty smooth because you're,

451
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,683
Are you how many owners are there?

452
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,384
Are you just my my husband and myself?

453
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,185
Is he on board with this?

454
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,526
Yes, he's I mean, I have to ask.

455
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:37,609
Yeah, he actually he's he had to take somebody to talk soccer practice or else he'd be on the he'd be on the call too.

456
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:40,310
Okay, that's no problem.

457
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,830
I just I have to ask something like that.

458
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:46,292
Also, if you were kind of crazy, but yes, he is on board.

459
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,954
Do you do you have a mortgage on the property?

460
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:50,414
You do?

461
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:56,730
have you spoke with your mortgage provider to make sure that they're on board with this as well?

462
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,990
No, that I have not done.

463
00:40:58,231 --> 00:40:58,731
I will do that.

464
00:40:59,131 --> 00:40:59,431
Okay.

465
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,973
So that would be, that would be the only other hurdle I'd see.

466
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:06,635
And then, I mean, it's still probably going to be six months.

467
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:18,941
I mean, just by the way things are, but, um, I mean, the only, I mean, a neighbor, I would be shocked if a neighbor is going to come in and say, no, that would just seem bizarre.

468
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:19,942
But, um,

469
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:31,442
Yes, we could start now, but then, like I said, once it's accepted, then you'd be coming to us with any changes or anything you were going to do.

470
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:35,625
So you may want to wait, or you may want us to start now.

471
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,366
Can I ask a question?

472
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:46,513
I'm sorry if you had questions there, but if we were just a thought exercise, if we were to go through the motions, accept it now, it gets designated in six months, great.

473
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:52,983
And then in six months, maybe that's next spring, Kit, you're at the point where you're looking at an ADU.

474
00:41:53,063 --> 00:42:00,009
All that they would need to do then at that point is come back to the commission, because now they're in a district, and say, hey, I want to make this alteration.

475
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:00,950
We can grant that.

476
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,551
That's correct.

477
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:02,372
Yeah.

478
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:07,356
The only concern that I have is that we would be taking the house as it is.

479
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,382
As you're going through construction, I mean, you know how it is too, like something happens with that window, whatever it is.

480
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:20,504
Now your contractor can't just do whatever they need to do to that window.

481
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:27,047
And it's probably, I mean, it looks like 90% of the house is original in the front there.

482
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:34,371
So no matter what it is, we're probably going to accept it in the end anyways, because the society is still getting a tremendous product here.

483
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,773
It just complicates it, makes it harder for you to do.

484
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,795
That's the only concern I have for you.

485
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:41,923
Yeah.

486
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:53,326
And it's not, we're going to work at an expedient rate, but you have to remember that, like, if you're, if your contract is like, oh, I've got to do whatever, you know, and then you're like, oh, that's the front of the side.

487
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:55,186
We've got to go to the historic district commission.

488
00:42:55,826 --> 00:43:02,687
We would love to just move as fast as we can, but we're still constrained by, we have to send out one of these to everybody.

489
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:06,108
And then some, you know, we have to, so you're, you put you a month and a half out.

490
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:09,889
So just think of that before you proceed for, you know, further.

491
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,580
you know, before you proceed with it.

492
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:12,881
Yeah.

493
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:21,587
And to that end as well, just so that you're aware, um, you know, for that ADU, but again, say we've accepted it, boom, boom, boom.

494
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,268
Now you're, you're ready for the ADU.

495
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,912
It would be another public notice of public hearing where folks can come and speak.

496
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:30,574
So hopefully you've got great neighbors.

497
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,115
I know you yourself are a neighbor.

498
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:36,498
Um, but just having just, I just want to highlight that as like, it's another public

499
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:44,787
notice that's out there to bringing attention to your project, for good or bad.

500
00:43:45,687 --> 00:44:01,250
We haven't had sort of an explicit conversation with the neighbors about turning it into a historic district, but right after we bought it, I walked through with the immediate abutter and explained that we were trying to preserve it and trying to save it.

501
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,353
and that we wanted to do something that the whole neighborhood would be comfortable with.

502
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:18,562
And, you know, he was, I mean, I have to imagine that all of them would much prefer it to be a historic district than, you know, a bunch of townhouses.

503
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:33,823
So the one benefit that you have, and I don't know if you've explored this or whatever, so there's a fund for doing the work to the facades that are impacted by the historic district.

504
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:34,423
Do you plan?

505
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:35,324
I did not know that.

506
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:37,263
Okay.

507
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:40,365
So that, that's like, so that's the other thing.

508
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:43,407
Is there any way we, I'm terrible looking stuff up.

509
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:48,289
Is there any way that we could look up whether that could be like a retroactive thing?

510
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:56,334
So if she, so we make it easy for us so that if, if she comes back to us and says, Hey, let's wait until I get substantially done with this.

511
00:44:56,374 --> 00:45:02,358
And then you guys start the process that she would still have access to those funds, or is it better for her to do it now?

512
00:45:02,418 --> 00:45:06,500
So she has access to those funds and like, and it would go for like both units.

513
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:07,905
It's my understanding.

514
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:10,287
I'm just not sure of what funding program.

515
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:13,028
Um, is it, is it through this?

516
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,769
I'm not aware of one through the city.

517
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:15,709
It's through the state.

518
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,689
Through the state.

519
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:16,950
Okay.

520
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,091
Well, the houses that are in historic district.

521
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:19,231
Yes.

522
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:19,451
Okay.

523
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:19,911
Yeah.

524
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:22,192
And it's, I mean, it's not, it's not much money.

525
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:24,693
They haven't update, they haven't kept up with inflation.

526
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:30,856
I think it's like, I don't want to say the word cause I'm going to be wrong, but it, it, you know, don't.

527
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:32,677
Even if it paid for a window.

528
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:33,297
It's.

529
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:43,162
Yeah, well, with nowadays prices, who knows, you know, so that we can probably get back to you on something like that as well.

530
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:54,650
Because you because so how much money is it was a $5,000 tax credit, historic rehabilitation tax credits up to 20% of the costs of rehabilitation.

531
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:03,416
I thought there was also like, I think preservation mass has like preservation Massachusetts is has like intermittent grants that they offer.

532
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:15,497
Technically, CPA, which is my day job hat, we've been exploring opportunities.

533
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:31,345
It's not something that's clearly eligible for CPA funding, but we're trying to find ways of creating a home rehab program funded by CPA that takes care of, it would probably be for lower moderate income eligible folks.

534
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,981
So yeah, I can share some of that information.

535
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,483
In the tax credit, is that just immediate or would that be retroactive?

536
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:43,505
Like we should be able to get that after the fact, after she did the work?

537
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:46,327
I'm not sure of that one.

538
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:48,568
Because it has to be in a historic district.

539
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:50,589
Correct.

540
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:00,434
It doesn't immediately say that here.

541
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,055
I'll have to really dive into the

542
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,775
The tax credit information.

543
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:10,899
I can I can take this one offline and share the information I can pull up with you.

544
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:18,283
But thank you for mentioning that complete was like I might reach out to Chris because Chris knew of some other thing with that too.

545
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:18,844
There was some

546
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,736
I'll have to get back to you on that.

547
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:22,076
Okay.

548
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:31,361
I will also say as a grant manager, a lot of grant programs are evaporating daily, um, based off of what's going on in the world right now.

549
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:33,041
So it may have existed.

550
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,402
I mean, no longer.

551
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:44,727
So do you want us to, would you like us to, I'm comfortable with starting now because of how, um, intact it was, how intact it is.

552
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:44,787
Um,

553
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:49,027
Do you, you know, do you want to think about it?

554
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,808
Well, let me, how about this?

555
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,611
Let me talk it over with my husband and just make sure he's okay with it.

556
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:56,373
I mean, it has been our intention all along to do this.

557
00:47:57,253 --> 00:48:02,237
So it's just a matter of, of when and, you know, starting the conversation with you all.

558
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:11,585
And, and, and again, like Teresa has my contact information, but if you want to take a walk through, I mean, it's just, it's an amazing place.

559
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:20,557
Yeah, I know, I'm kind of leaning towards a field trip.

560
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:27,465
It's a bit of a mess because we bought it with contents, but that's for those people.

561
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:29,186
He got more excited when he saw it.

562
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:33,809
You have to promise that I can't take anything home.

563
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:37,850
Is it all furniture or no furniture?

564
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:45,393
So we did have an estate sale, but actually the house has always been sold furnished.

565
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:51,570
So the Bradleys sold it to the buses and it was furnished.

566
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:55,114
And when the Simonettis bought it, it was furnished.

567
00:48:55,674 --> 00:49:04,102
And so in the 90s, Adriana had, she had an estate sale that pretty much funded her retirement.

568
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:08,527
So most of the really fine antiques went then.

569
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:17,021
But some of the things that were left that, well, all of Adriana's family papers.

570
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:28,697
So all of our dads, everything about his import export business and about the family moving from Italy to the United States, all of that was there.

571
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:31,478
So we gave that to the Massachusetts Historical Society.

572
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:39,360
We've given as much as we can, as much as the Medford Historical Society would take to the Medford Historical Society.

573
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,701
So they've been through it and taken, you know, anything local that we've just tried to keep here.

574
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:47,742
And Kate Buss actually left

575
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:55,887
some of her paintings and some of her books that I think that eventually will go to the Historical Society too.

576
00:49:56,908 --> 00:50:04,314
So it's, you know, it's a, it was kind of a time capsule of Medford history.

577
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:08,757
I mean, if it's, you know, on to, you know, immigrant history.

578
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:09,277
So it's,

579
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:11,882
Very cool.

580
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:17,565
We just want to make Adriana proud because she would come back and haunt me in a heartbeat if we don't do this right.

581
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:20,847
Well, that's great.

582
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:21,527
All right.

583
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:22,668
So I don't think so.

584
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:25,829
You're going to come back to us to see at what point you want to get started.

585
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:29,371
We're sounds like we're game, but we are game going on it.

586
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,021
That's great.

587
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:31,621
Well, thank you.

588
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:32,702
And thank you very much.

589
00:50:32,742 --> 00:50:33,702
This is excellent.

590
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:34,583
Beautiful place.

591
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,624
Well, thank you very much.

592
00:50:35,704 --> 00:50:45,270
I appreciate the work that you all do because, I mean, I sit on the Medford Historic Commission and it's hard to see these houses go.

593
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,691
And they are.

594
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,472
So, yeah.

595
00:50:49,272 --> 00:50:49,873
It's important work.

596
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,795
Let's do what we can to protect them.

597
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:53,875
Yes, it is.

598
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:54,936
Thank you.

599
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:56,117
Thanks very much.

600
00:50:56,994 --> 00:51:00,915
Teresa, so if I go back to you, I'll just connect with you.

601
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:02,535
Yes.

602
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:09,737
We'll probably just invite you to our next meeting if that timeline works for you, which is next month.

603
00:51:09,857 --> 00:51:10,817
But yeah, we'll connect.

604
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,037
Talk with your husband and we'll connect.

605
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:13,817
Excellent.

606
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:14,758
Thank you all.

607
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:16,318
Thank you.

608
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,778
Thank you.

609
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:19,019
Awesome.

610
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:21,819
That would be exciting stuff.

611
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:22,479
Yeah.

612
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
That would go pretty slow.

613
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,760
I'd be more on my bed.

614
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,200
Yeah.

615
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:35,918
The only thing, like, I did want to just flag that, you know, the ADU, the notice that would come from us about an ADU might just prompt some interest from the neighbors.

616
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:40,079
So that was my subtle way of saying, go talk with your neighbors.

617
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,320
Perfect.

618
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,620
Okay.

619
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,480
So we handled that.

620
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,162
So now we got to let's bang through the letter here.

621
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:45,542
Yes.

622
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,343
Okay.

623
00:51:49,683 --> 00:51:51,184
And I'm going to screen share that.

624
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:55,766
So just as a reminder, at our last meeting, we were discussing

625
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:23,797
um, Discussing bill S 9 9 3, which while well intention has some, some language in, in there that would, uh, kind of deplete our authority for being able to kind of, um, curtail some development projects that would, you know, eliminate some historic buildings here.

626
00:52:25,595 --> 00:52:37,301
Again, just as a reminder, the bill language said that local historic districts would not have the authority to weigh in on any project where it creates at least one new unit of housing.

627
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,463
So that means somebody can take down a house and put up two new units there.

628
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:49,667
So if it's a single family that's historic, they can take it down, put up two brand new townhouses, and we've lost part of our inventory here.

629
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:53,949
Um, the draft letter here, I can read it aloud.

630
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:55,569
Yeah, I can totally do that.

631
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,230
Try to keep it short.

632
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,990
So here we go.

633
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:08,173
Dear representative, I'm writing on behalf of the Medford historic district commission to express opposition of S 9 9 3, which is called an act accelerating housing production.

634
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:16,876
This bill as written would make our unique historic culture that makes up the fabric of all neighborhoods across the Commonwealth, all that much more vulnerable to demolition.

635
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:19,037
The intention of the bill.

636
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:23,520
to promote and accelerate the development of housing is valiant and well supported by this commission.

637
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:30,948
I'm going to pause here just because that's a little bit like, um, you know, I don't want to speak on behalf of everybody here.

638
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,632
I feel like we're all, we all believe in housing.

639
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,717
Everybody should have a house and kind of recognize that we need more housing.

640
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,580
So we can come back to that if folks feel like that's a little strong.

641
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:52,412
Um, so on behalf of the board of rural support, we recognize the need to create more thoughtful development that meets today's growing housing demands and fully supports efforts to find creative solutions.

642
00:53:53,253 --> 00:54:08,146
However, the bills language pertaining to the reduction in authority of historic district commissions would make it virtually impossible for these statutory boards to continue to protect communities, historic fabric to their intended expense.

643
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:11,117
By the way, I do not speak like this conversationally.

644
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:12,458
This is a very formal letter.

645
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:14,019
Back to it.

646
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,303
S-993 would see Historic District Commission strip of their authority.

647
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:23,127
Oh, I need to make a... That's a typo there.

648
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:32,095
Strip of their authority pertaining to construction projects that would create one or more new housing units, up to and including full demolition of the historic property.

649
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:37,446
This would cripple a regulatory process that has been successfully implemented for decades.

650
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:42,008
You know, just in general, historic district commissions have been put there for a reason in Massachusetts.

651
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:48,491
We would further like to bring to your attention the 20 plus alternative housing production bills that were presented.

652
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:59,216
There was a hearing on June 25th hearing of the joint committee on housing that identifies sustainable and alternative solutions to increasing housing production across the Commonwealth.

653
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,501
without resorting to depleting local protections.

654
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:11,830
We urge you as representative to recognize the cultural importance of historic buildings to Massachusetts and New England, and to oppose SB 993.

655
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:13,631
Sincerely, Judd.

656
00:55:15,373 --> 00:55:15,733
Sure.

657
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,235
Is that a little heavy handed?

658
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:22,840
I mean, again, the intention here was, I think we all believe that new housing is a good thing.

659
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:27,431
Whether or not it's at a volume, whatever, but new housing is important.

660
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:35,215
However, this bill, if it were to pass, we would have no authority to be able to stop these type of protests.

661
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:46,701
Even more beyond that, the people that we represent, so the people who own these old homes, the woman who just presented that, all of that's all gone.

662
00:55:52,192 --> 00:56:00,675
Everyone's worked and spent money and resources and effort to preserve this, and then all of a sudden it's just, no, we need another apartment.

663
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:04,117
This doesn't make sense to do it this way.

664
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:09,419
And there were, again, I watched the entire hearing that day.

665
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:19,604
There was 24 additional other bills that talked about how to increase housing production without it on the backs of historic properties here in this country.

666
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:20,869
in the state.

667
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,732
So my personal opinion, it's very well written.

668
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:25,212
It's great.

669
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:29,055
I don't know how to add anything else.

670
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,917
Is there anything there problematic?

671
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,038
Nothing's problematic.

672
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:33,599
I don't know how to.

673
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:37,181
I'm not good at persuading people, so nothing's problematic.

674
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:39,003
I would be perfectly happy to send that.

675
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:40,244
I don't know what I would add.

676
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,406
I don't know how to convince people of anything.

677
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:46,108
So yeah, I think it's to the point.

678
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:47,109
Yeah, thank you.

679
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:48,150
I appreciate that.

680
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:52,290
And it looks like I just need to add one letter in here too.

681
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:57,715
But Charlotte, do you have any strong opinions on this?

682
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:02,980
Or how do you feel about the letter, Charlotte?

683
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,309
Charlotte, are you OK with us sending this letter?

684
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,751
Say that again?

685
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:27,181
So this letter, are you okay with us sending this letter to the representatives that would be like- Absolutely.

686
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:28,542
Okay, great.

687
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,243
Excellent.

688
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:33,706
So should I just sign it or do you think we should all sign it?

689
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:37,610
I think we can sign it on our behalf.

690
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,611
Okay, perfect.

691
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:40,372
Let's do it.

692
00:57:40,392 --> 00:57:41,353
So let's make a motion.

693
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:43,234
Do we make a motion to accept it?

694
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:43,534
Yes.

695
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,056
All right.

696
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:46,597
Does anyone want to start that motion?

697
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,109
All right, perfect.

698
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:51,530
Does anyone want to second that?

699
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,630
Charlotte, can you second that?

700
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,430
I'll second it.

701
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,492
All right, let's take a vote.

702
00:57:56,892 --> 00:57:57,332
Charlotte?

703
00:57:57,952 --> 00:57:58,212
Yes.

704
00:57:59,253 --> 00:57:59,833
Okay.

705
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:01,053
Ann?

706
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:02,374
Marion?

707
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:05,242
Yes.

708
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:06,263
And I say yes.

709
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:07,623
So we're good to go with it.

710
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:08,784
That's ready to roll.

711
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:09,524
Fantastic.

712
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:09,844
Perfect.

713
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:10,585
All right.

714
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:18,309
So then the next thing we're going to do is the logistics discussion of the meeting on Tuesday.

715
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:20,270
So just wanted to confirm.

716
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,470
So we have our meeting.

717
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,531
It's at six o'clock.

718
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:24,132
We're going to walk South Street.

719
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:27,954
I am going to bring I'll bring

720
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:47,041
Probably way too much information just to have it there and people that come up and are interested, but I'll bring like the form bees and all of our South Street district material as well as, you know, a map photos of our other signs that we have, because the intention of this is to find out where to put new signs.

721
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:50,325
Now, I want to ask you said it's a non historic district.

722
00:58:50,345 --> 00:58:50,505
Yeah.

723
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:53,618
South Street is in the historic district.

724
00:58:54,158 --> 00:59:00,601
So what we're talking about now is, so we're going to meet in front of your house for the signage.

725
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:03,403
So everyone's still on board with that?

726
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:06,504
You didn't receive any emails of the contrary?

727
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:06,904
No.

728
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:09,446
Actually, you have a neighbor.

729
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:12,007
He's off of South Street.

730
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:13,547
Is it Toro?

731
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:14,448
I think Toro's.

732
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:16,129
Yeah.

733
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:17,349
He's going to join us too.

734
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:20,891
He actually just, he's about to join the historic commission.

735
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:24,373
So I've got to bring- With the other historic commission?

736
00:59:24,413 --> 00:59:24,613
Yeah.

737
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:24,833
Okay.

738
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,554
So we're going to meet at my house.

739
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:26,974
Yes.

740
00:59:27,014 --> 00:59:29,996
Which remind me one more time, just- 48 South.

741
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:29,996
48.

742
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:35,879
So I'll make sure that the notice says you're going to meet in front of 40.

743
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,420
I won't say it's your personal residence.

744
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,381
I'll just say we're meeting in front of 48 South Street.

745
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:42,182
And we'll go from there.

746
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:49,347
but I'll bring some waters and stuff like that in case anybody, but otherwise hopefully everybody will be able to join us.

747
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:49,787
Great.

748
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:50,387
Okay.

749
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:51,128
All right.

750
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:56,070
So then the final issue we got to do is the meeting minutes from August.

751
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,472
Yes, which I have a copy of them here.

752
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:00,513
They were in the Dropbox too.

753
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:03,554
There you go.

754
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:10,458
Sorry, I only brought one copy, but all you'd be voting on is accepting the minutes, but

755
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:16,864
They are there, and I guess we would welcome a motion to accept them.

756
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:18,965
Do you want me to put them up on the screen or anything?

757
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:23,068
Yeah, go ahead.

758
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:29,432
Share.

759
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:32,494
Just to prove that they do in fact exist.

760
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,795
That's the agenda.

761
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:51,464
It's a little bit of a different format.

762
01:00:51,504 --> 01:01:07,109
I'm using where it's just kind of like a really high level summary up at the top next steps and then breaking it down by We talked about reservation plan.

763
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:08,757
Oh, that's one quick thing.

764
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:15,882
Um, I did reach out to our friends at the historical commission and see if they could join, because that was something that came out of our last meetings.

765
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,584
We invited them to come to this meeting.

766
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:34,577
They just, it wasn't able to, to be together, but I did speak with the chairperson of the historical about the idea of the preservation plan, which was the intention of why we wanted to invite them here to talk about how we can combine our efforts or two boards on preserving that for right.

767
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,236
They're very much on board with that.

768
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:39,538
It's just, we gotta figure out timing.

769
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:43,762
They have like a, they look at it multiple properties a week of the month.

770
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,644
So yeah, it's definitely tough.

771
01:01:45,924 --> 01:01:56,554
I actually supported their Monday historical commission meeting and gosh, I think they looked at like five or six properties there and it's, they're very busy over there.

772
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:57,475
So how can we

773
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,203
combine our efforts to make it less busy over there.

774
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:03,245
As always, your meeting notes look great.

775
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:06,408
Can we get a motion to accept them?

776
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:10,511
Emery?

777
01:02:10,872 --> 01:02:12,313
Yep, Emery just made a motion.

778
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,155
Charlotte, can you second that motion?

779
01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:15,296
I second that motion.

780
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,957
All right, let's take a vote.

781
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:18,399
Charlotte, you vote yes?

782
01:02:18,919 --> 01:02:19,199
Yes.

783
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,422
Okay, Emery, you vote yes?

784
01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:22,002
Yes.

785
01:02:22,162 --> 01:02:22,943
I vote yes, too.

786
01:02:23,003 --> 01:02:23,624
It's accepted.

787
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,221
That's it, so I think that hit every item, I believe.

788
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:27,821
It is.

789
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:29,001
All right, great.

790
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:30,582
We need a motion to adjourn.

791
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:32,763
Can someone make a motion to adjourn?

792
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,923
Anne-Marie made it.

793
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:35,943
Charlotte came second.

794
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:36,984
Charlotte seconded it.

795
01:02:37,164 --> 01:02:37,864
Can we have a vote?

796
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,405
Anne-Marie, do you vote to adjourn?

797
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:39,905
Yep.

798
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:40,385
Yep.

799
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:41,805
Charlotte, do you vote to adjourn?

800
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:42,606
I do.

801
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:42,886
Yes.

802
01:02:43,546 --> 01:02:44,066
Perfect.

803
01:02:44,186 --> 01:02:45,266
I vote yes as well.

804
01:02:45,286 --> 01:02:45,887
Awesome.

805
01:02:46,027 --> 01:02:48,167
All right, we'll see you guys on Tuesday.

806
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:49,308
All right.

807
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:50,008
Have a good one.

808
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:50,388
Take care.
