1
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hit record.

2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Recording in progress.

3
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:54,562
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

4
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:55,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.

5
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

6
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:04,709
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got to the agenda today is to discuss 44 Bradley Road.

7
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:15,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to continue forward with accepting that as a potential single property historic district.

8
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Review the drafted legislative letter

9
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,318
[SPEAKER_00]: in opposition of, yeah, you have the copy on the back side there.

10
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:35,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And then discuss the logistics of the meeting in the South Street District to talk about the signage, which would be on the 16th, which is coming up.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to get the meeting minutes adopted or voted on.

12
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:42,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Accepted.

13
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Accepted.

14
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:44,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

15
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:45,482
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll zoom back up here.

17
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,883
[SPEAKER_05]: For the folks on Zoom, you'll have to forgive me.

18
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:56,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like using a giant 56-inch second monitor.

19
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes it gets a little clunky.

20
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate your patience here.

21
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we can see everybody.

22
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:06,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we have a representative from the 44 Bradley Road property with us?

23
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we are joined by the property owner, Kit Nichols.

24
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Kit, why don't you introduce yourselves?

25
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.

26
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:26,227
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kit Nichols, and my husband Duncan and I live at 37 Governors Avenue, and we also own 44 Bradley Road, which is diagonally in back of our home.

27
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:30,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, thank you so much for

28
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:40,179
[SPEAKER_01]: considering our application to make 44 Bradley a single family historic district.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty special house and I can get pretty passionate about the history of it.

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:52,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go too far, if it's too much information, somebody should sort of cut me off.

31
00:02:53,859 --> 00:03:01,762
[SPEAKER_01]: It is 44 Bradley Road, is the Henry, Bradley, and Hefsa Hall House.

32
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:10,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, that is how it looked in 1948, but it was built between 1845 and 1850.

33
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Hefsa Hall was one of the three children of Dudley Hall, and 44 Bradley is one of the three Hall homes that were built by the three children.

34
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's only one other that still exists, and that's the sort of gingerbread house that's on Governor's Avenue.

35
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,590
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the other brothers.

36
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,192
[SPEAKER_01]: The house was lived in by the

37
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:51,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Hall-Bradley family until the early 1900s when it was sold to Charles Buss, who was the treasurer of the Medford Savings Bank.

38
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:58,002
[SPEAKER_01]: His brother, whose first name I can't remember, was an alderman in Medford.

39
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:15,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, the Buss family lived in the house until 1943, including their daughter Kate Buss, who was a author and a journalist, who was also a close friend of Gertrude Stein's.

40
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:23,318
[SPEAKER_01]: and was involved in getting Gertrude Stein's first publication actually published.

41
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:38,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are letters from Kate Buss to Gertrude Stein at the Beinecke Library at Yale, and Kate Buss's letters are actually, all of her correspondence actually is at Temple University Library.

42
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, and

43
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,702
[SPEAKER_01]: she lived in the house I guess after her parents died until the early 1940s when she died.

44
00:04:49,722 --> 00:05:06,271
[SPEAKER_01]: The house was then empty for several years and then it was bought by Alberto Simonetti who was an immigrant from Italy and who was and it was unfortunately during the seminary reign of this house that the aluminum siding went on but we'll get to that.

45
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Alberto Simonetti was a food importer.

46
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:24,337
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a salt cod business and he moved here, actually moved to Medford and lived in a variety of places before they bought the Bradley Road house.

47
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:45,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the war, I mean, he actually brought his two war-aged or draft-aged sons from Italy to the United States because he felt that if his sons were going to have to fight in a war, he wanted them to fight on the side of the Americans, and both of them did.

48
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:55,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them came home, and the house was lived in by the Simonettis, including Adriana Simonetti, who was the littlest sister.

49
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,619
[SPEAKER_01]: She was quite a bit younger than her older brothers.

50
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:13,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adriana lived in the house from the time they moved in in 1948 until she went into assisted living in 2021 and Adriana was a dear friend as well as our neighbor and she

51
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,014
[SPEAKER_01]: loved this house.

52
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,135
[SPEAKER_01]: The house was incredibly important to her.

53
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:18,595
[SPEAKER_01]: She understood the history of it.

54
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:25,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And she did everything that she could to preserve it the best way she could.

55
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So very little actually has been changed on the inside.

56
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,901
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spectacular on the inside.

57
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:34,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to take anybody who wants to take a tour through.

58
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:36,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.

59
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's going to take you up on that.

60
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be happy to.

61
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,107
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite an extraordinary place.

62
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:57,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Adriana told us that she was going into assisted living and she and I had had multiple conversations about what was gonna happen to the house because she was really afraid of what development in Medford could do to it.

63
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:05,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she said she was going into assisted living, I looked at my husband and I said, we're gonna have to watch whatever happens there.

64
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, it happens to be on almost a 14,000 square foot lot.

65
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:13,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

66
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually, can you advance, Teresa, to the next slide?

67
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to.

68
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

69
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,422
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how it looked when we bought it.

70
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:36,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometime probably in the 50s or 60s, one of Adriana's older brothers

71
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:46,192
[SPEAKER_01]: decided that aluminum siding was probably cheaper to heat, so they clad the whole thing in aluminum siding.

72
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:58,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't look so great from the outside, which is why I didn't want to lead with these photographs, because I thought you all would be like, why in God's name would we want to preserve it?

73
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:07,351
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we bought it and the first thing that we did was we decided that we wanted to restore the outside.

74
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what it looks like now.

75
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,764
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 3,000 pounds of aluminum siding stripped off.

76
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had all of the architectural details that had been removed, put back.

77
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:29,557
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can tell you that there are 163 corbels on this house.

78
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:40,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all, it's actually kind of neat because now there's a sort of another part of local history, which is all of the millwork was milled in Somerville.

79
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, by John Moriarty.

80
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,801
[SPEAKER_01]: is an incredible millworks there.

81
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had both of the porches replaced.

82
00:08:53,683 --> 00:09:05,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So the porches, the front porch originally wrapped around on the side, this porch originally wrapped around on the side, and we didn't do that.

83
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:12,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't replace it, restore it to exactly the way it had looked because the neighbor's fence is so close and the driveway goes there.

84
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we're hoping that we can also do is replace

85
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:21,753
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a carriage house in the back that also came down after the Simonettis bought the house.

86
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:30,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're hoping to do is replace the carriage house as best we can in the back.

87
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And there just wasn't quite room enough.

88
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:37,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So the porch isn't an exact restoration, although we tried really hard.

89
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:43,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are using as many of the original windows as we can.

90
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a number of them have been replaced.

91
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:53,105
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're planning on doing is putting all of the whatever originals we can at the front of the house.

92
00:09:53,465 --> 00:10:01,530
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you actually look at the house, it will look as much as we can make it look as it did when, well,

93
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:07,388
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually renovated in 1875 so it's probably it will probably be closer to an 1875 restoration.

94
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:25,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And our thought was if people could see what an incredibly beautiful house it was underneath all of that aluminum siding and the way it was supposed to look, then they would want to come in and see how spectacular it was inside.

95
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So our plan, it's a 5,800 square foot house.

96
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:35,482
[SPEAKER_01]: We have never thought we would live there.

97
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is the renderings of

98
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:47,553
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually Ryan Hayward did of how it will look when it's totally, the exterior will look when it's totally finished.

99
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the front.

100
00:10:54,096 --> 00:11:01,499
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually the side looking up Bradley Road.

101
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes.

102
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:15,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the porch that you see there on the left was not original.

103
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:21,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided in the end, we were gonna stick with what was as original as possible.

104
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:25,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So the porch on the right, we've replaced the porch on the left.

105
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:32,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I'd won the lottery last week, it would have been different, but that one at the moment, it's not going back on.

106
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually it was never there to start with.

107
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you keep going,

108
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:43,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the side.

109
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:44,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, one of the others was the back.

110
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next one should probably be... I'm missing one.

111
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:54,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got right, left, front, and back.

112
00:11:55,257 --> 00:12:00,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you should also have one that is the rendering of the carriage house.

113
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:04,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

114
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:05,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

115
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's it.

116
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll double check and make sure I sent that to Teresa, maybe.

117
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:11,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

118
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:15,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you keep talking, I could probably pull it up on another screen.

119
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:19,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me, let me set that up over here.

120
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And then is there a better

121
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:28,376
[SPEAKER_05]: landing page to have as a talking point here that you'd prefer while I'm doing that?

122
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:29,616
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

123
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:35,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is there any members of the committee who'd like to have a closer look at any of these images?

124
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:36,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Some questions?

125
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to look at the architectural drawings?

126
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can see them fine.

127
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:45,962
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything.

128
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:51,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there, there, Teresa has them also in a folder.

129
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look at them at your leisure.

130
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:59,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, really, that's, that's really the end of what we were end of the images.

131
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:05,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we could probably just so we're so it's under construction now.

132
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:13,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I didn't, I actually put it in my GPS to drive by, but it kept sending me to Arlington.

133
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was running late anyways.

134
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:29,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are you at with the construction as it relates to the outside front facade, the outside facades that are visible from the street?

135
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you at with that?

136
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,644
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's scheduled to be probably finished next spring.

137
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:44,110
[SPEAKER_01]: The builder really didn't want to do the windows until we had a good sense of what was going to happen to the interior.

138
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:51,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And our thought with the interior was, you know, again, if I won the lottery, we would restore it to a single family.

139
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:59,245
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is, there are very few families these days who need 5,800 square foot homes.

140
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And so- I don't know anyone that needs that square foot.

141
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:05,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It is enormous, I have to say.

142
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:19,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our thought was to do a sensitive project in which there would be two condos

143
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:25,692
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house and then a separate unit in the ADU.

144
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:30,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah are you now seeing the carriage house restoration or is it still?

145
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,439
[SPEAKER_01]: No so oh there it is.

146
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,841
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately actually the

147
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:46,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Alberto Simonetti had wanted to move into it himself, but the city of Medford wouldn't let him.

148
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:53,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was way back in probably the early 50s.

149
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:57,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And so eventually it just fell into disrepair and had to be taken down.

150
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:14,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So that building is not in existence, but we have a good enough sense from photographs of what actually was there that I think what Ryan has put together is a pretty good approximation of the carriage house that was originally there.

151
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:39,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very long-winded answer to your question, but essentially, the exterior, the builder wanted to wait on finishing off the exterior renovation because until he had a sense of window placement, I don't actually think that, well, the windows in the front wouldn't change at all.

152
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the front will be exactly as you see it.

153
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be that some of the windows in the back

154
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,358
[SPEAKER_01]: get moved around a little bit.

155
00:15:49,379 --> 00:16:00,006
[SPEAKER_01]: But frankly, you know, we're financing it ourselves.

156
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a labor of love.

157
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, what we would love to do is find somebody who would actually finish off the project in a sensitive way.

158
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:23,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, then it might take us a year or two, but we would go ahead with the two units in the house.

159
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, right now it's a zoned single-family residential, although you could put most of Medford on that lot.

160
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:34,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a very big lot, so that means like

161
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,696
[SPEAKER_00]: That means like a double lot.

162
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:47,043
[SPEAKER_00]: That should, you know, not, you know, just saying I would definitely go for that because it has the criteria where I would be very surprised if they didn't allow you to do it.

163
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:50,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the front of the house that was stripped?

164
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:53,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those sidings is removed from the front of the house right now.

165
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:54,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?

166
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

167
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:16,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, I mean, what will happen to the front of the house is we'll move the, what original windows we can, we'll replace the vinyl ones that we can't, you know, that are not original with either wood windows or, you know, as close approximation as we can get.

168
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:24,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll finish off all of the architectural details in the front and then it will be painted.

169
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:34,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will do a, probably the yellow that you see is actually the original color that was under there.

170
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,687
[SPEAKER_00]: The color's not a problem.

171
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,530
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have jurisdiction over the pink color.

172
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a permit for the carriage house as well?

173
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:41,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

174
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:42,752
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet, okay.

175
00:17:55,052 --> 00:18:10,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The permit that was granted from the city for this work through the other board, does that stipulate which windows are going to go where?

176
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as strict as what we do?

177
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,267
[SPEAKER_01]: This was strictly an exterior renovation.

178
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:27,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so yeah, they were there has been no, you know, really no stipulations about what what we do with it.

179
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:37,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So the historical commission since you're not really changing the roof line or anything, the historical commission didn't weigh in on on that.

180
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

181
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,639
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought it so somebody wouldn't tear it down.

182
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,442
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.

183
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in this.

184
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:49,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to look at the logistics of it.

185
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear everyone else's and the board's opinion, but I think the front

186
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:13,807
[SPEAKER_00]: the front facades that are visible from the street would have to be complete before we would move forward with it as a historic because otherwise, if we were to accept it now, we would have to then meet and tell you and tell you how to

187
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:28,391
[SPEAKER_00]: do what your renovation, which I'm fine with that too and I'm very interested in helping you give them whatever it is, I'm just looking at the logistics for you and the project and all that and how you like to go about it as well and like the carriage house.

188
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this just just you know it's like when this.

189
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:45,363
[SPEAKER_00]: If everyone in the board decides to proceed further with this and all that, putting the carriage house in and everything that would be done with that would then come through this board to then determine what's going to happen with that.

190
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:49,526
[SPEAKER_00]: For anything that's viewed from the street.

191
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:56,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, I think it's great.

192
00:19:56,898 --> 00:20:06,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all the ideas and everything that you're saying are great, but I think we'd have to discuss the timing on this and when to do it, because I'd like to see all that stuff in place.

193
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:35,109
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if we get started with it like and i know that you have good intentions but it might be you know you could very well vinyl side it we could be very we could be far i know you're not going to i'm just looking at it like objectively yeah objectively like i think that we we want to be part of this but we need to have the front we need to have the parts that are that we would be in charge of done or

194
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:41,003
[SPEAKER_00]: we would need to then stop the project at this point and then start being part of deciding it.

195
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,504
[SPEAKER_00]: So whichever way we would want to proceed from there.

196
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:47,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that was actually going to be one of my questions.

197
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:56,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've known right from the beginning that we wanted it to be, because frankly, it's the only way I can think of to protect it.

198
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:58,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it's great.

199
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:05,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we haven't discussed as a group, but I'm definitely excited about it and want to protect it with you.

200
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking of at what point we jump in and do that.

201
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:10,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.

202
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:21,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, and we, and you know, our thought all along has been, you know, we want it to be, we want it to be a single family or a single building historic district.

203
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just weren't sure, like, at what point

204
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and is it, frankly, as the project has sort of dragged on with this, the whole, it's been zoning, it's, it's just, it's, as all projects, construction projects do, it's taken a lot longer than we thought.

205
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,719
[SPEAKER_01]: But it never happens.

206
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it never happens.

207
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:49,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've sort of been like, okay, well, what comes first, the chicken or the egg?

208
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:56,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, you know, the first thing is I'll have a conversation with the Historic District Commission and find out if it is of interest.

209
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, and figure out with you all, like, what makes sense?

210
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:11,017
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, assuming it's something that it's a project that you would ultimately want to proceed with, you know, what makes sense, what makes sense to you all, and actually, frankly, get some guidance from you on that.

211
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:23,677
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, maybe we should, let's get everyone's opinion, I would say, on this to see when they would think would be a good point to get started with this.

212
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,179
[SPEAKER_06]: When they should, on their plans?

213
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:40,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So when should, so first of all, does this look, I guess, first of all, we have to all talk and decide, are we interested in this house and making this a historic district, a single,

214
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,992
[SPEAKER_00]: single, is it a single unit?

215
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:47,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a single building historic district.

216
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:50,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we all have to go around and talk about that first.

217
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:57,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, discuss at what point we jump in and do this.

218
00:22:57,765 --> 00:23:01,389
[SPEAKER_06]: The houses on that street were built around 1920.

219
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:01,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right?

220
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,633
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no other way.

221
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:13,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, originally it was it was it was gifted as a 10 acre lot.

222
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:26,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the 1800s, I think actually after Henry Bradley died, it seems like maybe the family fell on some more difficult times and they started splitting up the land.

223
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually when they sold the parcel that became the old Medford High School.

224
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

225
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:35,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, it was all subdivided.

226
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:46,288
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a really interesting map on the Form B that shows the three hall houses sort of set with nothing around them.

227
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:47,469
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

228
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, from a zoning standpoint, I think there was no zoning.

229
00:23:52,693 --> 00:24:01,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to scroll, but I just wanted to pull that up there, what you were just talking about.

230
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to place where that is.

231
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:08,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's off of Governor's Ave?

232
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it runs parallel.

233
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:15,470
[SPEAKER_01]: It runs between Forest Street and Governor's Ave.

234
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Forest Street and Governor's Ave.

235
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, you know, I'm looking at it.

236
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my sister lived in that house when she first got married.

237
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember the house.

238
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a little apartment upstairs?

239
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,222
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I believe it was on the first floor.

240
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:38,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully folks can see us.

241
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember exactly, you know.

242
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the Chevalier Theater.

243
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:46,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

244
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:49,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bradley runs behind it.

245
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the property there.

246
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:55,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the governor's border.

247
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the house she lived in.

248
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:18,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Teresa, if you scroll one more page on the Form B, and you can see the, it's actually a drawing.

249
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:20,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there, yep.

250
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more visual.

251
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:30,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the one, obviously the one with the red arrow is the Bradley, our Bradley house.

252
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:34,233
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in the middle isn't there anymore, as far as I know.

253
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:39,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one sort of up on the right hand side is the one on Governor's Avenue.

254
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:44,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember what number it is, but it is the other hall house.

255
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:52,561
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think we should proceed with

256
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you open to adopting this as a single property historic district?

257
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:04,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

258
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Explain to me.

259
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:14,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this house... That's a good point.

260
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's a criteria that we have to meet.

261
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,030
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not like a checklist.

262
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:29,606
[SPEAKER_00]: miss Nichols, you know, she gave the presentation of the historical significance of it to do we do we feel I feel that it warrants.

263
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's what they're calling it is deceiving to me, you know, a single historic district is that.

264
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's the wording, there's nothing we can do about that.

265
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:48,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just used, I mean we call them local historic districts, right, so you can technically if we were to go forward with 44.

266
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's any of the old houses on that street, is there?

267
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,918
[SPEAKER_01]: The one next to it is no, I mean the one next to it

268
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: what, number 38 was built around 1890, I think.

269
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:10,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been, within the last couple of years, it was bought and completely gutted.

270
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:16,282
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, there's nothing original left in that house.

271
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Just curious, what's the interior of the house like?

272
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What of that house?

273
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:22,608
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

274
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:24,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Of Bradley?

275
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:24,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

276
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:33,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, the first floor is actually, you know, a beautiful, elegant Italianate.

277
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:38,108
[SPEAKER_01]: The ceilings are probably 12 feet.

278
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,170
[SPEAKER_01]: The rooms are enormous.

279
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:51,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful marble fireplaces, parquet floor with an arch in the front hall.

280
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,132
[SPEAKER_01]: and a really amazing stained glass window at the top of the stairs.

281
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:14,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, the inside and it's, you know, I want to do whatever we can to preserve those rooms and not see them cut up.

282
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:23,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So, which is another reason we don't want to put six units in this, keep it as intact as we possibly can.

283
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:28,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would also just like to share, because I know we have some newer members.

284
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:35,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford, I believe, has four other local historic districts that are single properties as well.

285
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Grandfather's House is a perfect example of it, you know, over the river and through the woods to Grandfather's House we go.

286
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: That is its own single family district.

287
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of other towns have

288
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:48,714
[SPEAKER_00]: have tremendous amounts of them.

289
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Islington is pretty well all.

290
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:55,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Is South Street a historic district?

291
00:28:56,017 --> 00:29:00,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but Grandfather's House isn't part of the South Street district.

292
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:04,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was put into a district in like the 80s or something like that.

293
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is precedent for it here in Medford, and there's certainly precedent for it, you know, across the Commonwealth.

294
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:15,983
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way to protect individual properties, especially, you know, we tried and

295
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:22,899
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps we should try to pick it back up again, but we tried to establish a district on Forest Street because of all those old, beautiful homes over there.

296
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:27,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't well received and it didn't move forward at that time.

297
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is like a great example of like- This is a great example.

298
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:40,646
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a homeowner that's, the homeowner with a, A, with a beautiful house, which is what our job is, and then B, is generous enough to, generous isn't the word, with, yeah, it's generous.

299
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,987
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generous enough to, you know, protect this

300
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:47,263
[SPEAKER_00]: the future going forward, which is excellent.

301
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:53,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so would you be on board with moving forward?

302
00:29:53,888 --> 00:30:00,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this meet the criteria of becoming one of those homes, one of those?

303
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:00,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

304
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.

305
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:03,414
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Charlotte, what's your opinion?

306
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're muted, Charlotte.

307
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit the ask to unmute button, and I might pop up a notification on your screen to unmute.

308
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:41,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you heartily support the idea, we'll take an enthusiastic thumbs up.

309
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:44,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

310
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:45,804
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go with that.

311
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:46,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go with that.

312
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:47,946
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

313
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,527
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets us past that part.

314
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have enough for our viewers, right?

315
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:52,869
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

316
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,710
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we take a vote now?

317
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,791
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that?

318
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:10,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that we should take a motion from a member on accepting this as, let me think of the wordsmithing here, because it's not a formal application here, right?

319
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:14,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just that, hey, is this something the commission would be interested in partnering with the homeowner on?

320
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe a motion to accept this as a potential

321
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,899
[SPEAKER_05]: historic district and to start the process.

322
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you make a motion for that?

323
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:27,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

324
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's take a vote.

325
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And you vote yes, correct?

326
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:33,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And Charlotte, do you vote yes on that?

327
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can lip read.

328
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,067
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we'll go with the yes on that.

329
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,087
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll vote yes on that.

330
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moves forward.

331
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:46,871
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let's discuss the time period on that.

332
00:31:51,631 --> 00:32:03,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we discuss that at this meeting or do we... So in the paperwork, does it have... A timeline or anything?

333
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:08,410
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's... I'm trying to think how this would work.

334
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

335
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:24,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in your best interest, because you've already gone through with the other board and everything, and you're in process, that it would be once those facades are finished, then we'd move forward.

336
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that would make the most sense to me.

337
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:28,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you comfortable with that?

338
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason why you'd want us to start earlier?

339
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,619
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?

340
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,101
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm perfectly comfortable with that.

341
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:39,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I have a question.

342
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:46,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know it's the front facade, but if it's anything that you can see from the street, is that the sides as well?

343
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:49,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can see the sides from the street, depending on where you're standing.

344
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's anything that's visible from the public way.

345
00:32:53,157 --> 00:33:00,401
[SPEAKER_00]: But not including, so the landscaping is encouraged to be

346
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,653
[SPEAKER_00]: period, but I'm terrible at words.

347
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to apologize.

348
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Period specific.

349
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:12,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Period specific, but it's just encouraged, but it's not required.

350
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:22,444
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it would basically just be like, if you get the siding on, the windows in place, the siding windows trim, that type of stuff.

351
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:23,965
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be painted because that

352
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:29,446
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want with that.

353
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:37,989
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a chimney, even though the chimney, if it came on the other side of the roof, if it comes up and it's viewable from the street, that's still covered.

354
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:44,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately, they took the chimneys down to the roof line.

355
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, it's sad.

356
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:53,768
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked into having them replaced and decided we'd send our child to college instead.

357
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's exceptionally expensive.

358
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say this bottom right rendering here, that is essentially from the street.

359
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the, there's a fence line here.

360
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:07,176
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the driveway.

361
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be the ADU back there.

362
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the view from the street here.

363
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:18,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And your intent, your intention with the, with the carriage house ADU just

364
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get this straight.

365
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,092
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a permit for it now.

366
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:25,994
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not intending to do it right this minute?

367
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when's your thought on when you want to do that?

368
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:40,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as a matter of fact, we're having conversations with the lawyer about this, even as we speak, because we were doing sort of a hurry up and wait until Medford figured out zoning.

369
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:45,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, you think what we're likely to do is, because it is right now,

370
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:54,591
[SPEAKER_01]: It, I mean, right now it is a single, so what is it?

371
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,272
[SPEAKER_01]: SR1, single family residence.

372
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,252
[SPEAKER_01]: SF1, yeah, single family.

373
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:06,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, we'd need to go before the Zoning Board of Appeals and get a variance.

374
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

375
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:14,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, though, that we can, the ADU, we can do by right at this point.

376
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.

377
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:22,628
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it has to meet the setback requirements, but if you can make that, I mean, you have a huge lot.

378
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you can.

379
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:25,610
[SPEAKER_00]: The setbacks and stuff.

380
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,330
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not us.

381
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just whatever, whatever, whatever siding and the finish.

382
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:31,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

383
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

384
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:32,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

385
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:33,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So

386
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:45,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you finish the front facade, if you're not continuing with the carriage house right away with that, then we'll start at that point.

387
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:56,257
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to continue with the carriage house, I'd also want that to be underway, started, have the facades that would be us, that would be under our jurisdiction, so we can look at it, make sure that it's okay.

388
00:35:56,558 --> 00:36:02,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's going to be okay, I just... Yeah, no, I mean, you're doing exactly what you should be doing.

389
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,649
[SPEAKER_00]: just on the siding.

390
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you going to be doing wood clad wood siding?

391
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:11,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

392
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what's up there is in great shape.

393
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:17,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the original clad woods?

394
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

395
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:18,461
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.

396
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The house was... Oh my gosh.

397
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:22,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait a second.

398
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was the board sheet.

399
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:24,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

400
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:35,284
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it had originally the back and one side was clabbered and the other side... I'm going to just walk up close to that, I'm sorry.

401
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:39,188
[SPEAKER_00]: That looked to me like, it looked like it was all stripped down to the board.

402
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:46,416
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally when the house was built, it probably was more Georgian than Italianate.

403
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:51,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was all flatboard.

404
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't clabboard, except on one side in the back.

405
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:57,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was always clabboarded, one side in the back.

406
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:05,306
[SPEAKER_01]: But the front and that side that you see that's yellow were always flatboard.

407
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:09,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, it was because it looked more like marble.

408
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,189
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

409
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:16,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is finished siding material.

410
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,128
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be painting this at some point.

411
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:19,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

412
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:28,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go all over it and they'll work their magic on it and make sure it's sealed and so forth and so on.

413
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:31,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually in really great shape.

414
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:33,314
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

415
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:40,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So your scope of work for the facades that we're looking at then would just be changing some of the window sash

416
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:52,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And rebuilding the window sashes because when they put on the aluminum siding, they stripped off everything.

417
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like of all the times you wanted somebody not to be really thorough, but there was nothing left.

418
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:07,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing, depending on what the windows are, is to actually finish all the window frames as well on the outside.

419
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,788
[SPEAKER_01]: The front bay was actually put on in 1875.

420
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:18,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so they they and I'm not quite sure.

421
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:28,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they added a back addition to put in a different kitchen stove, which is actually still in there and dated 1875.

422
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think probably the first indoor plumbing to that point.

423
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still have the original stove you're saying?

424
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:39,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's beautiful.

425
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,134
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

426
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:41,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

427
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:47,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Adriana and her family really didn't touch anything.

428
00:38:47,289 --> 00:39:03,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So even, you know, there's a, they made two little apartments upstairs and there's a fireplace that's been, that's covered up that I know is still in there because Adriana wouldn't have taken anything out.

429
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:11,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it just, it was always owned by people who really cared about the history of it.

430
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:15,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So inside, it's amazingly intact.

431
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,874
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all pretty well there.

432
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:28,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't, this isn't got, this isn't stripped down.

433
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:32,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the vinyl, the aluminum siding was stripped off, all the original stuff there.

434
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:35,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is essentially what you plan to look at.

435
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.

436
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:45,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you- The flat board the way, I mean, the front had clapboards on at one point, but what's there now is the original board that was underneath.

437
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,486
[SPEAKER_01]: That's original also on that yellow side with the porch.

438
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:54,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And your intention is to leave that and someone's evaluated that and said that that can stay and that it's,

439
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,109
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.

440
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:55,750
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

441
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is really actually ready to go then the way it is.

442
00:39:59,072 --> 00:39:59,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

443
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:06,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, would you be looking for us to get started in the process now then?

444
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:09,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to wait to finish or what do you want to, what do you want us to do?

445
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how long is the process, I guess?

446
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can probably six months.

447
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:15,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

448
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:17,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say six to six to eight months.

449
00:40:17,823 --> 00:40:18,163
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.

450
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:21,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be pretty, it should be pretty smooth because you're,

451
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you how many owners are there?

452
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just my my husband and myself?

453
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he on board with this?

454
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he's I mean, I have to ask.

455
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:37,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he actually he's he had to take somebody to talk soccer practice or else he'd be on the he'd be on the call too.

456
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:40,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's no problem.

457
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I have to ask something like that.

458
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:46,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you were kind of crazy, but yes, he is on board.

459
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you have a mortgage on the property?

460
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:50,414
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?

461
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:56,730
[SPEAKER_00]: have you spoke with your mortgage provider to make sure that they're on board with this as well?

462
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,990
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that I have not done.

463
00:40:58,231 --> 00:40:58,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do that.

464
00:40:59,131 --> 00:40:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

465
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be, that would be the only other hurdle I'd see.

466
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:06,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, it's still probably going to be six months.

467
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:18,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just by the way things are, but, um, I mean, the only, I mean, a neighbor, I would be shocked if a neighbor is going to come in and say, no, that would just seem bizarre.

468
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:19,942
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um,

469
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:31,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we could start now, but then, like I said, once it's accepted, then you'd be coming to us with any changes or anything you were going to do.

470
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:35,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to wait, or you may want us to start now.

471
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a question?

472
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:46,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry if you had questions there, but if we were just a thought exercise, if we were to go through the motions, accept it now, it gets designated in six months, great.

473
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:52,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in six months, maybe that's next spring, Kit, you're at the point where you're looking at an ADU.

474
00:41:53,063 --> 00:42:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All that they would need to do then at that point is come back to the commission, because now they're in a district, and say, hey, I want to make this alteration.

475
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:00,950
[SPEAKER_05]: We can grant that.

476
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,551
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.

477
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:02,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

478
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:07,356
[SPEAKER_00]: The only concern that I have is that we would be taking the house as it is.

479
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,382
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're going through construction, I mean, you know how it is too, like something happens with that window, whatever it is.

480
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:20,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your contractor can't just do whatever they need to do to that window.

481
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:27,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably, I mean, it looks like 90% of the house is original in the front there.

482
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:34,371
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what it is, we're probably going to accept it in the end anyways, because the society is still getting a tremendous product here.

483
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,773
[SPEAKER_00]: It just complicates it, makes it harder for you to do.

484
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,795
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only concern I have for you.

485
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:41,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

486
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:53,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, we're going to work at an expedient rate, but you have to remember that, like, if you're, if your contract is like, oh, I've got to do whatever, you know, and then you're like, oh, that's the front of the side.

487
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:55,186
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to go to the historic district commission.

488
00:42:55,826 --> 00:43:02,687
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to just move as fast as we can, but we're still constrained by, we have to send out one of these to everybody.

489
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:06,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some, you know, we have to, so you're, you put you a month and a half out.

490
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:09,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think of that before you proceed for, you know, further.

491
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,580
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, before you proceed with it.

492
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:12,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

493
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:21,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And to that end as well, just so that you're aware, um, you know, for that ADU, but again, say we've accepted it, boom, boom, boom.

494
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're, you're ready for the ADU.

495
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be another public notice of public hearing where folks can come and speak.

496
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully you've got great neighbors.

497
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you yourself are a neighbor.

498
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but just having just, I just want to highlight that as like, it's another public

499
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:44,787
[SPEAKER_05]: notice that's out there to bringing attention to your project, for good or bad.

500
00:43:45,687 --> 00:44:01,250
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had sort of an explicit conversation with the neighbors about turning it into a historic district, but right after we bought it, I walked through with the immediate abutter and explained that we were trying to preserve it and trying to save it.

501
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,353
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we wanted to do something that the whole neighborhood would be comfortable with.

502
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:18,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was, I mean, I have to imagine that all of them would much prefer it to be a historic district than, you know, a bunch of townhouses.

503
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:33,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one benefit that you have, and I don't know if you've explored this or whatever, so there's a fund for doing the work to the facades that are impacted by the historic district.

504
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:34,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you plan?

505
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:35,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that.

506
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:37,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

507
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:40,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's like, so that's the other thing.

508
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:43,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way we, I'm terrible looking stuff up.

509
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:48,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way that we could look up whether that could be like a retroactive thing?

510
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:56,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So if she, so we make it easy for us so that if, if she comes back to us and says, Hey, let's wait until I get substantially done with this.

511
00:44:56,374 --> 00:45:02,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys start the process that she would still have access to those funds, or is it better for her to do it now?

512
00:45:02,418 --> 00:45:06,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So she has access to those funds and like, and it would go for like both units.

513
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:07,905
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding.

514
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:10,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not sure of what funding program.

515
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:13,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is it, is it through this?

516
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not aware of one through the city.

517
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:15,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through the state.

518
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the state.

519
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:16,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

520
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the houses that are in historic district.

521
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:19,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

522
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:19,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

523
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:19,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

524
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:22,192
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I mean, it's not, it's not much money.

525
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:24,693
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't update, they haven't kept up with inflation.

526
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:30,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like, I don't want to say the word cause I'm going to be wrong, but it, it, you know, don't.

527
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:32,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it paid for a window.

528
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:33,297
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.

529
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:43,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, with nowadays prices, who knows, you know, so that we can probably get back to you on something like that as well.

530
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:54,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you because so how much money is it was a $5,000 tax credit, historic rehabilitation tax credits up to 20% of the costs of rehabilitation.

531
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:03,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was also like, I think preservation mass has like preservation Massachusetts is has like intermittent grants that they offer.

532
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:15,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, CPA, which is my day job hat, we've been exploring opportunities.

533
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that's clearly eligible for CPA funding, but we're trying to find ways of creating a home rehab program funded by CPA that takes care of, it would probably be for lower moderate income eligible folks.

534
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I can share some of that information.

535
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,483
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tax credit, is that just immediate or would that be retroactive?

536
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:43,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we should be able to get that after the fact, after she did the work?

537
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:46,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of that one.

538
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:48,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has to be in a historic district.

539
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:50,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

540
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't immediately say that here.

541
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to really dive into the

542
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,775
[SPEAKER_05]: The tax credit information.

543
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:10,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I can I can take this one offline and share the information I can pull up with you.

544
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:18,283
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for mentioning that complete was like I might reach out to Chris because Chris knew of some other thing with that too.

545
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:18,844
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some

546
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to get back to you on that.

547
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:22,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

548
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:31,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I will also say as a grant manager, a lot of grant programs are evaporating daily, um, based off of what's going on in the world right now.

549
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:33,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may have existed.

550
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no longer.

551
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:44,727
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want us to, would you like us to, I'm comfortable with starting now because of how, um, intact it was, how intact it is.

552
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:44,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

553
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:49,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, you know, do you want to think about it?

554
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me, how about this?

555
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk it over with my husband and just make sure he's okay with it.

556
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:56,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it has been our intention all along to do this.

557
00:47:57,253 --> 00:48:02,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of, of when and, you know, starting the conversation with you all.

558
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:11,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and again, like Teresa has my contact information, but if you want to take a walk through, I mean, it's just, it's an amazing place.

559
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:20,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, I'm kind of leaning towards a field trip.

560
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a mess because we bought it with contents, but that's for those people.

561
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:29,186
[SPEAKER_00]: He got more excited when he saw it.

562
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:33,809
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to promise that I can't take anything home.

563
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:37,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it all furniture or no furniture?

564
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:45,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did have an estate sale, but actually the house has always been sold furnished.

565
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:51,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Bradleys sold it to the buses and it was furnished.

566
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:55,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the Simonettis bought it, it was furnished.

567
00:48:55,674 --> 00:49:04,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the 90s, Adriana had, she had an estate sale that pretty much funded her retirement.

568
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:08,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the really fine antiques went then.

569
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:17,021
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the things that were left that, well, all of Adriana's family papers.

570
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:28,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our dads, everything about his import export business and about the family moving from Italy to the United States, all of that was there.

571
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:31,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So we gave that to the Massachusetts Historical Society.

572
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:39,360
[SPEAKER_01]: We've given as much as we can, as much as the Medford Historical Society would take to the Medford Historical Society.

573
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been through it and taken, you know, anything local that we've just tried to keep here.

574
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:47,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kate Buss actually left

575
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:55,887
[SPEAKER_01]: some of her paintings and some of her books that I think that eventually will go to the Historical Society too.

576
00:49:56,908 --> 00:50:04,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's a, it was kind of a time capsule of Medford history.

577
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:08,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it's, you know, on to, you know, immigrant history.

578
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:09,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's,

579
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:11,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

580
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:17,565
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to make Adriana proud because she would come back and haunt me in a heartbeat if we don't do this right.

581
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:20,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's great.

582
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

583
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:22,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think so.

584
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:25,829
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to come back to us to see at what point you want to get started.

585
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:29,371
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sounds like we're game, but we are game going on it.

586
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,021
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

587
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:31,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.

588
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:32,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much.

589
00:50:32,742 --> 00:50:33,702
[SPEAKER_00]: This is excellent.

590
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:34,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful place.

591
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.

592
00:50:35,704 --> 00:50:45,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the work that you all do because, I mean, I sit on the Medford Historic Commission and it's hard to see these houses go.

593
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are.

594
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,472
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

595
00:50:49,272 --> 00:50:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important work.

596
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do what we can to protect them.

597
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:53,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

598
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:54,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

599
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks very much.

600
00:50:56,994 --> 00:51:00,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Teresa, so if I go back to you, I'll just connect with you.

601
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:02,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

602
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:09,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably just invite you to our next meeting if that timeline works for you, which is next month.

603
00:51:09,857 --> 00:51:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we'll connect.

604
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk with your husband and we'll connect.

605
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

606
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:14,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

607
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:16,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

608
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

609
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:19,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

610
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:21,819
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be exciting stuff.

611
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:22,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

612
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
[SPEAKER_00]: That would go pretty slow.

613
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more on my bed.

614
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

615
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:35,918
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing, like, I did want to just flag that, you know, the ADU, the notice that would come from us about an ADU might just prompt some interest from the neighbors.

616
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:40,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my subtle way of saying, go talk with your neighbors.

617
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.

618
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

619
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So we handled that.

620
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we got to let's bang through the letter here.

621
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:45,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

622
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

623
00:51:49,683 --> 00:51:51,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to screen share that.

624
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:55,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as a reminder, at our last meeting, we were discussing

625
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:23,797
[SPEAKER_05]: um, Discussing bill S 9 9 3, which while well intention has some, some language in, in there that would, uh, kind of deplete our authority for being able to kind of, um, curtail some development projects that would, you know, eliminate some historic buildings here.

626
00:52:25,595 --> 00:52:37,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, just as a reminder, the bill language said that local historic districts would not have the authority to weigh in on any project where it creates at least one new unit of housing.

627
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means somebody can take down a house and put up two new units there.

628
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's a single family that's historic, they can take it down, put up two brand new townhouses, and we've lost part of our inventory here.

629
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:53,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the draft letter here, I can read it aloud.

630
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:55,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can totally do that.

631
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to keep it short.

632
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we go.

633
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:08,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear representative, I'm writing on behalf of the Medford historic district commission to express opposition of S 9 9 3, which is called an act accelerating housing production.

634
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:16,876
[SPEAKER_05]: This bill as written would make our unique historic culture that makes up the fabric of all neighborhoods across the Commonwealth, all that much more vulnerable to demolition.

635
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:19,037
[SPEAKER_05]: The intention of the bill.

636
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: to promote and accelerate the development of housing is valiant and well supported by this commission.

637
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:30,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pause here just because that's a little bit like, um, you know, I don't want to speak on behalf of everybody here.

638
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we're all, we all believe in housing.

639
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should have a house and kind of recognize that we need more housing.

640
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can come back to that if folks feel like that's a little strong.

641
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:52,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so on behalf of the board of rural support, we recognize the need to create more thoughtful development that meets today's growing housing demands and fully supports efforts to find creative solutions.

642
00:53:53,253 --> 00:54:08,146
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the bills language pertaining to the reduction in authority of historic district commissions would make it virtually impossible for these statutory boards to continue to protect communities, historic fabric to their intended expense.

643
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:11,117
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I do not speak like this conversationally.

644
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:12,458
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very formal letter.

645
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:14,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to it.

646
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,303
[SPEAKER_05]: S-993 would see Historic District Commission strip of their authority.

647
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:23,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I need to make a... That's a typo there.

648
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Strip of their authority pertaining to construction projects that would create one or more new housing units, up to and including full demolition of the historic property.

649
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:37,446
[SPEAKER_05]: This would cripple a regulatory process that has been successfully implemented for decades.

650
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:42,008
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just in general, historic district commissions have been put there for a reason in Massachusetts.

651
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:48,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We would further like to bring to your attention the 20 plus alternative housing production bills that were presented.

652
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:59,216
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a hearing on June 25th hearing of the joint committee on housing that identifies sustainable and alternative solutions to increasing housing production across the Commonwealth.

653
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,501
[SPEAKER_05]: without resorting to depleting local protections.

654
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:11,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We urge you as representative to recognize the cultural importance of historic buildings to Massachusetts and New England, and to oppose SB 993.

655
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:13,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Judd.

656
00:55:15,373 --> 00:55:15,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

657
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a little heavy handed?

658
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:22,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, again, the intention here was, I think we all believe that new housing is a good thing.

659
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not it's at a volume, whatever, but new housing is important.

660
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this bill, if it were to pass, we would have no authority to be able to stop these type of protests.

661
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:46,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more beyond that, the people that we represent, so the people who own these old homes, the woman who just presented that, all of that's all gone.

662
00:55:52,192 --> 00:56:00,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's worked and spent money and resources and effort to preserve this, and then all of a sudden it's just, no, we need another apartment.

663
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:04,117
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't make sense to do it this way.

664
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:09,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were, again, I watched the entire hearing that day.

665
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:19,604
[SPEAKER_05]: There was 24 additional other bills that talked about how to increase housing production without it on the backs of historic properties here in this country.

666
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: in the state.

667
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So my personal opinion, it's very well written.

668
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:25,212
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

669
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:29,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to add anything else.

670
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything there problematic?

671
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's problematic.

672
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:33,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to.

673
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:37,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at persuading people, so nothing's problematic.

674
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:39,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be perfectly happy to send that.

675
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:40,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I would add.

676
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to convince people of anything.

677
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:46,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think it's to the point.

678
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:47,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

679
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:48,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

680
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:52,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like I just need to add one letter in here too.

681
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:57,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But Charlotte, do you have any strong opinions on this?

682
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:02,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you feel about the letter, Charlotte?

683
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte, are you OK with us sending this letter?

684
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that again?

685
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:27,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So this letter, are you okay with us sending this letter to the representatives that would be like- Absolutely.

686
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:28,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

687
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

688
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:33,706
[SPEAKER_00]: So should I just sign it or do you think we should all sign it?

689
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can sign it on our behalf.

690
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

691
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:40,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.

692
00:57:40,392 --> 00:57:41,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make a motion.

693
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:43,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we make a motion to accept it?

694
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:43,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

695
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,056
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

696
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:46,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone want to start that motion?

697
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,109
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, perfect.

698
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:51,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone want to second that?

699
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte, can you second that?

700
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,430

[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to bring I'll bring

720
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably way too much information just to have it there and people that come up and are interested, but I'll bring like the form bees and all of our South Street district material as well as, you know, a map photos of our other signs that we have, because the intention of this is to find out where to put new signs.

721
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:50,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I want to ask you said it's a non historic district.

[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't receive any emails of the contrary?

727
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:06,904
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to meet at my house.

48.

742
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:35,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll make sure that the notice says you're going to meet in front of 40.

743
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't say it's your personal residence.

744
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just say we're meeting in front of 48 South Street.

745
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:42,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll go from there.

746
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:49,347
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'll bring some waters and stuff like that in case anybody, but otherwise hopefully everybody will be able to join us.

747
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:49,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

748
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:50,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

749
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:51,128
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

750
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:56,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the final issue we got to do is the meeting minutes from August.

751
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, which I have a copy of them here.

752
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:00,513
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in the Dropbox too.

753
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:03,554
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

754
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I only brought one copy, but all you'd be voting on is accepting the minutes, but

755
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:16,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They are there, and I guess we would welcome a motion to accept them.

756
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:18,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to put them up on the screen or anything?

757
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:23,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go ahead.

758
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:29,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Share.

759
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:32,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to prove that they do in fact exist.

760
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the agenda.

761
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:51,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of a different format.

762
01:00:51,504 --> 01:01:07,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using where it's just kind of like a really high level summary up at the top next steps and then breaking it down by We talked about reservation plan.

763
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:08,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's one quick thing.

764
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I did reach out to our friends at the historical commission and see if they could join, because that was something that came out of our last meetings.

765
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We invited them to come to this meeting.

766
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:34,577
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, it wasn't able to, to be together, but I did speak with the chairperson of the historical about the idea of the preservation plan, which was the intention of why we wanted to invite them here to talk about how we can combine our efforts or two boards on preserving that for right.

767
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,236
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very much on board with that.

768
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:39,538
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, we gotta figure out timing.

769
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:43,762
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like a, they look at it multiple properties a week of the month.

770
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's definitely tough.

771
01:01:45,924 --> 01:01:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually supported their Monday historical commission meeting and gosh, I think they looked at like five or six properties there and it's, they're very busy over there.

772
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:57,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So how can we

773
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,203
[SPEAKER_05]: combine our efforts to make it less busy over there.

774
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:03,245
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, your meeting notes look great.

775
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:06,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get a motion to accept them?

01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:15,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that motion.
