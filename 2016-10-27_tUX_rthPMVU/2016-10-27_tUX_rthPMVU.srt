1
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:45,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

2
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:49,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to present this resolution.

3
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proposing that the city change the structure of the sign department.

4
00:00:54,688 --> 00:01:00,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think that the sign department should be a standalone division within the DPW and not a subdivision of the highway department.

5
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:10,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Reason being is it is a public safety department, Mr. President, and they need to ensure that there is proper installation and maintenance of our roadway control signs as well as the striping on our streets.

6
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody's been paying attention to the last five or six meetings of the Medford City Council,

7
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:25,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's safe to say that the topic of our conversation has been signage and has been the striping of our streets and the public safety issues that are surrounding those matters here in our community, Mr. President.

8
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm asking that the administration take a look at this issue and determine whether or not it's feasible to create a standalone sign shop.

9
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:39,178
[SPEAKER_04]: The sign shop is responsible for all of the signage that's put forth by the Traffic Commission, as well as the existing signs that are in place.

10
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,900
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in charge of all the signage at the schools as well, Mr. President.

11
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:56,955
[SPEAKER_04]: a large job, and what's happening is these individuals that are assigned to the sign shop being a subdivision of the highway division are being pulled away to handle other matters that are in the community, and then they're put back into the sign shop, pulled out of the sign shop, put back in the sign shop.

12
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:08,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it would make good sense to have a full-time, stand-alone sign and striping division within the DPW, Mr. President, so that these issues in our community can be addressed promptly and properly.

13
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have had

14
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:18,687
[SPEAKER_04]: a meeting yet when the good weather rolls around and we don't talk about when our sidewalks are going to be, our crosswalks are going to be striped, Mr. President.

15
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:22,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this would be a perfect remedy for that type of issue.

16
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd ask that my council colleagues support the measure.

17
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,411
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, the citizen wishes to speak.

19
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:34,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

20
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

21
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

22
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,032
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Robert Petter, a former member of this council.

23
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:46,468
[SPEAKER_14]: When I was reviewing the offering by Councilor Knight this evening, my question, I think, presents itself in a different direction.

24
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,911
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've spent over $14.5 million for a brand new building.

25
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,773
[SPEAKER_14]: It's obvious that certain departments are understaffed.

26
00:02:53,714 --> 00:03:02,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And this may be a good way to look at actually what is going on in the highway department as it relates to men, the equipment that they have, and everything that's going on.

27
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:08,085
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that if this is going to be, I think, is your intent to create another department?

28
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you said, Councilor Knight?

29
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:10,573
[SPEAKER_14]: stand alone.

30
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's a contractual obligation that has to be negotiated through the union.

31
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:25,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it presents itself with a whole bunch of issues, but the best part of the issue I think is this, that I think the council really needs to take a look and see as to what's going on over there, the highway department or the public works building.

32
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:27,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't really know if you have a director or not.

33
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,579
[SPEAKER_14]: He was on a three months on trial basis.

34
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:30,759
[SPEAKER_14]: It ended in March.

35
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they're still advertising for a new director's position.

36
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,794
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it would be beneficial if he was here tonight to discuss the matter.

37
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:44,039
[SPEAKER_04]: The commissioner has been appointed and is no longer wearing the interim tag, as far as I've been informed.

38
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that public knowledge that he's been?

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, are you councillors aware of the fact that he's been appointed?

40
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:50,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon me?

41
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:55,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is the problem of not getting information out there.

42
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,169
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, some councillors know, some don't.

43
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:58,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I, as a public person, don't know.

44
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,472
[SPEAKER_14]: And I try to stay on top of what's going on here in the city.

45
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: But more importantly, just getting back to this issue in particular, my suggestion would be, and if I was on your side of the rail, I would suggest that if we're going to be looking at this, maybe we should be looking at all the departments.

46
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:19,705
[SPEAKER_14]: And if this, in fact, is a union type of job, and this is contractual, I believe the membership themselves have to vote on this as well.

47
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:27,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So while it sounds good, I just think it needs to be researched, and I think it's the best time to look at the whole offering in the Department of Public Works.

48
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, citizen.

49
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-President Longo-Curran.

51
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Vice-President Longo-Curran.

52
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:50,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Just on that point, if we could just request from the Mayor's Office written notification if the Interim Director has been appointed as the full-time director, because I was unaware, so I know, I believe the Council's word, but if we could just get a report from the Mayor's Office to clarify that.

54
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,293
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of approval as amended by Vice-President Longo-Curran, Chair recognizes Councilor Knightingale.

55
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:13,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. President, this is a resolution that asks that the administration examine the feasibility thereof, so there will certainly be issues that are going to surround this matter in terms of collective bargaining, contract negotiation, and whether or not it even is a feasible move or an option to make, and that's why I'm asking the administration to study it.

56
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that clarification.

57
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes the person at the podium.

58
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, good evening.

59
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

60
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

61
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening.

62
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,072
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, why would they be being pulled away?

63
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a public safety issue.

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:40,713
[SPEAKER_01]: All DPW issues are a public safety issue, whether it's snow removal, whether it's trash removal, whether it's manhole covers, whether it's those rain drain things.

65
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:46,139
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not set right, somebody can get into a car or an accident or something like that.

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DPW is definitely

67
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:51,415
[SPEAKER_01]: interwoven with public safety.

68
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:57,016
[SPEAKER_01]: There is absolutely no question about it, that if you can't drive down the street safely, then it's a public safety issue.

69
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:02,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with that whole overview that I stated and I implore the mayor to look at.

70
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:13,559
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole city needs to be evaluated for traffic flow, sidewalks, bicycles, buses, trucks, the whole nine yards, everything, including striping.

71
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that striping, and I agree with Mr. Knight

72
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:27,203
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's absolutely, it's absolutely a basic function of the city that we have proper striping, proper signs so that everybody knows where they're going.

73
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:35,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wonder, the question that comes to my mind is, why are they being pulled away from the sign department in the first place?

74
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because we are understaffed.

75
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:42,811
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to look at that, but we can't look at staffing until we understand and assess the entire city.

76
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,693
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at it from the entire city's perspective.

77
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:53,674
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't assess the whole city and all of its needs, then you're just playing a little game patch here and patch here.

78
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they being pulled away?

79
00:06:55,495 --> 00:07:01,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be pulled away, and then some other part of DPW is going to go unresolved.

80
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:03,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to look at it.

81
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:12,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great idea, and I absolutely urge the city to hire more workers, especially for sections in the city, the squares.

82
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:18,637
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be the eyes and ears for the police in Haines Square, Medford Square, all the squares, South Medford.

83
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:24,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have section people all over the place cleaning them up and keeping them up, even if it's only Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

84
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to look at it from a whole perspective.

85
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's, you know, I asked the mayor to look at it from a whole perspective.

86
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:37,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they get pulled away, then there's going to be a hole someplace else.

87
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:39,007
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lack someplace else.

88
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:45,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So, putting them in their own division helps the signage, but it's going to cause a problem someplace else.

89
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:46,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you.

90
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

91
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:52,878

[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to second the motion.

135
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:46,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:54,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the paperwork for this, and they appear to be in order, and this is going to be inside of the BJ's store, correct?

137
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:55,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it has.

138
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:55,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

139
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:59,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it in one of the other stores already, so good luck.

140
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk about a family who's been more than generous to the city.

141
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,980
[SPEAKER_05]: The D'Alelo family have been there for everybody in this community, no matter what goes on.

142
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,474
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the first to step up.

143
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: They sponsor the Veterans Day here, the lunch for the veterans.

144
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, a motion for approval, Mr. President.

145
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,877
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

146
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

147
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:23,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

148
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:28,858
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with the petitioner, but more to do with BJ's.

149
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:37,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And you may or may not be aware, but BJ's has been a good neighbor for a number of years in that particular neighborhood.

150
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:50,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And of recent, I've received a number of calls from area residents regarding the trash on the property at BJ's and how it is sneaking under the fence into surrounding neighborhoods.

151
00:12:51,152 --> 00:13:06,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would just ask as part of this paper that we as a council send a paper to BJ's asking that they maintain the trash on both sides of the fence at BJ's and that they stay vigilant regarding that.

152
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,763
[SPEAKER_11]: very important neighborhood concern.

153
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular maintenance of any debris on their property.

154
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That's added to the paper.

155
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Cavill, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

156
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,270
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

157
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

158
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

159
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,572
[SPEAKER_03]: License is granted.

160
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:23,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Good brewing.

161
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

162
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: 16-733, communication from the Mayor to the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

163
00:13:35,215 --> 00:14:04,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, whereas the Honorable City Council voted to appropriate certified free cash $1,200,000 for the purpose of awarding the contract to the lowest qualified bidder for the City Hall roof, parapet, and dome, whereas this office informed you that when a loan order for the same purpose, paper 16674, parenthetically, was approved via three readings, that the free cash appropriation would be rescinded.

164
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,020
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas the third reading was taken on October 18th, 2016.

165
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be last week.

166
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:18,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, I respectfully request that the original vote from free cash, paper 16-676 be rescinded.

167
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:22,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

168
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair awaits motion.

169
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We spoke about this last week when we approved the papers.

170
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

171
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Cavill, seconded by Councilor

172
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:35,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

173
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,388
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

174
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

175
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:39,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

176
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,810
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no roll call recorded.

177
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam?

178
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:47,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're under suspension.

179
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not under suspension.

180
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for suspension, Madam Vice President.

181
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:56,640
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Langer-Kern, for suspension of the rules for what purpose, Madam?

182
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,102
[SPEAKER_06]: To request... Thank you, President Dello Russo.

183
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we were under suspension.

184
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,124
[SPEAKER_06]: The agenda is pretty much done.

185
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:18,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some changes that have been proposed from the Rules Committee, and I, as well as the public, have got a few calls and emails on this.

186
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty lengthy, the copy that we got in our Friday's packet.

187
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:28,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see the actual changes like highlighted anywhere.

188
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:32,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've noticed a few myself after reviewing the documents.

189
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:45,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask before tomorrow night's meeting if we could get the actual proposed changes highlighted on a version so that we can make sure we're not missing any of the important changes that are being proposed tomorrow night.

190
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just would like to ask that in a motion form.

191
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:52,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important and I know a lot of people are interested in these changes.

192
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Even for myself, it was hard when I was reading it.

193
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed a number of changes, especially in section 10 and 10.2, 10.3.

194
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,151
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

195
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:13,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a little difficult for me to review it, never mind the public who isn't here every Tuesday night.

196
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:20,675
[SPEAKER_03]: On that motion, first, Councilor Adam Knight, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee.

197
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:21,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, the subcommittee

198
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:31,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Membership will be prepared to make a presentation tomorrow, and we will go over the changes word by word and compare and contrast them with the current and existing rules.

199
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be nothing left out tomorrow at the meeting.

200
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be absolutely 100% sure to go over every single word, period, comma, so on and so forth, so that everybody is well aware of what's going on.

201
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence the purpose of the meeting, Councilor.

202
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:45,914
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct, sir.

203
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:46,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

204
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Order of information, Mr. President.

205
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,798
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the information you have to share with us, Councilor?

206
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:53,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to share it right now.

207
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with Councilor Long and Kern.

208
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be helpful to have that in advance of the meeting.

209
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,782
[SPEAKER_11]: So then I can go over it myself and come up with some questions that I may have.

210
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:11,004
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank the gentleman, Councilor Knight, for all the due diligence on that committee.

211
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:11,965
[SPEAKER_11]: They've done a lot of work.

212
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:18,647
[SPEAKER_11]: But in order for me to make an educated decision, I'd like to have ample time to review it ahead of time rather than right at that meeting.

213
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,555
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be helpful to have a comparison.

214
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:29,078
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this rule number one, we're adding the word the and changing it to the, you know, it is difficult to follow.

215
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:41,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, that's Mr. President, that's why when the committee report this paper out on August 1st, 2016, um, we asked that the city clerk put the committee report together and gave it to the council probably five, six weeks in advance.

216
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, we'll do the best we can with what we got to get it together.

217
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't make any promises that it's going to happen, Mr. President, but the council,

218
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:56,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the meeting should go forward, Mr. President.

219
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: If individuals that have questions, raise them, we will answer them and do our best to answer them.

220
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:07,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not appropriate to call for a vote, are there further changes that need to be deliberated in subcommittee, which I anticipate would be the case, Mr. President.

221
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,586
[SPEAKER_04]: more or less a reform measure that would start a discussion.

222
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:17,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that any of us on the subcommittee felt as though this was going to be a final product that came out of the committee of the whole.

223
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And we felt as though this is probably something that we're going to have to take a look at a couple of other things before it went forward and became operational.

224
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: If in fact that was the will of the council as a whole, Mr. President.

225
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:26,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

226
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

227
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:35,602
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're on to suspension, please state your name and address for the record.

228
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

229
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:36,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

230
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:54,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Coming Street, and thank you very much for bringing this up, because I think that the one thing that I'm concerned about with any rule changes, and I will be at that meeting, and I encourage all to be at that meeting for method, because that could change the way that this body makes votes, does decisions.

231
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:55,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This is huge.

232
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,348
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way our government is run.

233
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,892
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the basic core of how our government makes the decision-making process for the city.

234
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you do in this rules committee affects the entire city,

235
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:07,523
[SPEAKER_01]: and how we do business, which is huge.

236
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:18,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, our First Amendment right, I just want to remind everybody that this is the one chance that people get, and I remember being in some heated

237
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:25,536
[SPEAKER_01]: heated discussions in the city council hall, right here, this chamber, back in the days of Mr. Miyako and everything.

238
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:28,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back in the old days.

239
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:34,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And as heated as they got, it was cathartic and it was helpful to hear from the public.

240
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:43,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one thing that I don't want to see is any kind of rule change that might alter the public's ability to have participation in the process.

241
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:46,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make that perfectly clear.

242
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:47,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be at the meeting tomorrow night.

243
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:48,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

244
00:19:51,616 --> 00:20:08,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, this is something that didn't happen overnight, and this Rules Committee started meeting before I was a member of the Council, and then continued to meet when I became a Councilor, and then continued to meet after the composition of the subcommittee changed.

245
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:16,529
[SPEAKER_04]: When Councilor Camuso retired from public life and when you became the President, the composition of the subcommittee changed as well.

246
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something that started well before I was the Chairman.

247
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It went through my first term and was deliberated and discussed and it's been going on for the past year.

248
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:24,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We've probably met.

249
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:32,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think between the committee right now we've met seven or six times on these proposed rules.

250
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:37,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to that, when Councilor Dello Russo and Camuso comprised the committee, I think we met another six times.

251
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been at least 12 public meetings on

252
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:49,770
[SPEAKER_04]: the subject and topic of rules in the Medford City Council rules to date, Mr. President, that I can recall since I've been on this council and this proposal is the fruit of that labor.

253
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:50,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

254
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

255
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

256
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address.

257
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,791
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

258
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,131
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a member of the cyclist body.

259
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:07,093
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, one of the things that I think is a concerning point is while the meeting might be held tomorrow night, it's not really being held where the public can actually see it and view it.

260
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,613
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a lot of people who might like to come.

261
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:09,784
[SPEAKER_14]: and just can't do it.

262
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:10,524
[SPEAKER_14]: That's number one.

263
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:14,288
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have any public access, so that's another two points against us.

264
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:23,136
[SPEAKER_14]: But more importantly, I think some of these proposed changes and discussions that take place stand to be corrected, go back to 2004 and then 2008.

265
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:32,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And for them to be sitting in the committee for a long period of time such as that with no intent to either add or subtract to them or eliminate them,

266
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,602
[SPEAKER_14]: In the being brought up now you know is of a question.

267
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:44,388
[SPEAKER_14]: You have some concerns in here relative toward open public forums and public participation.

268
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:50,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you read it the way it's being written unless the words are going to be changed someone's going to have to come.

269
00:21:51,467 --> 00:22:01,074
[SPEAKER_14]: at six o'clock at night if they want to talk on the subject matter before the council, and then if they want to talk... Point of clarification, Mr. President, and this is why I'd rather not have this conversation now, because the paper still hasn't been presented.

270
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't even been adopted by the council.

271
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the council floor, but it hasn't been adopted by the council.

272
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still in subcommittee.

273
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The subcommittee reported a paper out.

274
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a meeting on this tomorrow.

275
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:13,442
[SPEAKER_04]: There are going to be lots of questions.

276
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,384
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the meeting tomorrow is for, Mr. President.

277
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, and that's why we're going to discuss this all tomorrow.

278
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But, Mr. President, with all due respect,

279
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:27,781
[SPEAKER_14]: If this is the report that came out, an eight-page report, okay, and it's Councilor Longo-Curran and it's Councilor Marksley's alluded to, it would have been nice to have it highlighted.

280
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It did take some time to go review it.

281
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Then why not discuss this right now?

282
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,645
[SPEAKER_14]: What's being, what's wrong with, we're talking about highlights.

283
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,026
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all we're talking about.

284
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:43,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And these are important points for people to maybe want to come tomorrow night and understand what's going on.

285
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:46,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, pursuant to the present Councilor, I'm going to clarify this.

286
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: This was reported out of subcommittee to the council with the paper that we came in our packets on Friday.

287
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:03,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've just called for the council meeting and announced it in the announcements that went out on Friday.

288
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:08,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So the matter was reported out of subcommittee to the council floor.

289
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:08,667
[SPEAKER_03]: The council

290
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: voted to send it to committee of the whole for vote some months ago, I believe.

291
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:23,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the committee meeting coming up, which will be held tomorrow, which is where we will begin the discussions of the matter.

292
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:27,125
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe, Mr. President, this was came out of committee in August.

293
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,546
[SPEAKER_14]: This is now October.

294
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was a few months lag in between.

295
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:35,429
[SPEAKER_14]: And now you're asking your honorable body to review this in a matter of a few days.

296
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight pages, very small, minuscule print.

297
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:39,877
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's not the point.

298
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:43,180
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact of the matter is this involves the taxpayers of this community.

299
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order, Mr. President.

300
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:44,942
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their floor.

301
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order, Councilor Knight.

302
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:52,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Pursuant to the council rules, a paper that's in subcommittee cannot hit the council floor until a committee of the whole has met.

303
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:53,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

304
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And the committee of the whole has not met.

305
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,296
[SPEAKER_03]: The committee of the whole is scheduled to meet tomorrow.

306
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,338
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to discuss this paper.

307
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,140
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's not true.

308
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's the Committee of the Whole.

309
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been referred to a Committee of the Whole.

310
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:10,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And since you're referring something to the Committee of the Whole, are you telling me that all seven of you?

311
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:18,849
[SPEAKER_14]: are going to be afraid to discuss it before tomorrow night, to let the taxpayers know some of the issues that are on the agenda, Mr. President, that they might want to come.

312
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on our agenda tonight, sir.

313
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:22,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on your agenda for tomorrow night.

314
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a committee of the whole.

315
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,610
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't even get out of the committee of the whole, it doesn't become operational.

316
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even hit the floor.

317
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't become operational.

318
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:29,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's often not.

319
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:30,891
[SPEAKER_04]: All it is is a proposal.

320
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:34,392
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the issue at point, Mr. President.

321
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:39,413
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some very salient points here that operate against the taxpayer

322
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:44,454
[SPEAKER_14]: coming to this podium when they would like to speak on a subject matter more than once.

323
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:48,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Also suspension of the rules as an issue more than once.

324
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:51,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can go through this if you want to, page by page.

325
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,496
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not my intent.

326
00:24:52,776 --> 00:25:03,619
[SPEAKER_14]: My intent is to talk about some highlights that directly affect any taxpayer in this audience to come up here and have an opportunity to speak like right now, which a new rules is promulgated.

327
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,980
[SPEAKER_14]: They will not, if it's voted upon by this body, you won't be able to do it.

328
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to send them- That's not true, Mr. President.

329
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:10,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

330
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.

331
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:12,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

332
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,825
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting ahead of ourselves here, Councilors.

333
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:22,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, so I'd like you to wrap up your remarks now so we can move on.

334
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:31,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, my remarks that I would like to wrap up, Mr. President, is the fact that on tomorrow night you're going to be discussing things that are going to restrict council.

335
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, citizen participation at this podium on more than one occasion.

336
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:35,917
[SPEAKER_14]: It's done three deliberate

337
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:48,178
[SPEAKER_14]: If the council so votes, there's going to be three opportunities where a citizens will not be able to do what's taking place here right now, coming up and speaking on something, whether it's on the agenda or suspension of the rules.

338
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,605
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the craziness of saying that the craziness of saying that is not wrap it up, please.

339
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,327
[SPEAKER_14]: And the craziness of saying.

340
00:25:55,847 --> 00:26:05,535
[SPEAKER_14]: that if one Councilor chastises another one, he has to be scolded by whoever the president is, and apologize, and he won't be able to speak until the apology takes place.

341
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,337
[SPEAKER_14]: What are we talking about here?

342
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,558
[SPEAKER_14]: This is child's play.

343
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:10,899
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be discussed in the Committee of the Whole, sir.

344
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, these are part of the rules that are being promulgated.

345
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:13,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

346
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

347
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for your presence here tonight.

348
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

349
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:19,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

350
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:33,636
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I was asked actually by phone and by email today was if I can get a resident a copy of what the proposed rule changes are.

351
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:39,818
[SPEAKER_11]: And because I don't have it electronically, it's difficult for me to relay six pages of changes.

352
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:45,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there any way we can get this electronically so we can get it out to our constituency?

353
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe all our documents that we get are also posted on the city's webpage.

354
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this posted on the city webpage?

355
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:58,967
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:00,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the meeting notice.

357
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:10,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also, it was attached to the meeting notes, but it was also attached to a previous council agenda when the subcommittee reported the matter out favorably and requested a committee of the whole, right?

358
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:15,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been attached to the council agenda, the council agenda once, maybe twice.

359
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been attached to the meeting notice now as well.

360
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:21,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe it is electronically available online.

361
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:22,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Where?

362
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:25,456
[SPEAKER_11]: The City of Medford website.

363
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:30,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find it, unless someone else is aware where it is.

364
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:33,938
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could give me a heads up where it is, just so I can point people in the right direction.

365
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was reported out of committee, and I don't have that particular date, onto the floor, that entire committee report was posted on the records that one of your councillors approved.

366
00:27:51,178 --> 00:28:01,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So the entire thing is part of the committee report that are on the records, the entirety of that committee report.

367
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and where would you find those records on the city website?

368
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:05,848
[SPEAKER_11]: On the council records.

369
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:08,290
[SPEAKER_11]: So the council records and we don't know what?

370
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you what date that was.

371
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you find out and send us an email just so I can point people?

372
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:18,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the first meeting in September, Mr. President.

373
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first meeting in September.

374
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,131
[SPEAKER_02]: September 20th, I think.

375
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:23,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're posted there, yeah.

376
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:36,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can... We can... I believe I might... Do I have... I think I do have that on my files, my own files.

377
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,637
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the committee report itself, yeah.

378
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:40,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

379
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

380
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:58,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to respectfully ask that before we meet on this, and it's only going to, I truly appreciate the amount of time spent, but the committee members and I agree that rules need to be reviewed.

381
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:04,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But with such a controversial issue at this point, I mean, this came out on Friday and we've.

382
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:05,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't come out.

383
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:10,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got we got these proposed changes in our packet on Friday.

384
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We received them and we received it in the summer.

385
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The public didn't know about it.

386
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't read it until this weekend.

387
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:20,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't tell the public there are five changes versus 20 changes.

388
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:29,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And for us not to be able to highlight the changes to the public and to even ourselves, I just think that's something that needs to be done before we sit and meet on it.

389
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we're bombarded with, I don't know how many changes there are.

390
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:36,635
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are 25 changes, I mean, that's going to be a lot to go over tomorrow night.

391
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:42,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you need a majority vote, but it might be only one or two that are hesitant and have concerns.

392
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:46,716
[SPEAKER_06]: continue as concerns and I just think it's a little fast to push it.

393
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: You know expedited when we have you know we do have the public kind of concerned about it.

394
00:29:55,303 --> 00:30:01,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight if you want to clarify that I do believe the meeting is a public meeting open to the public tomorrow.

395
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:03,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It is anybody that has a concern is more than welcome to come.

396
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have an opportunity to be heard at that meeting Mr. President.

397
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I don't think it's very difficult.

398
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,941
[SPEAKER_04]: When the paper was first reported out, I believe I explained to the council is because it is a lengthy document.

399
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:19,983
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at it and you'll see article 1.1, the swearing in and the oath of office, and then there's a number right next to that.

400
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:23,845
[SPEAKER_04]: That reflects the rule that's in the current rules that are adopted.

401
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:28,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made that point soundly clear when the paper was reported out of committee.

402
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:34,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the paper was reported out of committee some four, five, six weeks ago on this council floor.

403
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:36,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's looked at it since then.

404
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my problem.

405
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:38,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry about that.

406
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:49,515
[SPEAKER_04]: If they haven't looked at it, Mr. President, but this committee met for three and a half years on this topic, and we're ready to move forward on the matter and to present it to the council as presented to the committee of the whole meeting.

407
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:57,961
[SPEAKER_04]: In the interim, in the interim, I'd be happy to work towards putting a document like that together, but I don't feel as though it's something that should hold up the progress of the committee.

408
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:00,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

409
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:02,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a quick point of clarification.

410
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not on the city's website.

411
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:17,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the folks who have found out today, it was a citizen taxpayer who put it on a Facebook page, and that's how people became aware of it, because they couldn't get the gut of what this whole thing was about on the city's webpage.

412
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, sir.

413
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

414
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:23,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

415
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:25,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

416
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:26,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

417
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty Lowe, 34 Gibson Street.

418
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,525
[SPEAKER_07]: This is only my second time approaching the council.

419
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:40,850
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time was a couple of months ago, earlier this year, when I came up to speak about the proposed development at 61 Locust Street.

420
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've had a chance to review these rules.

421
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:55,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it was through, not the city's website, but through a concerned citizen on Facebook posting this document, the meeting report from August 1st.

422
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:12,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a chance to review it and I've come to the conclusion that if these rules had been in place when I first came up, when I first approached the council, I would not have been able to speak on that topic about 61 Lucas Street in my position of the development.

423
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:27,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Rule 10 in particular about open forum and public participation in conjunction with rule 4.2, papers requiring action,

424
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:43,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It would seem to require any citizen who would approach the council during public participation to have to file an application with the city clerk the week prior, either Friday or Thursday, depending on whether there's a holiday.

425
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,377
[SPEAKER_07]: By what time is it?

426
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,820
[SPEAKER_07]: By 9.30 a.m., the Friday preceding the city council meeting.

427
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:18,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And the public participation period seems to be limited just to whatever's on the council's agenda for that week, which... If you look at it, there's also an open forum section, and an open forum section was established by way of the subcommittee to allow for residents of the general public to come up and speak before the council on items that do not appear on the agenda.

428
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:26,195
[SPEAKER_04]: and anyone wishing to do so may do so by application in accord with rule 4.0, which is the way that everybody currently applies to speak before the city council.

429
00:33:26,515 --> 00:33:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you read the sentence further, it would say, or with the city messenger on the evening of the meeting prior to that portion of the meeting.

430
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to have the opportunity.

431
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:48,697
[SPEAKER_03]: in the meeting that was called for this purpose to begin the public deliberation of the proposed rules changes in the context of the meeting called for tomorrow night.

432
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:52,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two questions pertaining to Councilor Knight's points.

433
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:56,864
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one would be, with regards to the open forum, is that going to be televised?

434
00:33:56,924 --> 00:34:00,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you would, direct them towards the chair according to the rules that exist.

435
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:00,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

436
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:01,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

437
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:09,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to know if that open forum that's supposed to be taking place at 6 p.m.

438
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:10,585
[SPEAKER_07]: prior to the 7 p.m.

439
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,486
[SPEAKER_07]: roll call, prior to the 7 p.m.

440
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:16,507
[SPEAKER_07]: start of the city council meeting, will that part be televised?

441
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that portion be televised?

442
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Subject to the will of the council.

443
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

444
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:28,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other part I wanted to ask about was why is it that each member of the public gets to speak just once at each

445
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity for members of the public to participate at the open forum before the meeting, at the public participation time slot, and then at the open forum after adjournment.

446
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:56,972
[SPEAKER_07]: These rules would seem pretty onerous between the speaking once at each opportunity for public participation and with having to

447
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:05,905
[SPEAKER_07]: by an application with the city clerk the week prior to speak at the public participation part of the city council meeting.

448
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:23,032
[SPEAKER_07]: These would seem to fly in the face of the stated goal where the committee has drafted the proposal below that will reorganize the existing rules into a more coherent and fluid structure, streamline the meeting structure, increase opportunities for public participation, and adopt best practices.

449
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:28,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It would seem to me to really put quite a burden on the public to figure out the rules

450
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:37,026
[SPEAKER_07]: om pertaining to approaching the council during the public participation part of the meeting and being able to share our thoughts and opinions.

451
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:43,831
[SPEAKER_04]: In response to that, Mr. President, the parliamentarian for the council is the president of the council at that period, at that point of time.

452
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:47,173
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in charge of enforcing and implementing and applying the rules.

453
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:55,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Presently, under the current rules that are in place right now, I believe they say that a citizen would be allowed to talk no more than three times for no more than 10 minutes.

454
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So this allows a person to speak still three times,

455
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:07,382
[SPEAKER_04]: for up to three minutes, which actually increases participation, because it gives you a full 30 minutes to speak, as opposed to three times in 10 minutes, it gives you 30 minutes to speak.

456
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:09,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

457
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:12,443
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 minutes on any item that's on the agenda and 20 minutes on any items that aren't.

458
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we'll continue, we'll begin our deliberation on this tomorrow night in the Committee of the Whole.

459
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether or not the rules are adhered to, the current rules are adhered to in the 310 rules and story, Mr. President.

460
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

461
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:34,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the woman at the podium raises some great questions, and tomorrow will be a very fruitful meeting.

462
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:46,225
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I do agree that although Councilor Knight mentioned that this will allow ample opportunity to speak, the way I understand it is, other than the 6 p.m.

463
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,948
[SPEAKER_11]: prior meeting, that you would have to speak on something that's offered by the Council.

464
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the past, we have allowed residents to get up and speak on any issue.

465
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's always been the uniqueness of our body.

466
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:04,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike the state legislature, unlike Congress, we invite public participation.

467
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:09,450
[SPEAKER_11]: And my discussion will be made tomorrow night, but I agree.

468
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:17,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not support anything that narrows any type of public participation or makes residents jump through hurdles in order to speak before this body, Mr. President.

469
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:18,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

470
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, to Councilor Marks.

471
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,660
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just want to... Yes.

472
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:54,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that's said at the podium during the public participation portion that warrants further investigation.

473
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,570
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

474
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,850
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard it from a citizen.

475
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a week to investigate it.

476
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a week to investigate it.

477
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:00,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go and look at this for a week.

478
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:01,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there's an issue over here.

479
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:02,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make some phone calls.

480
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:03,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's investigate it.

481
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:04,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what's going on.

482
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:06,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this might be worthy of a resolution.

483
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:08,795
[SPEAKER_04]: You file a resolution, then next week the resolution's on.

484
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:11,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

485
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:14,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor, we have a citizen at the podium.

486
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I speak once or twice?

487
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

488
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be nice to get equal time.

489
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:26,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to offer a public session prior to our meeting.

490
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:28,998
[SPEAKER_11]: We're opening it up at 6 o'clock.

491
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We assume that people don't have families.

492
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,840
[SPEAKER_11]: We assume that people aren't working.

493
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,282
[SPEAKER_11]: We're taking a lot of assumptions here that a 6 p.m.

494
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:45,346
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting, first of all, that's not televised, and that, secondly, just say 20 people do want to come up and speak under this open meeting.

495
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,900
[SPEAKER_11]: The first person comes up and speaks on sidewalks.

496
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,421
[SPEAKER_11]: The second person comes up and speaks on the roof.

497
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,761
[SPEAKER_11]: The third person comes up and speaks on sidewalks.

498
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:57,782
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we going to keep a quorum, Mr. President?

499
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm not sure what order things would be taken if people are here.

500
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:06,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they just going to rattle off what their concerns are and fall on deaf ears?

501
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:12,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, to me, what better to have someone from the public speak while the debate is happening?

502
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:18,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want someone speaking two hours before a debate, because that's no good.

503
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:21,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hear what they have to say during the debate, Mr. President.

504
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:28,161
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we all should be eager to listen to residents that are taking the time to come up here out of their schedule.

505
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:34,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We always say, I wish more residents would come up, and now we're making it more difficult for residents to come up and speak before this body.

506
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:38,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the only point I want to make, and I appreciate you allowing me.

507
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Councilor, and we're going to

508
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap this all up, and we're going to discuss this tomorrow night.

509
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

510
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:47,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to agree with Councilor Marks.

511
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:51,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost makes me antsy not to know the exact proposed changes.

512
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:56,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine not allowing the public to speak during every single issue.

513
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's sometimes how we shape our votes.

514
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have 100 people for the Locust Street development.

515
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:05,736
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew what the people wanted and what they were upset about.

516
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:09,739
[SPEAKER_06]: If we didn't have something like that, I think it would be just a

517
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,322
[SPEAKER_06]: terrible way to do business.

518
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:18,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of the ways we do it now is the right way, and letting the people speak and have their First Amendment right.

519
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:25,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And people respect that, and people are scared enough to come in front of the podium, never mind having to be barred, you know, follow all these rules.

520
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have grave concern about that myself.

521
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:33,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why don't we wrap this all up now, since we're really not discussing this matter tonight.

522
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:38,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to welcome the citizen to the podium who's going to share his name and address for the record.

523
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Villione.

524
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:43,464
[SPEAKER_08]: 59 Garfield, where a tree was saved today from destruction.

525
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

526
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be very brief.

527
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a date with Dr. Strange tomorrow night, so I can't attend.

528
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:50,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you're happy about that.

529
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:54,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But if someone would like to borrow my camera, I think we need to get this on videotape.

530
00:40:55,149 --> 00:41:00,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just like to recite a paragraph said here in this very council chambers in 2008.

531
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:07,114
[SPEAKER_08]: The one sentiment that I have heard that I take great exception to is that the city is trying to limit speech.

532
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:09,995
[SPEAKER_08]: The notion the city would censor or squelch

533
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,202
[SPEAKER_08]: free speech is baseless and a city solicitor.

534
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:19,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I would find any such effort repugnant according to the movie transporter city solicitor Romney.

535
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:20,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's your big chance.

536
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:21,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

537
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:23,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

538
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:37,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilors, uh, I think the motion, what was your motion, madam vice president, that we have a colorized version of this, that the, on the motion that the changes be highlighted all those in favor.

539
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:53,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And an electronic copy is already available, but we'll add that as well, amend the motion.

540
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,651
[SPEAKER_03]: On that motion, all those in favor?

541
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:56,611
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

542
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

543
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:01,114
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're on to suspension, a couple papers in the hands of the clerk.

544
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:08,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be resolved that the City Council discuss the bus stop.

545
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,899
[SPEAKER_03]: On High and Main Street, Councilor Scarpelli.

546
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you?

547
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:13,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

548
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: There you are.

549
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

550
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:16,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

551
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:36,068
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, I know that a few weeks back we took a vote, we put a request into the Department of Transportation and we made a recommendation and requested that we eliminate the bus stop in front of High and

553
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:40,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Main Street until the construction on that side is complete.

554
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I gather, I believe that the bus stop is still active.

555
00:42:47,072 --> 00:43:01,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the city clerk can reach out to the Department of Transportation and I know Dan Fielding worked directly with him to make them aware of our decision and go from there.

556
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,461
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all those in favor?

557
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:04,522
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

558
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:14,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Council Mark, be it resolved that the administration update the council on the poor lighting in Medford Square and surrounding squares.

559
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:15,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Marks.

560
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

561
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:35,134
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not new to the council, but I've received a number of complaints from not only area residents, but business owners that now that the daylight savings time is here, that at 5.30 it gets quite dark and square is pitch dark.

562
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's becoming a problem, Mr. President.

563
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:54,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I know roughly about 12 to 14 months ago, many of the lenses were changed within the lighting fixtures with the hopes that that would improve some of the lighting in the square that failed to yield any benefit, in my opinion.

564
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:03,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is a pilot program, if anyone's interested, that's being done in front of the old theater, Medford Theater on Salem Street.

565
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:08,138
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll notice that they enhanced the lights and two of the street lights.

566
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my opinion, they give off great light.

567
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:29,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm hoping that we really don't need to spend much more time on this in the interest of public safety, in particular, when we have trick or treat coming in our square very shortly and in Haines Square and West Method, that these lights be changed over immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

568
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,711
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many sections in the square.

569
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:37,676
[SPEAKER_11]: If business owners didn't leave their lights on overnight, it would be ultimately dark in the square.

570
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:41,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not good for business, and it's not good for public safety.

571
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:49,445
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask for a response back from the mayor regarding when this new lighting is going to take place.

572
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So that if you could just clarify that, Mr. Clerk, that the new lighting solutions that were implemented by the Office of Energy and

573
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:06,639
[SPEAKER_03]: environment be implemented immediately in the interest of public safety.

574
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

575
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

576
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

577
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:17,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, not only in the squares, but all the streetlights that we have in our city, they're those orange low voltage lights.

578
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:25,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time that we change over to the LED lights like many other cities have on all our main streets, at least.

579
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That orange light isn't cutting it anymore.

580
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:33,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd say the squares, I've been to many of the squares in other cities and towns.

581
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,112
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have bright LED lighting on all their decorative posts.

582
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:40,253
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think those should be done immediately, and I agree with Councilor Marks.

583
00:45:40,853 --> 00:45:41,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween's coming up.

584
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:42,614
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be kids out.

585
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:48,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually there's 8,000 to 10,000 kids that come out next week.

586
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:51,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can get that done quickly, it would be a great help.

587
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:00,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello and amended by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Falco.

588
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:01,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

589
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:09,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention really quick, since the issue of public safety came up, that the next Medford Police Community Meeting is coming up.

590
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,170
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at St.

591
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis Parish Center at 7 p.m.

592
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,372
[SPEAKER_00]: on November 2nd.

593
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:15,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is welcome.

594
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:19,935
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what neighborhood you live in throughout the city, everyone is welcome to attend.

595
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,552
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francis Parish Center, 7 p.m.

596
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:23,832
[SPEAKER_00]: on November 2nd.

597
00:46:24,812 --> 00:46:26,893
[SPEAKER_00]: December 7th, Andrews Middle School.

598
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:29,954
[SPEAKER_00]: January 4th, South Medford Fire Station.

599
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:39,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just added a date of February 1st is going to be, I think, at Breed Hall at Patuxent University.

600
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:41,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added another date to the list.

601
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:46,379
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to, public safety came up, and this is,

602
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:50,845
[SPEAKER_00]: a great venue to talk about public safety issues and questions that they may have the police station.

603
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:56,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a list of updating, updated times and locations for those meetings.

604
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.

605
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:01,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that motion as amended, all those in favor, all those opposed.

606
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:10,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Our last piece of suspension offered by Councilor Marks be resolved that the Riverside Avenue be discussed in the interest of public safety Councilor Marks.

607
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:16,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Press, I typically don't like to bring up one street or another because I know

608
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of our streets are in deplorable condition.

609
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:31,705
[SPEAKER_11]: But I must say Riverside have, in particular at the corner of Riverside and Park and going down Riverside towards the Fellsway, there are a number of good-sized dips in the road.

610
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:33,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're unavoidable.

611
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,268
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't swerve to one side or another.

612
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:39,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And they really cause a public safety concern.

613
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've asked, I know I've put it on and other members of this council have put it on a number of times.

614
00:47:45,677 --> 00:48:00,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it's due to work done by the utilities, but really the city needs to step up, find who dug these particular trenches, and get them to repave the road in the condition it previously was.

615
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:08,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask once again, I know we received 400,000 in safe streets grant from the state.

616
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:12,879
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I don't think we can ignore the existing streets.

617
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:14,260
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great we have seven projects.

618
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,820
[SPEAKER_11]: that are coming to fruition, but we can't ignore the existing streets.

619
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:22,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that Riverside Ave be looked at again by our engineer.

620
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:30,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I remember correctly, Councilman, we were discussing that whole interchange down by the Fellsway and the Plaza with the new restaurants that went in.

621
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:44,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was our assumption, if not our explicit request, that that area be repaved before the grid, which they did paint in finally, was put into place to sort of

622
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:55,853
[SPEAKER_03]: allow for that grid to stand out, so there'd be less gridlock, and to smooth out that traffic area to make things work more efficiently.

623
00:48:55,893 --> 00:49:04,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, it didn't happen, and that grid was painted on what one could only describe as some sort of moon surface.

624
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks, we invite the representative of East Medford to state his name and address for the record.

625
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:16,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council President.

626
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:26,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Council March for bringing up a safety concern on the streets at Park and Riverside Avenue.

627
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:40,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been meaning to say this for many decades, and I've heard many people express concerns about the safety issue when they're driving a vehicle, also pedestrians, at that exact location.

628
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,630
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're on Park Street,

629
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: coming from the north side, from the old Swan School, and you're entering onto Riverside Ave, you have to go left or right, or straight.

630
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:08,102
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there is, it seems like it's not a fair obstruction, that fence on the left-hand side, it's a white picket fence,

631
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:19,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if you're sitting in a high-rise vehicle versus, forget about it, if you're driving a Corvette, of course, it's hard to see over that fence.

632
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure everyone here is totally aware of the exact location.

633
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:39,905
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been numerous accidents without me checking the internet from the insurance companies, and therefore, if we could sort of, like, do a surgical eminent domain on the

634
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:50,864
[SPEAKER_10]: the top 18 inches, whatever it takes on the fence, I would gladly be out of my pocket to see less accidents, less injuries.

635
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Just let me know the number, I'll cut you the check.

636
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

637
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So the motion of approval by Councilor Marks.

638
00:50:58,666 --> 00:50:59,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor?

639
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:07,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I could, actually the next street down and the street escapes, the name escapes me.

640
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:10,369
[SPEAKER_11]: There was some bushes that were eight to 10 feet tall.

641
00:51:11,597 --> 00:51:18,899
[SPEAKER_11]: En a building department went out and kindly asked the owners to cut them down because it was blocking the view of people trying to get onto Riverside.

642
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And the residents were kind enough to get out there immediately and trim the bushes down.

643
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:29,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never had something of a fixed structure like a fence, but I think it's something we should ask the building department.

644
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,363
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't happen to have a number, do you?

645
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:35,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Of the home that you're talking about?

646
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

647
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:53,155
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can get that, I think we should offer for the building apartment, maybe just to go out there, take a look at the area, because that is a tough area to pull out of, let alone with an obstruction in the way, so.

648
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:55,317
[SPEAKER_11]: On that motion as amended.

649
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you provide that to the city clerk, the address?

650
00:51:58,019 --> 00:51:58,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

651
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

652
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,461
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

653
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

654
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion carries.

655
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,285
[SPEAKER_03]: The records.

656
00:52:10,146 --> 00:52:13,868
[SPEAKER_03]: of the last meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

657
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:18,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I review the records, Mr. President, and find them to be in order and move approval.

658
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:22,353
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval of the previous meeting's records by Councilor Marks.

659
00:52:22,393 --> 00:52:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

660
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

661
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:25,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

662
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:29,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the motion for adjournment by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

663
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:30,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

664
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:31,459
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

665
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting is adjourned.
