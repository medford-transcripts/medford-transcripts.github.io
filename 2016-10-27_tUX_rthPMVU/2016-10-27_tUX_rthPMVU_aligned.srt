1
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:45,822
Counselor Knight.

2
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:49,625
Mr. President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to present this resolution.

3
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:54,668
I'm proposing that the city change the structure of the sign department.

4
00:00:54,688 --> 00:01:00,072
I really think that the sign department should be a standalone division within the DPW and not a subdivision of the highway department.

5
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:10,419
Reason being is it is a public safety department, Mr. President, and they need to ensure that there is proper installation and maintenance of our roadway control signs as well as the striping on our streets.

6
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:15,062
If anybody's been paying attention to the last five or six meetings of the Memphis City Council,

7
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:25,192
I think it's safe to say that the topic of our conversation has been signage and has been the striping of our streets and the public safety issues that are surrounding those matters here in our community, Mr. President.

8
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:31,615
And I'm asking that the administration take a look at this issue and determine whether or not it's feasible to create a standalone sign shop.

9
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:39,178
The sign shop is responsible for all of the signage that's put forth by the Traffic Commission, as well as the existing signs that are in place.

10
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,900
They're in charge of all the signage at the schools as well, Mr. President.

11
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:56,955
a large job, and what's happening is these individuals that are assigned to the sign shop being a subdivision of the highway division are being pulled away to handle other matters that are in the community, and then they're put back into the sign shop, pulled out of the sign shop, put back in the sign shop.

12
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:08,019
And I think that it would make good sense to have a full-time, stand-alone sign and striping division within the DPW, Mr. President, so that these issues in our community can be addressed promptly and properly.

13
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,740
I don't think we have had

14
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:18,687
a meeting yet when the good weather rolls around and we don't talk about when our sidewalks are going to be, our crosswalks are going to be striped, Mr. President.

15
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:22,168
And I think that this would be a perfect remedy for that type of issue.

16
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,508
I'd ask that my council colleagues support the measure.

17
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,189
Thank you, Councillor.

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,411
On the motion of approval by Councillor Knight, the citizen wishes to speak.

19
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:34,411
Good evening.

20
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,251
Welcome.

21
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,312
Please state your name and address for the record.

22
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,032
My name is Robert Petter, a former member of this council.

23
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:46,468
When I was reviewing the offering by Councilor Knight this evening, my question, I think, presents itself in a different direction.

24
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,911
I mean, we've spent over $14.5 million for a brand new building.

25
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,773
It's obvious that certain departments are understaffed.

26
00:02:53,714 --> 00:03:02,481
And this may be a good way to look at actually what is going on in the highway department as it relates to men, the equipment that they have, and everything that's going on.

27
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:08,085
And the fact that if this is going to be, I think, is your intent to create another department?

28
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,106
Is that what you said, Councilor Knight?

29
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:10,573
stand alone.

30
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,954
I don't know if that's a contractual obligation that has to be negotiated through the union.

31
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:25,078
I mean, it presents itself with a whole bunch of issues, but the best part of the issue I think is this, that I think the council really needs to take a look and see as to what's going on over there, the highway department or the public works building.

32
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:27,558
I mean, I don't really know if you have a director or not.

33
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,579
He was on a three months on trial basis.

34
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:30,759
It ended in March.

35
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,220
I don't know if they're still advertising for a new director's position.

36
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,794
But I think it would be beneficial if he was here tonight to discuss the matter.

37
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:44,039
The commissioner has been appointed and is no longer wearing the interim tag, as far as I've been informed.

38
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,160
Is that public knowledge that he's been?

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,722
I mean, are you councillors aware of the fact that he's been appointed?

40
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:50,544
Pardon me?

41
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:55,768
Well, this is the problem of not getting information out there.

42
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,169
I mean, some councillors know, some don't.

43
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:58,950
I, as a public person, don't know.

44
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,472
And I try to stay on top of what's going on here in the city.

45
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:12,021
But more importantly, just getting back to this issue in particular, my suggestion would be, and if I was on your side of the rail, I would suggest that if we're going to be looking at this, maybe we should be looking at all the departments.

46
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:19,705
And if this, in fact, is a union type of job, and this is contractual, I believe the membership themselves have to vote on this as well.

47
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:27,589
So while it sounds good, I just think it needs to be researched, and I think it's the best time to look at the whole offering in the Department of Public Works.

48
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,050
Thank you very much, citizen.

49
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,390
You're welcome.

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,400
Vice-President Longo-Curran.

51
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,701
Chair recognizes Vice-President Longo-Curran.

52
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,462
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:50,690
Just on that point, if we could just request from the Mayor's Office written notification if the Interim Director has been appointed as the full-time director, because I was unaware, so I know, I believe the Council's word, but if we could just get a report from the Mayor's Office to clarify that.

54
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,293
On the motion of approval as amended by Vice-President Longo-Curran, Chair recognizes Councilor Nightingale.

55
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:13,091
Again, Mr. President, this is a resolution that asks that the administration examine the feasibility thereof, so there will certainly be issues that are going to surround this matter in terms of collective bargaining, contract negotiation, and whether or not it even is a feasible move or an option to make, and that's why I'm asking the administration to study it.

56
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,092
Thank you for that clarification.

57
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,307
Chair recognizes the person at the podium.

58
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,147
Welcome, good evening.

59
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,968
Please state your name and address for the record.

60
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,749
Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

61
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,270
Thank you very much for listening.

62
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,072
My question is, why would they be being pulled away?

63
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,720
It is a public safety issue.

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:40,713
All DPW issues are a public safety issue, whether it's snow removal, whether it's trash removal, whether it's manhole covers, whether it's those rain drain things.

65
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:46,139
If they're not set right, somebody can get into a car or an accident or something like that.

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,602
So the DPW is definitely

67
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:51,415
interwoven with public safety.

68
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:57,016
There is absolutely no question about it, that if you can't drive down the street safely, then it's a public safety issue.

69
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:02,397
And it has to do with that whole overview that I stated and I implore the mayor to look at.

70
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:13,559
The whole city needs to be evaluated for traffic flow, sidewalks, bicycles, buses, trucks, the whole nine yards, everything, including striping.

71
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,900
And I think that striping, and I agree with Mr. Knight

72
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:27,203
That it's absolutely, it's absolutely a basic function of the city that we have proper striping, proper signs so that everybody knows where they're going.

73
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:35,247
But I wonder, the question that comes to my mind is, why are they being pulled away from the sign department in the first place?

74
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,528
And that's because we are understaffed.

75
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:42,811
So we need to look at that, but we can't look at staffing until we understand and assess the entire city.

76
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,693
You have to look at it from the entire city's perspective.

77
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:53,674
If you don't assess the whole city and all of its needs, then you're just playing a little game patch here and patch here.

78
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,475
And why are they being pulled away?

79
00:06:55,495 --> 00:07:01,258
So they're going to be pulled away, and then some other part of DPW is going to go unresolved.

80
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:03,940
So we have to look at it.

81
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:12,115
I think it's a great idea, and I absolutely urge the city to hire more workers, especially for sections in the city, the squares.

82
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:18,637
They can be the eyes and ears for the police in Haines Square, Medford Square, all the squares, South Medford.

83
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:24,799
We can have section people all over the place cleaning them up and keeping them up, even if it's only Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

84
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,240
So you have to look at it from a whole perspective.

85
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,921
And I think that that's, you know, I asked the mayor to look at it from a whole perspective.

86
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:37,466
And if they get pulled away, then there's going to be a hole someplace else.

87
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:39,007
There's going to be a lack someplace else.

88
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:45,672
So, putting them in their own division helps the signage, but it's going to cause a problem someplace else.

89
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:46,513
So, thank you.

90
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,614
Thank you very much.

91
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:52,878
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Vice President Langley-Curran.

92
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:53,859
All those in favor?

93
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:55,096
All those opposed?

94
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,717

The 2016 Induction Ceremony and Banquet will be held on Sunday, November 20, 2016, at the Irish American Hall in Malden.

109
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:41,915
Mr. President, thank you very much.

110
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:46,060
I'd like the Council to join me in congratulating these individuals for the fine

111
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,351
legacy that they've left behind them at Medford High School, Mr. President.

112
00:09:50,631 --> 00:10:00,275
And going through this list, we see a number of great student-athletes who have the blue and white running through their veins, who have done well in the classroom as well as on the athletic field, Mr. President.

113
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:04,177
And as we go down the list, there is someone who I'd like to point out, and that's Martin Murphy Jr.

114
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:14,441
Martin Murphy, for as long as I can remember, has been one of the most generous and giving individuals in our community, whether it's for Community Day, for

115
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,861
I was going to second the motion.

116
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:21,444
I know a number of the inductees and they are great athletes, Megan Richard, David Richard, and I also was coached by Lou Ruggiero as a

117
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,454
with cross-country and he is an amazing guy.

118
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,115
I still keep in touch with him today.

119
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,997
One of my two favorite coaches next to Mr. Scott Pelley.

120
00:10:53,458 --> 00:11:00,042
So just wanted to congratulate all the inductees, the Murphy family, and it'll be a great day, I'm sure, on November 20th.

121
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:05,065
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Lowell Kern.

122
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,186
All those in favor?

123
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:06,286
Aye.

124
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:07,147
All those opposed?

125
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,267
Motion carries.

126
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,249
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

127
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:10,289
16-732.

128
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:25,678
Petition for common fictional license by Michelle Lawler, 430 Salem Street, Metro Mass, for RMG Donuts, LLC, doing business as Dunkin' Donuts, 278 Middlesex Avenue.

129
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:31,379
On file are all the necessary certificates and writs of compliance.

130
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,679
Is the petitioner present?

131
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,359
Please state your name and address for the record.

132
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,180
Hi, Michelle Lawler, 5 Rose Lane, Boxford, Mass.

133
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,190
Welcome.

134
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,812
Chair recognizes Vice-Councilor Caraviello, Chairman of the Licensing Subcommittee.

135
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:46,593
Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:54,796
Mr. President, I have reviewed the paperwork for this, and they appear to be in order, and this is going to be inside of the BJ's store, correct?

137
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:55,236
Yes, it has.

138
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:55,816
Yes.

139
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:59,817
I've seen it in one of the other stores already, so good luck.

140
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:03,578
And talk about a family who's been more than generous to the city.

141
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,980
The D'Alelo family have been there for everybody in this community, no matter what goes on.

142
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,474
They're the first to step up.

143
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:13,515
They sponsor the Veterans Day here, the lunch for the veterans.

144
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,236
So, again, a motion for approval, Mr. President.

145
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,877
On the motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

146
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,637
Mr. President.

147
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:23,397
Councilor Max.

148
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:28,858
This has nothing to do with the petitioner, but more to do with BJ's.

149
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:37,760
And you may or may not be aware, but BJ's has been a good neighbor for a number of years in that particular neighborhood.

150
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:50,572
And of recent, I've received a number of calls from area residents regarding the trash on the property at BJ's and how it is sneaking under the fence into surrounding neighborhoods.

151
00:12:51,152 --> 00:13:06,140
And I would just ask as part of this paper that we as a council send a paper to BJ's asking that they maintain the trash on both sides of the fence at BJ's and that they stay vigilant regarding that.

152
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,763
very important neighborhood concern.

153
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,025
Regular maintenance of any debris on their property.

154
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,846
That's added to the paper.

155
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:18,489
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Cavill, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

156
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,270
All those in favor?

157
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,490
Aye.

158
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,550
All those opposed?

159
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,572
License is granted.

160
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:23,432
Good brewing.

161
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,794
Thank you.

162
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:32,738
16-733, communication from the Mayor to the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

163
00:13:35,215 --> 00:14:04,447
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, whereas the Honorable City Council voted to appropriate certified free cash $1,200,000 for the purpose of awarding the contract to the lowest qualified bidder for the City Hall roof, parapet, and dome, whereas this office informed you that when a loan order for the same purpose, paper 16674, parenthetically, was approved via three readings, that the free cash appropriation would be rescinded.

164
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,020
whereas the third reading was taken on October 18th, 2016.

165
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,721
That would be last week.

166
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:18,703
Therefore, I respectfully request that the original vote from free cash, paper 16-676 be rescinded.

167
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:22,804
Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

168
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,345
Chair awaits motion.

169
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,706
We spoke about this last week when we approved the papers.

170
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,226
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

171
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:34,828
On the motion for approval by Councilor Cavill, seconded by Councilor

172
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:35,347
Good night.

173
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,388
All those in favor?

174
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:38,329
All those opposed?

175
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:39,630
Motion carries.

176
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,810
There was no roll call recorded.

177
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,010
Madam?

178
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:47,274
Well, we're under suspension.

179
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,295
We're not under suspension.

180
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,016
Motion for suspension, Madam Vice President.

181
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:56,640
On the motion of Vice President Langer-Kern, for suspension of the rules for what purpose, Madam?

182
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,102
To request... Thank you, President De La Russo.

183
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,403
I thought we were under suspension.

184
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,124
The agenda is pretty much done.

185
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:18,566
I know there's some changes that have been proposed from the Rules Committee, and I, as well as the public, have got a few calls and emails on this.

186
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,331
It's pretty lengthy, the copy that we got in our Friday's packet.

187
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:28,567
I don't see the actual changes like highlighted anywhere.

188
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:32,128
I know I've noticed a few myself after reviewing the documents.

189
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:45,410
I just wanted to ask before tomorrow night's meeting if we could get the actual proposed changes highlighted on a version so that we can make sure we're not missing any of the important changes that are being proposed tomorrow night.

190
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,311
So I just would like to ask that in a motion form.

191
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:52,592
I think it's important and I know a lot of people are interested in these changes.

192
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,810
Even for myself, it was hard when I was reading it.

193
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,911
I noticed a number of changes, especially in section 10 and 10.2, 10.3.

194
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,151
But I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

195
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:13,513
So it was a little difficult for me to review it, never mind the public who isn't here every Tuesday night.

196
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:20,675
On that motion, first, Councilor Adam Knight, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee.

197
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:21,995
Mr. President, the subcommittee

198
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:31,921
Membership will be prepared to make a presentation tomorrow, and we will go over the changes word by word and compare and contrast them with the current and existing rules.

199
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,624
So there will be nothing left out tomorrow at the meeting.

200
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:43,311
We will be absolutely 100% sure to go over every single word, period, comma, so on and so forth, so that everybody is well aware of what's going on.

201
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,053
Hence the purpose of the meeting, Counselor.

202
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:45,914
That is correct, sir.

203
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:46,614
Thank you.

204
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,296
Order of information, Mr. President.

205
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,798
What is the information you have to share with us, Counselor?

206
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:53,678
I'm going to share it right now.

207
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,979
I agree with Counselor Long and Kern.

208
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,840
I think it would be helpful to have that in advance of the meeting.

209
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,782
So then I can go over it myself and come up with some questions that I may have.

210
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:11,004
So I thank the gentleman, Counselor Knight, for all the due diligence on that committee.

211
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:11,965
They've done a lot of work.

212
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:18,647
But in order for me to make an educated decision, I'd like to have ample time to review it ahead of time rather than right at that meeting.

213
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,555
It would be helpful to have a comparison.

214
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:29,078
You know, this rule number one, we're adding the word the and changing it to the, you know, it is difficult to follow.

215
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:41,924
So, um, that's Mr. President, that's why when the committee report this paper out on August 1st, 2016, um, we asked that the city clerk put the committee report together and gave it to the council probably five, six weeks in advance.

216
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,546
Um, but you know, we'll do the best we can with what we got to get it together.

217
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,307
I can't make any promises that it's going to happen, Mr. President, but the council,

218
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:56,727
I think that the meeting should go forward, Mr. President.

219
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,932
If individuals that have questions, raise them, we will answer them and do our best to answer them.

220
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:07,519
And if it's not appropriate to call for a vote, are there further changes that need to be deliberated in subcommittee, which I anticipate would be the case, Mr. President.

221
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,586
more or less a reform measure that would start a discussion.

222
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:17,390
And I don't think that any of us on the subcommittee felt as though this was going to be a final product that came out of the committee of the whole.

223
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,554
And we felt as though this is probably something that we're going to have to take a look at a couple of other things before it went forward and became operational.

224
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,116
If in fact that was the will of the council as a whole, Mr. President.

225
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:26,936
Thank you.

226
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,057
Thank you.

227
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:35,602
While we're on to suspension, please state your name and address for the record.

228
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,022
Welcome.

229
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:36,783
Thank you.

230
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:54,686
Jean Martin, 10 Coming Street, and thank you very much for bringing this up, because I think that the one thing that I'm concerned about with any rule changes, and I will be at that meeting, and I encourage all to be at that meeting for method, because that could change the way that this body makes votes, does decisions.

231
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:55,967
This is huge.

232
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,348
This is the way our government is run.

233
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,892
This is the basic core of how our government makes the decision-making process for the city.

234
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,375
So what you do in this rules committee affects the entire city,

235
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:07,523
and how we do business, which is huge.

236
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:18,792
Secondly, our First Amendment right, I just want to remind everybody that this is the one chance that people get, and I remember being in some heated

237
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:25,536
heated discussions in the city council hall, right here, this chamber, back in the days of Mr. Miyako and everything.

238
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:28,037
And, you know, back in the old days.

239
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:34,681
And as heated as they got, it was cathartic and it was helpful to hear from the public.

240
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:43,325
And the one thing that I don't want to see is any kind of rule change that might alter the public's ability to have participation in the process.

241
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:46,507
So I just want to make that perfectly clear.

242
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:47,848
And I will be at the meeting tomorrow night.

243
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:48,468
Thank you.

244
00:19:51,616 --> 00:20:08,124
Mr. President, this is something that didn't happen overnight, and this Rules Committee started meeting before I was a member of the Council, and then continued to meet when I became a Councillor, and then continued to meet after the composition of the subcommittee changed.

245
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:16,529
When Councillor Camuso retired from public life and when you became the President, the composition of the subcommittee changed as well.

246
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,990
So this is something that started well before I was the Chairman.

247
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,965
It went through my first term and was deliberated and discussed and it's been going on for the past year.

248
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:24,605
We've probably met.

249
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:32,069
Oh, I think between the committee right now we've met seven or six times on these proposed rules.

250
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:37,731
Prior to that, when Councillor Dela Russo and Camuso comprised the committee, I think we met another six times.

251
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,812
So there's been at least 12 public meetings on

252
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:49,770
the subject and topic of rules in the Memphis City Council rules to date, Mr. President, that I can recall since I've been on this council and this proposal is the fruit of that labor.

253
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:50,930
Thank you.

254
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,470
Welcome.

255
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,070
Good evening.

256
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,070
Please state your name and address.

257
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,791
My name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

258
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,131
I'm a member of the cyclist body.

259
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:07,093
You know, one of the things that I think is a concerning point is while the meeting might be held tomorrow night, it's not really being held where the public can actually see it and view it.

260
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,613
There are a lot of people who might like to come.

261
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:09,784
and just can't do it.

262
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:10,524
That's number one.

263
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:14,288
We don't have any public access, so that's another two points against us.

264
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:23,136
But more importantly, I think some of these proposed changes and discussions that take place stand to be corrected, go back to 2004 and then 2008.

265
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:32,225
And for them to be sitting in the committee for a long period of time such as that with no intent to either add or subtract to them or eliminate them,

266
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,602
In the being brought up now you know is of a question.

267
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:44,388
You have some concerns in here relative toward open public forums and public participation.

268
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:50,292
And if you read it the way it's being written unless the words are going to be changed someone's going to have to come.

269
00:21:51,467 --> 00:22:01,074
at six o'clock at night if they want to talk on the subject matter before the council, and then if they want to talk... Point of clarification, Mr. President, and this is why I'd rather not have this conversation now, because the paper still hasn't been presented.

270
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,916
It hasn't even been adopted by the council.

271
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,798
It's on the council floor, but it hasn't been adopted by the council.

272
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,719
It's still in subcommittee.

273
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,180
The subcommittee reported a paper out.

274
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,961
We're going to have a meeting on this tomorrow.

275
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:13,442
There are going to be lots of questions.

276
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,384
That's what the meeting tomorrow is for, Mr. President.

277
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,526
Right, and that's why we're going to discuss this all tomorrow.

278
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,187
But, Mr. President, with all due respect,

279
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:27,781
If this is the report that came out, an eight-page report, okay, and it's Councilor Longo-Curran and it's Councilor Moxley's alluded to, it would have been nice to have it highlighted.

280
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,542
It did take some time to go review it.

281
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,564
Then why not discuss this right now?

282
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,645
What's being, what's wrong with, we're talking about highlights.

283
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,026
That's all we're talking about.

284
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:43,548
And these are important points for people to maybe want to come tomorrow night and understand what's going on.

285
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:46,990
Mr. President, pursuant to the present Councilor, I'm going to clarify this.

286
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:54,600
This was reported out of subcommittee to the council with the paper that we came in our packets on Friday.

287
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:03,164
And then we've just called for the council meeting and announced it in the announcements that went out on Friday.

288
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:08,047
So the matter was reported out of subcommittee to the council floor.

289
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:08,667
The council

290
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:14,179
voted to send it to committee of the whole for vote some months ago, I believe.

291
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:23,303
And we have the committee meeting coming up, which will be held tomorrow, which is where we will begin the discussions of the matter.

292
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:27,125
But I believe, Mr. President, this was came out of committee in August.

293
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,546
This is now October.

294
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,247
So there was a few months lag in between.

295
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:35,429
And now you're asking your honorable body to review this in a matter of a few days.

296
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,210
Eight pages, very small, minuscule print.

297
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:39,877
But that's not the point.

298
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:43,180
The fact of the matter is this involves the taxpayers of this community.

299
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,442
Point of order, Mr. President.

300
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:44,942
This is their floor.

301
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,524
Point of order, Councilor Knight.

302
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:52,810
Pursuant to the council rules, a paper that's in subcommittee cannot hit the council floor until a committee of the whole has met.

303
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:53,851
Thank you.

304
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,013
And the committee of the whole has not met.

305
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,296
The committee of the whole is scheduled to meet tomorrow.

306
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,338
We're going to discuss this paper.

307
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,140
No, that's not true.

308
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,342
I don't think it's the Committee of the Whole.

309
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,527
It's been referred to a Committee of the Whole.

310
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:10,517
And since you're referring something to the Committee of the Whole, are you telling me that all seven of you?

311
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:18,849
are going to be afraid to discuss it before tomorrow night, to let the taxpayers know some of the issues that are on the agenda, Mr. President, that they might want to come.

312
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,409
It's not on our agenda tonight, sir.

313
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:22,209
It's on your agenda for tomorrow night.

314
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,190
It's a committee of the whole.

315
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,610
If it doesn't even get out of the committee of the whole, it doesn't become operational.

316
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,510
It doesn't even hit the floor.

317
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,991
It doesn't become operational.

318
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:29,691
It's often not.

319
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:30,891
All it is is a proposal.

320
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:34,392
That's the issue at point, Mr. President.

321
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:39,413
There are some very salient points here that operate against the taxpayer

322
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:44,454
coming to this podium when they would like to speak on a subject matter more than once.

323
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:48,575
Also suspension of the rules as an issue more than once.

324
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:51,236
And we can go through this if you want to, page by page.

325
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,496
That's not my intent.

326
00:24:52,776 --> 00:25:03,619
My intent is to talk about some highlights that directly affect any taxpayer in this audience to come up here and have an opportunity to speak like right now, which a new rules is promulgated.

327
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,980
They will not, if it's voted upon by this body, you won't be able to do it.

328
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,420
You have to send them- That's not true, Mr. President.

329
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:10,681
Thank you.

330
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,581
That's not true.

331
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:12,782
I understand.

332
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,825
We're getting ahead of ourselves here, counselors.

333
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:22,829
And so again, so I'd like you to wrap up your remarks now so we can move on.

334
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:31,074
Well, my remarks that I would like to wrap up, Mr. President, is the fact that on tomorrow night you're going to be discussing things that are going to restrict council.

335
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,836
I mean, citizen participation at this podium on more than one occasion.

336
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:35,917
It's done three deliberate

337
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:48,178
If the council so votes, there's going to be three opportunities where a citizens will not be able to do what's taking place here right now, coming up and speaking on something, whether it's on the agenda or suspension of the rules.

338
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,605
And then the craziness of saying that the craziness of saying that is not wrap it up, please.

339
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,327
And the craziness of saying.

340
00:25:55,847 --> 00:26:05,535
that if one counselor chastises another one, he has to be scolded by whoever the president is, and apologize, and he won't be able to speak until the apology takes place.

341
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,337
What are we talking about here?

342
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,558
This is child's play.

343
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:10,899
This is going to be discussed in the Committee of the Whole, sir.

344
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,801
Well, these are part of the rules that are being promulgated.

345
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:13,421
Thank you very much.

346
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,262
It's ridiculous.

347
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,144
And thank you for your presence here tonight.

348
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:18,045
Thank you very much.

349
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:19,947
Yes.

350
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:33,636
The one thing I was asked actually by phone and by email today was if I can get a resident a copy of what the proposed rule changes are.

351
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:39,818
And because I don't have it electronically, it's difficult for me to relay six pages of changes.

352
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:45,960
So is there any way we can get this electronically so we can get it out to our constituency?

353
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,562
I believe all our documents that we get are also posted on the city's webpage.

354
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,763
Is this posted on the city webpage?

355
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:58,967
No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:00,828
I'm talking about the meeting notice.

357
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:10,936
And it was also, it was attached to the meeting notes, but it was also attached to a previous council agenda when the subcommittee reported the matter out favorably and requested a committee of the whole, right?

358
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:15,640
And it's been attached to the council agenda, the council agenda once, maybe twice.

359
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,001
And it's been attached to the meeting notice now as well.

360
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:21,304
So I believe it is electronically available online.

361
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:22,275
Where?

362
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:25,456
The City of Medford website.

363
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:30,277
I couldn't find it, unless someone else is aware where it is.

364
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:33,938
If you could give me a heads up where it is, just so I can point people in the right direction.

365
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:49,843
When it was reported out of committee, and I don't have that particular date, onto the floor, that entire committee report was posted on the records that one of your councillors approved.

366
00:27:51,178 --> 00:28:01,325
So the entire thing is part of the committee report that are on the records, the entirety of that committee report.

367
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,688
Right, and where would you find those records on the city website?

368
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:05,848
On the council records.

369
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:08,290
So the council records and we don't know what?

370
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,392
I can't tell you what date that was.

371
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,189
Can you find out and send us an email just so I can point people?

372
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:18,390
I think it's the first meeting in September, Mr. President.

373
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,790
It's the first meeting in September.

374
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,131
September 20th, I think.

375
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:23,831
So if they're posted there, yeah.

376
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:36,716
But we can... We can... I believe I might... Do I have... I think I do have that on my files, my own files.

377
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,637
You know, the committee report itself, yeah.

378
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:40,717
Thank you.

379
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:45,844
Madam Vice President.

380
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:58,512
I'm just going to respectfully ask that before we meet on this, and it's only going to, I truly appreciate the amount of time spent, but the committee members and I agree that rules need to be reviewed.

381
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:04,435
But with such a controversial issue at this point, I mean, this came out on Friday and we've.

382
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:05,636
It didn't come out.

383
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:10,479
Well, we got we got these proposed changes in our packet on Friday.

384
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,380
We received them and we received it in the summer.

385
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,780
The public didn't know about it.

386
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,421
I didn't read it until this weekend.

387
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:20,925
And I can't tell the public there are five changes versus 20 changes.

388
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:29,550
And for us not to be able to highlight the changes to the public and to even ourselves, I just think that's something that needs to be done before we sit and meet on it.

389
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,472
Because if we're bombarded with, I don't know how many changes there are.

390
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:36,635
If there are 25 changes, I mean, that's going to be a lot to go over tomorrow night.

391
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:42,399
And I know you need a majority vote, but it might be only one or two that are hesitant and have concerns.

392
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:46,716
continue as concerns and I just think it's a little fast to push it.

393
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:53,902
You know expedited when we have you know we do have the public kind of concerned about it.

394
00:29:55,303 --> 00:30:01,168
Tonight if you want to clarify that I do believe the meeting is a public meeting open to the public tomorrow.

395
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:03,871
It is anybody that has a concern is more than welcome to come.

396
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:06,713
They'll have an opportunity to be heard at that meeting Mr. President.

397
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,659
Like I said, I don't think it's very difficult.

398
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,941
When the paper was first reported out, I believe I explained to the council is because it is a lengthy document.

399
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:19,983
If you look at it and you'll see article 1.1, the swearing in and the oath of office, and then there's a number right next to that.

400
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:23,845
That reflects the rule that's in the current rules that are adopted.

401
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:28,427
And I made that point soundly clear when the paper was reported out of committee.

402
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:34,449
Now, the paper was reported out of committee some four, five, six weeks ago on this council floor.

403
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:36,090
Nobody's looked at it since then.

404
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,790
That's not my problem.

405
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:38,208
I'm sorry about that.

406
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:49,515
If they haven't looked at it, Mr. President, but this committee met for three and a half years on this topic, and we're ready to move forward on the matter and to present it to the council as presented to the committee of the whole meeting.

407
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:57,961
In the interim, in the interim, I'd be happy to work towards putting a document like that together, but I don't feel as though it's something that should hold up the progress of the committee.

408
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:00,083
Thank you.

409
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:02,925
Just a quick point of clarification.

410
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,746
It's not on the city's website.

411
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:17,379
And for the folks who have found out today, it was a citizen taxpayer who put it on a Facebook page, and that's how people became aware of it, because they couldn't get the gut of what this whole thing was about on the city's webpage.

412
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,820
Thank you, sir.

413
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,062
Good evening.

414
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:23,602
Welcome.

415
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:25,243
Please state your name and address for the record.

416
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:26,164
Hi.

417
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,604
Betty Lowe, 34 Gibson Street.

418
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,525
This is only my second time approaching the council.

419
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:40,850
The first time was a couple of months ago, earlier this year, when I came up to speak about the proposed development at 61 Locust Street.

420
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,991
And I've had a chance to review these rules.

421
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:55,838
Again, it was through, not the city's website, but through a concerned citizen on Facebook posting this document, the meeting report from August 1st.

422
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:12,648
I've had a chance to review it and I've come to the conclusion that if these rules had been in place when I first came up, when I first approached the council, I would not have been able to speak on that topic about 61 Lucas Street in my position of the development.

423
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:27,392
Rule 10 in particular about open forum and public participation in conjunction with rule 4.2, papers requiring action,

424
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:43,476
It would seem to require any citizen who would approach the council during public participation to have to file an application with the city clerk the week prior, either Friday or Thursday, depending on whether there's a holiday.

425
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,377
By what time is it?

426
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,820
By 9.30 a.m., the Friday preceding the city council meeting.

427
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:18,143
And the public participation period seems to be limited just to whatever's on the council's agenda for that week, which... If you look at it, there's also an open forum section, and an open forum section was established by way of the subcommittee to allow for residents of the general public to come up and speak before the council on items that do not appear on the agenda.

428
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:26,195
and anyone wishing to do so may do so by application in accord with rule 4.0, which is the way that everybody currently applies to speak before the city council.

429
00:33:26,515 --> 00:33:34,240
And if you read the sentence further, it would say, or with the city messenger on the evening of the meeting prior to that portion of the meeting.

430
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,981
And we're going to have the opportunity.

431
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:48,697
in the meeting that was called for this purpose to begin the public deliberation of the proposed rules changes in the context of the meeting called for tomorrow night.

432
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:52,100
I have two questions pertaining to Councillor Knight's points.

433
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:56,864
The first one would be, with regards to the open forum, is that going to be televised?

434
00:33:56,924 --> 00:34:00,027
And if you would, direct them towards the chair according to the rules that exist.

435
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:00,748
Okay.

436
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:01,328
Thank you.

437
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:09,265
I would just like to know if that open forum that's supposed to be taking place at 6 p.m.

438
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:10,585
prior to the 7 p.m.

439
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,486
roll call, prior to the 7 p.m.

440
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:16,507
start of the city council meeting, will that part be televised?

441
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,467
Will that portion be televised?

442
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:20,007
Subject to the will of the council.

443
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,108
Okay.

444
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:28,850
And the other part I wanted to ask about was why is it that each member of the public gets to speak just once at each

445
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:41,660
opportunity for members of the public to participate at the open forum before the meeting, at the public participation time slot, and then at the open forum after adjournment.

446
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:56,972
These rules would seem pretty onerous between the speaking once at each opportunity for public participation and with having to

447
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:05,905
by an application with the city clerk the week prior to speak at the public participation part of the city council meeting.

448
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:23,032
These would seem to fly in the face of the stated goal where the committee has drafted the proposal below that will reorganize the existing rules into a more coherent and fluid structure, streamline the meeting structure, increase opportunities for public participation, and adopt best practices.

449
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:28,855
It would seem to me to really put quite a burden on the public to figure out the rules

450
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:37,026
om pertaining to approaching the council during the public participation part of the meeting and being able to share our thoughts and opinions.

451
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:43,831
In response to that, Mr. President, the parliamentarian for the council is the president of the council at that period, at that point of time.

452
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:47,173
He's in charge of enforcing and implementing and applying the rules.

453
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:55,039
Presently, under the current rules that are in place right now, I believe they say that a citizen would be allowed to talk no more than three times for no more than 10 minutes.

454
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,842
So this allows a person to speak still three times,

455
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:07,382
for up to three minutes, which actually increases participation, because it gives you a full 30 minutes to speak, as opposed to three times in 10 minutes, it gives you 30 minutes to speak.

456
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:09,082
Thank you.

457
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:12,443
10 minutes on any item that's on the agenda and 20 minutes on any items that aren't.

458
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:19,665
And again, we'll continue, we'll begin our deliberation on this tomorrow night in the Committee of the Whole.

459
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:26,927
Whether or not the rules are adhered to, the current rules are adhered to in the 310 rules and story, Mr. President.

460
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,127
Counselor Max.

461
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:34,215
I think the woman at the podium raises some great questions, and tomorrow will be a very fruitful meeting.

462
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:46,225
However, I do agree that although Councilor Knight mentioned that this will allow ample opportunity to speak, the way I understand it is, other than the 6 p.m.

463
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,948
prior meeting, that you would have to speak on something that's offered by the Council.

464
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,352
And in the past, we have allowed residents to get up and speak on any issue.

465
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,543
And that's always been the uniqueness of our body.

466
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:04,986
Unlike the state legislature, unlike Congress, we invite public participation.

467
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:09,450
And my discussion will be made tomorrow night, but I agree.

468
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:17,936
I will not support anything that narrows any type of public participation or makes residents jump through hurdles in order to speak before this body, Mr. President.

469
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:18,916
Thank you, Counselor.

470
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,238
Yes, to Counselor Marks.

471
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,660
If you just want to... Yes.

472
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:54,110
Something that's said at the podium during the public participation portion that warrants further investigation.

473
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,570
That's great.

474
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,850
We've heard it from a citizen.

475
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,531
Now we have a week to investigate it.

476
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,151
We have a week to investigate it.

477
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:00,452
We're going to go and look at this for a week.

478
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:01,632
Okay, there's an issue over here.

479
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:02,873
Let's make some phone calls.

480
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:03,573
Let's investigate it.

481
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:04,513
Let's see what's going on.

482
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:06,514
Okay, this might be worthy of a resolution.

483
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:08,795
You file a resolution, then next week the resolution's on.

484
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:11,116
Thank you, Counselor.

485
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:14,757
Counselor, we have a citizen at the podium.

486
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,473
Can I speak once or twice?

487
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,053
Thank you.

488
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,815
It'd be nice to get equal time.

489
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:26,777
It's great to offer a public session prior to our meeting.

490
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:28,998
We're opening it up at 6 o'clock.

491
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,299
We assume that people don't have families.

492
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,840
We assume that people aren't working.

493
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,282
We're taking a lot of assumptions here that a 6 p.m.

494
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:45,346
meeting, first of all, that's not televised, and that, secondly, just say 20 people do want to come up and speak under this open meeting.

495
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,900
The first person comes up and speaks on sidewalks.

496
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,421
The second person comes up and speaks on the roof.

497
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,761
The third person comes up and speaks on sidewalks.

498
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:57,782
How are we going to keep a quorum, Mr. President?

499
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,703
Because I'm not sure what order things would be taken if people are here.

500
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:06,765
Are they just going to rattle off what their concerns are and fall on deaf ears?

501
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:12,126
I mean, to me, what better to have someone from the public speak while the debate is happening?

502
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:18,035
I don't want someone speaking two hours before a debate, because that's no good.

503
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:21,477
I want to hear what they have to say during the debate, Mr. President.

504
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:28,161
And I think we all should be eager to listen to residents that are taking the time to come up here out of their schedule.

505
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:34,585
We always say, I wish more residents would come up, and now we're making it more difficult for residents to come up and speak before this body.

506
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:38,048
So that's the only point I want to make, and I appreciate you allowing me.

507
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,389
Thank you very much, Counselor, and we're going to

508
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,562
Wrap this all up, and we're going to discuss this tomorrow night.

509
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,562
Madam Vice President.

510
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:47,284
I just want to agree with Councilor Marks.

511
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:51,287
It almost makes me antsy not to know the exact proposed changes.

512
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:56,150
I can't imagine not allowing the public to speak during every single issue.

513
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,672
I mean, that's sometimes how we shape our votes.

514
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,554
I mean, we have 100 people for the Locust Street development.

515
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:05,736
We knew what the people wanted and what they were upset about.

516
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:09,739
If we didn't have something like that, I think it would be just a

517
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,322
terrible way to do business.

518
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:18,026
I think a lot of the ways we do it now is the right way, and letting the people speak and have their First Amendment right.

519
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:25,951
And people respect that, and people are scared enough to come in front of the podium, never mind having to be barred, you know, follow all these rules.

520
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,753
So I have grave concern about that myself.

521
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:33,276
Well, why don't we wrap this all up now, since we're really not discussing this matter tonight.

522
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:38,720
And we're going to welcome the citizen to the podium who's going to share his name and address for the record.

523
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,921
Joe Villione.

524
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:43,464
59 Garfield, where a tree was saved today from destruction.

525
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,005
Thank you very much.

526
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,885
I'll be very brief.

527
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,987
I have a date with Dr. Strange tomorrow night, so I can't attend.

528
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:50,567
I'm sure you're happy about that.

529
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:54,769
But if someone would like to borrow my camera, I think we need to get this on videotape.

530
00:40:55,149 --> 00:41:00,091
And I would just like to recite a paragraph said here in this very council chambers in 2008.

531
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:07,114
The one sentiment that I have heard that I take great exception to is that the city is trying to limit speech.

532
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:09,995
The notion the city would censor or squelch

533
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,202
free speech is baseless and a city solicitor.

534
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:19,386
I would find any such effort repugnant according to the movie transporter city solicitor Romney.

535
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:20,467
Now's your big chance.

536
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:21,587
Thank you very much.

537
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:23,149
Thank you.

538
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:37,178
And counselors, uh, I think the motion, what was your motion, madam vice president, that we have a colorized version of this, that the, on the motion that the changes be highlighted all those in favor.

539
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:53,430
And an electronic copy is already available, but we'll add that as well, amend the motion.

540
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,651
On that motion, all those in favor?

541
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:56,611
All those opposed?

542
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,572
Motion carries.

543
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:01,114
While we're on to suspension, a couple papers in the hands of the clerk.

544
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:08,538
Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be resolved that the City Council discuss the bus stop.

545
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,899
On High and Main Street, Councilor Scarpelli.

546
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:12,639
Where are you?

547
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:13,260
Hold on.

548
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,320
There you are.

549
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,841
Thank you.

550
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:16,781
I'm sorry.

551
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,801
Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:36,068
If I can, I know that a few weeks back we took a vote, we put a request into the Department of Transportation and we made a recommendation and requested that we eliminate the bus stop in front of High and

553
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:40,649
Main Street until the construction on that side is complete.

554
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,952
And from what I gather, I believe that the bus stop is still active.

555
00:42:47,072 --> 00:43:01,300
So if the city clerk can reach out to the Department of Transportation and I know Dan Fielding worked directly with him to make them aware of our decision and go from there.

556
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,461
On that motion, all those in favor?

557
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:04,522
All those opposed?

558
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:14,357
Offered by Council Mark, be it resolved that the administration update the council on the poor lighting in Medford Square and surrounding squares.

559
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:15,358
Council Marks.

560
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,479
Thank you, Mr. President.

561
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:35,134
This is not new to the council, but I've received a number of complaints from not only area residents, but business owners that now that the daylight savings time is here, that at 5.30 it gets quite dark and square is pitch dark.

562
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,049
And it's becoming a problem, Mr. President.

563
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:54,772
I know roughly about 12 to 14 months ago, many of the lenses were changed within the lighting fixtures with the hopes that that would improve some of the lighting in the square that failed to yield any benefit, in my opinion.

564
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:03,274
And there is a pilot program, if anyone's interested, that's being done in front of the old theater, Medford Theater on Salem Street.

565
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:08,138
You'll notice that they enhanced the lights and two of the street lights.

566
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,100
And in my opinion, they give off great light.

567
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:29,714
And I'm hoping that we really don't need to spend much more time on this in the interest of public safety, in particular, when we have trick or treat coming in our square very shortly and in Haines Square and West Method, that these lights be changed over immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

568
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,711
There are many sections in the square.

569
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:37,676
If business owners didn't leave their lights on overnight, it would be ultimately dark in the square.

570
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:41,679
And that's not good for business, and it's not good for public safety.

571
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:49,445
So I would ask for a response back from the mayor regarding when this new lighting is going to take place.

572
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:59,293
So that if you could just clarify that, Mr. Clerk, that the new lighting solutions that were implemented by the Office of Energy and

573
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:06,639
environment be implemented immediately in the interest of public safety.

574
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,640
Right.

575
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,400
Councilor Caviello.

576
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,141
Thank you, Mr. President.

577
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:17,506
Mr. President, not only in the squares, but all the streetlights that we have in our city, they're those orange low voltage lights.

578
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:25,931
I think it's time that we change over to the LED lights like many other cities have on all our main streets, at least.

579
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,193
That orange light isn't cutting it anymore.

580
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:33,070
But I'd say the squares, I've been to many of the squares in other cities and towns.

581
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,112
They all have bright LED lighting on all their decorative posts.

582
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:40,253
So I think those should be done immediately, and I agree with Councilor Marks.

583
00:45:40,853 --> 00:45:41,693
Halloween's coming up.

584
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:42,614
There's going to be kids out.

585
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:48,496
And usually there's 8,000 to 10,000 kids that come out next week.

586
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:51,938
So if we can get that done quickly, it would be a great help.

587
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:00,104
So, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caviello and amended by Councilor Caviello, Councilor Falco.

588
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:01,285
Thank you, Mr. President.

589
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:09,349
I just want to mention really quick, since the issue of public safety came up, that the next Memphis Police Community Meeting is coming up.

590
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,170
It's at St.

591
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,151
Francis Parish Center at 7 p.m.

592
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,372
on November 2nd.

593
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:15,893
Everyone is welcome.

594
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:19,935
No matter what neighborhood you live in throughout the city, everyone is welcome to attend.

595
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,552
San Francis Parish Center, 7 p.m.

596
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:23,832
on November 2nd.

597
00:46:24,812 --> 00:46:26,893
December 7th, Andrews Middle School.

598
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:29,954
January 4th, South Medford Fire Station.

599
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:39,677
And we just added a date of February 1st is going to be, I think, at Breed Hall at Patuxent University.

600
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:41,958
So we added another date to the list.

601
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:46,379
But I just wanted to, public safety came up, and this is,

602
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:50,845
a great venue to talk about public safety issues and questions that they may have the police station.

603
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:56,388
So that is a list of updating, updated times and locations for those meetings.

604
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:57,669
Well, thank you very much.

605
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:01,171
And on that motion as amended, all those in favor, all those opposed.

606
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:10,637
Our last piece of suspension offered by council marks be resolved that the Riverside Avenue be discussed in the interest of public safety council marks.

607
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:16,120
Mr. Press, I typically don't like to bring up one street or another because I know

608
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,539
Many of our streets are in deplorable condition.

609
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:31,705
But I must say Riverside have, in particular at the corner of Riverside and Park and going down Riverside towards the Felsway, there are a number of good-sized dips in the road.

610
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:33,807
And they're unavoidable.

611
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,268
You can't swerve to one side or another.

612
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:39,350
And they really cause a public safety concern.

613
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,973
And we've asked, I know I've put it on and other members of this council have put it on a number of times.

614
00:47:45,677 --> 00:48:00,149
Some of it's due to work done by the utilities, but really the city needs to step up, find who dug these particular trenches, and get them to repave the road in the condition it previously was.

615
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:08,475
And I would ask once again, I know we received 400,000 in safe streets grant from the state.

616
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:12,879
However, I don't think we can ignore the existing streets.

617
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:14,260
It's great we have seven projects.

618
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,820
that are coming to fruition, but we can't ignore the existing streets.

619
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:22,883
So I would ask that Riverside Ave be looked at again by our engineer.

620
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:30,327
And if I remember correctly, Councilman, we were discussing that whole interchange down by the Felsway and the Plaza with the new restaurants that went in.

621
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:44,456
I think it was our assumption, if not our explicit request, that that area be repaved before the grid, which they did paint in finally, was put into place to sort of

622
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:55,853
allow for that grid to stand out, so there'd be less gridlock, and to smooth out that traffic area to make things work more efficiently.

623
00:48:55,893 --> 00:49:04,498
And unfortunately, it didn't happen, and that grid was painted on what one could only describe as some sort of moon surface.

624
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:14,444
So on the motion of Councilor Marks, we invite the representative of East Medford to state his name and address for the record.

625
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:16,068
Thank you, Council President.

626
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:26,357
I want to thank Council March for bringing up a safety concern on the streets at Park and Riverside Avenue.

627
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:40,869
I've been meaning to say this for many decades, and I've heard many people express concerns about the safety issue when they're driving a vehicle, also pedestrians, at that exact location.

628
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,630
If you're on Park Street,

629
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:56,293
coming from the north side, from the old Swan School, and you're entering onto Riverside Ave, you have to go left or right, or straight.

630
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:08,102
However, there is, it seems like it's not a fair obstruction, that fence on the left-hand side, it's a white picket fence,

631
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:19,899
Even if you're sitting in a high-rise vehicle versus, forget about it, if you're driving a Corvette, of course, it's hard to see over that fence.

632
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm sure everyone here is totally aware of the exact location.

633
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:39,905
There's been numerous accidents without me checking the internet from the insurance companies, and therefore, if we could sort of, like, do a surgical eminent domain on the

634
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:50,864
the top 18 inches, whatever it takes on the fence, I would gladly be out of my pocket to see less accidents, less injuries.

635
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,624
Just let me know the number, I'll cut you the check.

636
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:54,965
Thank you.

637
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:57,525
So the motion of approval by Councilor Marks.

638
00:50:58,666 --> 00:50:59,086
Councilor?

639
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:07,588
Just if I could, actually the next street down and the street escapes, the name escapes me.

640
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:10,369
There was some bushes that were eight to 10 feet tall.

641
00:51:11,597 --> 00:51:18,899
En a building department went out and kindly asked the owners to cut them down because it was blocking the view of people trying to get onto Riverside.

642
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,381
And the residents were kind enough to get out there immediately and trim the bushes down.

643
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:29,702
I've never had something of a fixed structure like a fence, but I think it's something we should ask the building department.

644
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,363
You don't happen to have a number, do you?

645
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:35,184
Of the home that you're talking about?

646
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,905
Yeah.

647
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:53,155
So if we can get that, I think we should offer for the building apartment, maybe just to go out there, take a look at the area, because that is a tough area to pull out of, let alone with an obstruction in the way, so.

648
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:55,317
On that motion as amended.

649
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,419
Can you provide that to the city clerk, the address?

650
00:51:58,019 --> 00:51:58,399
Yes, sir.

651
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,060
Thank you.

652
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,461
All those in favor?

653
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:01,642
All those opposed?

654
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:03,143
The motion carries.

655
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,285
The records.

656
00:52:10,146 --> 00:52:13,868
of the last meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

657
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:18,271
I review the records, Mr. President, and find them to be in order and move approval.

658
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:22,353
On the motion for approval of the previous meeting's records by Councilor Marks.

659
00:52:22,393 --> 00:52:23,174
All those in favor?

660
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:24,635
All those opposed?

661
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:25,415
Motion carries.

662
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:29,097
And on the motion for adjournment by Vice President Longo Kern.

663
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:30,218
All those in favor?

664
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:31,459
All those opposed?

665
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,180
Meeting is adjourned.
