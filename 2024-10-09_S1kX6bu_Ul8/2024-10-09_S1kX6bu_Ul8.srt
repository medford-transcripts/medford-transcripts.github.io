1
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:23,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, welcome.

2
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,302
[SPEAKER_01]: We had over 60 people signed up.

3
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:30,472
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 30 of us here now, so really appreciate all the turnout.

4
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:52,635
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it's 6.35.

5
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:54,336
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be respectful of people's time.

6
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our Invest in Medford Zoom Community Forum.

7
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,841
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be here tonight until about eight o'clock.

8
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:20,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be here with School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham and School Committee Secretary Paul Rousseau to talk about the Invest in Medford campaign and questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot here in Medford.

9
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:24,788
[SPEAKER_01]: to invest in our schools, our streets, and a new fire headquarters.

10
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:37,313
[SPEAKER_01]: The format we're gonna be using today is we are going to be starting off with about 10 to 15 minutes of introduction, short presentation from myself and Jenny and Paul.

11
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:41,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll be taking questions for about an hour.

12
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,736
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an app up called Slido.

13
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,818
[SPEAKER_01]: If folks have a difficulty accessing it, let me know, but it should allow you to

14
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,317
[SPEAKER_01]: ask a question right in here.

15
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,398
[SPEAKER_01]: You should also be able to upvote questions that you like.

16
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:59,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously ask that folks, you know, use the tool responsibly.

17
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,721
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had open registration.

18
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:02,862
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a public meeting.

19
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like most everyone here is using their name.

20
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:10,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, just want to do that digital security ask of everyone here.

21
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:15,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, we'll take about 10 to 15 minutes to wrap up.

22
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,188
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:29,929
[SPEAKER_01]: like a question didn't get asked, or if you wanna follow up with us after, you can send us an email at investinmedford.gmail.com and we will do our best to answer further.

24
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure all of, many of us are around to talk and answer questions.

25
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:44,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I will turn things over to Jenny to introduce herself and then Paul, and then we'll go from there.

26
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:48,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.

27
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:49,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Jenny Graham.

28
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the vice chair of the school committee.

29
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,780
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my fifth year on the school committee.

30
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started January 2020.

31
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:12,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am really excited about this very historic opportunity for us to do what we've been talking about for five years as we have navigated

32
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible budgets for our schools and our kids and really to say to the community that we are asking the community to tell us that they value education as much as that they have told us for the last 5 budget season.

33
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super excited about this.

34
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:36,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of questions out out in the community.

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy that you're all here and hopefully we can answer some of those most pressing questions as we go tonight.

36
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will turn it over to Paul.

37
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:50,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.

38
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Paul Rousseau.

39
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the school committee as well.

40
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:58,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in office since January of 2018.

41
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:08,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not going to repeat everything that was just said, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to have a budget where we are not just cutting.

42
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:13,465
[SPEAKER_00]: We have literally just cut budgets forever, at least for 40 years.

43
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:18,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number goes up, but that doesn't mean it is actually going up because

44
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:19,508
[SPEAKER_00]: inflation.

45
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:36,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to perhaps having a budget season where we can talk about doing more with more and it's exciting and I look forward to hearing the questions and trying to answer them as best I can.

46
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:37,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

47
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Paul and Jenny.

48
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:53,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, we've had a few more people come in, and as I noted before, we're gonna be taking questions right after our presentations and our introductions.

49
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,172
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an app called Slido.

50
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:57,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just sent an invitation to everybody.

51
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:05,778
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask questions using this app and upvote questions, and we will take them as they go.

52
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:12,022
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see the same question multiple times, we're probably only gonna answer it once, but really encourage folks to start

53
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:18,831
[SPEAKER_01]: putting forward their questions using the tool so that we can start to answer them.

54
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:27,416
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to start doing that now, and hopefully we'll have a good lineup of questions to be answered.

55
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:32,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, I just wanna talk a little bit more about how we got here.

56
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:41,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Jenny noted, many of us in the city and many of us who run for office

57
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:51,634
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen the impact of underfunding and austerity budgets and cost growing up faster than revenues going up and the impact that's had on our city.

58
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:55,397
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that our streets are not in the condition we want them to be in.

59
00:05:55,738 --> 00:06:01,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we have firefighters at the headquarters that is still appetited and far past the end of its useful life.

60
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:09,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, as Jenny and Paul have noted, we have a school system that really has faced a lot of challenges when it comes to budgets, hiring staff,

61
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,351
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining programs, maintaining buildings, things that we see every day.

62
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:24,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And two years ago in 2022, we had the fiscal 23 budget.

63
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:32,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if folks were paying attention at the time, they noted that it was a very contentious budget season.

64
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:38,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that came out of that was really a clear picture for the first time in a long time of the structural deficit in the city budget.

65
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:53,477
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of one-time funds to pay for ongoing expenses, the soon-to-be-expiring federal funds that even two years ago were on our radar as expiring that we were using to pay to keep our schools and our city moving.

66
00:06:54,818 --> 00:07:07,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And where we are after that budget season, the city council, Councilor Collins and I tried to work with the mayor to see if we could get towards looking at

67
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,413
[SPEAKER_01]: an override to address that structural deficit.

68
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:25,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't able to reach an agreement, but the following budget season, after a lot of negotiation, we were able to work with the mayor to form, to reach an agreement, to pass a budget ordinance and to form a financial task force.

69
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:37,895
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee through its budget process and the council through this budget ordinance have really moved to a more transparent process that's more engaging of the public when we talk about creating the budget and understanding the challenges that we have.

70
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:43,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And the piece I want to focus on just for a minute is the financial task force.

71
00:07:43,357 --> 00:08:04,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So the task force was announced in June of 2023, and consisting of the mayor, who is also the chair of the school committee, the council president, the council vice president, the school committee vice chair, and the chief of staff, also being supported by the staff in both our city departments

72
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,473
[SPEAKER_01]: finance, et cetera, assessing, and our school finance and operations team.

73
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So that task force was announced in June 2023.

74
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:32,991
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to meet, we put out an initial press release and public statement in September of 2023, talking about how we were going to continue to meet with the goal of coming back to folks before the end of the fiscal year with a proposal that addressed the major financial challenges facing the community.

75
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:43,047
[SPEAKER_01]: In March of 2023, sorry, 2024, we kind of put out, we announced a framework for that approach.

76
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:54,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in June, we released the detail of that plan, which are the three ballot questions that are now on the ballot for November 5th for the consideration of the voters of the city of Medford.

77
00:08:55,473 --> 00:09:01,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ballot questions are question six, what should be a debt exclusion to fund the construction of a new fire headquarters?

78
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:03,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Question seven,

79
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:16,846
[SPEAKER_01]: which addresses the school system structural deficit and also the fact that right now we don't have anyone in our DPW who is dedicated to fixing our streets and sidewalks.

80
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,668
[SPEAKER_01]: We would bring back a dedicated street and sidewalk repair crew for the first time in many years.

81
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:26,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And question eight is about the future of our schools and then really investing and expanding our schools.

82
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So the $4 million override to invest

83
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:44,191
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly into our schools, into our educators, into programming, into making our schools what we want to be, and addressing what Jenny and Paul noted, all of the things that people want to see our schools do.

84
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:46,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, will we be able to do every single one of them with $4 million?

85
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:54,915
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it's the first time we're going to be able to have a serious conversation about what transformational investment would look like in our schools.

86
00:09:55,056 --> 00:10:00,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total of those items, the debt exclusion pays for a $30 million bond,

87
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:04,035
[SPEAKER_01]: The estimated cost of that is about $2 million per year.

88
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: That's question six.

89
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Question seven is $3.5 million per year.

90
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And question eight is $4 million per year.

91
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:17,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Those amounts would be part of the property tax levy.

92
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:23,101
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be paid by residents and businesses, and it would essentially affect the tax rate.

93
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:29,022
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax rate would be about 60 cents per, 60 cents higher.

94
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,323
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would go up from about 8.5

95
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:38,072
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars per $1,000 in assessed value to about $9.1 per $1,000 in assessed value.

96
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:44,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And the average impact on the average single family home is about $37 per month.

97
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:49,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the summary of what we're talking about and how we got here.

98
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:54,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the financial task force really does believe

99
00:10:55,276 --> 00:11:07,320
[SPEAKER_01]: that and has stated very clearly that this is a path forward that really does bring us to some financial stability and also the ability to make significant investments in our public schools.

100
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:15,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I will end my comments and we can move into the question and answer period.

101
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:23,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I see we do have a few questions here and I really do hope folks will submit some questions in the Q and A so that we can

102
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,922
[SPEAKER_01]: answer any concerns and provide information to the community about the questions they see around the override.

103
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just putting out an invite once again for folks to submit their questions.

104
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:48,387
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question is, can you speak to cuts that will likely be made in our schools should the overrides not pass?

105
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:49,427
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Melanie.

106
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,646
[SPEAKER_01]: H and we have five likes on that.

107
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go to Paul or Jenny to talk about that.

108
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:03,457
[SPEAKER_03]: start and Paul, please add to.

109
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a couple of things that we we know for sure.

110
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:08,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

111
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:20,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that in last year's budget, we relied on one time funds to prevent some of the cuts that were articulated.

112
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were following the last budget season, the

113
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:45,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The CFO and our budget, our now budget director, Gerry McCue, was directed to make the budget lean because we knew that we were coming off of our ability to use ESSER funds, which are COVID-related relief funds.

114
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:51,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And we knew that the budget was going to be tight.

115
00:12:53,366 --> 00:13:02,714
[SPEAKER_03]: He laid out a series of cuts, essentially, that were very unpopular and unfavorable.

116
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:14,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And they included things like two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists who work with our students.

117
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,803
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 nurse, 4 teachers, 4 department heads.

118
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:25,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So those positions alone are worth like 1.1 million dollars.

119
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: He laid out obviously more than 1.1 million dollars worth of cuts.

120
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,292
[SPEAKER_03]: He laid out, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.3 million dollars.

121
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:58,459
[SPEAKER_03]: In cuts, some of the cuts actually happened, but thanks to the finance task force working with me and the mayor, we were able to get agreement that we would use some 1 time funds from the city in order to make the whole, like, not so bad.

122
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the, the cuts that Jerry laid out in terms of what the.

123
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibilities were were sort of deep and devastating.

124
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:20,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was also articulating at that time that there was still $2.7 million of a gap between what the city thought the budget could possibly be and what.

125
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,696
[SPEAKER_03]: we felt like was needed to avoid cuts.

126
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:32,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the positions that he talked about lost 2.7 million more dollars were on the table in cuts.

127
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:45,348
[SPEAKER_03]: We saved many of those cuts from based on some of the one-time funds and really at the expense of many other city departments who had to go back and slim back their budget.

128
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a recurring theme in Medford where

129
00:14:49,190 --> 00:15:13,348
[SPEAKER_03]: the school costs are accelerating I would say more quickly than sort of anywhere else in the city's budget and what I've seen in the last five years is that when something more than two and a half percent is able to come to the schools it's at the expense of another city department and there's there's just no more for the city departments to cut or give it's why the DPW

130
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Is struggling to handle our roads and sidewalks.

131
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:22,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why we almost didn't have Saturdays in the library.

132
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:27,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, all of those things come because there's just the pie is only so big for the city.

133
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:31,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's only so much that we can do to direct money to the schools.

134
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is happening at the expense of all the other things that we would like to see in the city.

135
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year we were able to plug part of the whole with one-time funds.

136
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:52,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about $1.75 million in one-time funds and additional money that came at the expense of other city departments.

137
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we know for sure is that that $1.75 million is not available next year.

138
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sort of very definition of one-time funds.

139
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that there will be cuts.

140
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,111
[SPEAKER_03]: If these overrides don't pass, because there, there just is.

141
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:15,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere else to to collect that money from so we certainly.

142
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Could imagine that we might get a 2 and a half percent increase.

143
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, 90, something percent of our costs are fixed either by contract or by things like our utilities.

144
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,616
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all accelerating faster than 2 and a half percent.

145
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just no, there's no wiggle room there.

146
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:37,698
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's no room to say, but we want to keep these extra people.

147
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that that will happen.

148
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What exact positions are very much that's sort of the ugly question we will grapple with if we.

149
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, don't see these override succeed and so is it.

150
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,465
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 nurse or 2 nurses is it.

151
00:16:53,485 --> 00:17:00,467
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 behavior specialists or 3, all of those would be questions we'd be sort of asking and answering in the next budget.

152
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:03,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we also, we know that we.

153
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:15,078
[SPEAKER_03]: are not doing things today that we have to do, like maintain our technology, whether that's Chromebooks, laptops for teachers, any of those things.

154
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:16,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we're not doing that today.

155
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we don't do that next year, we will no longer have technology for students.

156
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:27,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we look to what we need to educate students,

157
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:37,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology is on the must have list so that means that that money that half 1Million dollars that we need for technology next year would have to come from somewhere else.

158
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So there.

159
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: In our budget, 80 ish, 85% of our costs are.

160
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:51,262
[SPEAKER_03]: For staff, so when you talk about cutting the budget, there's just very little that is.

161
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: discretionary in any way, unless you consider staff discretionary.

162
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

163
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:04,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But we would be looking at some very, very difficult decisions were it to come to that.

164
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've done that before.

165
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:11,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's ugly each and every time we do it.

166
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:20,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are the only city department since I have started that has said goodbye to humans who work in our department.

167
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So other departments have seen cuts.

168
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:31,119
[SPEAKER_03]: They've seen sort of flatlining, but we have said goodbye to people who work in our district in service to our kids.

169
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And there would be more of that before there would be less if the overpits don't pass.

170
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:45,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add to Jenny's rosy outlook is that the

171
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:58,960
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, as Jenny mentioned, in 2020 when the budgets were level funded, we said goodbye to 40 something people.

172
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:05,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people hear level funded, they often think of their own budgets.

173
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna just buy anything else.

174
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:15,806
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike your own budgets, we have contracts with our union partners and those are still legally enforced.

175
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:16,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

176
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:22,129
[SPEAKER_00]: When we negotiate with our unions, it's a negotiation.

177
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,952
[SPEAKER_00]: We're partners with them, and we often talk about the annual increase, the cost of living increase of 2.5%, 2%, 3%, whatever it is.

178
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:38,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a misconception that that is actually how much the increase cost for that.

179
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:42,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just use the teachers as an example because I brought that contract up.

180
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:48,166
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give the teachers a two and a half percent increase, give, we negotiate, it's not a gift.

181
00:19:51,158 --> 00:20:03,560
[SPEAKER_00]: They, each of, except for the teachers that have been here the longest, most teachers are moving up a step, meaning they are a year more of service, and they're getting much more than 2.5 or 3%.

182
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:16,762
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just did the calculations, and in 2023, a Step 10 teacher, so a teacher who had been here for 10 years, that same teacher, one year later, in 2024, would make between 12.9 and 13% more.

183
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,217
[SPEAKER_00]: That is.

184
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:27,149
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing weird, that's normal in districts across the, in any contract.

185
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:31,331
[SPEAKER_00]: You have another year of service, you get paid more.

186
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:36,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the total for that one staff member, 12 or 13%.

187
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:39,016
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the 2.5% we negotiated with the union.

188
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:48,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So Prop 2.5 really is a problem because even if we stuck to 2.5%, nobody could ever get more than 2.5% in our negotiations.

189
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:58,927
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's fine, but everybody's, other than the people who've been here the longest who kind of max out, everybody else is getting more than that.

190
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the problem.

191
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem, it's the way it's supposed to work, but it's also a sort of a misconception.

192
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:18,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And as for what else would be cut, you know, the 2.2 million or whatever the number was that we didn't even,

193
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,322
[SPEAKER_00]: get to discuss in the spring.

194
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:25,505
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a whole elementary school of staff.

195
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,670
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a couple of people.

196
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an administrator.

197
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,994
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a school committee getting no pay.

198
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,678
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anything anybody here can think of.

199
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,740
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so much.

200
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never even could get to that conversation because

201
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:49,774
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doomsday.

202
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:56,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you sit around and talk about, OK, so which elementary school are we shutting down?

203
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting rid of all of the arts, and all of music, and all of sports, and still not coming to $2.2 million?

204
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a lot of money.

205
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:12,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the cuts would look like, frankly, we don't have an answer that's very good.

206
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a bloodbath sounds very, very melodramatic, but it's not.

207
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:28,463
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an exaggeration if we don't pass these, what kind of cuts we're looking at.

208
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:36,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have my own thoughts on where on earth we would make such major cuts.

209
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:42,613
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal preference is that everybody hurts, not just one group of students or one level.

210
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:55,777
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have to do this, because Medford votes against it, then I want to make sure the pain is distributed to all kids and families, because it's not fair to just focus on one

211
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:03,245
[SPEAKER_00]: one group of folks, everybody should have to suffer equally.

212
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, it's dark.

213
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dark, but that's also reality.

214
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:18,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think just to follow up on that, the specifics of the cuts are part of the budget process, but the answer is 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions, right?

215
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's...

216
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:29,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna interrupt and say that that is based on our current pay scales.

217
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:38,128
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, we're negotiating with our parents, we're negotiating with our teachers, all of those things are gonna go up as they normally would and should.

218
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:45,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is an absolute low ball number based on the data from June.

219
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:51,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And I expect it to be higher if we have to have that.

220
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,701
[SPEAKER_01]: then I will clarify to at least 35 to 45 full-time equivalent positions.

221
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:06,304
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that looks like, I mean, that's, it's a huge cut, you know, that's, it's incredibly large.

222
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:11,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly would affect every building, every classroom, every program.

223
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:21,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny and Paul, I just wanted to follow up on, I just wanted to follow up on one thing, Jenny, first before we go to, there are some,

224
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Good questions here that we want to get to, but what was just there was 1 follow up to this question, which was.

225
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:32,905
[SPEAKER_01]: What was actually cut this year and would anything be able to come back if the override did pass.

226
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so a couple of things that we did.

227
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:44,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Eliminate this year, our director of data reporting.

228
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Was eliminated by.

229
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:55,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Six, five or six, I'm not remembering exactly, administrative assistant positions.

230
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:57,985
[SPEAKER_03]: were eliminated.

231
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:10,352
[SPEAKER_03]: There's at least one of them is on high on my list personally to come back because the McGlynn complex is working with one administrative assistant right now for a thousand kids.

232
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:12,713
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not okay.

233
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:17,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a huge, it's a huge ask and a big lift.

234
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:25,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some administrative assistant positions that we could look at to say what needs to come back.

235
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Literacy interventionists, we.

236
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: We're able to bring, I think, 3 back into the budget, but we needed 4. we only have 2 right now.

237
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have 1 open position.

238
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then there were, um, there ended up being 1 elimination from the administrators union.

239
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I don't.

240
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:58,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Think that's like, super high on our list because the work has been distributed, but that would certainly be subject of a discussion.

241
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:04,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then there were some changes to the portfolio of, um.

242
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:08,137
[SPEAKER_03]: of teachers at each of our buildings.

243
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And that number change, you know, whatever, whatever we talked about in May, and then in June, and what actually transpired at the start of the year is very much a function of like how the enrollment comes through.

244
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:26,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think there are some classrooms that are bigger than they have historically done.

245
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sort of always watching those class sizes because

246
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:38,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you put too many kids in a classroom, it becomes incredibly hard for all the kids to get what they need.

247
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would be looking at that and maybe able to return to some of those other questions.

248
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:49,266
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a whole bunch of other things that we've never been able to talk about doing.

249
00:26:50,667 --> 00:27:02,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that representatives from our teachers union was at, were at one of our early meetings this year asking us to address the overcrowding issues at the Roberts Elementary School specifically.

250
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:09,538
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no more space at that school and we continue to see enrollment climb.

251
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other things that we are going to have to do.

252
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:24,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may not be about like bringing back a position that was cut, but talking about finally being able to fund a position that's always been needed.

253
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:29,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So that those two things are both possibilities for this when we pass this.

254
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great transition.

255
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:40,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we might be able to meet both of your requests, Jenny, for a more hopeful question and talk about some of the things we could be able to do.

256
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:44,834
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, could you provide some examples about funds from question eight?

257
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:51,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the investing more in our schools question, what those could be used to improve our schools.

258
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:53,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

259
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,896
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of so question 8.

260
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Provides us an opportunity to talk about.

261
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,179
[SPEAKER_03]: What we should do, right?

262
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what what have we never been able to do that?

263
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:12,506
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do and we actually have been having this conversation in budget seasons for as long as I've been here.

264
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:18,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a shortage of good ideas about things that would benefit students.

265
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:27,240
[SPEAKER_03]: But the things that are sort of, I'll say highest on the list are things like living wages for all of our staff.

266
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I say a living wage, I mean.

267
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:42,265
[SPEAKER_03]: raising people up out of the minimum wage category, where many of our positions have existed for a really long time.

268
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:55,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made a lot of progress in moving out of that minimum wage territory, but we are not yet at what is considered a living wage for somebody who lives in this area and works in this community.

269
00:28:56,974 --> 00:29:01,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, and like, 1 of the biggest and most important things.

270
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:08,596
[SPEAKER_03]: For our district is to finish the integration of our high school and our vocational school.

271
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:11,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the 2 schools used to operate completely separately.

272
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:17,118
[SPEAKER_03]: They were listed as 2 different schools with the Department of elementary and secondary education.

273
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:18,958
[SPEAKER_03]: They were merged.

274
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:21,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Some years ago, 6, 7 years ago.

275
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:32,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But the two schedules were never integrated in such a way that students could move seamlessly between the two buildings.

276
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,021
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very complicated work.

277
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:39,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been at it for a good number of years.

278
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:44,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we finally are at the place where we have a path forward.

279
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:52,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will allow things like our vocational students to have space in their schedule to access

280
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:58,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the arts or world language, my daughter is in the vocational program.

281
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:03,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, now she's a 10th grader in the robotics and engineering program.

282
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:11,092
[SPEAKER_03]: She has to take Spanish in line after school to meet her world language requirement because there's no space in her schedule.

283
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,053
[SPEAKER_03]: For Spanish.

284
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that gets fixed with changes to the schedule.

285
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:29,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very complicated set of changes because we still have to and want to preserve what makes our vocational school so unique and special.

286
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:39,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We have students who come out who are halfway to licensure, who are like a year ahead of their peers coming out of high school, going into certain trades.

287
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:42,994
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that requires a completely different schedule.

288
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:46,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So the integration of the two schedules is critically important.

289
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:49,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to change the structure of the school day.

290
00:30:49,575 --> 00:31:09,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to change the amount of time that happens in class A versus class B versus class C. And all of that contributes to, you know, reexamining as we begin negotiations with our teachers, like what the contract is, what the requirements are, and what the costs are.

291
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:22,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Relatedly, when you think about all the rest of the schools in the district, universally, our instructional time is at the minimum that the state allows.

292
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:31,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we think about how much time we spend educating kids and what opportunities we're able to provide them, there's no wiggle room.

293
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:35,025
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably many, many reasons why we don't call a late

294
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:40,579
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who are parents and you're like, why don't we do a 2 hour delay?

295
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:46,523
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually probably many reasons, but 1 of the reasons is because we don't have 2 hours to spare.

296
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:49,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we either have to bring the kids in for a whole day.

297
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we're not meeting our instructional requirements.

298
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:53,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

299
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at.

300
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:03,414
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the nature and structure and lengths of the school day are all things that become possible when we are not.

301
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:08,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, simultaneously talking about cutting staff, because if you think about.

302
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: How your elementary school student moves through their day, for example, they, they have their core classes and they have their specials.

303
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:21,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole, like, the whole dynamic might need to shift in order to be able to spend another.

304
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, 5 minutes a day on something like math and that then may require additional specialists to be able to support.

305
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:58,320
[SPEAKER_03]: students in the building because every class changes so there's any number of ways that plays out in practice and we have to we obviously have to you know get with our partners in the union and sort of talk through all the nitty-gritty details of that but the way school day happens is going to change and in order for that to be possible it's very likely we're going to be asking teachers to do something different than they do today

306
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, like, we need the sort of financial space to be able to have a productive conversation about that.

307
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:09,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will add Jenny covered a lot of that the.

308
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:17,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the less sexy stuff is we have one HR person.

309
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:21,275
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one payroll person for 1,100 employees.

310
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:32,117
[SPEAKER_00]: To put that in context, Shore Collaborative has two HR people and is a teensy, teensy fraction of the size of Medford Public Schools.

311
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:39,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while those are just two examples of where we need to add staff,

312
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:50,048
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things when we finalize a contract with our union partners, it takes months often to get them their retro pay.

313
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:50,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Months.

314
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:59,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is an exorbitant amount of work for one person to do, who's also doing weekly payroll for 1,100 people.

315
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:19,805
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, we have like the city, you know, Jenny talked earlier, maybe it was Zach about how, you know, the schools, every penny we get, especially in this spring, it was by telling everybody else in the rest of the city, you can't have any of your requests.

316
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:29,330
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have departments with like the one man standing and just like the city, we have some departments where there's just one person left and,

317
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:43,086
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it takes months to get your retro pay after you finally, you know, everybody's celebrating, we finally got that contract done, it's bad for morale.

318
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:53,859
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like an edge case, but these are the kinds of things that drive the culture of the school.

319
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:01,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from a staffing perspective, the distrust that we can successfully do anything is

320
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:17,654
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, in my opinion, heavily influenced by the fact that we lack enough staff to do to execute on many things that in other organizations would just be so mundane and boring, it would never be a conversation.

321
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:31,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the most simple thing is really, really hard because there's one poor soul responsible for two or three jobs, it just isn't good for the kids.

322
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:33,513
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't good for the staff.

323
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:43,502
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just many, many examples where what we can do to improve things, I mean, busing, it's a long list.

324
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:57,023
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I think probably the most important thing is the school day, as Jenny mentioned, and we don't know what that will really cost exactly, because we have to negotiate that, of course.

325
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna ask people to work more time.

326
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:06,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So like anybody else, if your work day got longer, you'd expect to be paid more, so.

327
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:10,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.

328
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:13,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to move to some of our other top questions here.

329
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:17,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And folks, please feel free to submit some more questions.

330
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,582
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 35, 40 minutes before we start to move into some wrapping up.

331
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:30,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two top questions on deck right now, we'll start with one along these lines.

332
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:34,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a long-term plan to fill these budget gaps, or will we continue to need budget overrides?

333
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:40,914
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is there is a long-term plan to increase revenue for the city.

334
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:47,976
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council has been working on that in partnership with our planning department for several years now.

335
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:53,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, we passed the first recodification of the city zoning in 60 years.

336
00:36:55,398 --> 00:37:02,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is if we allow new development and new growth, that is the only way outside of an override or a debt exclusion.

337
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,681
[SPEAKER_01]: that the property tax levy can increase above the 2.5%.

338
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:15,304
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last two years have actually been the best two years for new growth values in the city of Medford in the last 25 years.

339
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:25,827
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what other people may say about that, that's just the fact you can go to the State Department of Revenue Division of Local Services website to see that information.

340
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:30,829
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has helped in the past two years, it hasn't been

341
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:39,708
[SPEAKER_01]: astronomical Cambridge, Somerville, Boston level, or even Worcester level growth, but it has been an improvement.

342
00:37:40,288 --> 00:37:42,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It has staved off even more cuts.

343
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:52,671
[SPEAKER_01]: It made possible this year some of what Jenny and Paul were talking about around not having to make the cuts that we had to make.

344
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:57,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is also the one-time revenue, the one-time funding from the federal government, of course.

345
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But the city council,

346
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,362
[SPEAKER_01]: In partnership with the planning department.

347
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:07,324
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have a city comprehensive plan for the first time ever.

348
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:12,907
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a city housing production plan we also have our climate plan and our open space plan.

349
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:25,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are going, all of those are being looped into a zoning update project that the council has been working on with the planning department and our zoning consultant in associates.

350
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,023
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 times on that year in city council in our planning and permitting committee.

351
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:54,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some really, we made some initial adjustments and we have some really, I think, transformative proposals coming up around our Mystic Avenue corridor, our Salem Street corridor, our Medford Square corridor, in terms of the transforming those neighborhoods and allowing significant new growth to see

352
00:38:55,123 --> 00:39:13,169
[SPEAKER_01]: modern walkable mixed use corridors with commercial space and residential space that once the zoning is completed and then once property owners and developers come in to start working on these projects would be transformative for our community in terms of raising revenue.

353
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:20,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the long-term vision for how we raise revenue beyond going down the other model.

354
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:37,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is maybe going into the next question a little bit, but the other model is the Winchester, Weston, Arlington, and other place model, which if folks don't know, those are places that do overrides and debt exclusions all the time.

355
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:45,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that may be a surprise to folks is that when Proposition 2 1⁄2 passed in 1980, the proponents of Proposition 2 1⁄2 actually said,

356
00:39:50,583 --> 00:40:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: that they expected communities to do overrides and debt exclusions regularly, and that the reason for the law was just so that it would be transparent and decided on by the voters.

357
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:11,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, many, 315, I think, of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have since proposed an overrider or debt exclusion.

358
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:15,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of those communities have passed an overrider or debt exclusion.

359
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is one of the few that has never even put one on the table.

360
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:33,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that with our location close to Boston, the value of our community, the transformative opportunities and corridors that have not seen the economic development focus that they've needed to see.

361
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:39,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, if we had seen 10, 20, 30 years ago, we might be having a different conversation today.

362
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:42,819
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be having a conversation more like a Somerville or a Cambridge or even an Everett.

363
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,622
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way for us to

364
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:55,097
[SPEAKER_01]: transform the community in a positive way, bring new amenities and benefits to the people who live here and increase the city's tax base significantly in the long run.

365
00:40:56,698 --> 00:41:11,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the medium to short term, you know, the financial task force believes that these overrides and the debt exclusion for the fire station provide significant fiscal space in the next few years for the city to not be in a budget crunch.

366
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,812
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe even be a bridge entirely to that development and revenue from those new developments.

367
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:21,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that with any certainty.

368
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:34,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly if there's another period, you know, if the tariff that have been proposed by a presidential candidate go into place and we see inflation at 10 or 20% again in the next couple of years, we're gonna be in really big trouble right away.

369
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see 2% inflation for the next 10 years, it's a different story.

370
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know,

371
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:44,486
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the thinking here.

372
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:48,229
[SPEAKER_01]: The one project that I think would fall outside of that is, of course, the new Medford High School.

373
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:55,315
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way, and you haven't really seen any community, even Somerville with Assembly Row had to do a debt exclusion for its new high school.

374
00:41:57,276 --> 00:42:02,300
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one project that I think there would be a further request of the voters to fund.

375
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:10,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, that is the only thing on the horizon that the current leadership team between the mayor, council, and school committee foresees asking the voters to do.

376
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:18,820
[SPEAKER_01]: the conditions remain reasonable and we don't have 20% tariffs on everything we import.

377
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:26,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Jenny or Paul you want to add on that long term court plan around the budget gaps at all.

378
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly to say yes to around the high school.

379
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:39,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We're several years away from that question being on the table for the voters.

380
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:48,930
[SPEAKER_03]: The money that we are required to set aside for the early stages of that project have been set aside by the council.

381
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So in so far.

382
00:42:51,812 --> 00:43:04,575
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about free cash, 1 of the things that happened back in June was an allocation of some of the free cash money, about 3M dollars to be ready for those early stages of so that is provided for.

383
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:11,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's many steps that will go through before we get to a point of being being in a position to ask about that debt exclusion.

384
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:19,021
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 of the things that's very interesting, there's lots of documentation on the school building committee website.

385
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to know more about that project, all of the deliverables that we have submitted are out there with the exception of some of our.

386
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:37,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our enrollment projection information, and I found that part of the exercise very enlightening because they did ask us to talk about future development and we talked.

387
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:41,778
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and we talked about in reference in partnership with the city, things like.

388
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Projects in Medford square in project over the air rights in Wellington and some of the bigger sort of coming attractions and I will follow up with the communications director to make sure that those documents get out there because.

389
00:43:56,586 --> 00:44:04,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I think where they landed is pretty digestible to the public and just to understand where that falls in relationship.

390
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,511
[SPEAKER_03]: to some of these plans that we're talking about here from a development perspective.

391
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:11,571
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real, they're coming, there's RFPs going out and all that good stuff.

392
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:17,373
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, what effect and impact does that have on the size of the eventual Medford High School?

393
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:20,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a follow-up on that, Jenny.

394
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:23,734
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question, why do we have to wait so long for the high school debt exclusion?

395
00:44:24,234 --> 00:44:25,074
[SPEAKER_01]: And I may have misspoke.

396
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:27,315
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be sooner than 5 to 10 years.

397
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:31,096
[SPEAKER_01]: The MSBA process, the stage we're in now, we would probably find out.

398
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny, could you go into that a little bit more?

399
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:40,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, we so we're in the very 1st stage of the project, which is called the eligibility phase.

400
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:50,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, our, our eligibility phase started on May 1st and by July 10th, all of our deliverables were in, which usually takes about 6 months.

401
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

402
00:44:51,770 --> 00:45:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we crushed through that in about 2 and a half months instead of 6. and so we are waiting now for, um, to finalize the process with MSBA, where we agree on how big of a population of students we're building a building for once that happens and they get back with us after they've done their work.

403
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:24,764
[SPEAKER_03]: will move into the next phase, which is where we would hire the owner's project manager and ultimately the architect who will help conduct the feasibility study.

404
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:27,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where that feasibility study money comes in.

405
00:45:27,946 --> 00:45:35,751
[SPEAKER_03]: The feasibility study has to be completed in order to then have any sort of a spec that would be able to go out to debt exclusion.

406
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not five to seven years away.

407
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:39,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that

408
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: We have students in the building to 7 years.

409
00:45:44,056 --> 00:45:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly am pushing for that, but we're probably a couple years down the road before a debt exclusion before we're ready to do that.

410
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:53,902
[SPEAKER_01]: For the new high school for the new high school.

411
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:54,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

412
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:59,785
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Paul, I cut you off and then I will go to Matt.

413
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:03,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jenny already covered it, so I don't need to repeat it.

414
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,068
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

415
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:04,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

416
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:07,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Another panel, Matt.

417
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose, we had a we had a very short city council meeting, but sorry, I wanted to, I just wanted to add on to what Zach was saying about the long term financial plan of the city, which was a lot of what city council doing is right

418
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:46,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, is establishing sort of the instruments of municipal finance and governance that other surrounding towns have sort of taken for granted for a very long time and I don't think that's always obvious to people who are looking in a good example is the stabilization funds.

419
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:55,163
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we decided to create a couple of rainy day funds and allocate some cash into them.

420
00:46:55,203 --> 00:47:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that the vast majority of cities in Massachusetts have had forever that this city council only recently actually instituted.

421
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Only last year we established an affordable housing trust so that we put some money towards affordable housing.

422
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that Somerville established like 30 years ago and it's been collecting money ever

423
00:47:17,563 --> 00:47:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: ever since.

424
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:25,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Our zoning really should have been overhauled a very long time ago.

425
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: With regards to a lot of the HR issues that were just being discussed earlier, that's not just a case for getting retrograde, it's not just a case for the teachers union, it's a case for all

426
00:47:39,262 --> 00:47:40,642
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much all city staff.

427
00:47:41,163 --> 00:47:50,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked HR that during a meeting a couple months ago, and they said they don't have the financial software to do those calculations.

428
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:53,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally have to calculate everything by hand on paper.

429
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:58,468
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something that most other organizations have to do.

430
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:05,890
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our long-term financial planning, just to be clear, is establishing

431
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:12,104
[SPEAKER_02]: be, it's just getting things that other areas have taken for granted.

432
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:13,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to make that point.

433
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get off the panel.

434
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:17,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just missing those.

435
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,667
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really a really important point.

436
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:31,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I take for granted that people don't know that we don't have such basic things that I forget to mention that we're establishing things for the first time here in Medford that many communities have had for decades, if not longer.

437
00:48:34,238 --> 00:48:38,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack, could I speak to the admin is heavy question?

438
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:44,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah, we'll jump back to that and then we can talk about a couple other questions.

439
00:48:45,003 --> 00:49:02,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, so I've been on the school committee for seven years, and while running for office, I heard that Medford had this massive administrative crew of people, vastly more than every other district around us, as is the usual assertion for every claim.

440
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:06,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that, of course, that isn't true.

441
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:12,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we do have two assistant superintendents and a superintendent and a director of finance,

442
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:14,906
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

443
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:27,603
[SPEAKER_00]: What other districts often have, if they don't have as many assistant superintendents, is many, many, many more lower-level administrators.

444
00:49:28,943 --> 00:49:42,806
[SPEAKER_00]: In some districts, every single building has, by grade level, a person responsible for curriculum, for math at fifth grade, at this school, a person responsible for science at this grade, at this school.

445
00:49:45,668 --> 00:49:46,676
[SPEAKER_00]: We have none of that.

446
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.

447
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:57,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So our administrators are doing the work of, frankly, so many people, it's sort of, again, it's absurd.

448
00:49:57,126 --> 00:50:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work they're doing is not work that's optional.

449
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:08,734
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times there's enormous amounts of reporting and regulatory stuff that they're involved in.

450
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:13,237
[SPEAKER_00]: They execute on all the things the school committee asked them to do.

451
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:17,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just do not have a heavy

452
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,562
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative, we don't have a lot of administrators.

453
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:27,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And administrators, also people have very different ideas on what the word administrator means.

454
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:34,849
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an administrator's union, which has our directors of curriculum, director of science, director of math.

455
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:44,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And my entire time I have been on the school committee, we have had people doing double duty, sometimes triple duty.

456
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:46,736
[SPEAKER_00]: covering three different departments.

457
00:50:47,956 --> 00:50:55,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's just not normal in other school districts that are even remotely better funded.

458
00:50:56,801 --> 00:51:05,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have one person who's responsible for humanities, social studies, and English, and is covering foreign language,

459
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:11,092
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that person usually will have a specialty, which, you know, maybe that's English.

460
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:16,135
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much are they able to really do in those other disciplines?

461
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:26,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have great teachers, and often that is the only reason we have continued to have a quality education in Medford at all, is because our teachers are good.

462
00:51:26,763 --> 00:51:31,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lack of anybody above,

463
00:51:32,366 --> 00:51:36,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing any kind of leadership has often not been the end of the world.

464
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:37,990
[SPEAKER_00]: But things change.

465
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:43,974
[SPEAKER_00]: The state changes the guidelines for what is required for social studies curriculum.

466
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:47,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are constantly changing.

467
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you don't have any leaders to focus on that, because the teachers are busy.

468
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,801
[SPEAKER_00]: They're with the students.

469
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:59,962
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any of these administrators, then we don't have the ability to get that done.

470
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:10,636
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been working on the science of reading and that's been an assistant superintendent, a director of humanities and a whole host of other staff and

471
00:52:11,437 --> 00:52:14,178
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, it's not like a five minute part of their job.

472
00:52:14,258 --> 00:52:17,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a huge, huge effort that's multi-years.

473
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not only not administration heavy, I think we are administration light.

474
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:31,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, my inclusion of administration is having enough people in HR and payroll.

475
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:35,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of administration as the people in central office.

476
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:44,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people have very different ideas of what administration means, but we are definitely, we don't have anywhere near enough.

477
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:46,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need two more assistant superintendents?

478
00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:46,774
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

479
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:49,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think we even need another assistant superintendent?

480
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:49,535
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

481
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:51,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people working under them.

482
00:52:53,012 --> 00:53:02,618
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can delegate to because they are completely swamped with incoming mandates and crises that are normal.

483
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:11,925
[SPEAKER_00]: They're normal parts of running a school system that can often swallow up anything that they were already in the process of actually doing.

484
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:14,306
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to answer that question.

485
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:14,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

486
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:17,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

487
00:53:17,268 --> 00:53:21,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to the next question that we have a bunch of votes on.

488
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:27,653
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, do we know what other towns have done to get overrides to pass given that Medford is a laggard compared to similar towns?

489
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:41,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I will defer to my colleagues in just a moment, but I wish there was a magic formula, because I'd be less stressed out about whether or not this question or these questions are going to pass.

490
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:48,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, to be honest, the first step is the city government needs to have the courage to ask.

491
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:53,716
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time the city government has had the courage to ask the voters.

492
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:59,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone thinks, oh, let's raise our taxes is a popular thing for anyone to ask anyone else.

493
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand like deeply and completely that it's a difficult decision for a lot of people.

494
00:54:06,162 --> 00:54:08,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all understand that.

495
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:16,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we also know that there's a lot of difficult decisions that have been had to be made or continue to be making when it comes to

496
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:18,481
[SPEAKER_01]: layoffs?

497
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:20,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we pay our staff enough?

498
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:24,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we have this department exist anymore?

499
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:28,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are really fundamental to the functioning of city government.

500
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:35,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, do we have our firefighters have a building where they feel like they're not going to get sick in that building, right?

501
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:43,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, these are really human deep questions, just as much as am I able to afford the tax increase is a really human deep question for a lot of people.

502
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for a long time, city government

503
00:54:48,004 --> 00:55:03,795
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like we could keep asking the community to not invest in city government, to do more with less, and found creative or uncreative or short-term, not long-term ways to make that work.

504
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:10,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last five years, especially with the pandemic and with the cost growth, we hit the wall, right?

505
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we don't have another choice but to ask.

506
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:16,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've been clear that if we ask and we

507
00:55:17,472 --> 00:55:18,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is no.

508
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:21,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of very, very hard choices that come after that.

509
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:29,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the first step I think to getting an override to pass is that an override is on the ballot.

510
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:37,642
[SPEAKER_01]: From what other towns have done what we need to do I think Matt really spoke to it and Paul spoke to it and Jenny spoke to it as well right like

511
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:48,683
[SPEAKER_01]: How do one of the big things that we're talking about the financial task force is how do we make sure that we address the scope of problems that is significant enough that people can see the investment that we're asking them to make.

512
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:54,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we don't do a big enough thing and we ask people to do this and they don't actually see a change.

513
00:55:56,209 --> 00:56:02,454
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not engendering any more trust than we've been engendering with the lack of progress that the city has been making for a long time.

514
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm really encouraged.

515
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:23,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've done a lot of public education, quite frankly, over the last two to four years around the difficulties and issues that we see in our schools and on our streets and in our city departments, where a lot of people are saying, Hey, you know, maybe I don't want to pay more taxes.

516
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:29,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it will be a challenge for me to figure out how to afford to pay more taxes, but also I care about this community.

517
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:32,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we need to do these things because.

518
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:35,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just see it, right?

519
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:46,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's literally the environment that we live in and the buildings that our kids are in and the teachers who are overworked and the city employees who are overworked, right?

520
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:51,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we see and feel the reality and I think people are ready to make this investment.

521
00:56:51,288 --> 00:57:00,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been really encouraged talking to my neighbors, been really encouraged talking to lots of folks across the city that these things are going to pass.

522
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:23,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the good thing that if we move forward on these is it sets a foundation for us to show progress, to show improvement, to maybe get the financial systems and softwares in place where we can point to a dashboard instead of a spreadsheet, point to, you know, pull data in a day instead of a week to answer questions more quickly.

523
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:30,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hope is to see that virtuous cycle of investment beginning more investment and

524
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,482
[SPEAKER_01]: city government having the resources that it needs to do its job, meaning that the public trust the city can do its job.

525
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:39,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my real hope.

526
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:42,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel good right now.

527
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:57,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be working very hard over the next 27 days, talking to people, getting people, raising money to send out the mailers, doing all the different things that we need to do to make sure that we get a yes vote on November 5th.

528
00:57:57,653 --> 00:58:00,014
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my kind of

529
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:05,913
[SPEAKER_01]: pitch and spiel around what do we need to do to get an override to pass and why we went this direction.

530
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:08,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul, I see that you're next.

531
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:12,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm itching to answer the question about short staff.

532
00:58:12,558 --> 00:58:19,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the schools are short-staffed, are we seeing high rates of burnout, turnover, and could we use these funds to help improve retention in the schools?

533
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:20,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are.

534
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:21,184
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost our

535
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:31,871
[SPEAKER_00]: not treasurer, I forget, the controller to Somerville, making 20 grand more to do the same job.

536
00:58:32,872 --> 00:58:48,921
[SPEAKER_00]: The catch here for that is that because we're missing so many positions, people leaving for better pay, or even if they aren't leaving for better pay, they are leaving for dramatically less work.

537
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to suggest they don't want to work or that they're lazy.

538
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:53,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

539
00:58:54,867 --> 00:59:00,272
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these folks that are leaving are working absurd numbers of hours for the pay.

540
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:03,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's absurd numbers of hours regardless of the pay.

541
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,858
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to actually do something other than just work.

542
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we lose somebody like a...

543
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:17,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Controller, she didn't just leave with the knowledge of what it's to technically do the job of the controller.

544
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:24,118
[SPEAKER_00]: She left with all the other knowledge for all the other stuff she had been doing because there was nobody else to do it.

545
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:25,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that vanishes.

546
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,242
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire a new controller who comes in to be a controller.

547
00:59:30,418 --> 00:59:33,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's just this gigantic gap.

548
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has happened many times in my time here.

549
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:47,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And replacing that person with a better salary, which you often have to do to even recruit somebody,

550
00:59:48,604 --> 01:00:02,291
[SPEAKER_00]: It solves the problem of that slot, but you didn't get what you had before, not even close, because that person rarely was doing the job that is their job description.

551
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:08,794
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing much more and it's a huge problem.

552
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about like,

553
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:15,821
[SPEAKER_00]: improving retention is often a very expensive endeavor.

554
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:19,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't just about people giving people a raise, which sometimes that is an answer.

555
01:00:19,924 --> 01:00:24,567
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about adding whole other people, more people to do the work.

556
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:27,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always a dramatically more expensive.

557
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:34,054
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can give somebody a $20,000 raise, that's a lot cheaper than buying another person for 90,000 or whatever hiring, not buying.

558
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:37,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know,

559
01:00:38,837 --> 01:00:42,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these problems are truly very expensive to solve.

560
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:48,587
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just what it costs to, you know, our business office is understaffed.

561
01:00:48,907 --> 01:00:50,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about that so much.

562
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:55,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a school committee member, you know, right out of the gate, I had all kinds of questions.

563
01:00:56,864 --> 01:00:59,648
[SPEAKER_00]: that could never be answered and have not been answered in seven years.

564
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:00,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

565
01:01:00,649 --> 01:01:09,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we had a modern financial system, somebody would go in, they'd write some little report and click print or email me an Excel spreadsheet.

566
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:18,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Without those systems, it's weeks of somebody going through multiple systems trying to figure out what's that over there, what's that over there.

567
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not exaggerating.

568
01:01:19,722 --> 01:01:28,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have things, there's a monthly report where we're legally supposed to get every month, a hires and terminations report.

569
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:30,110
[SPEAKER_00]: All the districts around us get it.

570
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:35,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know about it because of the Shore Collaborative where I'm the Medford School Committee representative.

571
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:37,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets it, the Shore gets it.

572
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:38,982
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get it.

573
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:39,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

574
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have a modern system.

575
01:01:40,683 --> 01:01:42,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Our HR is not connected to our payroll.

576
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:50,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And is getting that report worth paying somebody for 40 or 80 hours of work every month?

577
01:01:50,525 --> 01:01:51,246
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.

578
01:01:53,066 --> 01:02:00,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So this burnout issue is a really important one, but it's also very expensive to solve.

579
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:06,330
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not just a matter of looking at how much does a controller make in other districts and say, oh, we're going to pay them that.

580
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:10,044
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still gonna burn out because they're doing multiple jobs.

581
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:13,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to beat that one down, but it's been seven years of complaining about this.

582
01:02:14,926 --> 01:02:21,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone can tell that Paul is the secretary of the school committee, because one of the jobs that Paul has to do is sign every bill.

583
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:25,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's pretty familiar with that side of things.

584
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:32,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jenny raised the same exact point, though, around our class sizes, right?

585
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:41,862
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ask teachers and paras to have more kids in the room, it gets harder to educate the kids.

586
01:02:43,203 --> 01:02:51,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can have four less kids in a room, that may be the difference between someone staying or someone going somewhere else where the class sizes are smaller.

587
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,050
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, there's burnout and turnover in the school.

588
01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:00,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I'm on the city council and I spend a lot more time on the city side of things.

589
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,045
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of turnover and burnout on the city side too.

590
01:03:04,065 --> 01:03:08,207
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great folks come in, build some relationships.

591
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:18,752
[SPEAKER_01]: They're here for a year, they're here for two years, and then they get offered a job that isn't as many hours, is at a higher pay rate in another city or in the private sector, and they move on.

592
01:03:18,872 --> 01:03:25,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the greatest example of this is our issue hiring a city solicitor.

593
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:28,056
[SPEAKER_01]: We've raised the pay like two or three times now.

594
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:37,439
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping that this latest one, which was just a month ago, might actually, or two months ago, might actually lock us in and hopefully we can hire someone.

595
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:47,506
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, people come in, they work hard, they realize that they don't have the, they're working more or doing more jobs that they would have to do.

596
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:52,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, doing two jobs here where they might be able to do one job in another community, they move on.

597
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we see that across the board, city and schools.

598
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:58,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go to the next question.

599
01:03:59,824 --> 01:04:07,770
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just want to add in quickly that there was a clarification on the heavy administrator talking about the curriculum and department heads, not more superintendents.

600
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,531
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to note that.

601
01:04:09,591 --> 01:04:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for putting that clarification.

602
01:04:13,935 --> 01:04:23,181
[SPEAKER_01]: On the questions here that are left and we're coming up, you know, we got to probably about 10 or so minutes left if folks want to throw another question into the chat.

603
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:33,055
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is, has there been discussions about an owner-occupied property tax exemption like Cambridge and Somerville have, and is that something the city council could pass?

604
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:38,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year we use, we set the tax rate.

605
01:04:39,117 --> 01:04:47,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into the, take me more than 10 minutes to go into the complexities of exactly how Proposition 2 1⁄2 works, but we set the tax rate every year.

606
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:51,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the options that is, you know, we technically vote to consider is,

607
01:04:53,052 --> 01:04:55,973
[SPEAKER_01]: could we do an owner-occupied property tax exemption?

608
01:04:56,534 --> 01:05:03,737
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is that the city would set a certain percentage of the average residential bill.

609
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:12,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were an owner-occupied unit, you would get that, essentially, your tax bill would go down by that amount.

610
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:14,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use some round numbers here.

611
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it's $3,000.

612
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:19,888
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be like a 30% exemption.

613
01:05:19,928 --> 01:05:20,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it's $3,000.

614
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:23,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know off the top of my head, it's actually probably pretty close.

615
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:39,540
[SPEAKER_01]: How that would work is everybody who pays a residential tax bill from, if your owner occupied, regardless of your value, you'd get $3,000 off your bill.

616
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your house, essentially it creates a breakeven point where,

617
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:53,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little more complicated than this, but basically everyone who's owner-occupied would get that cut off.

618
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But that money doesn't just go away.

619
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:57,502
[SPEAKER_01]: The city can't afford to actually have the taxes go down.

620
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:04,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So that amount that owner-occupants get, that reduction, gets shifted onto people who don't get the owner-occupant exemption.

621
01:06:04,984 --> 01:06:11,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, you'd be shifting the city, the cost of the property tax on residential properties,

622
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:15,590
[SPEAKER_01]: off of owner-occupants onto non-owner-occupants.

623
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other side of that is that that actually changes the tax rate.

624
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:27,214
[SPEAKER_01]: It essentially means instead of a flat residential tax rate on residential tax bills, you end up with a progressive rate.

625
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually think that's a bad thing, but one of the reasons that previous councils prior to 2022

626
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:43,075
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pass it is it actually would raise taxes on owner occupants in high value homes.

627
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:51,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your home is worth more than the breakeven point, even though you get the exemption, the tax rates going up more than the exemptions, you actually pay more.

628
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:55,666
[SPEAKER_01]: The point being that it's a complicated conversation.

629
01:06:56,206 --> 01:07:01,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, if you are in a condo or a small single family and you're

630
01:07:01,954 --> 01:07:05,115
[SPEAKER_01]: living in that, you're an owner occupant, your taxes will probably go down.

631
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:09,837
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in an expensive single family or a multifamily, your taxes are probably going up.

632
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:15,959
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a certainly large apartment buildings, those there'd be significant increase because the rate would go up.

633
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:23,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just this, you know, everyone who gets an if we implemented it tomorrow, that everyone would get this benefit in the same way.

634
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:25,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complicated conversation.

635
01:07:26,164 --> 01:07:36,135
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons we haven't implemented it is because both the previous city assessor and the current city assessor say it would take them about a year to do the calculations and get everything in order.

636
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:45,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd probably need one to two more staff people in the assessing office just to process the applications for the owner occupancy exemption.

637
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:47,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a significant undertaking.

638
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:59,750
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of places like Everett's and Somerville's and Cambridge's did this a long time ago when the conversation was a little bit different because of the property values that we see today.

639
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:02,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we've talked about it a lot.

640
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:06,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I actually know too much about it because I don't know that I explained it particularly well right now.

641
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:13,302
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've talked about it every year that we've set the tax rate since I've been on the council and I know on prior councils before that.

642
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:19,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a complicated undertaking, and it isn't the silver bullet that it's presented to be a lot of the time.

643
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:22,507
[SPEAKER_01]: But do I think it's a bad idea?

644
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:29,269
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I'd be willing to move forward on it if folks felt we could make the time and effort and make it a priority personally.

645
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question is on

646
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:46,943
[SPEAKER_01]: The when would we expect to see changes to the high school vocational schedule, if we were able to move forward and if the negotiations were able to be concluded.

647
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,462
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have high school students, you know that this is desperately.

648
01:08:54,482 --> 01:09:02,526
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time coming, like I said earlier, my daughter is in the robotics and engineering program.

649
01:09:03,066 --> 01:09:03,646
[SPEAKER_03]: She takes.

650
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:06,828
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no opportunity for her to take.

651
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,409
[SPEAKER_03]: An art class, which is the other sort of half of her brain.

652
01:09:10,429 --> 01:09:18,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So she struggles with that, but she takes Spanish online because there's no space in her schedule to take a language, which is a graduation requirement.

653
01:09:18,512 --> 01:09:28,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly, if you are thinking about pursuing a 4 year college experience after high school, they want to know that you have some sort of full language for some number of years.

654
01:09:30,356 --> 01:09:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to answer the question, there is the changing the schedule is a huge undertaking.

655
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:43,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing everything we can on the administrative side to be as ready as we can possibly be.

656
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we are able to sort of have this productive conversation with with our teachers union.

657
01:09:51,857 --> 01:09:56,178
[SPEAKER_03]: which hopefully can happen quickly once these questions are successful.

658
01:09:56,278 --> 01:10:01,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some sort of like, I'll call them drop dead dates in the mix, right?

659
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:17,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So the high school students have to pick their schedule by like, say mid April, which would mean if you sort of back up from there, the offering and the new schedule would have to be ready in enough time to like,

660
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Build everything so that students could pick their schedule in April.

661
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:27,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really are looking at a very tight window, but the administration.

662
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:34,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Is working really hard to make this a reality for next school year.

663
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I.

664
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they think it's a huge amount of work and I think they are concerned about the viability of getting to that, that date.

665
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:46,969
[SPEAKER_03]: What I have said is we can't wait another year.

666
01:10:47,269 --> 01:10:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Another class of kids can't wait for this to go another year.

667
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I personally am really pushing.

668
01:10:56,877 --> 01:11:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: that this override passes, obviously we will have the opportunity to invest some resource in making this a reality.

669
01:11:04,002 --> 01:11:10,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously we have to go through the negotiating process and we are talking about that.

670
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the teachers union is talking about that.

671
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:18,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I want those conversations to be collaborative and productive.

672
01:11:19,452 --> 01:11:25,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And in saying that, that also means everybody's sort of ready and prepared for the discussion.

673
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:26,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And so part of what

674
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:34,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking of the school administration is that they get ready and prepared about all the things that have to happen to make the schedule a reality.

675
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:46,509
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am very hopeful that if these pass, we will see maybe not like the final, final, final change by fall of next year, but hopefully pretty darn close.

676
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:51,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully next year your students won't have to take a foreign language online.

677
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:55,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of work there.

678
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows that there's a lot of work there.

679
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:13,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you talk to anybody, any high school student, if you talk to parents of high school students, if you talk to teachers in the high school, like we've sort of all known this has to happen for any number of years.

680
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And the time is now.

681
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:22,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to push on that as best we can to make that a reality for fall.

682
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:25,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

683
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:26,624
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.

684
01:12:26,644 --> 01:12:32,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Jenny on the, you know, it's so long overdue.

685
01:12:33,626 --> 01:12:33,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

686
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:34,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

687
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:44,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, I think everybody who's everyone I've talked to talks about it gets that it's a heavy lift, but also that getting prepared to make that lift everyone's on that page.

688
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:47,150
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we got two more questions left.

689
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,171
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about on time.

690
01:12:49,875 --> 01:13:03,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, two and a half, there's a dueling questions for anyone who's seen it at the end and we'll take that one last, but just Rebecca's question is money from the override only required to go to the directed budget for the first year and after that could go anywhere else in the city budget.

691
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two answers to this question.

692
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:15,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition two and a half date law requires that in the first year, it goes towards the specific purposes outlined in the question.

693
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:18,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Those appropriations would be made

694
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:27,215
[SPEAKER_01]: people would be hired, things would be purchased, contracts would be signed based on those things.

695
01:13:27,856 --> 01:13:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second year, could the mayor and the school committee and the council then fire everybody that they just hired and go completely in another direction?

696
01:13:36,482 --> 01:13:40,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, is it legally allowed?

697
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:43,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, is it something that would be

698
01:13:44,577 --> 01:13:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: in the realm of possibility?

699
01:13:46,098 --> 01:13:46,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.

700
01:13:47,358 --> 01:13:52,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've all been very, very clear that what the purpose of these overrides are for.

701
01:13:52,580 --> 01:14:01,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anyone here, I think we've already been very clear that we don't like the fact that there are layoffs and position cuts and things happening now.

702
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:10,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly don't think that some massive bait and switch, I don't even know what we would put it into, to be honest.

703
01:14:10,227 --> 01:14:12,228
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the things that we want to do with the money.

704
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:14,049
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the things that we think are the priority of the city.

705
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:25,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's a little bit of trust that comes from that, and I acknowledge that, but we've been very clear about what these priorities are.

706
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it, especially on the school side, is also subject to negotiation, collective bargaining agreements, other laws, and that's what it is.

707
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been very clear that if these overrides are to pass,

708
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:49,964
[SPEAKER_01]: they would fund our schools, they would fund our educators, they would fund the people who work in our schools, they would hire a DPW street crew.

709
01:14:50,705 --> 01:14:55,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can say is that if the debt exclusion passes question six, that just have to go to the fire station.

710
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:56,608
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the law.

711
01:14:57,088 --> 01:15:00,710
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only pay for the bond for the fire station, period.

712
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:04,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the answer to that question.

713
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And can I just add to that?

714
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

715
01:15:09,576 --> 01:15:09,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually,

716
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: with Paul's help, hopped in the time machine and went back through our school budgets.

717
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:24,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see like, do we, you know, to answer the question, like, do we defund the schools ever?

718
01:15:24,643 --> 01:15:27,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is basically no.

719
01:15:27,705 --> 01:15:31,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are years where we've flatlined the budget of the schools.

720
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we did for fiscal year 2021.

721
01:15:33,289 --> 01:15:33,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So we

722
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: gave the schools the same exact appropriation for FY21 as they had for FY20.

723
01:15:42,308 --> 01:15:44,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That is effectively a cut in order to make that work.

724
01:15:45,511 --> 01:15:46,792
[SPEAKER_03]: We laid off staff.

725
01:15:47,212 --> 01:15:49,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would call that a flat line, right?

726
01:15:49,194 --> 01:15:53,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's effectively a cut, but the dollars from last year and the dollars from this year are the same.

727
01:15:54,198 --> 01:15:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have done that, and we have not invested enough, right?

728
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:05,047
[SPEAKER_03]: In our school budget to grow the budget enough to sort of prevent.

729
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:16,000
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had to go back to, like, the 80s to see a year where the number for this year was lower than the number for last year.

730
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was, like, in the middle of the financial crisis.

731
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:19,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

732
01:16:20,695 --> 01:16:32,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford certainly does have some history of flatlining the budget or for under investing, but we really don't have a history of defunding the school budget.

733
01:16:32,339 --> 01:16:36,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is what would have to happen to, like, move this money.

734
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:41,502
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have to be making choices to defund the school budget a year from now.

735
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:44,083
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not why I do this work.

736
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:50,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not why people pour their heart and their soul into helping lead our schools.

737
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:56,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a no on any proposal that defunds our schools.

738
01:16:56,588 --> 01:17:01,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the council, without exception, would also not agree to defund our schools.

739
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if it were proposed,

740
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:16,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any support for that and I also don't think having worked with the council and the mayor on the finance task force that anybody even wants to entertain that idea.

741
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire premise of this is to do more.

742
01:17:19,604 --> 01:17:19,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

743
01:17:21,906 --> 01:17:33,897
[SPEAKER_03]: just maybe rest assured that we don't have even a history of doing this sort of scary thing that is legally possible, but would require an inordinate amount of support to make it happen.

744
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no support for that concept here.

745
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:38,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jenny.

746
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to move to wrap up on

747
01:17:44,764 --> 01:17:46,324
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of questions.

748
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:51,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have dueling questions that I think probably none of us here on the panel are the people who should be answering these questions.

749
01:17:51,746 --> 01:17:55,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask us not to answer them, but I will read them since they have been asked.

750
01:17:55,747 --> 01:18:03,389
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, how could the CC and SC accept a pay raise when you say we're in dire need of money and then ask for an override?

751
01:18:04,089 --> 01:18:12,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been also countered with the question, how can we increase CC and SC pay to increase diversity on those bodies so they represent the city's diverse population?

752
01:18:13,012 --> 01:18:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are both.

753
01:18:15,701 --> 01:18:17,022
[SPEAKER_01]: viewpoints that people hold.

754
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:29,668
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a final question here, which is what is the impact of union student leadership, either having had posed or unsure yet on the overhead set exclusion.

755
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that the fire union is not supportive.

756
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:36,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teachers union has not yet made a decision.

757
01:18:37,252 --> 01:18:39,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't know what the impact of it is.

758
01:18:41,114 --> 01:18:41,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly,

759
01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:49,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope that in the case of the fire union, that they could put aside some of their differences with the mayor.

760
01:18:49,995 --> 01:19:05,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the funding of this project and that we are prioritizing funding a new fire station should be considered independently of the disputes that the mayor and the fire union have had over fire station design and other matters.

761
01:19:05,547 --> 01:19:06,808
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal opinion.

762
01:19:08,263 --> 01:19:23,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I've spoken to a lot of our educators about these questions and some support, some oppose, and I'll leave it up to the Medford Teachers Association and other educator unions here in the city to make the decision that they need to make in the time that they need to make it.

763
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:36,244
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I wanted to wrap up quickly unless, Paul, Jenny, you have anything else you wanna add before I just put out a few pitches to the folks who are still here.

764
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:38,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add that.

765
01:19:40,615 --> 01:19:42,536
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great questions.

766
01:19:42,636 --> 01:19:48,559
[SPEAKER_00]: There are undoubtedly 500 other questions that a group this size has.

767
01:19:49,679 --> 01:20:01,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I certainly, and I'm quite sure the other elected officials here, would be happy to make ourselves available to sit with you one-on-one to answer your questions and to get into the details.

768
01:20:01,985 --> 01:20:07,828
[SPEAKER_00]: As Zach and Jenny and Matt alluded to, some of these things are sort of outrageously complicated.

769
01:20:08,548 --> 01:20:12,311
[SPEAKER_00]: and not very well suited to this kind of a setting.

770
01:20:14,012 --> 01:20:24,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I will make myself available to anyone that wants to have a conversation about understanding something because a lot of the stuff is really, really hard.

771
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,921
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also, thanks, Paul.

772
01:20:28,582 --> 01:20:31,664
[SPEAKER_01]: To that point, there's also two more opportunities coming up for folks.

773
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:36,567
[SPEAKER_01]: If you thought of a question as we're wrapping up, or you think of one after you leave here tonight,

774
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:53,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Next Tuesday at 6pm we have a city council committee of the whole meeting in the city council chamber, where we will be talking kind of doing a similar q amp a style format, you'll hear from members of the council and basically answering the questions they feel like they can answer asked by the public.

775
01:20:54,461 --> 01:21:03,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we also have an in-person version of this event, an Invest in Medford community forum, Monday, October 21st at 7pm, and that's going to be at the library.

776
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:09,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are two more opportunities that we have for very similar events.

777
01:21:10,689 --> 01:21:17,232
[SPEAKER_01]: As Paul noted, you can reach out to us, investinmedford.gmail.com, or reach out to your elected officials.

778
01:21:18,093 --> 01:21:20,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Our contact information is online as well.

779
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny, if you want to

780
01:21:23,089 --> 01:21:27,390
[SPEAKER_01]: say anything, and then I'm just going to put a couple of resources in the chat really quick.

781
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:43,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach, the only thing I would say is the city put out earlier today a graphic about how we've used ARPA dollars, which I think has been a question that's out there.

782
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:47,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So check out the city's Facebook page or website to see that.

783
01:21:49,515 --> 01:21:54,519
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a sort of a deeper dive into question 7 and 8 that are.

784
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:02,006
[SPEAKER_03]: That is now done sort of almost hot off the presses and I think we can get that out in the morning.

785
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So be on the lookout for that.

786
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I'm happy to answer questions offline.

787
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:11,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I know many of you please don't hesitate to reach out.

788
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:29,288
[SPEAKER_03]: This is such a significant priority for me over the next couple of weeks, because it sets the stage for what the rest of this year becomes, and frankly, for what the future for our students becomes.

789
01:22:29,328 --> 01:22:31,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a big deal.

790
01:22:31,269 --> 01:22:33,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer questions any time.

791
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I will see maybe some of you at Walking Wednesday tomorrow at the Roberts, but grab me any time.

792
01:22:43,597 --> 01:22:44,978
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a question, happy to do it.

793
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, Jenny.

794
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:52,865
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, just want to share again, this was an Invest in Medford community forum.

795
01:22:53,625 --> 01:23:00,370
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested, you can go to investinmedford.com where you can find out some more information here.

796
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:11,339
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see our wonderful photos and of course, but we have the explanations on the three questions, including their full text.

797
01:23:12,335 --> 01:23:22,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our impact calculator based on fiscal 24 assessed values from the assessor's office and the division of local services override impact calculator here.

798
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:28,427
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, we're compelled tonight to get more involved, you can get involved.

799
01:23:28,487 --> 01:23:32,630
[SPEAKER_01]: You can submit a testimonial about why you support these questions.

800
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:40,675
[SPEAKER_01]: You can donate to the campaign so that we can get our message out there in these last three and a half, four weeks, get a yard sign.

801
01:23:40,695 --> 01:23:41,556
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a few left,

802
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:42,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many.

803
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:48,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can sign up to Canvas and talk to your neighbors about these important issues.

804
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some endorsements up here.

805
01:23:52,102 --> 01:23:56,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have endorsements from 11 of the 14 city elected officials.

806
01:23:56,384 --> 01:24:00,305
[SPEAKER_01]: We have endorsements from three of our four state elected officials.

807
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:04,207
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few organizations up here hoping to add some more soon.

808
01:24:05,588 --> 01:24:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And this great FAQ page.

809
01:24:08,396 --> 01:24:15,080
[SPEAKER_01]: which really gets into some of the details on what would be the impact if the overrides don't pass?

810
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need the overrides?

811
01:24:17,461 --> 01:24:19,602
[SPEAKER_01]: What are overrides and debt exclusions?

812
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:22,223
[SPEAKER_01]: How will they impact your taxes?

813
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:27,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just some of the information about how to measure taxes compared to other cities.

814
01:24:29,627 --> 01:24:36,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing that I think is just really important to note, our residential tax rate is the 93rd lowest out of the 97

815
01:24:37,486 --> 01:24:40,208
[SPEAKER_01]: MA cities and towns with population over 20,000.

816
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just a lot more here on the website.

817
01:24:44,272 --> 01:24:51,918
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are looking for more information, looking to share, looking to join our campaign, you can go to investinmedford.com.

818
01:24:52,838 --> 01:25:01,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really hope that folks here will strongly consider and commit to vote yes on questions six, seven, and eight on Tuesday, November 5th.

819
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail voting has already started.

820
01:25:04,007 --> 01:25:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Early voting starts Saturday, October 19th.

821
01:25:06,983 --> 01:25:15,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And election day, if you're voting at your polling location, if you haven't made your choice by Tuesday, November 5th, polling locations will be open 7 a.m.

822
01:25:15,106 --> 01:25:15,766
[SPEAKER_01]: to 8 p.m.

823
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:17,126
[SPEAKER_01]: on November 5th.

824
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:21,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really, really hope that everyone here will vote.

825
01:25:21,307 --> 01:25:24,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's fair to say that this panel hopes that folks will vote yes.

826
01:25:27,509 --> 01:25:29,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for a wonderful evening.

827
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:36,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate everyone being here and hope to see you over the next few weeks as we lead up to election day.

828
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:38,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

829
01:25:38,892 --> 01:25:39,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone.

830
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:40,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everyone.
