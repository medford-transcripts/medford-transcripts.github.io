[SPEAKER_00]: I'm someone who had, you know, thought Christine was doing an okay job, but when Anna really made it her business to get in touch with me, which I appreciated, we had the chance to, I had the chance to learn about her and then we had a chance to talk.

[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say, I was just super impressed.

00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:33,685
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's clear from everything that Anna has done that she has not only the kind of values that I think we all care about, but she has the passion and the willingness to really work hard and take on those people in the structures who don't want, really want change.

00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And they talk about change, but they don't really want to do it.
