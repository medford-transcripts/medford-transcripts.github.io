00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:12,685
Hi there is Anna Callahan, I'm one of your city counselors and today I want to talk a little bit about why we have these prop two and a half overrides on the ballot in November and why you should vote yes.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,306
So a lot of people may feel that they already pay a lot in taxes, and they want to know where that money is going.

3
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,288
I think that is a fair question.

4
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:27,793
I think, first, it's important to understand that it costs money to run a city.

5
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:34,158
So the question is, are we spending just as much as other cities but getting less in services?

6
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,802
Are we spending more money than other cities and somehow wasting it?

7
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:45,030
Are we spending less money and not able to meet our expenses?

8
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,953
So in fiscal year 2024, Medford ranks 320th out of 351 municipalities in our operating budget per capita.

9
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:06,890
Of all of the other 58 cities in Massachusetts, Medford spends less per person than every single one of those.

10
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:12,153
Our budget is smaller per person than every other city in Massachusetts.

11
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:17,636
Our budget is also smaller than 90% of all towns in Massachusetts.

12
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:21,198
90% of towns spend more per person than we do.

13
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,219
They have a larger budget than we do.

14
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,081
The few that spend less than we do are much smaller than we are.

15
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:36,436
So we really do not have a budget that is large enough to properly fund our city.

16
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,457
Our budget is too small.

17
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:44,399
I wanna get into a little bit of a detailed discussion of our budget.

18
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:55,123
And this idea, I've heard a lot of people talk about the idea that we should be able to like scrimp and save our way out of this budget crisis, right?

19
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,092
So let's go ahead and show you a graph that I made.

20
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,955
So this is our budget.

21
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,462
And I want you to just look at the largest expense we have.

22
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,263
This is our schools.

23
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:19,360
And I think everyone agrees, no matter what side of this issue of the Prop 2.5 issue you're on, everyone agrees that we need to fund our schools and properly fund them.

24
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:34,787
There was a crisis this year that we did not have enough in the operating budget to properly fund the schools now that the ARPA funds, the city, or sorry, the federal funds that were there for COVID, now that those funds have ended.

25
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:41,056
So we were looking for how to find at least three million, maybe five million more dollars to fund the schools.

26
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:44,802
So we're not taking money out of the school budget, that's for sure.

27
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,472
The second largest one is insurance.

28
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,334
Now, insurance is required by law.

29
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,978
Unfortunately, it goes up as well.

30
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,659
It's not something that stays fixed.

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,406
It's something that goes up, it increases every year just due to normal inflation and everything else.

32
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,048
And it's uncontrollable.

33
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:06,869
There's nothing we can do.

34
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,470
We cannot cut out of the insurance budget.

35
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,332
This next one is pensions.

36
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,571
Now, pensions, our contracts, we are required to fulfill by law.

37
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,751
They also are not staying the same or going down.

38
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,772
There is an uncontrollable expense.

39
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:24,212
We cannot take money out of the pensions budget.

40
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:27,073
Next is the fire department.

41
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,793
And after that is the police department.

42
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:40,115
I suspect that no one, no matter what side of the prop two and a half override question you are on, wants us to drastically cut our police and fire departments.

43
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:46,351
After police and fire, the next one is highway, right?

44
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:47,192
That's DBW highway.

45
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:48,153
That means our roads.

46
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:57,499
And I do want to get a little bit into roads because I think talking about roads can help people understand why we are in the situation that we are in.

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,525
We had a roads assessment done for the first time in 2019.

48
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:07,468
And that assessment rated our roads one, two, three, four, and five.

49
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,091
And with one being the best and five being the worst.

50
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:14,694
A full 49% of our roads rated four or five.

51
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,794
They're the worst two categories of roads.

52
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,294
Now, you can tell, right?

53
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:23,954
You know that.

54
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:24,814
I know that.

55
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:25,815
We drive on the roads.

56
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:26,755
I bike on the roads.

57
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:28,375
We walked on the sidewalks.

58
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:33,077
And we can all basically, we didn't need an assessment to tell us that.

59
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:44,020
But what the assessment can tell us is that it costs between 30 and 50 times as much to repair a category 5 road as it does to repair a category 2 road.

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:56,464
Now, if we just always fixed the Category 2 roads to Category 1 roads, if we just always fixed our roads every year, the state Chapter 90 funding, it would cover everything, right?

61
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:00,925
But when you allow your roads to fall into such disrepair,

62
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,817
You balloon this road debt, right?

63
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:14,842
You balloon the amount of money that's called a backlog, the amount of money it will take to repair your roads, because it costs so much more to repair dilapidated roads.

64
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:21,104
It's as if you have a house, and you allow a leak in your roof to continue.

65
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,146
You don't fix it, and you keep letting it get worse and worse.

66
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,546
That's going to destroy your ceiling.

67
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,827
It's going to destroy your hardwood floors.

68
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,388
It's going to destroy the ceiling on the next floor.

69
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:30,709
It costs more and more money.

70
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,272
by not repairing.

71
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:37,044
Now, we have underfunded our city for so long.

72
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:50,556
that we are ballooning these kinds of debt, the amount of capital projects, buildings, fire trucks that need to be replaced, that are long overdue for being replaced.

73
00:05:51,317 --> 00:06:05,947
We have many tens of millions of dollars, $67 million in road debt and many tens of millions of dollars in capital improvement debt because we have underfunded our city, chronically.

74
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:14,368
So going back to this, this is roads right there.

75
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:19,811
And we do not want to underfund our roads because it just makes the problem so much worse.

76
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:22,812
After roads is bonds.

77
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,074
That is debt that we must repay.

78
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,475
And again, we can't cut that.

79
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:34,438
It continues to increase, like not increase, but it continues to be something that we have to pay.

80
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,482
And then you get to the library facilities.

81
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:44,525
And there are other much, much, much smaller amounts in here.

82
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:52,250
But none of these are going to cover the $3 million that we need to give to the schools.

83
00:06:52,691 --> 00:07:03,758
So there is literally nowhere, unless you're willing to cut police and fire, there is nowhere to scrimp and save and find the money that we need to fund our schools.

84
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:18,949
The only way that we are going to get a budget that appropriately funds our schools and our roads is by doing what almost every other city and town in Massachusetts has done, which is to pass a Prop 2.5 override.

85
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:27,493
And I will also say that the proponents of Prop 2.5 in 1980, they didn't pass it to make it wrong or bad or illegal.

86
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:38,516
to increase taxes more than two and a half, not increase taxes by two and a half percent, but to increase the total amount, the total tax levy, the total amount of taxes that a city brings in more than two and a half percent.

87
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:48,158
They wanted cities to put them on the ballot so that when it was necessary and appropriate, those taxes would in fact go up.

88
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,539
So I hope that this has been informative.

89
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,001
I look forward to any kinds of questions that you have and do reach out.

90
00:07:57,461 --> 00:08:00,643
And I hope that everyone will vote yes on six, seven, and eight.

91
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:01,163
Thank you.
