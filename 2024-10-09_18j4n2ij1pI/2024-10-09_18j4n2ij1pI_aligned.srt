1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,009
Good news about the money too, so we'll get there.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,170
Before I start, I want to shout out our Council Vice President, Kit Collins, who is here.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,631
All right.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,152
Now, I know everyone's just here to see the giraffes.

5
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:18,493
We're going to do three things before then.

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,793
First, you're going to listen to me for a minute.

7
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,394
Hopefully you'll donate if you haven't already.

8
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:29,555
And then we're going to take a photo right around here so that we can show everyone how many people are psyched for this campaign.

9
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:32,527
correct.

10
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:37,310
It's a beautiful evening to be here with all of you, my neighbors.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:50,037
I want to thank the McGordys for hosting us, and I want to thank everyone for everything that they've done so far to build the foundation of this grassroots campaign to invest in Medford.

12
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,939
I want to talk a little bit about why we're here.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,003
We're here because we see the impact of chronic underfunding around all of us, all around us every day.

14
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,148
Kids without the resources they need to thrive.

15
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,649
Schools in desperate need of maintenance.

16
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:08,249
Teachers and paras who aren't paid enough.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,110
Not enough teachers and paras and staff in the first place.

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,452
Streets and sidewalks in such bad shape that people are getting hurt and everyone's cars constantly need repairs.

19
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:26,433
A 60-year-old fire headquarters without the proper living quarters and gear storage to keep our firefighters safe.

20
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,302
Not only do we see it, the numbers lay it out.

21
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:37,905
We're the fifth lowest in per capita spending of the 97 cities and towns with more than 20,000 people in Massachusetts.

22
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:40,306
92nd out of 97.

23
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:46,108
Fourth lowest residential property tax rate of that same group, 93rd out of 97.

24
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:56,132
And we're one of only 20 cities out of all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts that has never even tried to put an override or a debt exclusion on the ballot.

25
00:01:57,092 --> 00:02:03,018
Even the people who passed Proposition 2.5 in 1980 thought that these votes would be happening regularly.

26
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:08,303
It wasn't that we should starve government, it was just that people should know what their money's going towards.

27
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:11,446
And we have those items on the ballot today.

28
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:16,251
We're here because it's time to turn the ship around and invest in Medford.

29
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:26,709
Medford residents have been clamoring for the chance to vote to invest in our city, and elected officials have finally delivered by putting questions six, seven, and eight on the ballot on Tuesday, November 5th.

30
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,774
We need to spend the next two months pounding the pavement, raising money, and talking to our neighbors about why we need to vote yes to invest in our schools, our streets, and our fire department.

31
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:41,975
Now, this campaign is not going to be easy.

32
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,816
Some people may have seen the latest attack line.

33
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:46,697
Stop the scam.

34
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:55,568
Well, let me tell you now, I think calling the hard work of people coming together to invest in our community a scam is just plain weird.

35
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,008
Our kids are not a scam.

36
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,249
Our teachers and our firefighters are not a scam.

37
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:06,150
Walking or rolling or driving down the street safely is not a scam.

38
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,930
Doing the right thing for our city is not a scam.

39
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,951
So we're going to push back and we're going to push back hard.

40
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,792
We'll be correcting the record and busting these myths every day.

41
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:20,257
And we'll have resources to help you do it at investinmedford.com.

42
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:22,138
There's stuff up there now, go check it out.

43
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,618
There's gonna be even more rolling out over the next few weeks.

44
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,680
I need each and every one of you to be ambassadors for the truth here in Medford.

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,862
So sign up, most everyone did at the front, get trained on the facts and make sure you can step in and correct the record when the lies start coming out.

46
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,143
But pushing back just isn't enough.

47
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:42,604
We need to fight back in order to win.

48
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,517
That means we need to get the facts out to as many people as possible, especially with so many people voting by sending mailers and spending enough money to do this campaign right.

49
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:54,139
Our fundraiser goal was $50,000.

50
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,244
I want to thank everyone who's already given and raised over $6,000 just in the first two weeks of this campaign.

51
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:05,268
I especially want to thank Dave McKenna and Nicole Morrell, who gave $1,000 each.

52
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:05,529
Thank you.

53
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:14,998
I wrote a check tonight for $1,000 from my campaign funds because winning this campaign and investing in our future is way more important than me getting reelected.

54
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,820
So I want to thank everyone who's already donated.

55
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,082
Please donate if you haven't and get the word out to your neighbors.

56
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,364
I'm hoping we can raise another $6,000 tonight on our path to victory.

57
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,646
Thank you so much for letting me share my thoughts with you tonight.

58
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:37,389
I'm just so excited to talk to everybody, talk to our neighbors, and especially celebrate with some homegrown entertainment.

59
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:39,869
I love this city.

60
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:46,674
We have a truly transformative opportunity to build a better future for Medford and I'm glad to be here with you over the next two months to make it happen.

61
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,897
Last week I was reminded of some great words from a great campaign.

62
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,139
I'm fired up.

63
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,100
Are you fired up?

64
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,421
I'm ready to go.

65
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:57,642
Are you ready to go?

66
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,404
Fired up.

67
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:01,445
Ready to go.

68
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:03,166
Fired up.

69
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:04,928
Ready to go.

70
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:06,649
Let's win this thing.

71
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,204
Alright, now we need to take that photo so folks could gather here.
