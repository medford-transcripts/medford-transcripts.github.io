2-1-396 offered by Councilor Mox and Councilor Falco.

50
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:38,296
Be it resolved that Medford High School student athlete, Kaylee Layla be recognized for her hard work and determination for being the first female player on the Medford High School JV baseball team.

51
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,137
Councilor Mox.

52
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:42,711
Thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:49,954
It's an honor and a pleasure to rise here tonight to recognize one of Meffitt's finest that we have in the audience tonight.

54
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,354
Kaylee, can you stand up, please?

55
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,780
Mr. President, as early as age five,

56
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:15,269
Kaylee used to play baseball, T-ball, in the backyard with her grandpa, Papa.

57
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,011
And that's Richard Laidlaw.

58
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:24,559
And as early as age five, Kaylee used to say to her grandpa, someday I want to play baseball for Meffitt High School.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,802
And her grandpa, like every other grandpa, would say, OK, maybe someday you'll play baseball.

60
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:35,143
And he used to tap her on the shoulder and say, maybe someday you'll play.

61
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:49,687
And then Kaylee, knowing that she was ambitious and wanted to succeed, spent countless hours practicing and honing in our skills at Gillis Park.

62
00:03:50,763 --> 00:04:00,828
While other kids were out doing different things, Kaylee was down there with an instructor, learning how to catch, hit, run, the fundamentals of baseball, Mr. President.

63
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,850
It was her dream to play baseball at Meffitt High School.

64
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,452
Through hard work and determination,

65
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:22,019
Kaylee earned a spot on Meffitt High School baseball team, breaking the glass ceiling for many other young women becoming the first female to play Meffitt High School JV baseball.

66
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,624
I'm offering a motion tonight, Mr. President, requesting that the city council recognize Kaylee Laylaw

67
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:40,650
for her dedication and commitment by issuing a formal council accommodation recognizing her first of a kind accomplishments in this community.

68
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:51,471
Also, Mr. President, I would like to recognize at this time, we have not only Kaylee here, but we have the entire baseball team.

69
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,711
How often do you see an entire team, Mr. President?

70
00:04:54,992 --> 00:05:06,235
I think it speaks volumes for the camaraderie and the feelings that all the players have for each other and the fact that they have these same feelings for Kaylee and honor Kaylee.

71
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,415
So if the baseball team could please stand up.

72
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:10,556
Come on, everyone stand up.

73
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:30,951
I was also told, Mr. President, from Gino DeSimone, who's the coach in the back.

74
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,733
And the one thing he said, please don't have me speak.

75
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:39,615
So I know he's a man of few words, but carries a big stick.

76
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,396
I understand that.

77
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,796
So we're not going to have Gino speak.

78
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:48,059
But Gino has done a tremendous job as coach of the JV team.

79
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:53,958
He's done a tremendous job bringing in this group of kids, Mr. President.

80
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:55,960
Their record's two, three, and one.

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,723
And I know they can only get better as the year goes on.

82
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:05,570
But on a good piece, Mr. President, they just had a game against Lynn Classical.

83
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:12,437
And Kaylee hit a double, bringing in two runs, Mr. President, which won them the game.

84
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:37,533
So I think, Mr. President, what we see here tonight is really a group of kids getting together, banding together, being able to accomplish goals, Mr. President, goals in which unite everyone as a community.

85
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:41,994
And now more than ever, I think we need to look to this team,

86
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:50,256
as leaders, Mr. President, in a community that I believe is currently divided over a lot of different issues.

87
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:55,458
And here we have youngsters that are saying how it is to work together.

88
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,199
No matter who you are, let's work together.

89
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,399
Let's unite for a common goal.

90
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,680
And we're seeing that tonight here with these players, Mr. President.

91
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,321
I want to thank the coach.

92
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,441
I want to thank the team.

93
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:07,702
I want to thank Kaylee.

94
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:11,923
And last but not least, Kaylee's family, Mr. President.

95
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:18,996
Because without that support at home, and the parents that drive, a lot of the parents are here tonight.

96
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:20,437
I see them in the back row.

97
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,997
They're the ones that get the kids back and forth.

98
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:25,378
They're the ones that go out and get the equipment when needed.

99
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,839
They're the ones that take the Saturday nights, the Sundays, the Monday practices, the Tuesday, the Wednesday.

100
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,239
They're the ones that put in the hard work as well.

101
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,740
So this is truly a family effort, Mr. President.

102
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:41,464
So on behalf of this council, I'd like to personally, I know my colleagues have things to say.

103
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,926
I'd like to personally thank the Laidlaw family.

104
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:46,767
I'd like to congratulate Kaylee.

105
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:54,191
I'd like to congratulate the team, the coach, Method Sports in general, Mr. President, all the student athletes.

106
00:07:54,652 --> 00:08:05,778
And I would ask that we send out a council accommodation and also take a team picture as well as a picture with Kaylee and her family once the council is done giving their accolades, Mr. President.

107
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:06,459
Thank you.

108
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:07,872
Councilor Falco.

109
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:09,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:14,053
Thank you, Councilor Marks, as a co-sponsor of this resolution.

111
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:17,874
I'm very proud to be part of this offering a resolution.

112
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:22,215
And I'm really, really proud of Kaylee and this accomplishment.

113
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,255
I've known Kaylee for many years.

114
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,215
She lives a few doors down from my house.

115
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:34,837
I remember seeing her in the neighborhood as a little kid and my son, Jack, played baseball with Kaylee throughout the years.

116
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,277
And to see her,

117
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:43,862
uh, progress, uh, over time, you know, playing at Gillis Park, where I feel it was like a second home for many years.

118
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:51,626
Uh, it's remarkable to see, you know, the commitment, the energy, the dedication, the perseverance, and always wanting to do better.

119
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:59,030
And I saw that firsthand and you really knew, uh, from early on that she was, she was a remarkable baseball player and still is.

120
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:02,520
And to see that firsthand was really something special.

121
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:06,203
And I want to congratulate you on this accomplishment.

122
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,444
You know, Councilor Marks hit it on the head.

123
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:17,471
You know, it takes support from everyone, especially supportive family to get you to practices, to help you practice, to always be there for you.

124
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:24,355
But you take a look at the greater baseball community that is here tonight and coming together and supporting everyone.

125
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,577
That's what it comes down to, comes to support.

126
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:39,674
You're right, this community is fractured in many ways, but this here is nice to see people coming together, supporting one another, being there for one another, and take a look at all these baseball faces that I haven't seen in quite some time.

127
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:43,815
And it really brings a smile to my face to see what we can be as a community.

128
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:47,436
And Kaylee, thank you for all of your hard work, your dedication.

129
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:50,057
I wish you well, and congratulations.

130
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:51,077
Thank you.

131
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:53,118
Thank you.

132
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:54,738
Councilor Scarbelli.

133
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:58,209
Thank you, Mr. President, and I congratulate Kaylee.

134
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,671
I think this is an unbelievable accomplishment.

135
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:12,977
I've watched Kaylee play as a coach and member of North Medford Board and Medford Little League, and watched the commitment of her mom and her family, and it's amazing to see.

136
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,498
This is what Medford's all about.

137
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,700
This is why people move to Medford.

138
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,063
Coach Vonnegut, Coach Pazzarello, Coach DeSimone, Coach Quinlan,

139
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,752
Coach Bell that's not here, I know that.

140
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:31,857
Coach Nesta when he was here, one thing you knew about the baseball team, they always took care of each other.

141
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:38,083
If one of their kids passed away, one of their grandparents or teammates' grandparents passed away,

142
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,728
You know this team would always rally around each other.

143
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,869
What you're seeing tonight is exactly what Councilmarks brought up.

144
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:50,232
This is what we need, a diverse group of kids that love each other, love Medford, and want to support each other no matter what.

145
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:54,814
As a former softball coach at Medford High School, I'm sure, Kayla, you've gotten the phone calls, right?

146
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,115
Jeez, you should be playing softball.

147
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,991
it takes a strong person to do what you're doing.

148
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:12,335
You stepped up, you had a dream, you've had coaches that believed in you, teammates that believed in you, parents and grandparents that believed in you, and the biggest, most important piece of this, Kaylee, you believed in yourself, and you went out and did something special.

149
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:13,895
So this is what it's all about.

150
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:16,256
This is what makes Medford great.

151
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:21,578
And I'm proud to be a parent of a baseball player.

152
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:26,280
I'm proud of a lot of these young men and women that are here because I've watched them all grow up, and to be there,

153
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:27,882
is so important.

154
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:30,523
Don't ever forget that because that's that's important.

155
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:33,244
Always support the people around you when they need you.

156
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:36,345
So congratulations and keep up the good work.

157
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,045
Method Mustangs.

158
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:37,666
That's amazing.

159
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:38,066
Thank you.

160
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:39,386
Vice President Knight.

161
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,167
Mr. President, thank you very much.

162
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:43,147
First of all, Kelly, congratulations.

163
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:54,351
Although I didn't have the opportunity to be on the board of the North Method Little League or watch him play with football in the backyard with your grandfather, I did have the opportunity to watch him coach my son in T-ball last year.

164
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:55,876
And you did a hell of a job.

165
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:01,097
The Orioles were the best t-ball team in Memphis Little League last year because of Kelly and her mom.

166
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,177
So let me tell you, we did it.

167
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:02,997
We had a great year.

168
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,358
We had a great season.

169
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:13,199
But it's very flattering and quite humbling to see someone at such a young age pursue something that they love against all odds and be so successful.

170
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,100
And really, Kelly, this is a great achievement that you should be proud of.

171
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,580
And I just want to say congratulations.

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,581
And we hope to have you back on the t-ball field next year coaching.

173
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,698
Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:32,983
Yeah, Taley, I just wanna echo my colleagues and say that this is a tremendous accomplishment that you should absolutely be proud of that you've really earned.

175
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:37,227
And I'm so heartened to see your whole team here to support you and of course your family.

176
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:43,432
And it's really incredibly admirable to pursue what you're passionate about regardless of the barriers.

177
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,774
And I think that's something everyone, a lesson we could all learn.

178
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:51,638
So I hope you will keep chipping at that glass ceiling for all of us and congratulations on this accomplishment.

179
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,220
Thank you.

180
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,171
Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:12:55,351 --> 00:13:06,960
I don't think I could say it any better than my colleagues have already, but it really is a fantastic accomplishment, and it's especially great to see the team spirit and see so many people here tonight with you, supporting you.

182
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,943
So I'm excited to see what you continue to do as you continue to grow as a player.

183
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:12,704
Thank you.

184
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:14,765
Thank you, Council President.

185
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:17,147
For myself, being the parent of a

186
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:19,808
student athletes in the past.

187
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:32,854
I know the dedication it takes for the parents that do this every week and for a young woman like Kaylee to overcome the odds of doing what she did is an achievement in itself.

188
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:43,640
So again, I want to thank you for myself, but again, thank all your team players who are here to support you, your parents who will put in the time, take you to practice every week and drive you here and there.

189
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:44,948
And thank you to everybody.

190
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:56,754
Again, thank you to the team and the coaches, everybody for the support that you've given this young lady.

191
00:13:56,874 --> 00:14:02,156
Yes, we're on the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Falco.

192
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,277
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

193
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:06,678
Councilor Behrs?

194
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:07,038
Yes.

195
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:07,879
Councilor Falco?

196
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:08,099
Yes.

197
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:08,959
Vice President Knight?

198
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:09,599
Yes.

199
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,240
Councilor Marks?

200
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,700
Yes.

201
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,460
Councilor Morrell?

202
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes.

203
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,621
Councilor Scarpelli?

204
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:13,161
Yes.

205
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:23,095
Yes, motion passes on the motion by Council box for a brief recess for a brief recess seconded by Councilor Belco.

206
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,576
So could please call the roll.

207
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:26,477
Yes.

208
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:28,078
Yes.

209
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,219
Yes.

210
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:30,620
Yes.

211
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,640
Yes.

212
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:32,981
Yes.

213
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:34,002
Yes.

214
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:21,333
We revert back to regular business.

215
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:23,554
Okay.

216
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:41,278
2-1-397 offered by Councilor Marks, be resolved that Meffitt's heroine of the American Revolution, Sarah Bradley Fulton, be recognized for her courage and outstanding achievements, and be it fully resolved that the city of Meffitt declare a day in early October as Sarah Bradley Fulton Day.

217
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,218
Councilor Marks.

218
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:44,772
Thank you, Mr. President.

219
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:54,534
Again, it's with great honor that I rise here tonight to bring up a former resident of this community, Mr. President, Sarah Bradley Fulton.

220
00:21:55,175 --> 00:22:05,877
Sarah lived from 1740 to 1835 and was Method's heroine of the American Revolution, often called the mother of the Boston Tea Party.

221
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:15,899
as she came up with the idea to disguise the Sons of Liberty as Mohawk Indians and helped her Boston sister-in-law outfit them.

222
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,905
Sarah was appointed leader of the Daughters of Liberty, who oversaw the boycott of the British goods.

223
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:29,871
She organized a makeshift hospital in Medford for the injured American soldiers.

224
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,173
Following the Battle of Bunker Hill,

225
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:42,878
Famously, Sarah Bradley Fulton acted as a spy, delivering dispatches from General Washington behind enemy lines.

226
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,500
President Washington thanked Ms.

227
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:59,053
Fulton for her heroics by making a personal visit to see her at her Method Farmhouse, located in the vicinity of Fulton Street, which is named after her following her death.

228
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:06,773
The Marquise de Lafayette also visited Sarah at her home to say thanks.

229
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:25,582
It's also fitting that the city of Method follow the lead of George Washington and Lafayette by honoring one of their own, by declaring Sarah Bradley Fulton Day in early October of 2021.

230
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:43,670
Mr. President, we have the distinct honor, if any one of the council has any questions, we happen to have Sarah Bradley Fulton herself here tonight in the audience.

231
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:54,578
And if any members of the council have any question why we should recognize Sarah, I think the only appropriate person to answer would be Sarah herself.

232
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,140
So Sarah, are you in the audience?

233
00:23:58,017 --> 00:23:58,437
Yes, she is.

234
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:05,661
Good evening, Sarah.

235
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,082
Good evening.

236
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:08,803
I'm Sarah Bradley Fulton.

237
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:13,325
I'm residing at my farmhouse on Fulton Street.

238
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,626
I'm delighted to be here this evening.

239
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,207
I see all you gentlemen.

240
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:18,288
The lady, too.

241
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,008
Very good.

242
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,109
Very good.

243
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,730
Methinks Medford needs a day in my honor.

244
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,171
Do you agree?

245
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:25,691
Yes.

246
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:25,952
Yes.

247
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:40,906
In 1835, it was so very nice of the officials of Method Town to set aside a street in my honor.

248
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:53,241
And I'm so delighted by that, but don't you think we now need a day in my honor so that people will know what that street was named for?

249
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:54,401
Do you agree?

250
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,322
Yes, we agree.

251
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:58,243
Thank you so much.

252
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:03,326
And if you have any questions you may ask me, otherwise I have to make my way back to the farmhouse.

253
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:06,928
As you may recall, I do have nine children to take care of.

254
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:10,326
Councilor Falco.

255
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:13,148
If I may, thank you for joining us tonight.

256
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,031
And we also named a schoolhouse after you too.

257
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:17,932
You did?

258
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:19,093
Yes, you did.

259
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:23,076
I graduated from the Sarah Bradley Fulton Elementary School.

260
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,577
How wonderful.

261
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:25,037
Back in the 1970s.

262
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:27,359
When?

263
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,880
Oh, yeah, that's very interesting, yes.

264
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,682
Yes, yes, at the top of Fulton Street.

265
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:34,703
Very far, very far.

266
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:44,548
Many of my aunts and uncles, many of them, they're not with us any longer, but they graduated from that same school back years ago, as did my father.

267
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,210
So you live in Medford then?

268
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,691
I do, yes, I do live in Medford.

269
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,472
Oh, very nice, very nice.

270
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:52,653
I actually live on Fulton Spring Road.

271
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:53,895
Oh, you do?

272
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:56,016
There's a Fulton Spring Road now also?

273
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:57,377
There is, you are correct.

274
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,218
Oh, that's wonderful.

275
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,879
I must say I'm quite pleased.

276
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,682
But I'm definitely in favor of having a day to recognize you.

277
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:07,622
Thank you so much, sir.

278
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:10,344
I'm very happy that my colleague, Consular Marks, brought this presentation forward.

279
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,325
I want you to thank him very much.

280
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:13,165
Thank you so much.

281
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:18,408
And do come by the farmhouse and we have a wonderful rum punch that we will share with you.

282
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:20,809
Medford rum, of course.

283
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:21,769
Let's see.

284
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:33,385
The story goes that when Judge Washington visits Sarah, that Sarah offered Judge Washington this method punch, and he accepted, correct?

285
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,985
He seemed to like it quite a bit, yes.

286
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:37,305
He did indeed.

287
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,406
So he was a teetotaler then?

288
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:42,086
Not that night he was.

289
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:45,887
No, no, no indeed, no indeed.

290
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,187
Okay, let's move on.

291
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:49,087
Thank you so much, and I must take my leave.

292
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,188
Councilor Scalzi.

293
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:50,608
Oh, yes.

294
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:51,068
Thank you, Ms.

295
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:51,448
Wilk.

296
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:54,445
Maybe you should talk to the mayor.

297
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:55,546
Is that the budget?

298
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:56,726
You're very persuasive.

299
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:04,990
On all serious notes, I think this is a very good resolution.

300
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:11,672
The fact that when you talk about the Mefford history, a lot of people focus on the Brooks estate, the royal house.

301
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:14,854
The focus is really on one side of Mefford.

302
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,435
But you realize how important that the north side of Mefford

303
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:23,691
historical sites and landmarks and people that reside in that neighborhood and how important that is.

304
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:32,785
So I appreciate Councilor Marks bringing this forward and I too will support a day named after you.

305
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:34,549
I thank you so much.

306
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:39,212
It's nice to have a woman remembered during the Revolutionary War, because we were there.

307
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:42,774
We may not have been written in the books, but we were definitely helping.

308
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:45,135
And it's so nice of you to acknowledge all of that.

309
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,437
And I thank all of you with my heart.

310
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:48,277
Thank you so much.

311
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:48,778
Oh, don't go away.

312
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:49,838
Don't go away.

313
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:50,799
Oh, I have to go.

314
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:51,499
Not done yet.

315
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,843
And I'm happy to let you know, I've been a lifelong resident of the Fulton Heights neighborhood.

316
00:27:56,983 --> 00:28:01,986
So the whole area around your former farmhouse, we call the Fulton Heights today.

317
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:03,087
Fulton Heights.

318
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:03,527
Yes.

319
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:06,389
That's so nice.

320
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:06,909
Yes.

321
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,671
And I fully support this.

322
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,334
I think it's incredibly important that we recognize our history.

323
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:22,160
And a little bit, I think, after your first work with the Tea Party, Abigail Adams said, remember the women.

324
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,661
So I think it's very apt.

325
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:25,282
She did indeed say that.

326
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:25,602
Right.

327
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:26,723
Remember the women.

328
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:27,584
Right?

329
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:30,939
Thank you.

330
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,679
Councilor Morrell.

331
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,860
Thank you, Mr. President.

332
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,601
Yes, the theme of the night sponsored by Councilor Mark seems to be remarkable women.

333
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:40,262
So I am all for it, past and present.

334
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:44,284
And I think we need to honor the contributions of many, many more women.

335
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:47,145
So I'm fully in favor of this day and I thank you for coming out.

336
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,346
Your mic's off.

337
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:55,687
Pat, the mic and the podium is off.

338
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,109
One second, your mic went off, Laura.

339
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:00,269
There you go.

340
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,751
The mic's back there.

341
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:05,333
It's a mechanism to speak.

342
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:07,734
I'm so sorry.

343
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,275
Yes.

344
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,139
Are we all done?

345
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:14,359
No.

346
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:19,542
As president of the council, I thank you for coming down this evening and thank you, Councilor Marks, for putting this forward.

347
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:22,684
And I am in full support of naming a day after you also.

348
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:24,445
So again, thank you for coming here.

349
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:24,886
Mr. President.

350
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:33,889
If I could, just for the edification of the viewing audience, there's a great story that's on Meffitt Community Media.

351
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,329
You can go on at any time.

352
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:41,131
It's the story of Sarah Bradley Fulton, which is the heroine of the American Revolution.

353
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:51,594
I believe it's 33 minutes long, and it's a great depiction of what Sarah did for not only the city of Meffitt, or the township of Meffitt at the time,

354
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:54,556
but also for the entire country, Mr. President.

355
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:59,600
And I think anyone that wants to read up on Sarah or view, I think that would be an excellent idea.

356
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,002
I also want to thank, you probably don't know her, Laura Duggan.

357
00:30:03,022 --> 00:30:03,703
Who?

358
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:04,703
Laura Duggan.

359
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:07,185
Oh, she is?

360
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:07,846
She is.

361
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:08,126
Oh.

362
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:18,147
She's a local historian that does tremendous work on local access and keeping up with Memphis history.

363
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:21,648
And you know, you really should pay a visit to her as well.

364
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,149
Well, I'll make a note of that.

365
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,330
Thank you very much, sir.

366
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,530
Yes, very much.

367
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,051
So, okay.

368
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:32,473
On the motion by Vice President Knight.

369
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,294
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

370
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:35,795
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

371
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:39,107
Motion is to create the date, Mr. President.

372
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:41,128
Sarah Brown, the full date.

373
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:45,131
Early October of this year, Mr. President.

374
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:47,133
Thank you.

375
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,090
We appreciate it.

376
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,211
Is that the same rum that Bill Cummings used to sell?

377
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:52,191
What's that?

378
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,852
Is that the same rum that Bill Cummings made his fortune on?

379
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:56,532
The method rum?

380
00:30:57,152 --> 00:30:57,692
The method punch?

381
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:58,833
Oh, the method rum.

382
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:01,033
The method punch that Bill did?

383
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,374
Yes, it's quite tasty.

384
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,955
My husband's a distillery, works for the distillery.

385
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,675
That's why we had a good supply.

386
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,016
And then we use my grandmother's recipe.

387
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:11,716
It's the best.

388
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:18,101
So if you want to visit me on the farmhouse on Fulton Street, I would be delighted to give you a taste.

389
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:20,583
Maybe more, if you're good.

390
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:22,205
Mr. Clerk, call the roll, please.

391
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:23,726
Councilor Behrs?

392
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:24,326
Yes.

393
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:25,387
Councilor Felco?

394
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:25,527
Yes.

395
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:26,788
Vice President Knight?

396
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:26,868
Yes.

397
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,009
Councilor Marks?

398
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,550
Yes.

399
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,791
Councilor Morrell?

400
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:30,892
Yes.

401
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:31,753
Councilor Scarpelli?

402
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:32,213
Yes.

403
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:32,293
Yes.

404
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:33,214
So moved and seconded the motion.

405
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:34,735
Passenger Sara, thank you very much for coming.

406
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:35,236
Thank you.

407
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:35,656
Thank you.

408
00:31:42,223 --> 00:32:00,776
21-399 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Memphis City Council recognize the American Legion Post 45 for its hard work and dedication in the annual coordination of hundreds of volunteers decorating the final resting place of over 8,500 Methodist veterans in honor of Memorial Day.

409
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:01,757
Vice President Knight.

410
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:03,860
Mr. President, thank you very much.

411
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:14,413
I think we'd be remiss in not pointing out the hard work and dedication that our friends at American Legion Post 45 have put forth year after year to ensure that the city of Medford is in compliance with General Logan's order.

412
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:16,556
This year was the

413
00:32:17,897 --> 00:32:20,038
the first time we were able to convene since the pandemic.

414
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:22,200
And this is one of my favorite events that we have every year.

415
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,903
And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we point out the hard work that our friends at The Post do.

416
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:40,692
And also a familiar face that was missing this year, John Granara, someone who has led the charge in ensuring that these graves get decorated annually, was someone that used to run our annual Memorial Day ceremonies.

417
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:46,256
He's had some health issues that have rendered him unable to participate in the way that he used to.

418
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:53,728
When I went out to decorate flags with my family, Mr. President, the first person I saw there working out of the trunk of his car was John Granara with a set of maps.

419
00:32:54,787 --> 00:33:00,549
a list of names, who the people were, where they're supposed to go, how many graves they're going to be decorating, how much time it's going to take.

420
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,330
He'd have chaperones and proctors there to make sure that the work was getting done correctly.

421
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,591
Um, even a small little training, uh, before he allowed people to go out to, uh, to, to put flags on veterans graves, Mr. President.

422
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:15,053
Um, so I think it's very important that we point out the work that our friends, uh, have done over there at post 45, um, anytime

423
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:19,908
that the city of Medford calls on them, they're there to deliver.

424
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:25,832
If we remember back just a couple of years ago, we weren't able to have the local elections at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

425
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:29,013
And the first people to step up were our friends at American Legion Post 45.

426
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:33,456
The veterans in this community are very active, and they deserve to be remembered, Mr. President.

427
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:45,602
And in that regard, I invite here this evening our Veterans Service Director, Mike Durham, to say a few words on behalf of the Memorial Day ceremonies and the efforts that went into getting the city prepared and the cemetery prepared.

428
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:46,562
for that event.

429
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:49,584
So, with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case and thank my council colleagues.

430
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:53,747
I'd ask them to support the resolution and also offer Mr. Durham an opportunity to speak.

431
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:54,808
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

432
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:56,209
Good evening, Mike.

433
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:57,230
Name and address of the record, please.

434
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:02,834
Tim, Todd, put the mic on.

435
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:03,535
There we go.

436
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,078
Michael Durham, 85 George P. Hassett Drive.

437
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:09,279
I'm the Director of Veterans Services for the City of Medford.

438
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,281
Thank you for inviting me here tonight to say a couple words.

439
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,812
I think Vice President Knight knocked it out of the park.

440
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:22,537
The American Legion Post 45 bends over backwards every year to mark those graves.

441
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:29,163
You know, our surrounding communities, Somerville has as little as 12 flags that they have to put down.

442
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:31,405
The average is maybe 500 at most.

443
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:32,906
Medford is close to 9000.

444
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:33,847
We're actually at 8700 this year.

445
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:42,433
And without the dedication of that nonprofit and those key individuals, it couldn't be done the way it is.

446
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:46,834
We don't have the capacity in-house, and they really supplement us every year.

447
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:56,096
They reached out in April, like is normal, just to start the planning process and reach out to the community to get volunteers and coordinate them.

448
00:34:56,376 --> 00:35:01,197
And it couldn't be done without those key individuals and that nonprofit.

449
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:02,658
So thank you.

450
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:03,718
That was very well said.

451
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,908
If it's okay, may I say a couple words about the 77th anniversary of D-Day?

452
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,629
Because that went by on June 6th, and I think it's something that maybe we should say a couple words on.

453
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,669
So I jotted down a little speech here.

454
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:28,751
I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the 77th anniversary of D-Day and to thank all the World War II veterans living in Medford for what you sacrificed and what you accomplished.

455
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:32,572
You secured the continuation of our freedom as a people,

456
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:40,696
and preserve the existence of democratic governance across the globe.

457
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:43,877
22,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on June 6th alone.

458
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:54,942
I had the opportunity to speak with former Command Sergeant Major Rock Marin, who parachuted into France prior to the D-Day amphibious landings with the U.S.

459
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,803
Army's 82nd Airborne Division.

460
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:02,486
He was a private in his company, and by the next day, he was the first sergeant due to losses.

461
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:15,145
He described the fighting as so intense that he and his fellow paratroopers ran out of ammunition that night and resorted to fighting the enemy hand to hand with bayonets in the darkness.

462
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:20,587
He has since passed, and I was lucky to be able to hear his firsthand account of the war.

463
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:24,168
This opportunity is fleeting for our community.

464
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:28,090
There's still a handful of World War II veterans living amongst us.

465
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:34,015
If you know your neighbor is one, stop to speak with them before it's too late to do so.

466
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:36,756
They are truly the greatest generation.

467
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:43,739
The scope and scale of what they accomplished has never been replicated, and hopefully it will never need to be.

468
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,580
But that depends on us as a people.

469
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,942
Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.

470
00:36:51,162 --> 00:37:04,206
There are nations and non-state actors across the globe whose ethical foundations are diametrically opposed to our nation's ethical values of liberty, justice, tolerance, and inclusion of all under the law.

471
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:09,467
They will not stop until our nation and way of life has perished from this earth.

472
00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:18,490
I have seen this hatred of our nation and of our culture firsthand overseas, and it is unwavering in its commitment to our destruction.

473
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,848
We cannot squander what was won by our greatest generation.

474
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:34,152
It's fine to have disagreements and differences of opinion, and that is healthy for our country and our democracy, and competition breeds excellence.

475
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:46,516
However, it is vital to remember that we are all Americans, and we, as a people, have the same fundamental values based off love of liberty and justice.

476
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:59,219
We cannot be blinded by our perceived adversaries when there are so many legitimate and capable foes across the globe who would take advantage of our internal strife.

477
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,848
Families fight, but at the end of the day, they're still family, like it or not.

478
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:20,073
Let us honor the sacrifices of our D-Day veterans by remembering that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

479
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:26,197
As long as that remains true, their sacrifice will continue to be honored.

480
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:29,420
Thank you very much for inviting me.

481
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,200
So, Durham, I'm going to be honest with you.

482
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,861
My children were in the back watching the celebration the other day.

483
00:38:50,501 --> 00:39:00,664
And when you typically go to a celebration to honor our veterans, you hear a lot of warm and fluffy stories, and deservedly so.

484
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:02,904
But your speech resignated.

485
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:11,867
And I hope if people can see that, if it's played back, I think it's a true understanding of people like yourself and your colleagues that gave their lives for this country.

486
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:19,650
I think Councilor Falco, myself, when we started in school committee, one of the first things we want to do is bring civics back to our community, back to the city.

487
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:35,958
And what we're seeing is the basic irresponsibility of us as Americans and educators at the time to teach our kids what the flag really means, what the Pledge of Allegiance really means, and why it's so important.

488
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:43,668
and that celebration of the 9000 flags that put that and the work that Mr Granada has done year after year.

489
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:55,896
I think it's something that has to be honored, cherished and also our Children should be educated because it is important because we don't know where we're going unless we know where we've been.

490
00:39:56,436 --> 00:40:03,141
And if people don't understand what our military, what our veterans have done, um, we can't move forward.

491
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:09,947
So I really think that we talked about the separation in our community right now, and I think that's one of the pieces we need to bring together.

492
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:15,452
And I think that your words spoke volumes of why we do what we do here.

493
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,875
So I think that I just want to

494
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:45,375
Thank you, and thank you 1,000 times over, not just for your service, but also for the effort that you're putting into making sure that the community and the people of this community understand how important the flag is, what the POW flag means on that pole, and how important it is to this country, and the basic rights that everybody has in this country because of the work that you and your colleagues have done.

495
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:46,593
Thank you so much.

496
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,594
We should never forget our veterans.

497
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:56,276
And again, people should really take time to watch a retape of that speech because it speaks volumes.

498
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:56,816
So thank you.

499
00:40:56,836 --> 00:40:58,817
Thank you.

500
00:40:58,837 --> 00:40:59,797
Vice President Knight.

501
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:13,501
Mr. President, if we look at our packets this evening under suspension, there's also paper 21405, recognizing June 6th as the anniversary of D-Day and requesting that this evening's meeting be dedicated to the honor of our World War II veterans.

502
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,322
And I just ask that these two papers be combined.

503
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:17,962
What number was that, Councilor?

504
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:17,962
21405.

505
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:24,103
21405.

506
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:24,103
We're going to combine those two.

507
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:30,925
Councilor Pietrangelo, do you want to speak?

508
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:31,145
Yeah.

509
00:41:33,185 --> 00:41:34,125
Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:35,465
Thank you, Director Durham.

511
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:43,607
I want to echo what Councilor Scarpelli said about the words that you, the speech that you gave at our Memorial Day remembrance.

512
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:59,413
And, you know, luckily was able to get part of a transcript, share it out with some people that I know, because I think all too often we forget that we've been in the longest war that we've, you know, this is the longest war we've ever been in the war that we're still fighting right now.

513
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,918
And I really also appreciated you bringing to light

514
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:13,243
that there are people coming back who wouldn't have come back before, that, you know, we aren't doing the work to reintegrate them into our society and make sure that they're welcome and they're getting the jobs that they need.

515
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,406
So I think that's just a really important thing to put out there.

516
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:20,751
But I also want to acknowledge our World War II veterans.

517
00:42:21,612 --> 00:42:23,373
My uncle Bill fought at the Battle of the Bulge.

518
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:24,595
My

519
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:34,839
Grandfather was part of the occupation of Japan and I'm lucky too, that they were historians themselves and they shared those stories with us.

520
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:45,685
And I hope that for the World War II veterans who are still here, people can really hear their stories because that was a fight for the future of the world.

521
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:50,928
And I don't think people really understand what was at stake and what they sacrificed to make sure that

522
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:59,218
we can have elections and we can have democracy and we can have a civil culture where we can have those disagreements.

523
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:07,262
So thank you for the work that you're doing and thank you to post 45 as well for the work that they did to put the flags down.

524
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:08,283
Thank you.

525
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:10,813
Thank you, Mr President.

526
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:16,777
And I just have to say, Mike, Mike is a pretty intimidating, intimidating person.

527
00:43:17,558 --> 00:43:28,165
And you know, when he speaks, Mr President, I think, as Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, his words really resonate with at least with me and I know with the community.

528
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:35,671
And since he's taken over the Veterans Affairs Office, there's been a renewed interest in this community.

529
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:36,712
And I really mean that.

530
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:47,398
And I think it's partly due because of your interest and your enthusiasm and your ability to speak on behalf of those that can't speak for themselves.

531
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:56,283
You know, when you think about Veterans Day, we hear about the many volunteers and there's a lot of great volunteers that do it without any fanfare.

532
00:43:56,943 --> 00:44:00,244
And as the council has mentioned, they'll be out there in the morning.

533
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:09,666
Council Vice President Knight mentioned working out of their trunk and not looking for, you know, to speak to a reporter or get accolades.

534
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,587
They're doing it because they believe in it.

535
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:16,548
And they believe that we should recognize those who made the ultimate sacrifice, Mr. President.

536
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:23,290
But Mike not only deals with, you know, putting flags out, Mike deals with veteran benefits all the time.

537
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,872
Mike deals with veterans that are suicidal.

538
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:30,354
Mike deals with veterans that are homeless.

539
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:33,276
Mike deals with veterans that have mental illness.

540
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:44,583
There's a host of issues that people probably aren't aware of, but the Veterans Office is out there to assist and assist those in need, Mr. President.

541
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:50,347
And I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to thank you for your action.

542
00:44:50,947 --> 00:45:00,571
as the veteran affairs coordinator, administrator, and whatever we can do as a community, I hope you're very vocal.

543
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:06,874
I hope you come out and let us know what we can do on behalf of the veterans in our community, any way we can assist.

544
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,255
It would be helpful to hear directly from you.

545
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:10,416
I appreciate that.

546
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:12,782
Thank you very much, Counselor.

547
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:19,345
So you're aware, three years that have been here, we've stopped three veteran suicides, active veteran suicides.

548
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:25,408
Jail diversion is an option for veterans, drug rehabilitation, dozens of people.

549
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:30,070
So these issues exist in the community in great numbers and we are seeing them.

550
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:33,192
A big thank you to the Medford Police Department.

551
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:41,544
because they're constantly assisting me and assisting veterans in those mental health crises and jail diversion.

552
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:43,845
Um, thank you.

553
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,645
I was not aware of that, and I want to thank you.

554
00:45:45,965 --> 00:45:47,146
That's that's honorable.

555
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:47,846
Thank you very much.

556
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:50,066
Coach buckle.

557
00:45:50,307 --> 00:45:51,127
Thank you, Mr President.

558
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,527
I also want to thank director Durham for all his hard work.

559
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,168
I think a lot of people

560
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:05,436
when we're talking about it now, truly do not realize how much work happens in your office and the different programs that are available.

561
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:07,438
And there's a lot of work, a lot of hard work.

562
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:13,101
And I know you're very busy and I thank you for all your hard work and for the speech that you made on Memorial Day.

563
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:16,644
It does resonate with a lot of people.

564
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:22,908
I think it does touch a lot of people and it's important that people hear that.

565
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:30,942
you know, and thank you to, you know, thank you for Council Vice President Knight for bringing the resolution tonight.

566
00:46:31,662 --> 00:46:32,382
Thank you Post 45.

567
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:36,583
And it's important that those 8,700 veterans are remembered.

568
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:45,306
And I had the opportunity to, I was actually with Vice President Knight and we did, you know, put the flags down at the cemetery.

569
00:46:45,326 --> 00:46:53,568
And it's quite humbling as you walk, you know, among the graves and you're putting them in the ground and it's, you know, literally you have bags and bags of flags, you know,

570
00:46:53,974 --> 00:47:03,138
you know, that represent, you know, the many residents that, you know, volunteer, you know, that were in the Army and Navy, Air Force, Marines, and you name it.

571
00:47:03,778 --> 00:47:07,759
And in many of them, you know, making that ultimate sacrifice.

572
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:21,765
And when you see that, and you see that the graves and you're walking, you know, row by row, it's, it's amazing that the dedication and commitment to our, to our country into, you know, many of the freedoms that we enjoy today, we have because of that.

573
00:47:22,783 --> 00:47:25,866
And you think about the 77th anniversary of D-Day.

574
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:31,691
And I had the opportunity about 20 years ago to visit the D-Day beaches in France.

575
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:37,597
And you walk down the beach and you turn and you see the cliffs in front of you.

576
00:47:37,617 --> 00:47:48,567
And you try, I mean, you can't even imagine that people walking into that and all that fire coming off, you know, all the, you know, you know, just,

577
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:52,357
the fire from the machine guns and whatnot coming.

578
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:55,599
I mean, they were just walking into pure hell.

579
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,782
And you think about the sacrifice and the commitment that they made.

580
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:03,364
And it's amazing.

581
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:13,249
It's just, I mean, to be there and to see it firsthand, I mean, you see it in the movies, you see it on TV and the different documentaries, but to see it, you hit on the head, the greatest generation.

582
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,391
I mean, to make that sacrifice,

583
00:48:18,915 --> 00:48:19,656
It's just amazing.

584
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:22,198
And, you know, it is truly the greatest generation.

585
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,118
They should be remembered.

586
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:24,279
They'll always be remembered.

587
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,721
And you can never thank them enough.

588
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:43,094
And I think, in the end, if you know a World War II veteran, if there's someone in your neighborhood, it's important, I think, that you really talk to them and hear it firsthand, if you can, because the sacrifices that were made, you know, you don't see a lot of that today.

589
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:53,240
And it's really a special generation that will, you know, I think always have a special place, you know, in our country.

590
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:59,302
So I thank you so much for all your time and your effort that you put in day in and day out.

591
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:00,822
I know you don't have an easy job.

592
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:02,283
It is very busy.

593
00:49:02,863 --> 00:49:05,304
And I thank you for your commitment to the city.

594
00:49:05,764 --> 00:49:06,664
And I thank you for your service.

595
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:07,864
Absolutely.

596
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:08,925
Thank you for having me here tonight.

597
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:09,625
Thank you.

598
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:18,413
Thank you, Mr. President, Director Durham, like everyone, every counselors mentioned your speech on Memorial Day really struck me and stuck with me.

599
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:31,438
And I think you have, you know, I've heard you speak a few times before, and you have such a way of delivering, you know, the commitment, the challenges, the reality of your experience and the experience of many other veterans that I think is really

600
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:37,485
impactful to people and you highlighted unprecedented challenges that are being faced by today's veterans.

601
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:50,822
And I think it's so important as you said that as you're saying now just, you know, the mental health issues and really addressing those the unprecedented on employment crisis, you know, worse than our Vietnam veterans when they were returning so.

602
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:57,656
Highlighting that and the work that we can do today to support today's veterans I think is so essential and I thank you for bringing that up.

603
00:49:58,897 --> 00:50:09,425
Both of my grandfathers are Navy were Navy veterans they both passed away and knowing that there's someone like you, helping out people like them in the current generation, I think really means a lot.

604
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:22,899
You know, even just looking at the, the budget narrative and the budget book, the incredible amount of work you do in such a small department, not just for Medford, but beyond beyond is something that is so needed.

605
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,462
We're so thankful for and something we should be really proud of.

606
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,445
I thank you for raising, you know, talking about Post 45.

607
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:35,128
I live near the cemetery and there is no corner of that cemetery where you don't see those little flags.

608
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:43,292
And I think it really demonstrates just the people of Bedford have fought and, you know, fought for our freedoms in every single war we've been involved in.

609
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:49,195
And the work that Post 45 and the volunteers do to honor that and mark that is so important.

610
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:53,878
And lastly, you know, I thank you for taking the time to really talk about D-Day on the anniversary.

611
00:50:53,898 --> 00:50:54,378
It's, you know,

612
00:50:55,718 --> 00:51:02,103
what, again, what everyone else said, what more can you say about the greatest generation, but I think it's just tremendous sacrifice.

613
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:12,111
And I think as we talk about the realities of coming home from war today, it maybe gives us a different framing on what people were facing them that maybe didn't get talked about or often didn't get talked about.

614
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:14,573
So I just I thank you for your time.

615
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,736
And I thank you for really speaking so eloquently on all those topics.

616
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:19,043
Thank you.

617
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,205
And thank you for remembering some of the details of my speech.

618
00:51:21,285 --> 00:51:23,426
It really moves me that somebody took that away.

619
00:51:23,446 --> 00:51:26,408
The Vietnam fact absolutely blew my mind.

620
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:27,989
I couldn't, I had to double check it.

621
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:29,390
I was like, this can't be true.

622
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,551
But thank you for remembering that.

623
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:32,231
Of course.

624
00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:35,033
Thank you.

625
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:40,777
Mike, 10 years ago, then President Mayarco made me

626
00:51:41,716 --> 00:51:43,036
Chairman of the Veterans Subcommittee.

627
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:47,797
And shame to say, I knew very little about what your office did.

628
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:57,240
The following week, I went down there and introduced myself to then Director Ernest Lindsay, who gave me an overview of what the office did, and I got involved.

629
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:06,442
But one of the best things I did, I got involved with a good friend of mine who's probably one of the, both from Post 45, Dominic Marcellino.

630
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:10,903
who set me on a path to do good things for veterans.

631
00:52:10,983 --> 00:52:16,185
And over the years, him and I have done some pretty decent projects for the veterans.

632
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:25,028
With him, myself, and other people in the community, we got a house built over for a veteran's family that was on Channel 5.

633
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:26,608
They came down and did a story on it.

634
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,349
Mr. Bloomberg, a World War II veteran,

635
00:52:29,652 --> 00:52:31,632
who hadn't been out of his house for three years.

636
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:34,353
We found an elevator for the guy for free.

637
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:36,933
And Chad Murphy and those guys, they helped, they put it in.

638
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:43,195
So again, and then you came along, and I've tried to help you out in anything you can do.

639
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:45,135
And again, I thank you for the work that you do.

640
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,716
And again, I'm here for you and anything you need from me to continue to serve.

641
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,616
Because again, veterans matter in this community.

642
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:53,597
They mattered then, and they matter now, and they'll matter in the future.

643
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:54,897
Again, thank you for your work.

644
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:56,277
Thank you very much.

645
00:52:57,317 --> 00:53:05,304
Um, if I could say one thing, the, uh, there are VA grants to adapt homes, but sometimes, well, oftentimes they fall short.

646
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,788
Um, one off the top of my head, a VA sharp grant.

647
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:10,289
If you're an amputee,

648
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:13,295
They won't adapt your property unless you're a double amputee.

649
00:53:13,976 --> 00:53:16,317
So those are the VA rules.

650
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:20,179
Our community has a donation account, and we're able to step in.

651
00:53:20,279 --> 00:53:31,524
So if you're watching this on TV right now, and you want to donate, you want 100% of your donation to go to Medford Veterans Only to adapt their homes, buy their medication, bail them out of terrible situations.

652
00:53:32,024 --> 00:53:33,345
We do have that here in the city.

653
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:35,666
So contact my office.

654
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:36,927
I can walk you through the specifics.

655
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:41,829
We supplement outside of what the state does and outside of what the federal government does.

656
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:46,673
And we try to take care of our, our veterans and their survivors here in the community.

657
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:48,475
Thank you for all for what you do.

658
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:53,520
I know veterans are proud that, you know, batons in our hands as a nation.

659
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:55,317
as a state, as a community.

660
00:53:55,437 --> 00:54:01,739
So now we look to you to provide us the leadership and the mayor to come together as a community and move in the right direction.

661
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:03,019
So thank you for what you do.

662
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,581
And my door is always open for any help that's needed in any facets.

663
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:08,782
So thank you for having me here tonight.

664
00:54:09,902 --> 00:54:10,502
Thank you, Mike.

665
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:11,223
OK.

666
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:11,703
Thank you.

667
00:54:11,743 --> 00:54:11,983
Thank you.

668
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:17,105
So on the motion by Vice President Knight to merge 21399 and 210405, second and by.

669
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:23,823

Yes.

673
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:30,267
Councilor Falco.

674
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:30,787
Yes.

675
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:31,727
Vice President Knight.

676
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:32,028
Yes.

677
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:32,748
Councilor Marks.

678
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:33,308
Yes.

679
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:34,049
Councilor Morrell.

680
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:34,409
Yes.

681
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:35,549
Councilor Scarpelli.

682
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:35,830
Yes.

683
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:36,810
President Caravaglia.

684
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:36,990
Yes.

685
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,251
Seven in favor of the motion passes.

686
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:45,134
On the original motion offered by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

687
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,455
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

688
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:52,141
Councilor Behrs.

689
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:52,621
Yes.

690
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:55,222
Councilor Falco.

691
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:55,602
Yes.

692
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:56,762
Vice President Knight.

693
00:54:56,883 --> 00:54:57,083
Yes.

694
00:54:57,983 --> 00:54:58,523
Councilor Marks.

695
00:54:58,783 --> 00:54:59,023
Yes.

696
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:00,083
Councilor Morrell.

697
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:00,484
Yes.

698
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:01,424
Councilor Scarpelli.

699
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:01,524
Yes.

700
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:02,884
President Caravaglia.

701
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:04,605
Yes, I mean affirmative motion passes.

702
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:15,048
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Method Chess Club outdoor Riverside Avenue Park Sunday club meetings be discussed.

703
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:15,708
Councilor Marks.

704
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,191
Thank you, Mr. President.

705
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:26,758
We have a unique opportunity, Mr. President, to join with the Method Chess Club, which began over two years ago.

706
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:37,607
And they're looking to restart its Sunday outdoor chess club at the Riverside Ave Park, right on Riverside Ave, Mr. President.

707
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:42,030
And the first chess club meeting is Sunday, June 13.

708
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:57,895
And the club expects anywhere from 20 to 40 people will participate over the next few Sundays, bringing in additional foot traffic, which we all know we need to help assist our local economy and our local businesses.

709
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:03,877
Methodist placed, Mr. President, to become a chess haven.

710
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:13,108
for New England if and when we can get these chess players, the best in New England, to come into our community.

711
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:16,432
But we need a little assistance from the city.

712
00:56:17,213 --> 00:56:22,499
And originally when this started a few years back, the city was gracious enough to assist

713
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:35,245
But now the Chess Club would like to move this into a more advanced atmosphere, Mr. President, where we're welcoming people from other communities.

714
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,185
We're welcoming the general public.

715
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:49,770
The Chess Club is looking for four new concrete chess tables, Mr. President, to help assist that could be used for multi-purposes, not just for chess.

716
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:59,796
They're looking for three inexpensive sunshades, Mr. President, for a day like today when it's 95, and I'm sure we're going to get some hot Sundays.

717
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:05,420
And they're looking for new two-foot-tall, family-friendly chess pieces.

718
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,242
to be available for public use.

719
00:57:08,722 --> 00:57:16,368
So this is truly a family type atmosphere, Mr. President, and welcomes all Method residents to come down.

720
00:57:16,848 --> 00:57:20,271
And if you don't know how to play chess, there'll be people there to teach you.

721
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:23,813
There'll be ways that you could join the club, Mr. President.

722
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,595
There'll be all different ways you can participate.

723
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:30,919
And if you just want to watch a friendly chess game, I happen to love chess.

724
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:33,160
I don't play it often, but I happen to love chess.

725
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:35,282
And it is a great,

726
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:38,444
game, Mr. President, for those to play.

727
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:47,290
They're also looking if the city could pitch in and provide a water spigot on that particular piece of property for larger events.

728
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:52,153
And one person I do want to recognize that got this off the ground

729
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:56,436
and actually got a number of initiatives in this community off the ground.

730
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:59,579
He's always working on some great initiative.

731
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:02,642
It's Chris Donovan, and he happens to be here tonight.

732
00:58:03,142 --> 00:58:05,684
And I'd like to ask him if he'd want to just say a few words.

733
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:19,396
He was instrumental in getting this up and running, Mr. President, and know the needs firsthand on how to attract to make this really a mecca for chess, which I think would be a great attraction to our square.

734
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,550
Chris Donovan for Lorraine Road.

735
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:34,098
I think Councilor Moxley wasn't prepared for this tonight but it was some some messaging I sent out to the city and an advocate for the chess club which is to me an economic engine social connection for people.

736
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:40,462
It came out of the wonderful Riverside Plaza that they redesigned and put into chess tables on their own.

737
00:58:42,864 --> 00:59:08,036
cognizance they put in two chess tables I thought was the initiative to get more people into the square because my real goal is historic tourism in our square and our Salem Street Burying Ground is a fascinating and incredible place and thank you for Laura Duggan and people like that are putting together some of these initiatives to try and bring Medford some notoriety from this great history narrative that we have it's been kind of buried so I appreciate that and again for the Medford Chess Club

738
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:25,877
It was a vehicle because I kept seeing international families walking through Salem Street burying ground, looking, looking, looking, and we have a wonderful memorial to the Royal House and the slave families that were buried there and noted as well as John Brooks, a New Hampshire militiaman, Sarah Bradley Fulton, and many, many more.

739
00:59:25,957 --> 00:59:26,838
And it's the vehicle

740
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:29,940
when people come off the highway, it's the first thing that they see.

741
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:33,402
Well, Salem Street, Bearing Ground, Lydia Mariah Child, and Chevalier.

742
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:39,125
We have the opportunity in the next couple of months and years to showcase that to all the people that will be coming through Chevalier.

743
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:45,409
And the Medford Chess Club could be one of those components where as they're coming through, we've had chess sets in some of the storefronts.

744
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,551
We have games.

745
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:51,513
We had a simul where one player played 20 different people at the same time in one.

746
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:56,196
We have chess grandmasters around our community that are willing and interested in playing.

747
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,122
But the word on the street is it's kind of a difficult place to bring family and friends into Riverside Plaza.

748
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:07,763
So there's a little bit of a safety concern down there sometimes with people coming out of the community.

749
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,745
We've had over 10,000 hits on our Facebook page, people from all over the greater Boston community.

750
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,226
have come to join us, and they stay.

751
01:00:15,706 --> 01:00:17,727
Colleen's has been a fantastic sponsor.

752
01:00:18,387 --> 01:00:21,309
Mr. Coffee Roasters, everybody wanted to get involved.

753
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:27,431
Kumon had chess sets in all the different spots, so it was a groundswell of volunteerism.

754
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:34,374
Jack Esley has been one of the mainstays down there, one to three on Sundays, provides chess sets for the community.

755
01:00:34,574 --> 01:00:36,195
We'd just like to expand it a little bit more.

756
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,536
So thank you for bringing this initiative.

757
01:00:37,556 --> 01:00:38,516
I don't know how it develops.

758
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:42,498
Kevin Bailey has been a great helper in the past.

759
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:52,245
they did purchase recently some large size chess pieces which is going to be family friendly fun when they figure out how to bring it down there and keep it safe.

760
01:00:52,785 --> 01:01:05,812
So there's a lot of new things coming out from the Medford Chess Club but it is a volunteer ad hoc group but it's an opportunity to bring chess and diversity and inclusion into our square through the

761
01:01:06,654 --> 01:01:13,542
families and friends that come are young and old, all colors, all shapes and sizes and they intermingle so beautifully.

762
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,004
So thank you for the initiative.

763
01:01:15,024 --> 01:01:22,953
We hope so if any of you happen to drive by that Riverside Plaza, you will see on a regular basis that everyone goes to the shady area.

764
01:01:23,174 --> 01:01:24,235
It's brutally hot.

765
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,937
There's no sunshades at all.

766
01:01:26,277 --> 01:01:30,301
So everyone just takes the metal chairs, which are better than the plastic chairs are there.

767
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,182
They're really great.

768
01:01:31,222 --> 01:01:32,863
The metal and the setup is wonderful.

769
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:33,584
It's just so hot.

770
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:37,447
So everyone goes underneath the shade trees and pulls the chairs there.

771
01:01:37,768 --> 01:01:41,971
Why not put four chess sets, four chess tables, still food tables.

772
01:01:42,372 --> 01:01:46,375
I see the elderly there in the daytime, multi-use, but it could be redesigned.

773
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,882
the way that's being used day to day.

774
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,905
So that's the initiative and thank you for bringing it up.

775
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:59,034
I just don't know what direction would group who's gonna foster that, but that's we're trying to do ad hoc, but the tables would be a great investment for the city.

776
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:01,737
Councilor Scalabella.

777
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:02,238
Thank you.

778
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:03,279
Councilor Maxwell.

779
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,061
but that's gonna be a conduit.

780
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:32,048
I'm gonna make a motion that we ask the director of recreation of the city administration to have the director of recreation reach out to this organization and truly start a partnership because this is what recreation departments do.

781
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,488
around the Commonwealth.

782
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:39,691
It's just not the old recreation days where you're doing park league or you're playing games, but it's more now.

783
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:45,933
It's theater driven, it's music driven, it's driven with STEM and chess.

784
01:02:45,993 --> 01:02:47,413
So there's so much more we can do.

785
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,414
And I think that that's what makes Memphis such a great community.

786
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:51,715
There's different avenues.

787
01:02:51,755 --> 01:03:00,338
And I think that in Kevin's budget, you're talking about simple pieces that even right now you're looking at

788
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:10,069
a few tents that they probably already have, you know, that they can set up for tournaments all the way down the line, you know, chess tables, chairs that are comfortable.

789
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,190
If it gets big, why wouldn't we close off that area of Memphis Square and celebrate it?

790
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:21,151
Why don't we do it, you know, in my community, I work and we had a group come in and we were doing tango.

791
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:22,732
We realized tango blew up.

792
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:29,513
So we decided to close off an area of Union Square and we started the biggest tango event in the neighborhood.

793
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,514
And that's now triggered

794
01:03:32,314 --> 01:03:35,597
another aspect of what our community can do.

795
01:03:35,697 --> 01:03:41,021
So this is Medford, and if that's a piece that people love, I think we should celebrate it.

796
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:46,725
And again, I think it's the person that's got to bring that together has to be our director of recreation.

797
01:03:46,745 --> 01:03:48,106
I've talked to Kevin multiple times.

798
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:53,310
Kevin's a great resource.

799
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:58,174
We love Medford Square, but why wouldn't we do something at Wright's Pond?

800
01:03:58,214 --> 01:03:59,115
Why wouldn't we do something

801
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:12,027
at Tufts pool, let's, if it's something that's, you know, creates revenue and generates, we have different areas that we open up for restaurants, you know, in the street, safety is an issue.

802
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:18,049
We look at certain times that we do something special for chess activity that we can really celebrate in the community.

803
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:21,550
And that brings, like we said, that brings people into the stores.

804
01:04:22,202 --> 01:04:24,263
That brings people that play into the restaurants.

805
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,625
Colleen's is booked on Sundays regularly.

806
01:04:27,205 --> 01:04:30,547
It's filled with just our chess players as a regular thing.

807
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:35,531
And when we have different events, it's really, again, 20, 40 people, always different, always changing.

808
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,033
And Kevin Bailey has been a wonderful asset to this community.

809
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:41,735
He's really been interested in any opportunities.

810
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:42,475
But this is great.

811
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:43,996
This is coming from a resident.

812
01:04:44,536 --> 01:04:46,858
We have a communications director who's amazing.

813
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:48,258
She's done great things.

814
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:49,559
She can do great things.

815
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:58,041
Why wouldn't we partner with the communication department, the recreation department, and really start something at Groundswell that we started, you know, we all celebrated, didn't we?

816
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:01,883
We talked about Chris Donovan and starting the chess program.

817
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:04,483
We first opened Riverside Park and this is great.

818
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:07,364
And then, you know, the ink dried and everybody forgot.

819
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:12,766
So this is something that's sustainability wise, we really need to get the recreation department involved.

820
01:05:13,146 --> 01:05:16,187
So my recommendation would be to reach out to the administration,

821
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:17,213
that they can.

822
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:24,356
contact Mr. Donovan and the Method Chess Organization so we can really assist in what they really do.

823
01:05:24,376 --> 01:05:28,499
I know everybody was talking about budget time, everybody gets nervous, but this is low-hanging fruit.

824
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:36,343
This is something that- And one, maybe a communication to the DPW, this water spigot's down there and the grass is starting to fade and we waited so long for it to kind of come up.

825
01:05:36,383 --> 01:05:41,446
If we can just get them to turn it on regularly and make that part of the routine, because people are hanging out under those trees.

826
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:44,188
It's beautiful, but it's gotten to get run down a little bit.

827
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:47,670
So a little push from a DPW would be a great as well.

828
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:48,150
Thank you all.

829
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:49,168
Thank you.

830
01:05:49,268 --> 01:05:50,189
Councilor.

831
01:05:51,891 --> 01:05:52,691
Thank you, Mr. President.

832
01:05:52,831 --> 01:06:02,940
And so if I could amend the resolution just to have the DPW look into the water spigots to see if they're working correctly just so we can hopefully save that grass if it's possible.

833
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:06,744
But I also want to thank Mr. Dunn for all his hard work and

834
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,765
collaborating with Medford Recreation and with the business community.

835
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:11,665
That's- Yes, absolutely.

836
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:21,468
It's great to see that you're going from business to business, and actually they have chess sets, I think you said, in each of the- I think we've had a dozen people donate chess sets, and they went to different restaurants.

837
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:30,790
We pull them all back in, but we were trying to make it available everywhere for free, and then swap them ad hoc as we could, but that was really, the businesses dove into it.

838
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:31,929
And it's great.

839
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,890
It's great to see that I give you a lot of credit.

840
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,231
I know you do this in your own time.

841
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:45,180
And I think that that commitment is really something special that, you know, more and more people get that that just go out and try to do things on their own and try to, you know, make, you know,

842
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:47,655
just make improvements wherever they can.

843
01:06:47,735 --> 01:06:51,456
It's great to see Riverside Plaza being occupied and being used.

844
01:06:51,956 --> 01:06:58,079
I've gone by a few times and I've seen people playing chess and that's always good to see people sitting and enjoying the space.

845
01:06:58,819 --> 01:06:59,620
I do have one concern.

846
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,461
You had mentioned briefly something about safety.

847
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,782
Can you comment a little bit on that?

848
01:07:04,982 --> 01:07:06,784
Some people are concerned about the environment down there.

849
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:11,609
There's a lot of yelling and arguing and fighting from different people there, and it's uncomfortable.

850
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,732
But we've had a good success at Colleen's because of the heat.

851
01:07:14,932 --> 01:07:16,414
Again, go to Colleen's.

852
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,502
get a break away from the heat, and it's not that situation.

853
01:07:20,543 --> 01:07:27,348
So when we are down at the plaza, there is some kind of extracurricular craziness kind of going on there that's noted in the community.

854
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:29,150
So have someone maybe sort of check in.

855
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:36,296
We're planning on Sundays, but it may change according, if we don't get the weather figured out, people are looking just to be cool when they come down.

856
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:43,982
But we've really had the most diverse intellectual group of people I've ever met down the square from all countries, all races, all,

857
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:48,240
And they've heard about it, and they've come to that point.

858
01:07:48,301 --> 01:07:51,863
And I think if we develop it a little bit more, it will turn into the new Harvard Square.

859
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:52,764
Thank you.

860
01:07:53,364 --> 01:07:58,088
If I may amend the resolution again, Mr. Donovan, thank you for that feedback on that.

861
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:08,956
But as far as the safety goes, if we can amend the resolution to have, could you send the Metro Police just increase patrols in that area, maybe just to make sure that

862
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:12,733
People, I don't want people to feel that they can't go and enjoy the park.

863
01:08:12,873 --> 01:08:15,814
I mean, I've been by the, I understand what Mr. Donovan is talking about.

864
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:18,915
Especially with this family friendly chess set that's going to be out there soon.

865
01:08:18,955 --> 01:08:22,216
It's going to be a joy, but we just don't want it broken.

866
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:23,897
Do we leave it out for the public?

867
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:25,398
Is it coming in on a time schedule?

868
01:08:32,565 --> 01:08:34,945
So that's not difficult to do.

869
01:08:34,965 --> 01:08:38,426
So that's a good recommendation to take that contract.

870
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:39,946
Point of information on that, Mr. President as well.

871
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:47,628
Mr. President, when we voted to repurpose Riverside Plaza, one of the things we did was we turned Riverside Plaza into a parkland.

872
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:51,928
And the reason we turned Riverside Plaza into a parkland was so that we had the opportunity to permit it.

873
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:52,889
Correct.

874
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:59,570
So I think this could be something that's as simple as being taken care of with a permit as well.

875
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,070
Right, without recreation.

876
01:09:02,073 --> 01:09:05,715
because they can enforce, if I can, Mr. President, I take point of information with that.

877
01:09:06,236 --> 01:09:16,462
The big reason was that they couldn't enforce a public, an open area, but because it's classified as a park now, we can now, they can police that a little bit different.

878
01:09:16,482 --> 01:09:17,723
We have a little power with that, so.

879
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:19,704
We'd welcome them at the chess table too.

880
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:22,166
Unless they win.

881
01:09:23,647 --> 01:09:24,087
Thank you all.

882
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:24,527
Thank you.

883
01:09:25,168 --> 01:09:25,788
Council Member Rowe.

884
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:28,650
Council Member Rowe.

885
01:09:29,459 --> 01:09:34,763
I also think just point of, I guess, parliamentary procedure, since this came under suspension, we can't vote on it tonight.

886
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:38,847
It would have to be submitted another meeting to vote on it since it just came under suspension.

887
01:09:38,867 --> 01:09:41,169
It wasn't under the agenda.

888
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,655
I'm fully in favor of it, but just... Of course, do those tables have holes in it for umbrellas?

889
01:09:46,675 --> 01:09:47,535
Say that again?

890
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,357
Do those tables have holes for umbrellas?

891
01:09:49,858 --> 01:09:54,322
They don't, but an umbrella, simple umbrella for the summertime could solve.

892
01:09:56,465 --> 01:10:00,830
No, if there was a hole in the middle where you can put a leaf, there's no hole in it.

893
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:01,892
Yeah.

894
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,641
beautiful ones that some of these developments, they're just spectacular.

895
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,102
Some of these umbrellas- So you're looking for like a pop-up tents?

896
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:14,386
A sunshade is just a tarp over connected to a couple of poles, just to break up the heat.

897
01:10:14,486 --> 01:10:17,308
But you all know if you kind of sit down there at midday, it's brutal.

898
01:10:17,568 --> 01:10:18,649
It's brutal, there's no break from it.

899
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:21,671
A couple of shade trees are coming, but they're five, 10 years away from that.

900
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:27,595
But whatever this administration's suggestion would be, I just may see them commercially, it's pretty common.

901
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:30,677
But we'll get more people in the Riverside Air Plaza midday.

902
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:32,902
Whether it be chess or not.

903
01:10:34,003 --> 01:10:34,783
I did have one question.

904
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:36,123
Also, I have a sunshade.

905
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,304
I will happily donate if it is needed.

906
01:10:39,304 --> 01:10:43,486
I'm just curious, have you guys, I know you said you guys have a lot of interest already, a lot of people engaged.

907
01:10:43,826 --> 01:10:51,108
Have you seen an increase in people reaching out since everyone was trapped inside watching the Queen's Gambit and like buying the chess then?

908
01:10:51,572 --> 01:10:52,972
I think if you build it, you'll come.

909
01:10:53,032 --> 01:10:53,693
People see it.

910
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,433
It's on different social media sites, and it's something to do.

911
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:57,314
It's an activity.

912
01:10:57,374 --> 01:11:03,875
And again, you would be surprised at where people come from to come and find other chess players to do that.

913
01:11:04,255 --> 01:11:06,496
And then families of middle schools are getting involved.

914
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:08,197
The high school has a program.

915
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:14,398
Medford's not involved in the scholastic tournament, which is called the Spiegel Cup, which is the state's championship.

916
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:16,259
It's not even on the radar in Medford.

917
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:17,139
And I go to other cities.

918
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:18,919
It's part of their curriculum.

919
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,700
It's part of their programming.

920
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,637
So we'd love to just kind of bring Medford into the fold with some of that.

921
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:29,520
So we do include families and reach out, but it's mostly social media and word of mouth right now.

922
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,883
And thank you so much for coming out to just kind of explain some of the challenges, but also some of the exciting stuff coming up.

923
01:11:34,803 --> 01:11:35,083
Thank you.

924
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:41,707
Mr. President, I'd like to amend Councilor Caviello's recommendation also to request that the

925
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:52,501
Recreation Department apply for a determination of eligibility grant from the Community Preservation Committee to see if there's a funding mechanism available there.

926
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:58,884
Every so often, we have the ability to apply to determine if we're eligible for certain projects.

927
01:11:58,925 --> 01:12:08,990
And this might be either through the Chess Club or through the Recreation Department or in partnership, file a joint application with the Community Preservation Commission and see if you're eligible for funds through that.

928
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:11,276
that we're an informal ad hoc group.

929
01:12:11,316 --> 01:12:17,461
So anything I think would be done through the city, but thank you, but there's no mechanism for receiving funds, so to speak, but.

930
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:22,665
Well, no, I mean, it's just an application to see if the city would perform the project per se, you know what I mean?

931
01:12:22,725 --> 01:12:27,228
And you guys could propose the project in partnership with the recreation department.

932
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:32,052
The recreation department would be the one that promotes the plan and then the oversight and stuff would be handled through.

933
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:35,693
whoever the project manager is that gets assigned to the project.

934
01:12:35,713 --> 01:12:38,374
I don't think this is going to be something that's overly expensive.

935
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:40,235
I mean, you know, a couple of tables and a tent.

936
01:12:40,275 --> 01:12:42,956
I don't think we're looking for rocket science over here to make sure the water works.

937
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:44,156
You know what I mean?

938
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:49,798
So if the funding is a problem, I know we got a lot of money coming in from this ARAPA that they're talking about.

939
01:12:49,858 --> 01:12:51,198
Maybe that money can be used for that as well.

940
01:12:51,819 --> 01:12:55,840
But I think that, you know, the community preservation grant would be a great opportunity for you to

941
01:12:57,038 --> 01:13:03,223
plant a seed and then build upon it, let it grow, water it, because if it works once, it's going to work twice in a different location, work a third time in a fourth location.

942
01:13:04,164 --> 01:13:05,826
So I think it might be worth pursuing.

943
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:09,849
So with that being said, I'd just like to add that as an amendment to the council's recommendation.

944
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:11,811
Any further questions?

945
01:13:13,512 --> 01:13:25,042
So on the motion by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Falco twice and Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

946
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:30,980
to put this on the next week's agenda.

947
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:31,720
So moved.

948
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,220
Because this was under suspension.

949
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,621
It was offered under suspension.

950
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:34,981
Okay.

951
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:36,101
All right.

952
01:13:36,141 --> 01:13:38,301
So Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

953
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:39,822
I think it's just a table of, yeah.

954
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:46,483
I almost put it on the age of recommendations tonight, but I was told to make recommendations because the president went out of me.

955
01:13:53,812 --> 01:14:02,374
you know, someone from the administration's watching this meeting, we made a number of recommendations and we wouldn't need a formal vote, but if, you know, we can take a formal vote next week.

956
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:08,876
I can, Councilor Marks, I can put it on with all the amendments, put it right on the agenda with all the amendments.

957
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:09,876
That's fine, that's fine.

958
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,636
And then it'll be tracked.

959
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:12,177
Yeah, that's fine.

960
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,297
We'll take a formal vote next week?

961
01:14:14,197 --> 01:14:14,357
Yeah.

962
01:14:14,557 --> 01:14:14,757
Okay.

963
01:14:15,457 --> 01:14:16,738
Chris, thank you very much for your service.

964
01:14:16,778 --> 01:14:17,318
Thank you, Chris.

965
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:17,658
Thank you.

966
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:24,916
21389 offered by Councilor Scapelli, be resolved in the Memphis City Council requested administration.

967
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:30,177
Mr. President, I would hate to drop to just withdraw that motion.

968
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:36,179
I think that resolution, I think the, my absence last week, a lot has been done.

969
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:43,142
It looks like the chambers is open for business and we're moving on to some sort of normalcy.

970
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:45,202
So thank you.

971
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:45,923
Okay.

972
01:14:45,943 --> 01:14:46,983
21398 offered by Councilor Maxwell.

973
01:14:48,480 --> 01:15:01,195
Whereas City Clerk Kirby's three-year appointment by the Memphis City Council ends September 1, 2021, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council meet in the Committee of the Whole to discuss the reappointment of the City Clerk.

974
01:15:01,215 --> 01:15:01,795
Councilor Marks.

975
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:03,597
Thank you, Mr. President.

976
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:08,343
As we all know, when we hired Clerk Kirby,

977
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:10,864
that we gave him a three-year appointment.

978
01:15:11,544 --> 01:15:16,025
That appointment is coming up this September, September 1st, to be precise.

979
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:27,708
And I think where we have so much going on with budgetary and so forth, I would respectfully request that we meet Mr. President and the committee of the whole within the next week or two.

980
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:28,968
Next Tuesday night.

981
01:15:29,268 --> 01:15:35,350
Next Tuesday night, that's perfect to discuss the reappointment of the city clerk, Mr. President.

982
01:15:36,776 --> 01:15:41,540
On the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

983
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:44,082
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

984
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:48,146
Yes.

985
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:49,607
Yes.

986
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:51,529
Yes.

987
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:51,909
Yes.

988
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,010
Yes.

989
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:55,672
Yes.

990
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:57,053
Seven in favor, motion passes.

991
01:15:57,373 --> 01:16:02,558
And we will discuss this on Tuesday before the budget at six o'clock p.m.

992
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,961
2-1-4-1 offered by Councilor Behrs.

993
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:18,705
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council and the city administration provide a monthly written report regarding the expenditure of the approximately $37 million allocated to the city of Medford through the American Rescue Plan Act.

994
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:25,887
Be it further resolved that this report include a breakdown of spending in the four main categories of eligible expenses.

995
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:33,150
One, response to the public health emergency or its negative economic consequences.

996
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:33,390
Two,

997
01:16:34,478 --> 01:16:43,323
revenue replacement, three, investments in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure, and four, provision of premium pay to eligible workers.

998
01:16:43,703 --> 01:16:52,467
Be it further resolved that the senior administration outline any process underway to encourage public input into the use of the ARPA funds.

999
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:53,508
Councillor Baerz.

1000
01:16:53,968 --> 01:16:54,888
Thank you, Mr. President.

1001
01:16:56,169 --> 01:16:58,370
I mean, I think most of the resolution speaks for itself.

1002
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:12,038
The funds coming to the city from the American Rescue Plan Act are a significant investment from the federal government and the city representing almost a quarter of an annual budget that we would pass in a year.

1003
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:23,065
And I think we should have a clear accounting from the administration as to how they're spending those funds, that they're being spent within the, how they're being spent within the four

1004
01:17:23,525 --> 01:17:28,248
for main categories of eligible expenses per the Department of the Treasury.

1005
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:40,895
And I think something that many communities are doing with this money, or at least with a portion of it, is having a public input process to determine what are the needs that the public would like to see this money expended on.

1006
01:17:41,515 --> 01:17:53,064
And I'd really like to hear from the administration if they are planning to engage in any sort of public process around this funding and what Medford residents would like to see it spent on.

1007
01:17:53,224 --> 01:18:01,430
I do have one amendment for the clerk after the words city of Medford in the first paragraph, and you can let me know when you're ready.

1008
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:10,416
And it would be, and any additional funds provided

1009
01:18:11,378 --> 01:18:14,859
as part of the Middlesex County allocation.

1010
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:32,602
And that amendment reflects the 37 million is what was allocated directly to the city of Medford, but because we do not have a county government, we will also be getting a portion of the funds allocated to Middlesex County.

1011
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,482
So I just wanted to make sure that that was part of this.

1012
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,943
Okay, the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by?

1013
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,460
Second by Councilor Falco.

1014
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:43,621
Councilor Mox.

1015
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:47,582
Just if I could, and I am supportive of this, Mr. President.

1016
01:18:48,522 --> 01:19:02,065
The question I had was I was approached by a number of first responders in our community stating that there was also grant money available for those that worked as first responders during the pandemic.

1017
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:17,624
And I would respectfully amend this to ask if the city has filed for any grants that would be out there for increasing salary for first responders during the pandemic.

1018
01:19:18,245 --> 01:19:20,488
I know there's money in this particular

1019
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:27,454
narrative, but there's also other funds out there that other communities, Mr. President, are applying for.

1020
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:32,139
And I would hate to see us not apply on behalf of our police, fire and EMS.

1021
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:32,819
Mr. President.

1022
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,020
Thank you.

1023
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,141
Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:19:35,502 --> 01:19:40,526
If I could just, I believe that those grants are separate from the 50 million that would come to the city.

1025
01:19:40,546 --> 01:19:42,168
There are additional money we can apply for.

1026
01:19:42,568 --> 01:19:43,890
So I just want to make that, you know,

1027
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:48,845
Because they very well could possibly use the money within here around premium pay as well.

1028
01:19:48,926 --> 01:19:51,227
So I think we should apply for the additional grants.

1029
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:54,729
Hopefully we can have even more money coming into the city.

1030
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:54,969
Thank you.

1031
01:19:55,689 --> 01:20:02,934
So on the motion by Councilor Bares, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bares, as amended by Councilor Marks.

1032
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:05,055
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1033
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:08,613
Councilor Behrs?

1034
01:20:08,854 --> 01:20:09,054
Yes.

1035
01:20:09,294 --> 01:20:09,934
Councilor Felco?

1036
01:20:10,114 --> 01:20:10,274
Yes.

1037
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:11,115
Vice President Knight?

1038
01:20:11,135 --> 01:20:11,495
Yes.

1039
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:12,076
Councilor Marks?

1040
01:20:12,496 --> 01:20:12,756
Yes.

1041
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:13,457
Councilor Morrell?

1042
01:20:13,617 --> 01:20:13,817
Yes.

1043
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:14,657
Councilor Scarpelli?

1044
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:15,018
Yes.

1045
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:15,898
President Caravaglio?

1046
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:16,138
Yes.

1047
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:17,339
7 in favor of the motion passes.

1048
01:20:17,799 --> 01:20:26,985
21400 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Memphis City Council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Ralph Scopa on his recent passing.

1049
01:20:27,066 --> 01:20:27,686
Vice President Knight.

1050
01:20:27,946 --> 01:20:29,248
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1051
01:20:29,428 --> 01:20:42,625
For those of us who know Mr. Skoper, he was a retired city employee from the city of Medford, a longtime Medford resident, very active in both our community and in politics, Mr. President, and was a devout supporter of President Emeritus.

1052
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:49,687
Robert Amiako, I can remember standing at the Columbus School holding a sign with Mr. Scopa on one of the coldest days.

1053
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:55,808
He must have been 80 years old and he was there from the minute the polls opened until the minute the polls closed, Mr. President.

1054
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,029
An unbelievable campaigner, just an all-around good guy.

1055
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:01,189
And he's going to be sadly missed in this community.

1056
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:09,591
He was someone who put his money where his mouth and wasn't afraid to go volunteer, was someone that would go out there and get behind the candidate that he loved and supported as opposed to crying and complaining on the internet.

1057
01:21:10,072 --> 01:21:14,709
He was a throwback to the old days and just a good person, Mr. President, that dedicated a lot of his life to the city.

1058
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,295
So I ask that he be remembered this evening.

1059
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:18,089
Councilor Scappelli.

1060
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:21,371
Thank you, Vice President Knight bringing this forward.

1061
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:26,315
I think the scope of family, again, fits that mold that we've been talking about this past year.

1062
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:27,576
And it's been a tough year.

1063
01:21:28,036 --> 01:21:35,681
It's the people that unselfishly given themselves to this community, no matter what, no questions asked.

1064
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:45,048
I remember there were concerns when I was overseeing the recreation department years ago, when it was just a summer program, that the traffic and the safety of the people going to Tufts pool

1065
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:49,713
They were in jeopardy, but unfortunately it was tough times financially.

1066
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:56,920
Well, the Scopa family, if you know Mr. and Mrs. Scopa, they made sure that that area was safe for everybody.

1067
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:08,833
And they tell you too, that they then took their passion of Medford, they moved out to the high school and started making sure they always saw the high school on the grounds when it's being rented.

1068
01:22:09,413 --> 01:22:13,035
And I still remember in the school committee talking about security in Medford.

1069
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:19,879
I said we don't need security in Medford when you have bulldogs like the Scopus because that passion and love in Medford really shines.

1070
01:22:19,999 --> 01:22:23,821
So again, I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward, Vice President Knight bringing this forward.

1071
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:24,641
And again,

1072
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:39,129
It's the challenge to our community who picks up that torch from the scope of family and then carries on that tradition of community and unselfishness and pride that the scope of family has shown.

1073
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:43,092
So we appreciate everything they've done, and he will be missed for sure.

1074
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:43,592
So thank you.

1075
01:22:46,197 --> 01:22:47,218
Thank you, Mr President.

1076
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:52,081
As my colleague stated, Ralph Scopa was a dedicated employee for many years in this community.

1077
01:22:52,641 --> 01:22:53,822
I believe three decades.

1078
01:22:54,562 --> 01:23:00,566
And, you know, he treated every street, every road, every area of this community like it was his backyard.

1079
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:06,970
And really, when Councilor Scott Pelli and Vice President Knight talk about him, he really had Medford pride.

1080
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,191
And that's shown right through him, Mr. President.

1081
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:18,573
And, you know, I think in this day and age, you know, it's nice to have people to step up and say, you know, I care about this community.

1082
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:23,194
Even though he was a city employee, he did many other facets in this community.

1083
01:23:23,514 --> 01:23:26,054
It wasn't just regarding his DPW service.

1084
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,455
He stepped up to the plate each and every time.

1085
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:34,616
And the Scopa family truly are one of the great families in this community.

1086
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,077
And Ralph will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1087
01:23:37,557 --> 01:23:37,897
Thank you.

1088
01:23:38,177 --> 01:23:38,537
Thank you.

1089
01:23:39,578 --> 01:23:40,158
Councilor Falcone.

1090
01:23:40,338 --> 01:23:41,298
Thank you, Mr. President.

1091
01:23:41,678 --> 01:23:52,481
I remember Mr. Scopa from my days working for the city as a teenager in high school, and I remember his dedication, his commitment, and the dedication and commitment of the whole family.

1092
01:23:52,981 --> 01:23:56,822
And my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family, and he will be missed.

1093
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:57,502
Thank you.

1094
01:23:58,182 --> 01:23:58,542
Thank you.

1095
01:23:59,342 --> 01:24:01,863
And myself, you know, I think Councilor Monk said it right.

1096
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:06,284
Ralph took care of the city like it was his own house, or his own yard.

1097
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:15,466
And again, you saw him everywhere, a dedicated employee, again, another icon of community that has since passed away.

1098
01:24:16,526 --> 01:24:18,627
So on the motion by Vice President Knight.

1099
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:19,807
Second.

1100
01:24:20,047 --> 01:24:21,868
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1101
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:23,368
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1102
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:26,082
Councilor Behrs.

1103
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:26,383
Yes.

1104
01:24:26,723 --> 01:24:27,345
Councilor Falco.

1105
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:27,565
Yes.

1106
01:24:27,726 --> 01:24:28,427
Vice President Knight.

1107
01:24:28,467 --> 01:24:28,627
Yes.

1108
01:24:28,808 --> 01:24:29,389
Councilor Marks.

1109
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,050
Yes.

1110
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:30,732
Councilor Morrell.

1111
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:31,112
Yes.

1112
01:24:31,373 --> 01:24:32,074
Councilor Scarpelli.

1113
01:24:32,195 --> 01:24:32,415
Yes.

1114
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:33,958
President Kerrio.

1115
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,080
Yes.

1116
01:24:35,421 --> 01:24:36,624
Please rise for a moment of silence.

1117
01:24:53,395 --> 01:25:10,493
2-1-4-0-2, offered by Councilor Bez, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council and that the administration urgently outfit the Alden Chambers, Richard Lee Room 201, City Council Office Room 207, and at least

1118
01:25:13,478 --> 01:25:23,162
One other public meeting room at Meffitt High School with the technology upgrades needed to maintain remote participation via Zoom and public meetings on a permanent basis.

1119
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:39,928
Be it further resolved that the city administration provide additional staff training or other resources needed to allow the City Council School Committee and any and all other city boards and commissions to conduct meetings with remote participation on a permanent basis.

1120
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:40,809
Be it further resolved

1121
01:25:41,684 --> 01:25:51,052
that these urgently needed technology and infrastructure upgrades are eligible for use on the ARPA funds based on treasury department guidance.

1122
01:25:51,873 --> 01:25:52,453
Councilor Baez.

1123
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:53,734
Thank you, Mr. President.

1124
01:25:55,565 --> 01:25:59,788
As I think, I was hoping Councilor Scarpelli's resolution we'd talk a little bit about first.

1125
01:26:00,248 --> 01:26:13,837
We do have a lot of bodies and boards and commissions and the school committee and city council coming back into this right now, just this room as it's the only room outfitted for a hybrid meeting to allow participation by the public remotely.

1126
01:26:14,577 --> 01:26:18,420
I think we've seen the great advantages that's had in terms of engagement.

1127
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,082
and people being able to attend our public bodies.

1128
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:31,949
And, you know, we still have many immunocompromised people, people under the age of 12 and other folks who can't access vaccines who are still going to need to be able to access all of our public meetings.

1129
01:26:32,089 --> 01:26:45,179
So the intent of this resolution is to really push the city administration to make sure that this is not the only space where we can have a Zoom hybrid meeting with the body meeting in person and members of the public participating remotely.

1130
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:46,940
I have spoken with

1131
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:56,565
Patrick Gordon from Medford Community Media about the, you know, intense amount of work that goes into just making this room work with the current technology that we have.

1132
01:26:57,785 --> 01:27:12,373
But we also talked about there being technology out there or at least partially out there that would allow rooms like room 201, room 207 or the room at the high school where the school committee often meets to have the hybrid technology needed

1133
01:27:12,953 --> 01:27:14,895
to allow these meetings to function more smoothly.

1134
01:27:15,555 --> 01:27:27,325
I've also reviewed the treasury department guidance and spoken with the city administration and they agree that the ARPA funding, which does allow for technological upgrades, this would qualify under that.

1135
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:28,826
So really just trying to put,

1136
01:27:29,887 --> 01:27:31,928
you know, fire under the administration to get this done.

1137
01:27:32,568 --> 01:27:37,349
One of the concerns that I know is out there is that now everybody is trying to get this technology.

1138
01:27:37,409 --> 01:27:42,171
It's the same issue we faced last year when we were trying to set this room up for hybrid meetings.

1139
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:54,234
So we really need to get the funding out the door and make sure that Medford Community Media is able to set this up and that there are folks who are adequately trained to run these meetings going forward.

1140
01:27:54,534 --> 01:27:56,215
And that's the intent of the resolution.

1141
01:27:56,315 --> 01:27:56,655
Thank you.

1142
01:27:58,433 --> 01:27:59,234
Thank you, Mr President.

1143
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:02,817
I think Councilor bears are introducing this and I fully support this resolution.

1144
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:12,424
I talked with representative Garber Lee today and I believe because this is this permanent zoom participation or remote participation is something that Governor Baker is interested in.

1145
01:28:13,165 --> 01:28:19,030
Representative Garber Lee said it's something that they're actually going to be taking up this week so legislation may be coming out so I think it makes perfect sense to

1146
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:39,318
try to get ahead of this and really outfit our spaces to enable people to engage in this way that I think it says in our budget book that community participation in public meetings went up 300 to 400 percent during the pandemic and with the ability to dial in via zoom and you know to the to the groups of people that counselor bears mentioned but also just people that you know are in caregiving positions

1147
01:28:39,718 --> 01:28:45,985
don't have childcare, can't come out to city hall, just making sure we're doing everything we can to keep this remote participation option.

1148
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:47,987
So I just want to say, please support that.

1149
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:52,252
And I think we're just trying to be ahead of the curve at this point, because I think it is something that is, it's coming.

1150
01:28:54,381 --> 01:29:02,086
On this piece with the state legislation, are we aware if there's any funding attached to this or if this is going to be an unfunded mandate that will go through the legislature?

1151
01:29:02,146 --> 01:29:07,450
When I came in, Pat had mentioned that there is a bill going through the state house currently right now.

1152
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:11,392
I don't know if there's any funding that attached.

1153
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,453
I didn't see the actual bill.

1154
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:13,574
There's no money in that bill.

1155
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:27,566
May it be so bold as to make the suggestion that we send this to a director of community media to come up with maybe a cost estimate as to what this will cost to retrofit these rooms.

1156
01:29:27,646 --> 01:29:31,029
If we're really serious about it, we got to know what it costs before we go any further than that.

1157
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,931
Find out what it costs, put out an RFP or something, you know, but.

1158
01:29:34,691 --> 01:29:35,912
So you want to amend that?

1159
01:29:35,932 --> 01:29:43,879
I mean, I think that that's probably the, if we want it to happen, that's probably the way to go about it, in my opinion.

1160
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:49,435
community media come up with some type of cost estimate

1161
01:29:54,642 --> 01:29:55,003
Scott.

1162
01:29:55,143 --> 01:29:57,685
So I know I appreciate council and I was going to say the same thing.

1163
01:29:57,705 --> 01:30:07,295
I think that what we did realize is that through the pandemic, you know, the difficult what was what was difficult for some people was a success for other people.

1164
01:30:07,355 --> 01:30:11,179
So to get people involved to support it, I, you know how I feel.

1165
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:15,684
I'm a strong supporter of making sure that the first priorities in person meetings

1166
01:30:16,164 --> 01:30:19,085
but having that option, making sure that it's cost efficient.

1167
01:30:19,465 --> 01:30:28,488
And I think sending that to Patrick and as a professional coming back to us and telling us what it looks like and even and that's a little homework to council bears.

1168
01:30:28,528 --> 01:30:35,391
And I know that the software that's needed really isn't developed truly yet, but seeing what other avenues we can

1169
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,533
we can work with to make this happen.

1170
01:30:38,593 --> 01:30:51,902
So I would support, I appreciate your resolution, but I would support Councilor Knight's motion that we get a report from Mr. Gordon, so we can move forward with some teeth and that's it.

1171
01:30:52,482 --> 01:30:53,022
Thank you.

1172
01:30:53,122 --> 01:31:02,969
Also, Mr. President, I know that there are certain criteria outlined in the open meeting law relative to remote participation that, you know, may need to

1173
01:31:03,923 --> 01:31:16,637
be looked at by our boards and commissions should they wish to adopt this measure in the form of probably a training because I know that there are certain steps that need to be taken by the public body in order to authorize such should the state legislation not pass.

1174
01:31:18,745 --> 01:31:18,885
Yeah.

1175
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:21,607
And I did talk to Patrick around the cost estimate.

1176
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,129
Patrick was able to ballpark it for me.

1177
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:25,410
I said, is this going to be a million dollars?

1178
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:27,051
He said, absolutely not.

1179
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:27,431
He said 500,000.

1180
01:31:27,491 --> 01:31:28,512
He said less than that.

1181
01:31:28,972 --> 01:31:35,137
So just in terms of a ballpark, tens of thousands of dollars, it seems to be just so.

1182
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:36,118
Oh, that's good.

1183
01:31:36,338 --> 01:31:36,518
Yeah.

1184
01:31:37,178 --> 01:31:40,441
And I'm fine asking Patrick to provide a cost estimate.

1185
01:31:41,743 --> 01:31:46,185
If we could do that at the same time that we're telling the city administration that this is important to us, I think that would be valuable.

1186
01:31:46,645 --> 01:31:49,047
So that's just my own request.

1187
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:51,728
Councilor Falcone.

1188
01:31:51,908 --> 01:31:52,528
Thank you, Mr. President.

1189
01:31:52,568 --> 01:31:54,329
I thank Councilor Villes for bringing this forward.

1190
01:31:54,349 --> 01:32:02,973
One of the things I'd also like to know is, you know, in addition to a cost estimate, I mean, how long is it going to take to get all of this in place?

1191
01:32:02,993 --> 01:32:10,837
And the reason why I ask is I know I worked with Patrick when I was president of the council and I knew it took a lot of time, effort and energy

1192
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,231
just to set this up.

1193
01:32:13,051 --> 01:32:18,754
And I'm sure it's probably perfected it by now, but it'd be good to just get an estimate as to how long that will take.

1194
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:22,736
So if I could add that as an amendment, I really appreciate it.

1195
01:32:22,756 --> 01:32:23,057
Thank you.

1196
01:32:23,157 --> 01:32:23,377
Sure.

1197
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:25,338
And just if I may, that's part of the intent here.

1198
01:32:25,358 --> 01:32:26,979
It will take time.

1199
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:30,761
The more cities and towns around us that start to do it, the more time it'll take.

1200
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:34,003
So if we can be out front, I think that's good for us in the long run.

1201
01:32:37,525 --> 01:32:37,965
Council Meeks.

1202
01:32:38,727 --> 01:32:42,510
You know, what's crucial to make this work is in-house training as well.

1203
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,092
And I know that's part of the resolution.

1204
01:32:45,932 --> 01:32:53,858
You know, to me, tens of thousands of dollars to set this up doesn't sound like a realistic, you know, and we haven't seen anything that doesn't sound realistic.

1205
01:32:54,178 --> 01:32:56,780
This is going to take far more staff than we currently have.

1206
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:08,428
And when you add in all the boards, the 40, 50-odd boards and commissions that meet, along with the council and the school committee, you're not going to have one person like Patrick running all this.

1207
01:33:08,448 --> 01:33:10,390
You're not going to have two people, Mr. President.

1208
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:14,453
You're probably going to need a half a dozen people to be actively involved.

1209
01:33:14,933 --> 01:33:16,514
And I'm just throwing that number out there.

1210
01:33:17,435 --> 01:33:21,638
This is a much larger endeavor than just tens of thousands.

1211
01:33:21,998 --> 01:33:26,402
I think you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars to have this established, Mr. President.

1212
01:33:26,862 --> 01:33:27,962
It's something we need to look at.

1213
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:29,743
We're going to be discussing budget soon.

1214
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:34,664
If we're serious about that, then maybe that's the time to have the discussion as well during budget.

1215
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:38,684
We just found out what our authority is as a council, Mr. President.

1216
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:50,867
And if this is not an item that's currently within the maids budget, and I don't remember seeing it in the budget we just received yesterday, that we can add this as a line item, Mr. President, if need be.

1217
01:33:51,207 --> 01:33:55,728
So if this is something we're interested, we can definitely have it added as long as we have the facts.

1218
01:33:56,807 --> 01:33:57,147
Thank you.

1219
01:33:58,248 --> 01:33:58,909
Any further discussion?

1220
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:11,222
So on the motion by Councillor Baez, as amended by Councillor Falco, and as amended by Councillor Knight, and Councillor Oosterhof, do you have an amendment too?

1221
01:34:11,262 --> 01:34:11,582
No.

1222
01:34:11,602 --> 01:34:12,343
OK, seconded by?

1223
01:34:12,363 --> 01:34:13,264
Seconded.

1224
01:34:13,684 --> 01:34:14,865
Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

1225
01:34:15,286 --> 01:34:16,247
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1226
01:34:25,846 --> 01:34:26,446
Councilor Behrs?

1227
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:26,727
Yes.

1228
01:34:27,027 --> 01:34:27,667
Councilor Falco?

1229
01:34:27,767 --> 01:34:27,928
Yes.

1230
01:34:28,108 --> 01:34:28,828
Vice President Knight?

1231
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:29,269
Yes.

1232
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:29,869
Councilor Marks?

1233
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:30,209
Yes.

1234
01:34:30,349 --> 01:34:30,930
Councilor Morrell?

1235
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:31,290
Yes.

1236
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:32,071
Councilor Scarpelli?

1237
01:34:32,091 --> 01:34:32,171
Yes.

1238
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:33,392
President Kerrio?

1239
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:35,293
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, the motion passes.

1240
01:34:36,034 --> 01:34:37,915
Hearings.

1241
01:34:37,935 --> 01:34:51,346
2-1-0-1-8, Councilor.

1242
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:51,786
2-1.

1243
01:34:51,806 --> 01:34:52,787
2-1-0-1-8.

1244
01:34:52,807 --> 01:34:54,548
The motion by Vice President Knight.

1245
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:59,487
on this suspension.

1246
01:34:59,687 --> 01:35:02,508
21018, amendments to the revised ordinances personnel.

1247
01:35:03,228 --> 01:35:05,089
It's eligible for its third reading.

1248
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:08,490
Excuse me, sorry, it's taken its third reading already, correct?

1249
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:10,611
No, it's taken first reading, it's been advertised.

1250
01:35:11,611 --> 01:35:14,372
So this is the third reading, am I correct?

1251
01:35:14,712 --> 01:35:14,873
Yes.

1252
01:35:15,213 --> 01:35:22,015
So on the motion by Vice President Knight to let this take its third reading, seconded by?

1253
01:35:22,355 --> 01:35:22,655
Second.

1254
01:35:23,435 --> 01:35:24,656
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1255
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:26,651
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1256
01:35:26,671 --> 01:35:29,033
I can't hear you with the mask.

1257
01:35:30,073 --> 01:35:31,174
I don't know.

1258
01:35:31,214 --> 01:35:31,954
Councilor Behrs.

1259
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:33,175
Yes.

1260
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:35,396
Councilor Falco.

1261
01:35:36,336 --> 01:35:36,576
Yes.

1262
01:35:37,697 --> 01:35:37,957
Yes.

1263
01:35:39,097 --> 01:35:39,358
Yes.

1264
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:40,778
Yes.

1265
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:44,500
Yes.

1266
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:45,560
Yes.

1267
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:50,223
Mr. President, while we're under suspension, we have members of the public that would like to speak on the public participation.

1268
01:35:50,843 --> 01:35:52,624
Okay.

1269
01:35:53,744 --> 01:35:55,005
The public participation.

1270
01:35:56,549 --> 01:35:56,829
Okay.

1271
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:01,413
Public participation, who would like to speak?

1272
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,821
Good evening, name and address of the director, please.

1273
01:36:12,241 --> 01:36:17,865
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the circus party.

1274
01:36:18,526 --> 01:36:21,508
I'd like to read a three-page prepared commentary

1275
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,151
that I find and feel to be very important.

1276
01:36:27,011 --> 01:36:32,052
It's a message from Memorial Day to Flag Day, and it's a commentary to our Medford residents.

1277
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:36,434
Memorial Day, why is my speakers off?

1278
01:36:39,655 --> 01:36:51,178
Memorial Day was never intended as a celebration to remind us of the ugliness and the ravages of war, but rather to honor in some solemn observance, our men and women,

1279
01:36:52,540 --> 01:37:02,604
their survivors, and our allied comrades who sacrificed their lives to protect our liberty and our freedoms here at home and around the world.

1280
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:21,412
Likewise, our Flag Day observance on June 14th is but an annual reminder of some 244 years ago when the Second Continental Congress, along with George Washington, took a break from their writing of the Articles of Confederation to establish a standard bearer

1281
01:37:22,382 --> 01:37:29,064
to be the unifying symbol of our colonial fighting forces and for our freedom.

1282
01:37:30,245 --> 01:37:39,668
As our fledgling nation was moving forward in its quest for its independence, that is how Old Glory was commissioned to be our American flag.

1283
01:37:41,143 --> 01:37:54,929
From Memorial Day remembrances of lives given up to protect our America, to the flag day birth of old glory, both symbolizing the embodiment of our right of free speech, we are here today.

1284
01:37:56,690 --> 01:38:09,095
But in the interim of many years, what has happened to our country, state, and local cities and towns nationwide, especially over the past 30 years in particular?

1285
01:38:10,537 --> 01:38:38,986
When the politically correct crowd of progressives and liberals began complaining that our public displays of patriotism is offensive to others, and we have to back off such displays, and that we are a systematically racist country as well as a city, and that we need to practice cancel culture, wokeness, defund the police, teach systematic race theory, and being a white supremacist,

1286
01:38:39,918 --> 01:39:05,130
and accept revisionary history as history's new truth, I take offense to such broad universal commentaries, especially by Washington politicians and self-serving proclaimed educators who have made their living by espousing race as their financial and social calling card for more than the past 20 years.

1287
01:39:06,933 --> 01:39:29,593
With crime running at an all time high, illegal immigration crossing our borders, causing ongoing social welfare, educational, security, and uncontrollable medical problems, we have now become the victims of today's liberal and progressives agenda of inclusion without requirement or responsibility.

1288
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:47,966
Also, if God offends anyone, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because our good God is part of our American inheritance of religious freedoms secure from governmental intervention.

1289
01:39:49,062 --> 01:40:03,052
And if our American stars and stripes offend you, or you do not like or believe in our Uncle Sam, and you don't have the tolerance for free speech, then you should seriously consider exporting yourself to another country.

1290
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:05,133
In conclusion,

1291
01:40:06,095 --> 01:40:10,496
Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion.

1292
01:40:11,277 --> 01:40:29,102
But for those who complain, whine, or gripe, or dislike our American way of life, as well as our city of Medford way of life, don't let the door slam you as you leave, because you do have the right and the opportunity to leave.

1293
01:40:30,162 --> 01:40:32,303
We are not a perfect society.

1294
01:40:33,805 --> 01:40:38,888
but there is no other country that offers more freedoms than our America.

1295
01:40:39,968 --> 01:40:58,299
So from a Memorial Day remembrance to a Flag Day observation, let not our freedom of thought, speech, and expression ever be challenged by some ideology that bears no fruit but hatred, division, and racism.

1296
01:40:59,422 --> 01:41:05,046
Thank you and let our method never be a part of any such movement or agenda.

1297
01:41:06,267 --> 01:41:25,782
I felt Mr. President and counselors, I had to say that because after being at the Memorial Day service and listening to our veterans director emotionally present before our community that for which a veteran is all about.

1298
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:30,351
I feel as an American.

1299
01:41:31,823 --> 01:41:35,166
I am a white Italian American.

1300
01:41:35,306 --> 01:41:36,167
I'm proud of it.

1301
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:40,670
I am not a racist, and I don't intend to be a racist.

1302
01:41:41,191 --> 01:41:55,382
I encompass anyone and everyone who wishes to express their opinion, and I would hope that our city of Medford does not go down any path that disrespects the fact of who we are as individuals.

1303
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:56,343
Thank you.

1304
01:41:56,423 --> 01:41:56,703
Thank you.

1305
01:41:58,925 --> 01:42:01,186
The gentleman from uh, east medford would like to speak.

1306
01:42:01,646 --> 01:42:04,267
Mr. Castanetti Yes counselor.

1307
01:42:04,448 --> 01:42:05,008
Can you hear me?

1308
01:42:05,028 --> 01:42:05,868
Counselor president?

1309
01:42:06,608 --> 01:42:12,491
I can hear you Thank you very much Um, I just wanted to ad lib a few words.

1310
01:42:12,571 --> 01:42:25,357
I wanted to go back in the meeting and thank The director of the veterans affairs for his wonderful words of of thankfulness to our veterans usa and because of them we still uh

1311
01:42:26,232 --> 01:42:34,759
speak the English language mostly, and also we still have the Constitution and I believe first, second amendments and more.

1312
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:37,581
Hopefully we have all of them in place.

1313
01:42:39,323 --> 01:42:42,205
Also, he was very well spoken.

1314
01:42:42,965 --> 01:42:44,767
He wrote a great speech.

1315
01:42:45,347 --> 01:42:52,193
He sounded good at Memorial Day at Oak Grove last Monday, and it's great to hear

1316
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:57,003
someone of his stature speak up for these veterans, including my father.

1317
01:42:58,263 --> 01:43:06,287
And come to think of it, I don't recollect President Biden talking on Memorial Day, anything to this effect to thank our veterans.

1318
01:43:07,027 --> 01:43:10,949
And I want to thank Mr. Durham, especially.

1319
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:12,530
Thank you all, counselors.

1320
01:43:14,211 --> 01:43:14,571
Thank you.

1321
01:43:16,032 --> 01:43:17,092
Any further discussion on this?

1322
01:43:17,632 --> 01:43:18,813
Hey, uh,

1323
01:43:22,252 --> 01:43:23,773
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1324
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,334
Bill Giglio on Winthrop Street.

1325
01:43:26,394 --> 01:43:36,980
So I am both saddened and upset that the high school, that at the high school, the POW MIA flag at the front entrance has been replaced with a rainbow flag.

1326
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:46,326
The POW MIA flag represents over the 87,000 soldiers who have still never made it home while protecting this great country.

1327
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:49,408
While the rainbow flag represents someone's sexuality

1328
01:43:50,382 --> 01:43:53,603
they get to enjoy the freedoms that these same soldiers fought for.

1329
01:43:54,443 --> 01:44:01,605
I wrote to the entire school committee, the mayor and the superintendent on this, and I only heard back from one of them.

1330
01:44:02,105 --> 01:44:19,470
I do realize that you guys as a committee have no say on what flies on the flagpoles at the high school, but I'm just using this platform just to use my voice to whomever makes the decisions to please do the right thing and put back the POW MIA flag.

1331
01:44:20,442 --> 01:44:28,163
One of the suggestions from the person I did hear back from was that another flagpole would be needed to correct the situation.

1332
01:44:28,964 --> 01:44:37,385
Well, it's a good thing they were in luck because there was an empty flagpole sitting in the courtyard with zero flags flying from it.

1333
01:44:37,445 --> 01:44:47,347
So I don't know if the committee can do anything about it, but I just find it totally disrespectful that on May 31st, we had a great celebration.

1334
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:52,544
June 1st, that POW flag came down and another flag was put up.

1335
01:44:52,584 --> 01:45:00,149
And before anyone thinks anything about me, just because it's a rainbow flag, that's not the case.

1336
01:45:00,289 --> 01:45:03,531
Like I said, there was an empty flagpole in the courtyard.

1337
01:45:03,771 --> 01:45:05,352
There's zero flags flying from it.

1338
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:08,214
I really don't think the POW flag should ever come down.

1339
01:45:08,434 --> 01:45:14,799
And this is probably the third year in a row that this, that the flag, the POW flag has been replaced by the rainbow flag.

1340
01:45:17,288 --> 01:45:19,470
There's many other flags out there that would never be hung.

1341
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:30,379
You know, we just lost two officers over the weekend and a thin blue flag would never, the thin blue flag represents foreign officers.

1342
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,783
A thin blue flag would never be hung on any of those poles at the high school.

1343
01:45:35,143 --> 01:45:35,884
That's all I wanted to say.

1344
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:36,444
Thank you.

1345
01:45:36,564 --> 01:45:36,885
Thank you.

1346
01:45:38,686 --> 01:45:39,967
Any further discussion in public?

1347
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:45,632
You have a new topic you want to speak on?

1348
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:49,201
You have a different topic?

1349
01:45:50,282 --> 01:45:50,542
Okay.

1350
01:45:50,562 --> 01:45:53,783
Yeah, come on up.

1351
01:45:55,044 --> 01:45:55,404
Good evening.

1352
01:45:55,424 --> 01:45:56,464
Name and address of the record, please.

1353
01:45:56,925 --> 01:45:59,606
My name is Richard Orlando, 13 Winford Way.

1354
01:46:00,346 --> 01:46:11,691
I wanted to just update you because I know on May 18th, you had a number of people who spoke on a subject, which typically would be the responsibility of the school committee.

1355
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:13,792
But this body was gracious.

1356
01:46:13,872 --> 01:46:14,652
I think Michael Marx,

1357
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:18,173
uh, pointed out that this is a venue for the public to speak.

1358
01:46:18,534 --> 01:46:24,417
And it was good discussion, different opinions, but discussion was had last night.

1359
01:46:24,437 --> 01:46:25,978
I attended the school committee meeting.

1360
01:46:26,538 --> 01:46:30,640
Um, and there were a lot of people there who I believe wanted to continue that discussion.

1361
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:35,743
The meeting started after about a 30 minute executive session.

1362
01:46:36,983 --> 01:46:41,166
It then proceeded for approximately three hours.

1363
01:46:41,866 --> 01:46:43,507
There were programs, um,

1364
01:46:44,873 --> 01:46:55,339
the strategic plan for the school, some proposals for software, for personnel, et cetera, all of those things, all worthy topics.

1365
01:46:56,299 --> 01:46:59,821
But the discussions went on, excuse me, for about three hours.

1366
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:04,583
And as you can imagine, the people in the audience, as time progressed, began thinning out.

1367
01:47:05,904 --> 01:47:08,525
There were a number of people still left, myself being one of them.

1368
01:47:10,206 --> 01:47:13,328
As the meeting got past the three hour point,

1369
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:19,633
There was a brief discussion on a controversial subject we've heard in the community about the Columbus school.

1370
01:47:20,073 --> 01:47:26,055
It was a brief discussion on forcing a vote next week at the school committee meeting on the 14th.

1371
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:38,241
Immediately after that, the mayor and school committee adjourned the meeting without opening up the session for public participation.

1372
01:47:38,761 --> 01:47:40,582
As you can imagine, I was dumbfounded.

1373
01:47:41,323 --> 01:47:46,967
And there were people who, the few people that were still there were very frustrated, but the meeting was ended.

1374
01:47:47,828 --> 01:47:55,234
And we heard certain explanations from protocol point of view and so on, but I just wanted to give you an update.

1375
01:47:55,834 --> 01:48:06,943
And I think just for you to understand the plight of people who want to speak on issues regarding our schools and school committee, that they're really not being heard or allowed to speak.

1376
01:48:07,303 --> 01:48:10,866
And that's very sad, given what we've just heard about

1377
01:48:11,252 --> 01:48:14,574
America, freedom of speech, and things of that nature.

1378
01:48:14,894 --> 01:48:15,975
So thank you very much.

1379
01:48:16,275 --> 01:48:16,595
Thank you.

1380
01:48:19,937 --> 01:48:21,478
Anything else on the public discussion?

1381
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,421
We haven't got that far yet.

1382
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,203
And no more public discussion.

1383
01:48:30,383 --> 01:48:30,463
OK.

1384
01:48:30,523 --> 01:48:30,944
Mr. President.

1385
01:48:31,864 --> 01:48:32,364
Council Max.

1386
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:38,288
Just if I could, and I think I'm obligated to say something on behalf of the residents of this community.

1387
01:48:39,099 --> 01:48:41,761
I appreciate knowing Rick Orlando for a lot of years.

1388
01:48:42,461 --> 01:48:51,666
I know Rick as a level-headed person, someone that speaks his mind, Mr. President, but also equally listens and hear what other people have to say.

1389
01:48:52,206 --> 01:49:04,313
And it's very disheartening, Mr. President, when you have a resident that's been in this city for a number of years, active in so many aspects of this community, that feels that his voice is being left out of a process.

1390
01:49:04,888 --> 01:49:08,932
especially a process, Mr. President, of a public body.

1391
01:49:09,472 --> 01:49:13,236
That really, really enrages me, Mr. President.

1392
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:17,660
I understand they have rules and regulations, and they can follow, Mr. President.

1393
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:33,813
But when a resident comes up to the podium, whether it's school committee, city council, board of commissions, every resident should have the right, the taxpayer, to ask a question, Mr. President, of their elected officials or their appointed bodies, whether they're boards or commissions.

1394
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:37,315
Everyone has a right to do it respectfully, Mr. President.

1395
01:49:37,715 --> 01:49:46,742
And to cut out people, to not allow them to speak because they may be saying something you don't want to hear is an outright disgrace, Mr. President.

1396
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:48,339
An outright disgrace.

1397
01:49:50,821 --> 01:49:58,127
And that's what's happened for the past year with this circus that's going on in this community that's dividing us, Mr. President.

1398
01:49:58,947 --> 01:50:07,214
I've never seen so many executive sessions in all my 26 years of elected office in this community.

1399
01:50:08,995 --> 01:50:14,960
What's the cloak of secrecy that's going on that you need that many executive sessions, Mr. President?

1400
01:50:16,455 --> 01:50:18,316
That's what the discussion should be about.

1401
01:50:21,578 --> 01:50:26,181
If you feel strongly about an issue, own up to it, and also allow people to talk.

1402
01:50:27,342 --> 01:50:32,725
It's when you run from an issue, Mr. President, that makes people believe something's going on that's rotten.

1403
01:50:33,926 --> 01:50:37,288
And that's what people believe in this community, whether it's true or not.

1404
01:50:38,889 --> 01:50:40,150
And I don't want to be part of that.

1405
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:45,133
And anyone that wants to come up to this podium, whether I agree or not, they have the right to do so.

1406
01:50:46,017 --> 01:50:50,760
And if we have to take hours like we've done in the past to listen to people, that's what we're here for.

1407
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,481
And the school committee should be doing the same thing.

1408
01:50:53,781 --> 01:51:02,947
Shame on all of them, all of them, the whole bunch, for not allowing someone standing up and allowing people to speak at a meeting.

1409
01:51:03,167 --> 01:51:11,412
And not even a common courtesy, Mr. President, when you know there's a number of people on the same issue, to make them wait three or four hours.

1410
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:13,733
Shame on them, Mr. President.

1411
01:51:15,868 --> 01:51:17,308
The people have the right to speak.

1412
01:51:18,429 --> 01:51:24,731
And they should have the common dignity to say, we have a lot of people on an issue here, let them speak at the beginning of the meeting.

1413
01:51:25,491 --> 01:51:27,532
Because Mr. Orlando is 100% correct.

1414
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:33,014
That's just an attempt to stifle people and weed people out, Mr. President.

1415
01:51:33,394 --> 01:51:34,174
Shame on them.

1416
01:51:35,615 --> 01:51:41,897
And people that show up to a meeting, we just talked about tonight, about having Zoom and the increased participation on Zoom.

1417
01:51:42,793 --> 01:51:45,774
What about the participation when someone shows up at a meeting?

1418
01:51:46,194 --> 01:51:49,094
Physically takes the time and comes down, and you don't want to hear them.

1419
01:51:49,114 --> 01:51:53,055
That's all I have to say, Mr. President.

1420
01:51:54,615 --> 01:51:55,396
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1421
01:52:00,837 --> 01:52:02,197
Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

1422
01:52:02,217 --> 01:52:03,157
Good evening.

1423
01:52:03,177 --> 01:52:03,597
Hold on.

1424
01:52:03,617 --> 01:52:03,897
Thank you.

1425
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,418
Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

1426
01:52:05,438 --> 01:52:10,259
Through the chair, thank you, Councilor Marks.

1427
01:52:12,578 --> 01:52:16,540
Last night's performance by the school committee was abhorrent.

1428
01:52:17,721 --> 01:52:18,782
It was terrible.

1429
01:52:19,402 --> 01:52:25,045
It was disrespectful that we people sat out here to make a point.

1430
01:52:25,765 --> 01:52:28,367
Nobody was going to get crazy or yell or scream or anything.

1431
01:52:28,847 --> 01:52:29,748
We had questions.

1432
01:52:30,268 --> 01:52:31,589
We had suggestions.

1433
01:52:32,189 --> 01:52:32,990
We needed to know.

1434
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:40,734
We were read the public participation guidelines, and then they went right to this other agenda.

1435
01:52:41,523 --> 01:52:42,503
for over three hours.

1436
01:52:43,804 --> 01:52:45,765
What an embarrassment this school committee is.

1437
01:52:46,805 --> 01:52:48,806
I hope in the fall that they're all replaced.

1438
01:52:49,226 --> 01:52:49,627
Thank you.

1439
01:52:51,788 --> 01:52:53,208
Any further public participation?

1440
01:52:55,749 --> 01:52:56,069
Thank you.

1441
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:57,590
All right.

1442
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:59,751
21-404 offered by President Caravello.

1443
01:53:00,251 --> 01:53:04,153
Being so resolved, the Memphis City Council will discuss the report submitted by Traffic Engineer

1444
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:11,941
in regards to high street, it'd be a further resolve that the traffic engineer and city engineer be available to discuss the issue.

1445
01:53:13,483 --> 01:53:18,687
We have Tim McGiven I see on the call here and we have Todd Blake.

1446
01:53:20,028 --> 01:53:31,018
Todd, you would issue a report that I had sent to the other counselors and if you'd like to go over that report and explain it to them, I'd really appreciate it.

1447
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:35,972
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Todd, please?

1448
01:53:45,379 --> 01:53:46,701
Sure, thank you for having me.

1449
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:48,562
Thank you for coming.

1450
01:53:50,123 --> 01:53:56,469
Yeah, Todd, you would send me a report and I in turn forwarded it to the other councillors.

1451
01:53:56,869 --> 01:54:01,333
If you could give us a brief synopsis on that, it'd be appreciated.

1452
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:02,102
Yep.

1453
01:54:02,703 --> 01:54:18,804
So it's my understanding that there have been some concerns about safety perhaps and the ability for trucks and others to make navigate the new turns on High Street, particularly at Woburn Street but maybe at the other end sections as well.

1454
01:54:20,325 --> 01:54:37,812
And I had reached out, based on those concerns, reached out to MassDOT and their consultants who designed the project to confirm that all the maneuvers at all the intersections, including Woburn at High, will be able to accommodate trucks.

1455
01:54:38,233 --> 01:54:43,595
Specifically at Woburn and High, WB40 trucks, which are typically

1456
01:54:44,375 --> 01:54:49,788
know the typical size semi-trailer and then all the other intersections

1457
01:54:51,682 --> 01:54:54,604
fire trucks and SU30s would be accommodated.

1458
01:54:54,764 --> 01:54:59,626
SU30 is a term engineers use for kind of a standard box truck.

1459
01:54:59,666 --> 01:55:04,529
It's a 30-foot truck, but the typical box truck you would see delivering a lot of types of goods.

1460
01:55:05,909 --> 01:55:09,031
And those turns will be able to be made at times.

1461
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:16,015
You might have to encroach onto the oncoming lane in certain situations on the side streets, not on the major street.

1462
01:55:16,795 --> 01:55:25,398
So I do want to reassure the council and residents that these maneuvers can be made with the current design.

1463
01:55:25,658 --> 01:55:30,780
I know it may not appear that way now just because it's still somewhat under construction.

1464
01:55:31,761 --> 01:55:40,604
So after the curb was set and the drums were there, once it's finally paved and finally marked, it may become more clear.

1465
01:55:40,744 --> 01:55:42,445
The yellow line on High Street,

1466
01:55:43,565 --> 01:55:45,787
is currently the old yellow line.

1467
01:55:46,287 --> 01:55:51,931
So once the new final markings are there, that yellow will shift over a little bit and it will become more apparent.

1468
01:55:55,353 --> 01:55:55,814
Thank you.

1469
01:55:56,354 --> 01:56:03,559
I know the fire chief had gone by there yesterday to take a look, see if he thought the fire trucks could make it through.

1470
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:10,484
I didn't hear back from him, but I have heard from waste management, they're saying they're having a hard turn.

1471
01:56:11,212 --> 01:56:14,014
I had time making that turn on the Woburn Street also.

1472
01:56:14,835 --> 01:56:30,806
So again, in a 10-mile department, I understand what the actual intent of it was, but we also have to take into consideration the people who don't drive speed limit, drive correctly, and that's

1473
01:56:31,387 --> 01:56:37,192
That's where my concern is, the people, the speed on that street, the trucks that get on there at a higher rate of speed.

1474
01:56:38,333 --> 01:56:49,222
Again, you went to traffic engineer when the truck rolled over down on Route 60, a little further down, and spilled 30,000 gallons of fuel into the Mystic River, because it hit the curb and rolled over.

1475
01:56:49,922 --> 01:56:57,869
So again, I'd hate to see something that tragic happen early in the morning as those oil trucks get on there,

1476
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:01,431
to deliver gasoline to our gas stations.

1477
01:57:01,711 --> 01:57:08,734
I would hope that maybe at the worst, there'd be a light there, so people can see it, especially coming up there, it comes up on you quick.

1478
01:57:09,454 --> 01:57:18,618
And like I said, you know, you went by the rotary, that rotary gets hit half a dozen times a year on Winter Street, and that's 10 times the size of that small island down there.

1479
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:23,240
So again, I'll open it up for questions from my fellow counselors.

1480
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:23,920
Vice President Knight.

1481
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:25,641
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1482
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:34,088
Growing up in the area, I grew up on Whitman Road, Essex Street, Winthrop Street, Essex Street, Whitman Road, Woburn Street.

1483
01:57:34,709 --> 01:57:37,069
There we are, two streets away from Woburn Street, Mr. President.

1484
01:57:37,929 --> 01:57:44,271
I was looking at the number of signs that go, it almost looks like Yale Street, High Street right now, they got so many signs on it.

1485
01:57:45,131 --> 01:57:54,853
But ultimately, Mr. President, if I were driving home from Medford Square, and I lived on Hastings Lane, Austin Road, Walcott Street,

1486
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:57,561
Well, Mystic Street, how do I get home?

1487
01:57:57,801 --> 01:58:00,203
I can't take a left turn down any of those streets.

1488
01:58:00,843 --> 01:58:08,828
So the answer would be, well, go down to the Parkway and then turn up from the Parkway onto the street.

1489
01:58:09,008 --> 01:58:12,170
But Hastings Lane has restrictions on it.

1490
01:58:12,591 --> 01:58:13,911
Mystic Streets, you do not enter.

1491
01:58:13,932 --> 01:58:16,013
You have to go down to Auburn Street.

1492
01:58:16,033 --> 01:58:18,634
You'd have to go all the way down to Auburn Street, all the way down to the school.

1493
01:58:19,075 --> 01:58:23,438
Does this make any sense to divert traffic from people that live in the neighborhood to go all the way down to the school, number one.

1494
01:58:23,858 --> 01:58:24,898
Number two, Mr. President,

1495
01:58:26,029 --> 01:58:30,330
We are seeing the changes that we made at the South and Main intersection.

1496
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:33,311
We are seeing now these changes along High Street.

1497
01:58:33,551 --> 01:58:37,332
We have a significant problem with Route 16, the light timing, Mr. President.

1498
01:58:37,352 --> 01:58:48,335
So every single morning, every single morning, the stretch of Winthrop Street between the Parkway and High Street backs up almost all the way to Lawrence Road, sometimes past it.

1499
01:58:49,115 --> 01:58:54,237
On the other side, it backs up almost all the way to the Woburn Street split, Mr. President.

1500
01:58:55,617 --> 01:59:07,870
looking at these changes that we're making to traffic patents, we need, we need, we have to study the impact that it has after the fact, because quite frankly, the light changing cycle on route 16 is not fast enough.

1501
01:59:08,932 --> 01:59:13,794
to, it doesn't happen frequent enough, to promote the steady flow of traffic through that intersection, Mr. President.

1502
01:59:13,814 --> 01:59:25,380
So what you see is someone driving down Winthrop Street, and they get to the Winthrop Street Rotary, and they say, well, I'm not gonna make the light, but I'm not gonna sit here either, so let me pull up and block the intersection.

1503
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:35,684
Or you see someone coming down High Street that doesn't wanna turn down Winthrop Street and keep going Winthrop Street to Tufts University, they wanna go onto Winthrop Street and then turn left onto Route 16 to get on the highway.

1504
01:59:36,105 --> 01:59:36,865
But what happens is,

1505
01:59:37,326 --> 01:59:42,549
The current high street blocks the passing traffic lane, so nobody from Winthrop Street can go straight down Winthrop Street.

1506
01:59:42,789 --> 01:59:43,489
It's a nightmare.

1507
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:45,470
It's an absolute traffic nightmare, Mr. President.

1508
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:57,016
I don't want to get into the last 10 years of traffic nightmares that the people in this area have had to deal with due to the simple fact that we've had construction going on between the Craddock Bridge, the Winthrop Street replacement, and the other source project.

1509
01:59:57,795 --> 02:00:07,158
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm glad we have 12 on the phone because I'd like to see what the plan is in terms of looking at the timing of the light cycles throughout this whole stretch.

1510
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:15,201
I mean, ultimately we make these changes, but then there's never any follow-up in terms of what impact it has on the traffic flow as a whole in this community.

1511
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:26,245
You know, for a very long time, we've been making knee-jerk reaction responses to the traffic situations in this community, but to put a no left-hand turn sign on the five streets coming up High Street,

1512
02:00:27,512 --> 02:00:30,433
Those streets, all the people that live on them, it's crazy to me, Mr. President.

1513
02:00:30,453 --> 02:00:31,013
You're one of them.

1514
02:00:31,213 --> 02:00:32,333
You're one of them, Mr. President.

1515
02:00:33,594 --> 02:00:36,895
So with that being said, Doug, maybe you can shed some light on that.

1516
02:00:37,015 --> 02:00:38,315
I might appreciate it if you could.

1517
02:00:38,595 --> 02:00:46,557
But I definitely think that we need to perform some type of traffic study to look at the impact that these changes have made, number one.

1518
02:00:46,878 --> 02:00:55,380
And number two, figure out a way that we can lessen them so that people in the area that have to get places can move down the roadway and not be trapped through an unpassable situation.

1519
02:00:57,255 --> 02:01:01,576
Inside we also lost the bus stop to the bus stop they took a bus stop out of it.

1520
02:01:04,577 --> 02:01:15,579
Yes, so the no left turns I believe was massive way of trying to simulate what measure already had in place was already existing on those side streets.

1521
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:17,339
So the side streets.

1522
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:25,341
Before this project came around, had do not enter except residents seven to nine from high street down to missing Valley Parkway.

1523
02:01:26,087 --> 02:01:32,770
So point of no return, which is different than do not enter because we may have Burke put those signs up.

1524
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:40,353
So if I'm coming down route 16, I can't turn out to any one of those streets either from route 16.

1525
02:01:40,853 --> 02:01:42,974
Those are all do not enters there.

1526
02:01:43,014 --> 02:01:55,699
So I, so again, you have to go all the way down to Auburn street, no matter which way, whether you're on route 60 or you're on route 16, you gotta go down to Auburn street, the turn to get out the high street, I'd get, get to one of those side street where particularly where I live.

1527
02:01:57,709 --> 02:02:00,430
So again, councilor Dice, right?

1528
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:02,830
To do not enter is one thing, but the no left turn is another.

1529
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:09,612
Because when Mayor Burke erected those resident only signs, there was a lot of discussion about who's considered a resident and who isn't.

1530
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:12,372
And that was addressed and discussed.

1531
02:02:12,432 --> 02:02:16,013
Same thing when it happened up at Jim's Market, when they put those signs up, that was addressed and discussed.

1532
02:02:16,073 --> 02:02:18,634
And it was residents are residents, residents can go down the street.

1533
02:02:19,014 --> 02:02:22,434
Now, you can't even take a left turn as a resident on the street.

1534
02:02:22,754 --> 02:02:25,315
Nevermind a resident in the city, a resident on the street to go home.

1535
02:02:25,962 --> 02:02:27,124
So I think that that's a problem.

1536
02:02:27,405 --> 02:02:38,242
And quite frankly, I've spoken with people that live in the neighborhood, not Councilor Caballero actually, but I've spoken with people on Hastings land, I've spoken with people on Austin road, I've spoken with people on Walcott street, and all of them say the same thing.

1537
02:02:38,282 --> 02:02:39,023
How am I supposed to get home?

1538
02:02:41,692 --> 02:02:47,033
Yeah, so it's probably a nuance between the way the city would handle something in the state.

1539
02:02:47,634 --> 02:02:52,495
The state doesn't necessarily support or endorse the accept residents.

1540
02:02:52,995 --> 02:03:00,137
So that's what their equivalent restriction would be, the no left turn seven to nine, instead of the do not enter.

1541
02:03:00,897 --> 02:03:03,198
What's the solution, I guess is the question.

1542
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:05,339
That's all well and good, but what's the solution?

1543
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,679
None of these residents have been contacted about this.

1544
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:10,640
All of a sudden, they're just getting it.

1545
02:03:11,783 --> 02:03:12,864
So what's the solution?

1546
02:03:13,044 --> 02:03:13,884
Can the science come down?

1547
02:03:17,426 --> 02:03:20,487
Can the science come down at some point until we get a resolution on this?

1548
02:03:24,188 --> 02:03:32,692
The answer is I guess we could revisit it and see what we can do working with our state partners once the project's complete.

1549
02:03:34,713 --> 02:03:39,775
So in essence it sounds like we sold our soul for this million dollars and we have no control of what's going to happen on the roadways that we

1550
02:03:40,948 --> 02:03:41,929
that these residents live on?

1551
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:56,699
Well, we have control of the local side streets that are outside the limits of the project, so I do hold hope that we'll find a solution for everyone involved.

1552
02:03:57,780 --> 02:04:03,504
In terms of the other aspects of the project, I think it has a lot of benefits to

1553
02:04:04,584 --> 02:04:07,686
improve pedestrian atmosphere, bicycle atmosphere, and things like that.

1554
02:04:07,726 --> 02:04:14,870
And it is actually supposed to improve safety and hopefully encourage slower speeds to get to the points earlier about the high speeds.

1555
02:04:16,011 --> 02:04:27,977
By narrowing the lanes and areas, but still able to accommodate trucks, the hope is that the safety will improve for all, for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.

1556
02:04:28,017 --> 02:04:32,319
So those are the true intents of the project.

1557
02:04:34,954 --> 02:04:38,575
And we do believe it will be successful in that regard once it's all said and done.

1558
02:04:40,336 --> 02:04:47,238
Mr. President, if I may, what I see happening is people are going to come up High Street, and they're going to get to the fork in the road.

1559
02:04:47,298 --> 02:04:56,981
And they're going to say, all right, I can shoot down moving street now, and then I can catch the top half of Walcott, and then I can shoot across High Street.

1560
02:04:58,022 --> 02:05:00,242
Because going straight across isn't a left turn.

1561
02:05:00,622 --> 02:05:02,223
So now what we're doing is we're diverting

1562
02:05:02,854 --> 02:05:08,336
traffic into the residential neighborhood, as opposed to keeping it on the main state controlled trucking route.

1563
02:05:10,397 --> 02:05:12,838
So was there any discussion of removal of the bus stop also?

1564
02:05:13,038 --> 02:05:19,580
I don't remember any discussion or any notice of the bus stop being deactivated.

1565
02:05:21,304 --> 02:05:22,144
on the part of them.

1566
02:05:23,045 --> 02:05:27,566
Mr. President, the project and the MBTA reached out to us regarding the potential removal.

1567
02:05:28,627 --> 02:05:33,748
The MBTA claims that they have the authority to remove versus move to remove on their own.

1568
02:05:33,808 --> 02:05:44,672
But we had pushed back saying that we wanted to notify the public to make sure that there's anyone that particularly anyone with needs that needs that stop versus another stop.

1569
02:05:45,632 --> 02:05:55,097
Based on ridership, the MBTA made the argument that, or the case, the reason why they're removing it is because the nearby stop has a lot of ridership in terms of ons and offs.

1570
02:05:55,537 --> 02:05:59,380
And that stop had much fewer and they were so close together.

1571
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:03,162
But we did push back and say, we want some notifications.

1572
02:06:03,202 --> 02:06:14,788
So they posted a sign on the post itself saying, you know, please contact either the city or the state regarding, you know, if you have any questions or concerns about this removal.

1573
02:06:16,895 --> 02:06:17,596
What information, Mr. President?

1574
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:19,378
What information, Councilor Maitland?

1575
02:06:19,478 --> 02:06:20,939
Is that considered a reduction in service?

1576
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:26,966
The removal of a stop for the DOT, for the MBTA.

1577
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:52,118
So, some of their policies suggest that consolidation of stops actually helps this I'm just repeating what they say it helps on time performance by not requiring the bus to pull over every block or so in their in their, in their preferred bus stop spacing, they prefer to be roughly 1200 feet between spacing.

1578
02:06:52,898 --> 02:06:59,325
So in some cases like this it may be more like 500 feet or less, and it may be, you know, one block versus several blocks.

1579
02:06:59,986 --> 02:07:05,412
So, in terms of on time performance and, you know, adhering to schedules.

1580
02:07:07,178 --> 02:07:14,561
they have this thought that the more the bus pulls over, the more delay, which will make it not on time.

1581
02:07:14,601 --> 02:07:17,603
So they look at ridership and ons and offs at each bus stop.

1582
02:07:18,323 --> 02:07:30,568
So if one bus stop nearby has 100 people getting on and off a day and another has less than 10 people, they'll sometimes look to consolidate the one that has the less than 10 people, especially if it's very close to one another.

1583
02:07:31,488 --> 02:07:35,210
I understand that, but does that correlate to what would be considered a reduction in service?

1584
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:40,081
I guess I would be open for interpretation.

1585
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:47,767
I don't believe so that, uh, one silver lining here is that you gain a parking space or two back when they do remove the stop.

1586
02:07:47,807 --> 02:08:02,859
So I, you know, uh, I thought there was going to be no parking in that side of the streets, the North side, uh, in that the one that I know of that's being removed, there is parking on the North side in that area.

1587
02:08:05,421 --> 02:08:05,801
Thank you.

1588
02:08:06,201 --> 02:08:08,183
I know Todd, thank you for answering these questions.

1589
02:08:08,243 --> 02:08:15,768
I know that I like to make a motion that we contact our partners, the MBTA.

1590
02:08:16,869 --> 02:08:25,535
I didn't get one, I didn't get two, but I got a few more phone calls from residents in the neighboring streets that have brought this issue.

1591
02:08:26,215 --> 02:08:32,840
They wanted to know why MBTA buses are driving down side streets in that neighborhood.

1592
02:08:33,533 --> 02:08:34,294
And I didn't believe it.

1593
02:08:34,514 --> 02:08:37,055
I said, no, maybe there was a detour.

1594
02:08:37,456 --> 02:08:44,780
Well, this past week I was driving, uh, coming home and it was about six, seven o'clock at night.

1595
02:08:45,181 --> 02:08:46,622
A little bit later, it was dark.

1596
02:08:47,142 --> 02:08:53,146
And I realized coming down Lawrence road, there's an MBTA bus in front of me.

1597
02:08:54,166 --> 02:08:59,290
And he, that, that driver was, they were going pretty quick out of service bus.

1598
02:08:59,910 --> 02:09:02,832
But I think this, I think it's time that we call, I know that

1599
02:09:03,269 --> 02:09:17,695
as a chairman of subcommittee transportation, we could do subcommittee, ask for a subcommittee meeting, but there are some issues that we're seeing right now, especially in that area with the MBTA and our community that we need some answers.

1600
02:09:17,755 --> 02:09:33,002
So I make that form of a motion that we call for a subcommittee or committee of the whole meeting, whatever this council prefers, because before somebody gets hurt with what's going on in that area with the changes,

1601
02:09:33,818 --> 02:09:41,943
and MBTA buses going down side streets, pretty narrow streets, by the way, before somebody gets injured.

1602
02:09:42,904 --> 02:09:45,125
Public safety should have some answers.

1603
02:09:45,185 --> 02:09:45,505
Thank you.

1604
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:50,868
Councilor Scott, while this is under suspension, this will be put on next week's agenda.

1605
02:09:52,329 --> 02:09:53,090
Any further discussion?

1606
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:55,451
Any further discussion?

1607
02:09:55,471 --> 02:09:55,951
Mr. President.

1608
02:09:56,512 --> 02:09:57,873
Councilor Max.

1609
02:09:57,913 --> 02:09:59,213
Mr. President, I wanna thank Todd.

1610
02:09:59,253 --> 02:10:03,376
You know, I know there's a lot he's working on in every part of the city,

1611
02:10:03,847 --> 02:10:05,108
So I really want to thank him.

1612
02:10:05,128 --> 02:10:08,312
He's like a one man team.

1613
02:10:09,513 --> 02:10:17,242
But Mr. President, every year this community pays an assessment to the team that comes directly off our cherry sheet that comes from the state.

1614
02:10:18,043 --> 02:10:21,447
Millions of dollars we pay for MBTA services.

1615
02:10:22,392 --> 02:10:38,744
And as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, when they start eliminating bus stops, when they start eliminating bus routes, like the 325 and the 326, that, in my opinion, is a diminishing of bus MBTA services in our community.

1616
02:10:39,444 --> 02:10:45,609
Nowhere else, Mr. President, would you get a diminishing service and pay the same or more for an assessment.

1617
02:10:46,189 --> 02:10:48,991
It makes zero sense, Mr. President.

1618
02:10:49,591 --> 02:10:51,693
Right out here in back of City Hall,

1619
02:10:52,576 --> 02:10:58,703
They have bus stops where they idle their buses, the MBTA, on city-owned property.

1620
02:10:59,844 --> 02:11:01,706
City-owned parking lot, Mr. President.

1621
02:11:02,207 --> 02:11:05,911
The MBTA has practical use of that parking lot out there.

1622
02:11:06,832 --> 02:11:10,677
I don't know what's going on, Mr. President, but this community needs to stand up.

1623
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:24,498
And if it's a matter of holding back some money from the T assessment to get them at the table and to negotiate with the MBTA regarding what's going on regarding service and so forth, that's what needs to be had, Mr. President.

1624
02:11:24,938 --> 02:11:26,579
This has been going on far too long.

1625
02:11:26,819 --> 02:11:31,722
We need leadership in this community to stand up and say, we're not going to tolerate this anymore.

1626
02:11:32,303 --> 02:11:34,404
And that project on Winter Street's no different.

1627
02:11:35,121 --> 02:11:44,785
When that project came out about a year ago, Mr. President, I know we were all vocal, but I mentioned that a year ago, that we're going to lose control of what happens on that particular road.

1628
02:11:46,345 --> 02:11:57,349
And when we said we're going to lose parking, Mr. President, then when they talk about putting a bike path to nowhere, those were questions that we raised that fell on deaf ears, Mr. President.

1629
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:02,351
And now you see a project that we have little say in, right?

1630
02:12:02,831 --> 02:12:03,852
I mean, we heard, uh,

1631
02:12:05,089 --> 02:12:06,029
Todd Blake mentioned.

1632
02:12:06,690 --> 02:12:08,032
This is a state project.

1633
02:12:08,292 --> 02:12:09,353
We have very little say.

1634
02:12:10,434 --> 02:12:14,498
The chief executive officer has to bring these state agencies to the table.

1635
02:12:14,999 --> 02:12:18,662
We can't allow them to roll over us on behalf of the residents.

1636
02:12:19,163 --> 02:12:25,209
And Council Vice President Knight's a thousand percent correct when he said you're diverting traffic into the neighborhoods.

1637
02:12:26,830 --> 02:12:28,312
And that's exactly what's going to happen.

1638
02:12:30,825 --> 02:12:39,429
You're taking them off a major thoroughfare that's set up for this type of traffic, and you're putting them into neighborhoods, Mr. President, that's not set up.

1639
02:12:40,569 --> 02:12:40,969
Thank you.

1640
02:12:41,629 --> 02:12:41,930
Thank you.

1641
02:12:42,510 --> 02:12:42,970
Councilor Beall.

1642
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,331
Mr. President, I'll be brief.

1643
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:46,892
I just want to thank Councilor Mark for his comments.

1644
02:12:47,712 --> 02:12:49,773
We have, I think, many issues with the MBTA.

1645
02:12:50,053 --> 02:12:57,456
I know I received, in addition to the issue that's going on on High Street, you know, we have issues with the 325, 326 that I receive calls on constantly.

1646
02:13:00,725 --> 02:13:11,169
So if Councilor Scott Pelley wouldn't mind, if we have a committee in the hall instead of a subcommittee, I just think it should be a broader discussion with regards to the MBTA and the services that they provide here.

1647
02:13:11,229 --> 02:13:12,890
Well, I should say the lack of services.

1648
02:13:13,930 --> 02:13:15,751
So I would appreciate that.

1649
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:19,112
We'll make that a committee in the hall.

1650
02:13:19,132 --> 02:13:22,174
Mr. President, Councilor Best, if we could have the 710 bus as well.

1651
02:13:22,954 --> 02:13:23,334
That's right.

1652
02:13:23,354 --> 02:13:23,854
Correct, yes.

1653
02:13:23,994 --> 02:13:25,275
That was also canceled.

1654
02:13:26,337 --> 02:13:28,419
That's an important part to the people living in Fulton Street.

1655
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:30,681
That's their only means of transportation.

1656
02:13:33,623 --> 02:13:35,084
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1657
02:13:38,627 --> 02:13:41,249
Pat, if you put on the podium.

1658
02:13:41,729 --> 02:13:47,954
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1659
02:13:48,474 --> 02:13:50,395
Robert Penton, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

1660
02:13:51,136 --> 02:13:55,059
I have some, Mr. President, this is our third time we've had this discussion on this high street project.

1661
02:13:55,527 --> 02:13:58,568
at the corner of Woobin and Hastings Lane.

1662
02:13:59,609 --> 02:14:16,715
And I'm a little bit disturbed and recognizing that Mr. Blake, who I've never met, I'm quite sure that he's proficient in what he does, but he makes a comment in his response to you by saying fire trucks may have to use the entire opposite lane to make the turns.

1663
02:14:17,819 --> 02:14:25,225
And by doing that, Mr. President, what you are doing, you are exposing the city of Medford to a tremendous amount of liability.

1664
02:14:26,106 --> 02:14:46,442
And if the city is going to go forward and leave that island there, then it should be part of the official record here that the Medford City Council does not support, but rather condones the fact that that island can now cause a potential hazard to the city of Medford's liability.

1665
02:14:47,682 --> 02:14:53,585
We've spoken to MBTA buses, there's no mention in here on the extra long tankers that carry gas.

1666
02:14:54,305 --> 02:15:00,548
The other day coming down high street toward the charter circle, there was a bicyclist there.

1667
02:15:01,329 --> 02:15:03,930
And you know those trucks once they have that weight, they're moving.

1668
02:15:05,631 --> 02:15:11,314
And he was people in the home because the bike was just taking his time going through that little pathway there.

1669
02:15:12,254 --> 02:15:13,715
So all I can say is,

1670
02:15:14,752 --> 02:15:16,273
It's there, it's in writing.

1671
02:15:16,914 --> 02:15:35,131
And the city council now has enough, if you're really strong in this position, and I think you are, you have an affirmative position to make by way of a vote that the city of Medford, the Medford city council opposes that particular island that's put there because the acknowledgement from your own traffic commissioner says,

1672
02:15:35,872 --> 02:15:40,815
The fire trucks might have to go on the complete opposite lane to make its turn.

1673
02:15:40,835 --> 02:15:43,137
What about a car coming the opposite way?

1674
02:15:43,377 --> 02:15:45,038
What about the bump out that's over there?

1675
02:15:45,058 --> 02:15:46,259
What about the second island?

1676
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:53,324
What about the bump out that's in front of the house, in front of the man's driveway, in front of the Brooks School?

1677
02:15:53,804 --> 02:15:55,305
It makes no sense at all.

1678
02:15:55,925 --> 02:16:00,529
And go further down into West Method on the corner of High Street and Sagamore Ave.

1679
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:03,070
Look what they already have penciled out there.

1680
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:05,392
It's on to the middle of the street almost.

1681
02:16:06,353 --> 02:16:08,154
These aren't traffic calming.

1682
02:16:08,174 --> 02:16:10,855
These are traffic accidents just waiting to happen.

1683
02:16:11,115 --> 02:16:15,197
And you've got to understand the route traffic and the type of traffic that's on those routes.

1684
02:16:15,958 --> 02:16:18,039
I think you brought it up last week, Mr. President.

1685
02:16:18,339 --> 02:16:21,840
A truck going up the hill, they've got to pick up the speed to get up the hill.

1686
02:16:21,860 --> 02:16:22,721
Look at the buses.

1687
02:16:22,741 --> 02:16:24,222
What are you going to do?

1688
02:16:24,282 --> 02:16:28,624
And right there at that intersection, there's a bump out there, which makes further no sense.

1689
02:16:29,904 --> 02:16:31,165
So I don't know, Mr. Blake.

1690
02:16:31,485 --> 02:16:33,326
Like I said, I've never met you and I don't know you.

1691
02:16:34,487 --> 02:16:43,374
But I don't know how you can put in writing that a firetruck can go in the opposite lane to make its turn if it has to because of an emergency.

1692
02:16:43,774 --> 02:16:48,498
You are now indicating that the city is exposing itself to a liability.

1693
02:16:49,659 --> 02:17:00,127
And if that's what the state is going to be doing throughout the rest of the city, with these locations, with these prompts, causing problems with side streets because of buses,

1694
02:17:00,885 --> 02:17:02,528
and cars cannot be going down there.

1695
02:17:02,728 --> 02:17:12,164
What are we getting all this money for the state for if the city has no input into providing common sense use of the money?

1696
02:17:13,145 --> 02:17:14,087
It's a damn shame.

1697
02:17:14,899 --> 02:17:22,525
that we have to be discussing, you folks have to be discussing something that common sense tells you by just going there and looking at it.

1698
02:17:22,545 --> 02:17:27,909
And you can paint and stripe the streets all you want with your yellow lines, you're not gonna get rid of those islands.

1699
02:17:28,249 --> 02:17:40,098
And you're not going to get rid of the fact that coming up or going down in a winter's day storm, and if there's ice in the road, and if there's an emergency that has to take place, somebody is gonna get killed there.

1700
02:17:41,279 --> 02:17:42,940
And you already have it now in writing.

1701
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:51,663
Your traffic supervisor has now told you in writing that a fire truck can go on the opposite lane if he can't make the turn.

1702
02:17:52,283 --> 02:17:53,163
What does that tell you?

1703
02:17:53,423 --> 02:17:59,725
What does that tell you about the Commonwealth of Massachusetts coming in here trying to tell the city of Metro, we know what's best for your streets.

1704
02:18:01,166 --> 02:18:12,230
Tell them to take their money back and mind their business and let the city of Metro to its engineering department and through citizen input, take each section one at a time to realize what it is.

1705
02:18:14,052 --> 02:18:22,838
It's all right for somebody to come in here and tell you what to do, but it isn't all right for you to tell them, possibly you maybe made a mistake.

1706
02:18:23,038 --> 02:18:25,540
You haven't thought this out correctly or possibly.

1707
02:18:26,181 --> 02:18:30,423
Mr. President, you're the president of this council, the six of you, you make seven.

1708
02:18:30,804 --> 02:18:38,149
I would strongly, I strongly advise and suggest that some one of you, if not all of you put a resolution on

1709
02:18:38,851 --> 02:18:51,516
indicating that you do not, you are against, and you don't accept the fact that that island in the middle of High Street, Reuben, Hastings Lane, serves in the best interest of the city of Medford.

1710
02:18:51,656 --> 02:18:54,497
If anything, it does not serve in the best interest.

1711
02:18:54,897 --> 02:19:01,699
And you have the letter from your own traffic supervisor who says the same thing, traffic consultant, excuse me.

1712
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:03,680
Thank you.

1713
02:19:05,321 --> 02:19:06,421
Tim, did you want to weigh in on this?

1714
02:19:08,096 --> 02:19:14,461
I believe Todd has said what needs to be said, and I believe he's muted as well.

1715
02:19:15,422 --> 02:19:18,284
I said I believe Todd has said what needs to be said.

1716
02:19:18,304 --> 02:19:21,406
I don't have much to add, but I believe he's muted at the moment.

1717
02:19:22,847 --> 02:19:24,128
Todd, did you want to add anything to this?

1718
02:19:26,210 --> 02:19:26,470
Todd?

1719
02:19:28,452 --> 02:19:29,012
Hold on one second.

1720
02:19:30,226 --> 02:19:30,867
Hey, how's it going?

1721
02:19:31,327 --> 02:19:32,308
Yeah, I was muted again.

1722
02:19:32,328 --> 02:19:32,989
Sorry about that.

1723
02:19:33,609 --> 02:19:35,411
I had a mute on my end, then I couldn't unmute.

1724
02:19:35,991 --> 02:19:37,733
So I just wanted to clarify something.

1725
02:19:37,773 --> 02:19:44,619
I appreciate whatever anyone says and, you know, and wants to add to the situation, but I just wanted to clarify something.

1726
02:19:45,572 --> 02:19:54,359
So what I read earlier was a quote from an email received by the traffic consultant that designed the project for MassDOT.

1727
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:58,343
And I just wanna clarify because it's a little bit, I think a little bit confusing at Woburn.

1728
02:19:58,723 --> 02:20:06,089
So Woburn, this is a quote now, Woburn Street was checked and can accommodate WB40 trucks for all turns.

1729
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:10,573
So WB40 truck is an 18-wheeler, a 45-foot 18-wheeler.

1730
02:20:10,893 --> 02:20:13,475
So in that case, it does not need to encroach.

1731
02:20:14,376 --> 02:20:29,202
all the intersections all the other intersections can accommodate fire trucks but may have to use the entire opposite lane all turns and bumpers are checked to accommodate vice president night is the intention to divert 18 wheeler trucks down woven street

1732
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:32,530
No, not at all.

1733
02:20:32,991 --> 02:20:38,273
So people are saying that they believe it's too tight, correct, with the median and the new bump out there.

1734
02:20:38,693 --> 02:20:45,476
But with the consultant and everyone else saying it's not too tight, a truck could go east-west on High Street as it should.

1735
02:20:46,036 --> 02:20:57,141
And if a vehicle of a large size needed to go on Woburn like a trash truck or fire truck or whatnot, it would be able to make it because it's a smaller truck than an 18-wheeler truck.

1736
02:20:57,901 --> 02:21:00,162
So the turns can be made at Woburn.

1737
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:03,780
Is that more clear?

1738
02:21:05,081 --> 02:21:06,061
Thank you for your clarification.

1739
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:06,801
All right.

1740
02:21:08,541 --> 02:21:08,741
All right.

1741
02:21:08,861 --> 02:21:16,663
Well, again, this, this will be back on the agenda for next week because it is under suspension and we will, uh, any further discussion will be had again next week.

1742
02:21:16,703 --> 02:21:18,943
So thank you.

1743
02:21:19,364 --> 02:21:19,604
All right.

1744
02:21:19,664 --> 02:21:24,565
So we have a hearing left in the budget.

1745
02:21:24,585 --> 02:21:24,645
Yes.

1746
02:21:24,965 --> 02:21:28,145
Earrings to one one nine zero legal though.

1747
02:21:28,165 --> 02:21:30,426
City of Bedford, Memphis city council chapter 94 zoning.

1748
02:21:31,953 --> 02:21:33,814
I'm glad that we got this.

1749
02:21:33,834 --> 02:21:40,419
The Memphis City Council shall conduct a public hearing on Tuesday, June 8th, 2021 at seven o'clock p.m.

1750
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:59,953
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a petition by Mayor Brianna Lundgren to amend Chapter 94 zoning, a revised ordinance of the City of Medford, Section 94-35A, to change the structure of the Memphis Zoning Board of Appeals from three members and one associate member to five members and two associate members.

1751
02:22:00,593 --> 02:22:03,955
The full text of the amendment may be viewed in the office of the city clerk.

1752
02:22:04,555 --> 02:22:06,937
I'm going to say over 103 or on the city's website.

1753
02:22:10,599 --> 02:22:16,322
Our current CD board file and Zoom link will be posted no later than June 4th.

1754
02:22:20,185 --> 02:22:25,988
So Mr. Clerk, but this is a hearing.

1755
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:30,873
We, I think, I think we missed the date on this.

1756
02:22:30,993 --> 02:22:31,353
We did.

1757
02:22:31,533 --> 02:22:40,421
We're gonna have to refer it back up to the OCD board for them to send it, re-approve it and send it back to us.

1758
02:22:40,981 --> 02:22:41,502
That is correct.

1759
02:22:41,742 --> 02:22:43,343
Okay, we have to make a motion to do that.

1760
02:22:43,384 --> 02:22:46,606
Motion to refer back, Mr. President, to the Office of Community Development.

1761
02:22:46,626 --> 02:22:50,730
The motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Mr. President.

1762
02:22:51,785 --> 02:23:07,338
Vice President, I just ask that we also simultaneously send this paper to the city solicitor and ask her to provide us with an amendment that would outline the creation or establishment of term limits for members of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1763
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:18,107
Okay, so on the motion by Council by Council Marx is amended by Council Vice President seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1764
02:23:18,127 --> 02:23:19,949
You want that done before we send it?

1765
02:23:20,678 --> 02:23:21,898
We can do it simultaneously.

1766
02:23:21,978 --> 02:23:23,639
It's going to come back to us anyway.

1767
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:26,300
So I'd like to have a, cause we're going to have to open up a public hearing.

1768
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:29,881
So I'd like to have the paperwork from the city solicitor when it's time.

1769
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:32,422
They're going to come back pretty quickly with their recommendation, right?

1770
02:23:32,522 --> 02:23:33,942
Cause they've already voted on it.

1771
02:23:34,382 --> 02:23:34,902
Right.

1772
02:23:36,283 --> 02:23:36,483
Yeah.

1773
02:23:36,863 --> 02:23:37,103
Yeah.

1774
02:23:37,243 --> 02:23:39,104
So I'd like to send the paper to the solicitor as well.

1775
02:23:39,164 --> 02:23:39,804
So we can get it back.

1776
02:23:40,224 --> 02:23:41,004
Okay.

1777
02:23:41,184 --> 02:23:42,445
Provided that my colleagues agree.

1778
02:23:42,685 --> 02:23:42,865
Wow.

1779
02:23:42,985 --> 02:23:49,807
They're going to have, they're going to have to, well,

1780
02:23:50,897 --> 02:23:55,821
I, it's, it's too late to advertise it for the June meeting, they're going to have to advertise it in July.

1781
02:23:56,141 --> 02:23:58,924
So that's something we call the role.

1782
02:24:00,765 --> 02:24:01,345
Council bears.

1783
02:24:01,486 --> 02:24:01,746
Yes.

02:25:00,603 --> 02:25:02,444
And refer the paper to Committee of the Whole.

1799
02:25:02,484 --> 02:25:04,504
We'll make it a double motion so we only have to vote once.

1800
02:25:04,524 --> 02:25:09,445
And refer the paper to Committee of the Whole.

1801
02:25:10,285 --> 02:25:11,305
Third, I'll give it a third.
