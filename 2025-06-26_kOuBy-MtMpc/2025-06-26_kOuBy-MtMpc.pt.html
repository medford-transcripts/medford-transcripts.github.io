    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=0.271s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So good evening everyone.
 My name is Emily Henneman.
 I am chair of the Medford Community Development Board, and I'm calling the meeting to order.
 Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.
 This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.
 No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.
 A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting on progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website.
 If despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.
 And a reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.
 I would also like everyone to know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, medfordma.org.
 Clicking on current CD board filings and Danielle or a member of the staff will drop that link in the chat.
 We are going to start with roll call attendance.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=115.58s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Good to have you as vice.
 And myself, Chair Emily Hedeman.
 Danielle, can you please introduce any staff from the call?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=127.055s">[Danielle Evans]</a>:  Yes, myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.
 We also have Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of PDS.
 I think we had Sal DiStefano, the Director of Economic Development, if he's still here.
 Yeah, I see Sal.
 We have Brenda Pike, who is the Climate Planner in our office.
 Welcome, Brenda.
 one of our student interns, Josh Needleman, who will be taking minutes tonight.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=157.803s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Awesome.
 Important job, Josh.
 Thumbs up for minutes.
 I used to do that when I staffed a board.
 So it's an important job.
 So our first item on the agenda tonight is a new public hearing.
 We've had continuances for previous public hearings, but this is a new one, so I'm going to read the public hearing notice for the record.
 This is a rather long one, so I just wanted to give people a preview that you're going to hear my voice for a couple minutes.
 So the public hearing notice for the record is that the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on January 22nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m.
 via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.
 Amend section 94-2.1, which is division into districts, to add the Salem Street Quarter District.
 Amend section 94-6.0, which refers to general regulations, to insert a new subsection to create the new green score zoning regulation and to state the applicability, standards, and calculation methodology therein.
 Amend Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, specifically Table A, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District into the existing table and to designated the uses permitted therein.
 Amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, specifically Table B, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein.
 Amend section 94-12, which is definitions, to amend and add various definitions.
 Amend section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Salem Street Corridor District.
 Amending the zoning map to create a new Salem Street Corridor District and to change the zoning district designation of various properties to place them within said district, as shown on a map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning, dated December 8th, 2024.
 Amend section 94-11.7, which is site plan review, to incorporate the green score regulation by adding submission requirements
 for the site plan review and modifications and establish a waiver process.
 We also include Zoom link meeting details in this notice.
 This is the Zoom meeting that you are all in presently and also posted this on the city website calendar.
 I would also like to let everyone know that a subsequent public hearing on this same matter will be held by the Medford City Council on February 11th, 2025 at 7 p.m., excuse me, in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, which is 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom.
 So two different ways to be involved with that hearing.
 A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than November 29th, 2024.
 I'd like to start this off by asking staff if they have any introductory comments, and then we will be viewing a presentation from Emily Innes of Innes & Associates.
 There's going to be two aspects to it.
 So for people that were very patient with the list of different changes that we're reviewing and providing recommendations on tonight, there's kind of two different topics.
 There's the green score zoning, and then there's zoning itself.
 So we're going to hear first about zoning, and then we're going to hear about green score zoning regulation, just to kind of set the stage for everyone and manage expectations.
 So Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and her team?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=440.592s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Madam Chair, I do believe that NS Associates has a pretty solid introduction explaining a lot of the background, the timing, etc.
 But I did want to share for the public, this is not one of our normally scheduled weeks for the Community Development Board meetings.
 However, we were aware that we had a number, a large number of public hearings that we needed to
 here, and we wanted to give the zoning its due time.
 Last time we took up zoning after several public hearings, it was much too late and too difficult to process all that information late at night.
 So we thought this deserved its own separate hearing.
 For those who are not aware, the city board meeting actually went until midnight last week, and we could never have taken this up after that.
 which is why we're hearing this on a separate week.
 And we continue to have a pretty heavy caseload, even though we're meeting twice a month.
 So with that, I'm actually going to pass this off to Emily Innis and Paula Ramos-Martinez, too, because they will put this into the context of the comprehensive plan, which is something that Emily actually worked on with us for several years, as the board is aware.
 I think that's sufficient.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=522.088s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Alicia.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=525.05s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  With your permission, Madam Chair, for the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.
 I'm joined by my colleague Paula Ramos Martinez.
 We are together going to give you a presentation starting with Paula first to go over the background to the zoning change for the Salem Street corridor, what we're doing, why we're doing it, information about that.
 I will then join you for the details of the zoning, so I can show you from the summary information where to find that within the language of the zoning itself, particularly important for many people on this call who may not deal with zoning on a regular basis, who just want to give them a guide to where to find it.
 Then at the appropriate moment, Hala will be back to you to explain the green score, again, what it is, why it is, and what the implications are.
 So that is our plan for tonight.
 I will just reiterate with what Alicia said I know Paola will talk to it as well but just said the this zoning process or rezoning process that we're in now was a recommendation of the comprehensive plan so we are essentially in the implementation stage of that recommendation by bringing forward the details that were envisioned in the plan.
 With that, and with your permission, I'm going to turn this over to Paola, who will share her screen and take us through the first part of the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=607.71s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Great.
 Thank you, Emily.
 Hello, everyone.
 This is Paola.
 Madam, if I may, I'm going to share my screen and start with the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=625.201s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  We can see your screen.
 We're looking at a meeting reminder, which no matter how many times you dismiss, they always pop back up.
 All right, now we got a presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=639.943s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  OK, it's going a bit slow then.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=642.084s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And we are looking at your presenter view.
 Now it's just the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=650.131s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Great.
 So I wanted to say, it was already said before, but we have
 two main things that we want to present today.
 One is going to be about Salem Street Corridor District and that is going to take the first part of this presentation.
 We will take questions and later on we will come back with the presentation and do the second part which is the green square.
 So in the agenda for Salem Street what I have is we're going to talk about the timeline.
 So what has
 what we did before and that made us come here at this meeting today.
 So what was the process before that?
 What are the opportunities for public comments?
 Not for this one alone, but because we're going to come back
 We are reviewing zoning, so we are going to do a lot of topics, very different topics.
 I want to give to everyone what is the process when we take a new draft, what are the different
 phases that has to go through and when in those phases you could give comments.
 Then I'm going to do introduction of why this, why Salem, where does that come from.
 We're going to go into your current zoning, what is there now, and then we're going to show the proposed zoning map.
 The last two topics I'm going to give to Emily, and she's going to go through the draft, so the language, and she's going to talk first about the general changes that are being done to the Medford zoning ordinance, and then the new district that we are adding.
 And after that, we will do the Q&A.
 I must say that I'm very happy that there is so many people here today.
 So what was the timeline?
 When did this started?
 And what were the meetings that we had until today?
 So we did a workshop in July 24th, where we showed a lot of analysis that were done at a citywide level, and also for Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.
 And this analysis were very varied, but were showing us dimensions,
 of the lots, the existing zoning, non-conformities, transit, a lot of different topics.
 And all those topics were citywide, but also Mystic and Salem.
 So this helped us to get started with the analysis.
 And then in the August 14th, we brought the first proposal.
 We started with Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.
 In December 3rd, we did Mystic Avenue first.
 That's why you see a big gap between August and December.
 And then when we finished Mystic, we started with Salem Street.
 We presented the draft.
 And then in December 11, we presented the final with the comments and different little tweaks that we did to the first draft.
 In December 11th, the Planning, Permitting and Committee meeting, I referred and approved to refer this draft to the CDB and this is why we're here today.
 So what is the process?
 So what we're going to do, and this is going to be with every topic that we are going to bring forward for the rezoning, we're going to first in city council, and this is in the planning committee meetings, we're going to bring a new topic, we're going to present it.
 And here we're going to listen from the councillors, from the city staff, and from the public, any comment that they may have.
 So we will come back another time to a planning committee meeting, and we will present the draft with the alterations that were needed.
 If everything goes well, then the city council can refer to the city board.
 Here again, we will hear from the public, from the board, and the board will vote.
 the topic and it can be referred again to the City Council and the City Council can give the final approval.
 So this is a process and in every of these phases and stages the public has an opportunity to comment on it.
 We are telling you this because we are going to continue looking at different topics and this list is going to be updated every time that we present it.
 So in gray, you're going to see different dates and topics.
 The gray says represented meetings that were already done.
 The red are the meetings that we're doing today, and that's Salem Street and Green Score topics.
 And the blue are the ones that will come in the future.
 So this is going to be updated.
 So we have the final dates.
 And every time that we present, we're going to
 let you know which are the new topics that we are working on and at what stage they are so that you can write it down and join any meeting that you would like.
 So where does it come from?
 Why we're doing this or why we're doing Salem Street?
 Where does it come from?
 So in 2023, January, it was published the Medfair Comprehensive Plan.
 In here, it was the work that was done by the city consultants, and there was a lot of public engagement.
 It was a two-year plan.
 In here, you can see and that are identified all the problems, opportunities that Medford has.
 So for example, we see here, so at the end of this book, and I recommend anyone that is interested in, we are basing a rezoning on this.
 So all the principles values are taken from this comprehensive plan.
 And at the end, it has a
 very long list of strategies that are organized by topics and one for example the VP which is vibrant places 1.1.2 refers to rezone to allow mixed use in village centers as a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street.
 So what you can see on the right is the vision map that comes out of this comprehensive plan.
 In this vision map you can see the corridors, so in here they were identified the corridors, squares and centres, transformational focus areas, green corridors, institutional anchors and different densities in the residential area.
 So what we are looking now is first we started with corridors, we started with Mystic Avenue, we're working now with Salem, later on we will look into the squares, we are looking now into neighborhood residential, so the low scale of the residential, and we will continue to look into every topic that was identified in this comprehensive plan.
 So we are going to look now at Salem Street,
 what is your current zoning and what does your current zoning allows.
 So in zoning, whenever we're going to rezone or rewrite a part, a district, what we have to do is to look what is existing, what is your current zoning, what are the future trends,
 If there is a comprehensive plan, for example, like we do have in Medford, what are those values and goals that the city has?
 And implement that in our proposal.
 So what do you have in your current zoning?
 It's not exactly, especially in Salem Street, it's not exactly what you do have right now.
 So what we're going to look into is Salem Street, you have three different districts.
 You have apartment one district, and that is the majority of Salem Street is in that district.
 Then you have commercial one at the end in the corner with Salem Street and Fellsway.
 And then in the other side of Fellsway, you have apartment two.
 So what does it mean?
 So we have here the dimension standards.
 We have it in a different way than your table because the table is a bit of difficult to read.
 So we have it by district.
 And so your dimension standards in apartment one
 your maximum height is three stories.
 Then it can be four if it's assisted living.
 But let's say that your multi-dwelling is up to three stories.
 Your C1 is up to six stories.
 These are all heights by right.
 In the case that in C1, somebody wants to do a hotel, by right, you can do 15, 1.5 stories high.
 In apartment 2, we have something similar.
 We have 6 by right and 15 for any other permissible permitted structure.
 So, this is what you have now in your current zoning.
 So if we see it a bit more like in a diagram illustration, what does it mean?
 Apartment one, that is this salmon pink that you have in Salem Street, in the majority of the Salem Street, you have, for example, single family maximum is 2.5.
 If you have, oh, sorry, there is a typo here.
 If you have multiple dwelling, it's three stories high.
 Oh, sorry, yeah, I know what it is, sorry.
 you have single family detached, that's 2.5, single family attached, that is your typical house, sorry, and that is three stories high, and then you have multiple dwelling that is three stories high.
 What happens in apartment one is that
 commercial use is not allowed.
 So you have all the commercial buildings that are from 93 until commercial one are uses that are not allowed in your current zoning.
 Now, if we go to commercial one, commercial use, yes, it is allowed.
 You can have multiple dwelling up to six stories.
 This is what is allowed right now.
 And you can have a hotel that is 15 stories high.
 With apartment is very similar, but instead of a hotel, what you have is any other principle structure that is allowed in apartment too.
 And the dwelling, multiple dwelling, it's also six stories high.
 So in our proposal, we don't think that those highs
 And those uses really reflect what you do have right now.
 Because you do have a lot of commercial that we do think it's important to keep and to make it conforming.
 You do have, sorry, you don't have the area to really let 15 stories high, not a hotel or any other.
 So we made a different proposal.
 We want also to have mixed use.
 So what we did is to create different sub-districts.
 We wanted to create a lot of diversity as it is already now.
 We wanted to look really into what you have and what really works.
 And the proposal comes from there.
 So we have two mixed uses.
 Mixed use one, that's the blue.
 Mixed use two, that is the reddish.
 Then we have commercial.
 Commercial is just one little parcel in here and I will explain why.
 This is the dark red.
 And then the rest is the yellow multi-unit residential.
 So I'm going to start for the residential.
 Whenever we saw that the lot was entire, the whole block was entire, already existing, all residential, we kept it.
 We think it's very important.
 This corridor, it has commercial, but it also has residential and
 this is not a citywide corridor, this is not Mystic Avenue, this is a corridor that should serve the neighborhoods that are around it.
 So we do like the idea of the neighborhood coming in this corridor, so to have a mix of only residential, of mixed use, and a little bit of higher density mixed use.
 So mixed use one, it's whenever we have that mix of
 You have residential, but you also have commercial.
 So we kept it as a mixed use.
 Why the difference between- Paula, one quick note.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1495.701s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Your audio is going in and out a little bit.
 I'm wondering if it's a bandwidth issue, which can sometimes be solved by turning off your own video.
 Maybe just double check that any programs that are competing for bandwidth have been closed out as appropriate.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1520.312s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Okay, I closed the video, so I hope that it's going better.
 Yes, I think it's a little bit better.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1526.594s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I would encourage members of the community to message Alicia or Danielle if you... Sorry.
 No, no apology needed.
 You know, we're all doing our best in this virtual world.
 So we'll try this.
 If we need to revisit, we'll go from there.
 Okay, perfect.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1543.939s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So what is the difference between MixUse 1 and MixUse 2?
 So MixUse 2 was...
 It's those areas that are connecting to a major service or to, like, for example, we have parks, we have other main streets like Washington streets.
 Streets that are connecting with these bigger activators, as for example, Park Street, where we have a school and we have the Hickey Park, or for example, on the really east that we have the Morrison Park, we have Spring Street that is also has some commercial areas and commercial nodes in there that has a higher, let's say, pedestrian, fluent pedestrian movement.
 We wanted to give it a different, let's say, a different density towards these areas so that we could have more commercial ground floor and make it more pedestrian and that, let's say, that these are like activity stepping stones along these streets.
 So, if I go...
 continue.
 Yes, so what are these districts and what are the dimensions standards that we are applying?
 So, for example, the multi-unit residential, the minimum lot area is 3000.
 We took this number because of what is existing there.
 We have a lot of non-conforming because the minimum lot area is from 5000 and 6000.
 So there are a lot of non-conforming lots and we wanted to reduce those non-conforming lots.
 And so the minimum lot area gets to be reduced to 3,000 square feet.
 The maximum height is three stories.
 mix use one, minimum lot area is also 3000.
 And I'm going to explain what is this difference between base height and maximum height.
 So the base height, it's the height that you have by right.
 And in this case, for the mix use one is three stories.
 So by right three stories.
 Now, if
 And here comes the incentive zoning that we will explain, and Emily will go through more in detail.
 Incentive zoning is when we let a developer increase their density if the developer gives something back to the community.
 And this giving something back to the community is something that is established.
 So it has to go through a menu of options and
 with standards and so if they think that is reasonable like for example increasing affordability or creating a pocket park for the neighborhood then we let them increase in mixed-use one a maximum of plus one story.
 So with incentive zoning mixed-use one could go to four stories high.
 Now in mixed-use two
 The minimum lot area is 3,000.
 Maximum height, and this is by right, is four stories.
 Four.
 Now, with incentive zoning, so if the developer gives something back to the community, they can increase by two stories.
 So maximum height with incentive zoning is six.
 And then the commercial, which in this case we have a very small
 a very small lot there, is minimum lot area 10,000 square feet, maximum height three stories, plus three of incentive zoning.
 So it will be the same as Mixis 2 at the end, but it has three of incentive zoning.
 So by right is three.
 We will talk more and Emily will go more through these dimensionless standards.
 We are going to go through the map and in this map, we're going to see what is there right now and what is not permitted by your current zoning.
 So, any kind of commercial area that we have from the 93 towards Fellsway, in this area, for example, this is not permitted.
 As well, the one that we see on the lower part, it's not permitted at the moment.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1832.026s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  um and then the three stories high multi-family this would be this it is permitted so when you say not permitted it doesn't mean that if this if these amendments were to pass like we would we would evict these businesses it means they're they're welcome and encouraged to continue to operate um as they see fit just to know
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1860.903s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Sorry, because maybe it's a bit confusing.
 What we're doing is that they will be permitted with our zoning.
 So with our proposal, they are permitted.
 And this is that right now, they are non-conforming by use.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1880.539s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  But they can still continue to operate regardless.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1883.321s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Yes, yes.
 It's just that if they want to increase their height by the current zoning,
 They have to go through a lot of bureaucracy by to they're not required.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.236s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.536s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So, because the commercial use is not permitted in apartment.
 These are not these are non conforming that will change with our new proposal because they would be in the mixed district and commercial.
 It is permitted.
 Thank you.
 Sure.
 So the same would happen here.
 Every time that we see a commercial in your current zoning is not permitted, that would change in the new zoning.
 Gas station, for example, you do have some along Salem Street.
 These won't be permitted in the new zoning as well.
 So they continue to be non-conforming.
 As well, when we go, we continue another gas station and another gas station.
 They are very close, three of them.
 So these are non-permitted, non-conforming, and they will continue to be non-conforming.
 Then this commercial is non-conforming now, but it will be conforming with the new proposal.
 These are the residential lots.
 They are permitted now, and they continue to be conforming in the new proposal.
 We continue here, more residential, these are permitted now and they will continue to be permitted in the new proposal.
 And these are commercial that right now in your current zoning is not permitted, it will be permitted and conforming in the new proposal.
 This is the commercial one area.
 So all of them are permitted now and they continue to be permitted in the new zoning and this as well.
 So now I will explain this really red area that we have a lot that we have as commercial is mainly so that we think this gas station makes sense to be here.
 It's near Fellsway.
 It's out of traffic from Salem Street.
 So we prefer that
 that we can keep and that we would like to continue, so this is conforming in the new proposal.
 So we also wanted to add this definition.
 This is a business incubator because we think that this is a new definition that would attract certain types of business into this area.
 They can be very small, so not big scale.
 So I'm just going to read the definition.
 Business incubator is an organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service
 and create an achievable plan to make that product or service to market.
 In addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as the shared office space.
 An incubator program can last for several months to a few years.
 We think also that this can create a lot of activation and a lot of community in this area.
 And because we understand that people might be worried about having these mixed-use 1 and 2 next to their residential or single-family house, what we have come with is
 a neighborhood compatibility, and this is that when MX1 or 2 on commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subjected to this context standards.
 And that means that their side and rear setbacks are going to be from zero
 to 10 so they have to allow that setback so we have a little bit more of a space between the two buildings and then the height it's going to be increasing and following a 45 degree angle from the three
 stories minimum up to the six in case they go for the incentive zoning.
 So we want to really have this transition between mixed use one, two and commercial towards the residential.
 So that's why we implement this as a development standard.
 What we also want to let very clear is that as we see this area is a pedestrian oriented area.
 We want this to be as active and for people in the center of this plan.
 So, we also have in these standards, like, for example, that the parking has to be on the rear side of the lot.
 So, what we have facing the street is the building.
 We have an active ground floor so that a lot of eyes are on the street.
 It feels safe.
 It feels active.
 We also, any new development has to provide 12 feet
 fit for the sidewalk.
 So the sidewalks right now are very small.
 We had this analysis in the very beginning.
 We don't think that is enough for new buildings to come here and to have this active and pedestrian activity.
 So to make it more safe we ask that any new building has to give that minimum
 space for the sidewalk of at least 12 feet, and then it has to have a minimum setback of three, if I'm not mistaken, so that we wanted really to make it as pedestrian as possible.
 So I'm going to give now the... I'm going to stop now the presentation.
 I'm going to pass it to Emily, and she will guide us through the ordinance.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2261.54s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  Thank you, Paola.
 I will just share my screen.
 Just one moment.
 Now, Paola has shown you the colorful images designed to explain the more technical aspects of what you're unfortunately about to see.
 Zoning can be kind of dry when you're not familiar with it.
 But I do want to show you where in the zoning ordinance to look for the things that Paola just mentioned.
 Also, I believe the city board members received a staff memo on proposed changes that came out of the city council meeting and a couple of other implications from those conversations.
 I've already put them in here, I've highlighted them, so I'm going to show them to you as we go along and then Paola will show them to you again later when we go back to the presentation.
 So, the first thing is the division into districts, which we talked about already.
 When you establish a new zoning district, you have to put that into a certain part of the zoning ordinance.
 I should say, I think most of the people on the call are probably familiar with this, but just for those who have not looked at zoning changes before.
 Zoning changes are not development projects, they set the stage, they give permission for things to happen, they give options for things to happen, but they don't require that things happen.
 And I think that goes to what we were talking about earlier with the uses that are
 non-conforming under the current zoning.
 We had a couple of different goals as we approached this process.
 One, obviously, was, as Paola said, to make sure that we were following the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, implementing that after that long public process.
 But the other thing was, as we were looking at what was on the ground now,
 hearing maybe what people valued about their neighborhoods and understanding that many things, and this is true of almost every community in Massachusetts, many things that are physically present now are actually not allowed in the current zoning.
 And that's because many of our communities developed before zoning came into play.
 Some communities
 didn't start putting zoning in place until the 60s, some were a little bit earlier, but most of our New England cities and towns are actually older than zoning.
 So, as we looked at this, just to clarify that we're also looking at giving permissions for things that were already there, making it easier for people to invest in their properties.
 because we were reducing the requirement for them to go and get a variance because their properties were non-conforming.
 So part of this is what we call right-sizing the zoning to what's already there, and I'll call out some of that.
 So unfortunately I'm going to scroll through and make you a little bit dizzy as we look at this, but the next key thing to note is the table of uses.
 Now for those of you who may have been
 Watching the changes when we did the Mystic Avenue corridor, you're going to recognize some of the terminology, the MX1, the MX2, and the commercial districts.
 Those district types are also present in Mystic Avenue, but we are tailoring them to be appropriate for Salem Street, right?
 Because Mystic Avenue is a very different entity, a very different feel.
 a very different purpose than Salem Street.
 So the first thing we did was to add this MR, this multi-family residential district, which Paola explained.
 So that's new, that is not found in Salem Street.
 And that was to allow for housing that was variations or varieties of housing types that was more suited to a neighborhood corridor, a neighborhood area.
 And then the second thing, so you'll see that, you'll see the yellows, that's the MR coming in.
 It allows and disallows or allows by special permit, depending on the use.
 The other thing you'll see is from time to time, you'll see a blue coming in under MX1, MX2, or commercial.
 You can see it here, for example, for co-living.
 That's when we're making a change from what's in Mystic Avenue, where we're specifically tailoring those district types to be appropriate for the Salem Street corridor, and I'm going to call out a couple of them as we scroll through.
 So, if you are interested, Paula gave an overview of what is and is not allowed in the different districts, but if you're interested in the specifics
 of what is and is not allowed, then you should go to this proposed table of uses.
 And I believe that all of these are online now.
 We will update it again, as we do after every meeting with the city board, we'll provide the new version.
 So you can see here, for example, adult use, there's a no in the commercial, you see that blue, that's because adult use is allowed in Mystic Avenue in the commercial sub-district, it's the only place in the city that it's allowed, so it is not allowed here.
 You will see also that we are proposing changes and Paula will go over this.
 We're proposing changes to some of the medical office definitions we introduced this past spring.
 Earlier in the process, we are refining them to be more specific with both and consistent with both state and federal law and also with the needs of the overall city.
 And then the permissions, and I'll show you the definitions in a minute,
 are very much tailored to Salem Street and neighborhood needs here.
 So I'll show you the definitions that go along with these, but just note that that's also a difference with the corridor.
 The other big one is that and where there's a major change is that in the Mystic Avenue District, the adult use marijuana uses are allowed, the various options that are not allowed in Salem Street.
 So you can see those called out here.
 And then motor vehicle related uses, as Paola mentioned, were not there.
 They're allowed in the commercial.
 The light service station is allowed by special permit by the CD board.
 The other ones are not allowed.
 And then certain industrial uses, manufacturing, research and testing, things that are appropriate for Mystic Avenue are not appropriate for Salem Street.
 So we have removed those.
 And there's a couple of tweaks in the parking that you see that are not major.
 Here's some other of those light industrial uses that are not allowed in Salem Street.
 And that is a change.
 And then we are done with the table of uses.
 So our next step is the table of dimensional requirements.
 And so these are the changes that we've made to these.
 So again, multifamily MR district is new.
 You see the yellow coming in indicating that's a new
 district in this area, so all of these are very different from Mystic Avenue.
 And then the blue, again, tailoring these district types, the mixed-use 1, the mixed-use 2, and the commercial for Salem Street.
 So, Paola went over the lot area.
 This was based on our evaluation, our analysis of the lot area in this
 neighborhood, the heights have been reduced.
 Anybody who saw the Mix 1, Mix 2 on Mystic Avenue, that's not applying here.
 We have reduced the heights as Paola suggested or described.
 We have a base height that's allowed as a right.
 that may have a maximum height, and these are for buildings up front on Salem Street, and they require that incentive zoning, which I'm going to show you.
 We have the step back in here that protects Salem Street from having the buildings sort of go straight up.
 There's a little bit of a setback there to make them more human scaled.
 Here's the business incubator coming in.
 Here are the new definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood medical office, and medical office.
 You'll note the difference between neighborhood medical office and medical office is that a neighborhood medical office is limited by size.
 So it shall not exceed 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and is limited by the number of employees.
 It cannot have more than five employees.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2776.204s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  It's also where the adjacency, the commercial next to residential uses is, this table up here.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2786.967s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  Oh, it's further down, the adjacencies in the standards actually.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 Thank you for calling that out.
 I'm going to actually swing down that.
 It's coming up in about three sections, but thank you for asking that question.
 So we have, this is the Salem Street now.
 So all of those sections that I just mentioned actually modified other parts of the zoning ordinance.
 Now we're getting into part of the zoning ordinance that establishes the Salem Street Corridor District.
 It has a purpose to it, which is the wider variety of uses and building types to support jobs, economic development near established residential neighborhoods.
 Paola mentioned that we were looking for neighborhood goods and services, neighborhood economic activity.
 So the idea is this provides options for living within walking distance of jobs, goods and services.
 We want mixed use, multifamily and commercial uses as a density appropriate to the walkable urban corridor, that's Salem Street itself, understanding that that's serving that wider neighborhood.
 And that we're establishing design standards to buffer the neighborhoods from a higher intensity of uses and we want this nice identity that's appropriate for Salem Street that reinforces what's there now.
 The applicability creates the sub-districts that we just described.
 And then this is that question that you asked Madam Chair, dimensional requirements and waivers.
 That's where we start to refine the dimensional requirements to allow for the setbacks.
 the step-downs, so we have to, this is this first one, the front setback is the one that Pella mentioned where the facade has to be set back to create those wider sidewalks to make it more walkable.
 The side and rear setbacks are required next to an existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units.
 We have to have a landscape buffer or a fence with a landscape buffer on the other side.
 Here are the height step back requirements, which is that neighborhood context and requires the massing of the building to be reduced closer to a building in any of the residential only districts and that's to allow for light, air, it keeps the existing residential buildings from being dwarfed by new buildings because they have to reduce that massing, reduce that height.
 We require the ground floor active frontage.
 We require some additional transitions to residential districts.
 We have setbacks for infill lots.
 So again, these are allows the infill building.
 An infill building is a new building on a vacant lot, for example.
 And it allows the infill building to match what's on the other side of it.
 So we keep the consistency with the neighborhood.
 We have height waivers.
 These are consistent.
 This is the step back waiver.
 So given that diagram, you can see that if you have a step back from Salem Street, and you have a step back from the residential neighborhood, and you might have a step back from another residential, at some point, you can't build a building.
 And so the waiver allows the Community Development Board to reduce the dimensional requirements of any of the step backs
 but it requires that priority is given to keeping the step backs that reduce the massing next to residential buildings.
 So in other words, you could reduce maybe the step back on Salem Street, but not the step back next to one of those three-story existing residential.
 We want to put criteria around that.
 Interested in hearing people's opinions.
 The next piece is the development incentives.
 Paola mentioned this, and I want to stress that this is a menu.
 I think we heard some questions that people thought that maybe they were all stacked on top of each other, so somebody could do them all and get additional height.
 We added language that's in the pink here that says it only goes up to the maximum height that's in that table of dimensional requirements.
 There are a lot of options for achieving that community benefit, but if you're only allowed to have one extra story, you only get to choose one of those options.
 You can't say, I'm giving you two options, I should get two stories.
 You are limited to that one extra story.
 Obviously, the maximum that we have is
 three incentive floors on top of a three-story building to get to six stories.
 So that is your limitation in this area.
 It's a six-story building, so it's either four and two or three and two.
 But none of these have changed except for the public parking.
 We had heard comments
 throughout the process that Salem Street, that area could use some additional parking.
 And so we've added public parking as a benefit.
 However, you'll see for the shared community, solar and public parking, these are topics we're still working on.
 So we have not set the requirement for the benefit yet.
 We're putting these in here to let people know that these are potential options.
 And we're going to confirm what the requirement would be for the benefit at a later date in the process.
 And then the design guidelines and applicability of the development standards.
 I do not, the sidewalk width is the only thing that changed from the other ones that we had developed.
 I'm just skimming down to see.
 Yes, that was the only change.
 Development standards and design guidelines are used in the site plan approval and the special permit process.
 They are criteria to measure the developer's proposal and require that they meet certain standards or address certain guidelines.
 For anybody who had seen the earlier process, except for that sidewalk width, they should be familiar.
 And with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen and turn it back to Paola just so she can give us a summary of the changes from the original document that we sent you.
 And then we're happy to answer any questions from the board and from the public as appropriate.
 Paola?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3166.046s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Madam Chair, if I may, I'm going to share again the presentation.
 You see my screen now?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3187.979s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yep, we're viewing the slide with city recommendations.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3193.108s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So we have five recommendations from the draft, the latest version.
 And so the first one is, as Emily explained, is to clarify that intent in the introduction of the development incentive bonus.
 So in the section of the development incentives, we want to add so that it's clear that it's up to the maximum height under the section.
 of the table of the mentioned requirements.
 So the total paragraph will read in as follow.
 In exchange for incorporating certain provisions that further the city's goal for affordability, economic development, environmental sustainability, climate and climate resiliency, applicants may receive development incentive bonuses that allow for certain development permissions beyond what is allowed as of right.
 up to the maximum height under section 94-4.1 table of dimension requirements.
 These permissions include one or more additional stories up to the maximum numbers of stories allowed in each sub-district.
 Additional stories must comply with any setback, stepback,
 sorry, there is a repetition, or other dimensional requirements and the development and design standards in 94-9.x.6 development standards.
 So, this is the first one, just to clarify, that is up to the maximum height under the section 94-4.1 that is in the table of dimensional requirements.
 The second is about some definitions that we wanted to modify.
 So we want to delete the definitions for clinic, hospital, and medical office that we had in the previous with Mystic Avenue district and replacing them with the following definitions.
 So clinic is a clinic as defined in general law point C.111.
 section 52 hospital a hospital as defined in general law c.111 section 52 neighborhood medical office office of a physician dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital as defined in section 94.12.0 definitions the office area shall not exceed 1500 square feet of gross floor area and shall have no more than five employees
 Medical office, office of a physician, dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital is defined in section 94.12.0 definitions.
 The office area is greater than 1500 square feet and has more than 5 employees.
 So with that, the third is update the section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, to reflect the proposed definitions.
 So we have text to be removed, is crossed out, and the text to be added is in bold.
 So we have them at the end of the table, we include that neighborhood medical office, which is not allowed in multifamily district, but it is allowed in mixed use 1, 2, and commercial.
 And then the medical office is not allowed in multifamily.
 And then we have mixed use 1, 2, and commercial as a special permit.
 And then the clinic is not allowed in any of the districts.
 The fourth is to add to the section 94-9.x.3 dimensional requirements and waivers the following.
 So, we add two of those requirements, one requirement, one waiver, which is the height step back requirement.
 And this is the text for the diagram that you saw.
 of the context.
 So for any lot within the MX1, MX2 or commercial district that abuts MRGR or apartment 1 district, a height setback is required along the lot line abutting the residential district.
 The height setback is calculated by a 45 degree angle beginning at the third floor and extending to the highest floor of the building in the MX1, MX2 or commercial district.
 The fourth, fifth and sixth floor shall not break the plane of that 45 degree angle.
 And then we have that a step waiver.
 If a building is subject to a front step back and rear or side step back, the community development board may waive the strict dimensional requirement of any of the step backs provided that priority is given to retaining the step back, step backs that reduce the massing next to the residential buildings of five or fewer units.
 And last is the update to section 94-3.2, table of use regulations, table A, to remove marijuana as an allowed use.
 Text to be removed is crossed out, text to be added is in bold.
 So what we do is just changing for the MX1 and MX2, the adult marijuana establishment, the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, retail, and independent laboratory, instead of CDB, so a special permit, we change them to no.
 not permitted.
 And those are the changes that we propose and the city recommends.
 So now we will give the Q&A.
 We finished our presentation and we hope for any comments we will be answering them Emily, myself or city staff.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3554.395s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
 Thank you, Paula.
 Thank you, Emily.
 I really appreciate the thorough presentation.
 I'm going to open it up to the Community Development Board for comments or questions from our group.
 Following that, we will open the public comment period, just to give a preview of what's next.
 We have Annie, Peter, Sabrina, Ari, Adam, Ben, myself online from the board.
 I'll just start with my first takeaway, which is really the alignment with the existing setup of Salem Street.
 I think that that presents a lot of opportunity.
 As I asked Paola, these non-conforming uses, do they, does that mean that they get kicked out or something bad happens to them?
 It almost means that they have more opportunity.
 So if they wanted to do something with their site or do something different commercially, they are now allowed by right.
 So I really like that.
 I think it's very considerate of the connections between commercial and residential.
 I'd like your thoughts around step back, especially the connection between higher density
 the housing, and it has some strangely specific questions about this neighborhood medical use.
 But I can save that.
 It was really just why five employees?
 I mean, that feels almost like an arbitrary number, and it feels weird to be regulating the count of employees, as well as questions around
 I think there was a comment that we don't allow neighborhood medical office and multifamily.
 And my first thought was there's people that operate their medical practice out of the first floor of their home.
 I don't think that that's common enough to make a big issue of it, but I did just want to recognize that just in case that's a scenario that you all evaluated.
 So yeah, those are some of my initial thoughts.
 But maybe we can do like a round with the board, and then Paula and Emily, if you want to respond, because we might have some of the same concerns.
 I see Ari, they have their hand up.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3723.992s">[Ari Fishman]</a>:  Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Innes Associates for the very detailed presentation and proposal.
 Um, I live just on the other side of the rotary towards Medford square, so I'm very familiar with this corridor.
 And 1 of the things that I appreciate about it as a resident is that mixture of residential commercial businesses.
 I can walk down the street and get a sandwich during my lunch break.
 And I think that one of the great ironies of the greater Boston area is that many of the structures that we most value and people most like, the townhouses, the triple deckers, are disallowed by our zoning, and we can't build more of them.
 So I think it's very smart that we're aligning it to accurately describe what we have and allow for more development like what we already have.
 evidence through living that this is what is working for our community.
 I don't have any particularly detailed questions.
 I'm looking forward to hearing community feedback, but I think in general the approach here of allowing commercial and mixed zoning makes a lot of sense for this area.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3799.392s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Adam, I see a hand.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3801.249s">[Adam Behrens]</a>:  Yeah, I just wanted to chime in as well.
 It was super helpful, especially in context with the Mystic Avenue zoning.
 I think when I first saw the proposals, my immediate reaction was like, oh Jesus, are we creating Mystic Avenue here?
 It was really helpful to see the consideration specific for this corridor that even though it might be called the same abbreviation, it's actually not permitting the exact same thing for Mystic Avenue.
 I just wanted to voice that where coming in, I was like,
 We're really trying to up zone this and so it was helpful to get the context of kind of a primary consideration of like, okay, let's, let's match to as much as we can to what's there.
 And then, um, um, you know, try to like ease ease into a little bit more density, but not do it in such a jarring way.
 So.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3875.364s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Then Sabrina, Peter, any thoughts?
 Or Ari, any response to Adam's comment?
 I think you hit the nail on the head.
 We can use the same letters in the table, but we're clarifying that this is specifically for Salem Street.
 And I think that's some nuance that DePaula and Emily, your slides did a good job at differentiating.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3907.463s">[Peter Calves]</a>:  I'm just going to say that I do appreciate the clarification on the height, because I know that's something that was confusing to people.
 And to understand that it is a hard maximum of six stories anywhere on the corridor, because I think that is something that I had heard concerns about.
 And I'm glad to see that that is the case.
 Agreed.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3932.73s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So I'm going to do a quick break because we're humans.
 Give Emily and Paula a little bit of time just to pull together some thoughts and responses.
 But let's all meet back here in, let's say, five minutes.
 grab a water, bio break.
 And I do see a hand.
 We will be moving into the public comment period after we hear back from Emily and Paola.
 Feel free to raise your hand and we will get to you once we enter that portion of the meeting.
 Really excited to hear from the public.
 We've got a great crowd, so should be good.
 But yep, we will be back in about five minutes.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3974.471s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Normally, I actually had a comment before, like from the staff before you go to public.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3980.233s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, so I gave Emily a heads up.
 She's going to defer to you and then we're going to hand it back to Emily and Paola for any responses to the board comments and then go into public comment.
 So, Alicia, if you would like to provide some of that insight.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3996.942s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Great, thank you.
 So I did just want to reiterate that we had reviewed and met with the consultants since what originally was went to the CD board in your packet is exactly what went to the city council.
 And so that is what the city council has to vote on, but they can be voting with amendments and they would vote on amendments that you recommend.
 And so what is this recommendations from the staff are amendments that have come up since it went to city council.
 But there was one that we had discussed and I think maybe there was a little miscommunication.
 And so I just wanted to mention it, not in that.
 So with the small medical office, the neighborhood medical, one of our thoughts was that
 we should be looking at limiting the hours from 8 a.m to 7 p.m because we don't want off medical offices and stuff we don't want people in people's neighborhoods next to people's homes coming and going at very early hours or very late hours so like you wouldn't want an urgent care open till midnight next to somebody's house or you wouldn't want them that kind of stuff going on and so that was one of the recommendations was to have
 and hours of operations.
 And that's also something in a big picture way that we want to be looking at in our zoning across the board is what are the hours of operations and how are they allowed in zoning?
 There is a paragraph in zoning that currently limits hours of operations, but it doesn't apply to medical offices.
 And it might be different if it was in a strip mall than it is if it was next to someone's home.
 Sure.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4109.766s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, thinking about the implementation, the actual use, and the day-to-day clientele.
 That's a good lens to apply to this.
 Thank you, Alicia.
 Emily and Paula?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4122.928s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  I'm happy to respond 1st to that and then to the comments from the board.
 We agree on hours of operation.
 It was, as I said, as Alicia said, it was a miscommunication that was left off our text.
 So we're just pulling the correct sentence and we'll have it for you by the end of the meeting.
 or at the appropriate point to discuss it, but we agree that that's an important piece.
 I think you had asked why the difference and again, it goes back to tailoring uses for the neighborhood.
 It is quite common to think about the impact of different uses on a neighborhood in terms of
 the scale of a business or use.
 And one of the issues we had heard coming from the community was something like this, like a business that had clients coming to it, the impact of traffic on it, given that Salem Street is not only a corridor in the sense that it leads from one place to another, right?
 That's how the comprehensive plan was defining corridors, is that they were important streets.
 that took people from one part of Medford to another part of Medford, but it's also a neighborhood.
 And so we wanted to think about the scale of certain businesses.
 This is one that came up.
 The size, the number of employees, the hours of operations are all methods of limiting that scale.
 So we've got a smaller scale, which could be as a right with special site plan review rather, we have a larger scale that could be a special permit and let's just have a higher
 higher level of review before it comes into an area.
 And I do want to stress, I was delighted to hear the city board members picking up on this idea of tailoring Salem Street to match what's there now.
 I do want to reinforce that zoning presents options.
 It doesn't require somebody to change their property.
 So, a business that's non-conforming now that would have to go through a variance process to invest in it.
 A homeowner maybe whose current house is on a lot that doesn't meet the minimum lot requirements would also be non-conforming for certain things, might have to go for a variance.
 Part of our goal was to reduce that.
 It doesn't mean the business has to change.
 doesn't mean the homeowner has to do anything, but if they choose to, the pathway is a little bit more clear for them now if the zoning is passed than it would have been otherwise.
 Zoning changes are about creating those opportunities, and in this case, with the addition of development standards,
 the ability to do design guidelines, it is also about putting appropriate community controls on some of those uses, some of those potential buildings that could come in if people make certain decisions with their property.
 But I just wanted to reinforce that we were trying very hard to respect what Salem Street was while giving the people who live, work, own businesses there now opportunities for the future.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4322.169s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Also, one thing as well, we do allow home occupation in multi-residential.
 So if they have a small business and they want one doctor or something practicing from their home, that is possible in the residential because home occupation in the table of uses,
 is permitted.
 I just wanted to flag that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4359.706s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  And with that, we're happy to listen to comments from the public as well.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4365.808s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
 OK, so I see some hands raised.
 Let me pull my notes back.
 So I will now open, or just real quick, do any other board members have any follow-up questions to what Emily or Paolo said?
 No, okay, and feel free to just throw your hands up or unmute yourself.
 Strong no from Annie, thank you.
 So I will now open the public comment period.
 Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.
 You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.
 Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.
 Reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members outside of technical difficulties to city staff, as it's not part of public record.
 However, if a participant is having audio or other technical issues, message Danielle, message Alicia, and they'll make sure
 You enter the queue.
 We are limiting speaking to two minutes per person.
 Part of the reason we do this is, you know, especially for topics like this, we have a lot of people that we want to hear from.
 We want to make sure everybody is heard in an equitable manner.
 The two-minute limit has worked previously for meetings, so we're going to be using that for this meeting.
 If you have more to add, or you want to respond to others' comments, I encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov.
 All of those comments get shared with the board.
 We review them before every meeting.
 So, you know, those, they don't just go into a black hole.
 So I want to encourage people to also use that email address as well as, you know, speaking up this evening.
 And this is such a great opportunity to hear directly from the public, because what we at the community development board are tasked with is making recommendations to the city council.
 So, you know, we can.
 you know, be a little creative and, you know, pass this back to the city council based on the amendments that we propose.
 So excited to hear what everybody has to say.
 Alicia is going to help me manage the public comment queue.
 I think I can manage it okay.
 But Alicia, do you have any overview for the written comments that have been received?
 Or Danielle?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4538.688s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  I didn't prepare a summary today to share that out.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4543.792s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That's OK.
 We've been reading them as they've been coming in.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4547.494s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Actually, I might share that there are ones that were sent directly to me.
 I found that there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was in the zoning.
 So I have been trying on a case-by-case basis to reply to residents with sort of more information about what was in them.
 partially because a lot of the concerns were around things that were either not correct or were being changed.
 I don't want to reiterate a lot of that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4576.412s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Sure, sure.
 But yeah, the public comment period is a time to provide your feedback, but also ask clarifying questions if there's something that doesn't really click or doesn't make sense.
 So encourage everybody to ask questions as well.
 And thank you, Alisa, for providing
 more updated feedback to the public that sent in questions.
 So I just want to make sure I'm keeping track of everyone.
 So the first public commenter that I see is Carlos Cabreras.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address.
 Alicia will start a timer.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4623.846s">[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  Hi, how are you?
 Yeah, my name is Carlos Cabrejas.
 I live at 224 Salem Street.
 So thank you for taking the time for this presentation, especially Paul, that was very thorough.
 So my question is, what is the plan to alleviate the already busy corridor that Salem Street is, you know, bringing all of these
 you know, development, houses, businesses, traffic is only going to get worse.
 What is the plan to make these, to mitigate the, yeah, what I said already, bad traffic that we have?
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4663.244s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Carlos.
 Appreciate the question.
 And for anybody that hasn't done these before, we typically hear all of the public comment, and then we'll pass it back to Emily and Paola to provide a little bit more insight.
 And then we as a board will deliberate and go from there.
 The next public commenter that I see is Dave McKenna.
 Dave, you're going to get a request to unmute.
 Sorry, Marielena, I might've accidentally clicked your name, but we're gonna start with Dave.
 Where did Dave go?
 We might've lost Dave.
 Let me look at the attendee list.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4722.02s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  I just sent him an unmute.
 Um, there we go.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4726.562s">[David McKenna]</a>:  Okay.
 Thank you for the presentation.
 I am generally supportive.
 Oh, David McKenna to vine street, just a half a block from Salem.
 Generally supportive of the new development because it will increase our tax base, which I think is really important.
 So we can improve city services for all residents.
 Um, and also, uh, really supportive because this will provide just more housing and we are in a housing crisis.
 Um, multifamily housing, condos and apartments are more affordable than single family.
 So, um, for people looking to downsize or for, um, we'll just have more housing options and I'm excited about that.
 Um, on the incentives, uh, I think it's great that by right, it's just three to four stories, which is what's currently existing.
 And then if there's an extra community benefit, then the developer could go beyond the three to four stories.
 The affordable housing community benefit seems really important.
 But my favorite one is the pocket parks.
 And I had a question about this because we could really use more green space along Salem, and developers are incentivized to provide a public pocket park.
 If they were to provide maybe the equivalent of two pocket parks or just more larger green space, would they get an additional incentive for that?
 Can they use that incentive maybe twice?
 And the seating, the extra bonus for seating in the park or the fountain, to me, does not really, it's not that valuable.
 It's the green space.
 A park should have seating in it.
 So I think that should just be a requirement of the incentive for the pocket park.
 I don't really care about the fountain.
 So any way to increase the amount of green space would be really beneficial.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4846.255s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Dave.
 And as we hear questions, we got a really solid recommendation from city staff.
 As we hear questions that come up again and again, we may pause to address those throughout this public comment period just to make sure that, you know, we're all kind of working on this together.
 or to offer clarifications.
 Marie-Elena, you're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4880.373s">[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  Hi, Marie-Elena Tetchi Bariola, 62 Sheridan Ave.
 I will try to keep it brief because I feel like I have a lot of questions, but I'll keep it to two.
 One, thank you for the presentation.
 It's very detailed, but my brain also doesn't work this way.
 So like, it's a lot to process.
 And I think that's probably true for a lot of people, you know, mix one, mix two, I get really kind of becoming that zoning stuff kind of just like jumbles in my mind.
 So some additional visuals might be helpful.
 Some of the slides were helpful, but it would have been really helpful to say, this is what's here now, and this is what we're proposing.
 Because I think she mentioned it, but I was having a hard time keeping track of it.
 So that would be helpful.
 But question wise, I think maybe what a lot of people, or at least myself anyway, is concerned about is,
 Is the definition of the differentiation between medical offices, clinic, medical facility, like on the heels of a methadone clinic being proposed in the area, it seems like, OK, so now they're changing the definitions.
 So I've been trying to figure out where are the original definitions to compare it to what the new amended ones are.
 So that would be helpful.
 But also, I think it might have been you, actually, that said,
 You you're not you don't think that like like why should we limit the number of employees in a medical office?
 I actually totally disagree with that I think that we should like I think because then what we're coming up against is Maybe an urgent care or something and you know We just came out of we're in a post-covid world where there were lines in urgent cares like outside And I don't want that in my neighborhood.
 I don't want you know, whether this happens again or not like that's
 you know, you have people like lining the street to get a COVID test, right?
 Or, you know, anything like that.
 And even if they open at eight o'clock, people line up at seven, 730.
 So I think that that is a concern, because when you don't limit the number of medical employees, you end up with offices like that.
 And, you know, where it says just a physician, well, what does that mean?
 Could they actually put them at the clinic if they
 filed it under something different.
 I think that's a major concern and there's my two seconds left.
 The other concern is like for all these increased housing, what do we do with these students?
 These schools are so overcrowded right now.
 Like if there are all these kids, what do we do with that?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5014.554s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Those are all really great questions and really great points.
 I appreciate your insight around the neighborhood medical office.
 The next public commenter that I see is Zachary Chertok.
 You should be getting a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5039.861s">[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  Zachary Chertok at 5 Allmont, right at the corner of Allmont and Salem.
 I have a list of questions, but the technical ones I'll email.
 I'm not going to worry about that now.
 I also apologize that my lighting makes me look like I'm going to say a soliloquy here.
 And Danielle, I also apologize for speaking through the chat.
 I forgot about the discernment in public records.
 So thank you for pointing that out.
 The two questions that I think could be generally answered here, one is, and this might have been stated, so it's more a point of clarification, is
 When buildings that are nonconforming seek to change the exterior of their building, when I've consulted and are advised on projects in other cities around this, including Boston and Providence around economic development, those buildings would require to go through a variance for continued approval and expansion of the building and its current use.
 Will that be part of the variance process, or in terms of your efforts to streamline the language and verbiage around your variance requirements, is that expected to be relaxed?
 The second one is for the IZ extensions to scale.
 Can the menu of options that are going to be provided for those IZs be published a little bit more clear and front and center?
 And can we be given notification around when it's solidified and what those are, as well as what the proximity to any proposed construction would be, what the requirements in terms of distance from them are?
 I've worked in places where you can offer a park to the city in exchange for an exemption versus it having to be feet from the building.
 So distance designations would be preferred.
 And then I'll echo the transportation concerns, especially since three boundary points around the zone are controlled by state agencies with land owned not by the city, including the I-93 Rotary, the Fellsway West, and the intersection at the Fellsway West and Salem Street, with a traffic signal that has been horribly unmistimed with the Fellsway East signal for some time, been trying to reach DCR for years.
 um and um and you know it just needs there needs to be a stronger partnership for that and it's sorry i know i'm over but that's not just a quarter it's a designated trucking route a state route overlay for route 60 as well okay this is all really helpful insight and it sounds like you have some really solid experience so thank you for sharing that with with us this evening

 53 Garfield Avenue.
 I just wanted to make sure that the Community Development Board got our legal letter from a group of neighbors this evening.
 We have 837 people that have voted no for this corridor expansion.
 No one has been included in any community involvement questions.
 All we hear is, we think you need, we've decided.
 What about the voters and the taxpayers?
 I feel confident in the next week, we will have over a thousand people in this neighborhood that do not want this corridor.
 This is a social justice neighborhood, as our legal letter imply, who have done nothing to offer any kind of, there's language barriers, nothing has been done in another language, nothing has been done regarding a reverse 911 call.
 And I think it's despicable the way this has been hidden from the neighbors and the constituents in this neighborhood.
 Salem Street, if you would even bother to come over here at six o'clock in the morning and six o'clock at night, you would see bumper to bumper traffic.
 And I think this is all of this rezoning.
 It is just too much, too fast, too big, too dense.
 It is not what this neighborhood needs and nothing that the voters, the homeowners and the taxpayers want.
 And we all know that, you know, you have to do something to expand some of the living.
 But this is ridiculous.
 It's not taking into concern the neighborhood at all.
 And we are prepared to take legal action.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5315.928s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I appreciate that.

 But thank you so much, Patricia.
 I really appreciate you commenting.
 Our next public commenter is Jane.
 You're going to get a request to unmute, Jane Marcus.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5342.849s">[Jane Marcus]</a>:  Hi, my name is Jane Marcus.
 I'm 65 Tainter Street.
 I live around the corner from the Roberts Elementary School.
 And from my perspective, this plan is about a corridor, but it really should be about the Roberts Elementary School neighborhood.
 We have the epicenter of the proposed density directly abutting the Roberts Elementary School.
 And there are so many of these businesses that I find inappropriate to put next to an elementary school with first graders and second graders walking to school.
 We don't want them walking by methadone clinics where there are addicts.
 We don't want them walking past a brewery.
 We don't want them walking past a winery.
 I'm super glad to see all the marijuana businesses have been removed from the plan.
 Thank you very much for that.
 I was worried about that as well.
 I also feel that there's an opportunity here with some of these zoning decisions to have mental health, rehab,
 halfway houses, homeless shelters and churches, other things that are wonderful for the community, but not next to a school.
 I don't want school children to be worried on their way to school about an addict or a drunk that they're going to encounter on the way to school.
 I want the kids to walk to school with joy and with the promise of learning something.
 And I feel if we have educational facilities that are likely to be halfway houses or something else, those are not appropriate.
 Private clubs that serve alcohol, not appropriate.
 Any kind of facility which is going to have temporary visitors, such as a hotel,
 may have sex offenders who are in the hotel for weeks or months under the radar.
 And we won't even know that there are sex offenders watching our children to see who the lonely and the vulnerable ones on the playground might be.
 So I ask the board, please consider this from the viewpoint that this is next to an elementary school.
 And I will really thank you for that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5482.671s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I hear your concerns about the uses that are proximate to the elementary school.
 So maybe that's something we can dig a little bit deeper and share more information.

 And please state your name and address for the record, please.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5510.572s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.
 I live at 281 Park Street, which is the epicenter of the neighborhood node.
 Park Street currently gets about 2,000 cars per day, and Salem Street, according to the 2022 study, was at 18,000 a day.
 It's important to note that this presentation doesn't match the zoning that is uploaded, so you are voting on whether or not you are recommending the pot.
 That's not gone.
 It's gone through three versions and was not removed.
 The zoning is not informed by any studies.
 How we came to the point that we're reducing lot size by 70% to 3,000 square feet for a six-story building is extreme.
 The incentives are so easy to max out height.
 A bench, a fountain will get you to six feet and a heartbeat.
 And why is the narrowest, busiest section, Park and Salem, a node for intense
 zoning, which is their words.
 How are the desirable uses chosen?
 Dorms, which Rocco DiRico at Tufts says he doesn't want, and informed the city that he didn't want them, and just wants to build on his own land, but they're still offering dorms, or offering shelters, or offering hotels.
 I don't think you're getting away from the methadone dispensary with the way that we're wording things.
 The research and testing labs, the dog daycare has no ordinance written yet.
 And we don't want a poorly staffed methadone clinic opening because they're trying to squeeze in to some niche employee count.
 Why are the special permits for pot growing, processing, retails, and labs, whoever thought that was appropriate?
 And why are we allowing a five-foot buffer with an eight-foot fence to shield a single-family home from a six-story building plus mechanicals, which according to state law can go up to 150% of the original height?
 The comprehensive plan called for studies.
 It called for strategies to avoid displacement of the environmental justice neighborhoods.
 And that's all we're seeing here.
 The zoning should be informed by facts.
 The community should have been involved.
 And Alicia said the zoning was based on developers wants to build.
 There's at least one demo permit already on the table in the red zone and the hole in the ground will be back for his six stories.
 And he told your board before that the city said he could build more.
 Profits should not be more important than the people that live here.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5659.703s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Cheryl.
 I really appreciate your comments.
 There's a lot there between the traffic, you have some feedback, like, you know, are the many options really commensurate with what's being delivered?
 Some questions about the uses, and then I'm curious about this mechanical percentage, so maybe we can address that at some point.
 But thank you so much, Cheryl.

 My name is Ralph Klein.
 I own and reside at 172 Park Street.
 My family also resides at 170, my sister Ruth.
 Now, we're on the fifth house down, fifth property down on Park Street, on the opposite side of the Roberts from Salem.
 Their proposal has three of the four properties barely conform.
 Let me look at this.
 184 has 2,065.
 182 has 2,265 feet.
 The next property has 3,000.
 And the next piece of property has 3,500.
 The combined frontage of this is 165 feet.
 And from Salem Street to my property line is approximately 130 to 140 feet.
 I could have a six-story building running the length of my property with these non-conforming properties that don't even make the limit, but they're in the red zone.
 Also, the parking.
 Since they put the condominiums on Salem Street, on Court Street, across from JRA Cycles, Park Street has become the dumping ground for all the vehicles that can't park there.
 for the part of building on the opposite side, JRA Cycles, there's five cars that come down here every day, park their vehicle, take their bicycle off, and ride it to JRA Cycles around the corner.
 If you think I'm kidding, come down Park Street and look at it.
 I cross Salem Street every day at least twice.
 My grandkids go to the Roberts Junior High School.
 Traffic is horrible.
 They do not listen to the crossing guards.
 I've almost gotten hit twice with a crossing guard there.
 I mean, to propose more buildings there?
 This is ridiculous.

 I want you to know I'm opposed to this.
 The traffic on Salem Street is insane right now.
 Just trying to get down that street will take you 25 minutes to a half an hour.
 Um, so it's already, I don't know what kind of study was done to see the traffic repercussions if this were to be implemented.
 Um, I'm also concerned about the first responders.
 If everyone decides to follow this new zoning and we have both sides of Salem Street with six stories or whatever is allowed, how is that going to impact not only our schools, but the first responders that have to get to those schools?
 That's all.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5979.75s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I'm hearing traffic first responders impact schools.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5986.859s">[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  I mean, it takes so long to get down that road.
 And honestly, if think about the DPW to if both sides of the street are six feet high, it's going to impact how the snow melts.
 you know, everything.
 So definitely it needs to be more thoughtful in the process.
 I think there's way too many factors.
 And you were talking about the hours of different, you know, in the mixed use zones, um, or commercial zones for that matter.
 You know, you talk about, you don't want a medical office to say past seven, but what if you have a regular commercial business open till nine, 10 o'clock at night, um, those people are parking somewhere.
 And we have, you know, residents that's trying to park their cars.

</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6090.559s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  Hi folks, just a quick question.
 We're at 174 Park Street, we're currently zoned apartment one, and it's changing to mixed two, commercial mixed two.
 We're a house behind a house, so we're kind of the second tier behind the frontage.
 And my question is, for the homeowners here, will they now become nonconforming?
 Right now it's a single family detached home.
 And so if it changes to mix two, commercial mix two, are they limited in their ability to sell to another residential use down the road?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6131.988s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  We can answer that question later, but you have about a minute left if you have any other comments, feedback.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6142.168s">[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  As far as, I feel like the other, you know, the other public members have pretty much addressed kind of like similar concerns like traffic, you know, what kind of businesses, you know, are being allowed if they're like appropriate, because we do live next to the school.
 And then yeah, as far as like, you know, what the building heights are, you know, considering
 you know, what we have around here with these homes, if we have like a, you know, a big eyesore.
 But I think everybody else has pretty much explained it a little bit better than, you know, than that.
 So it's pretty much in the same plane as everybody else.

 Just a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic.
 I don't think there was a traffic study done at all.
 Um, I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new.
 Properties apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them.
 Um, I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well.
 How does this impact our water our sewer?
 And our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts.
 I know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating.
 I'm very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school.
 I don't understand why that was even considered to have.
 commercial zoning at up to six stories next to a public school.
 If you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous.
 And if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school.
 I'm trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns.
 The only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business.
 But I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into
 reality, there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right?
 If they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of
 Availability to make more money.
 A lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced.
 So that's all I have.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6337.551s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That's a great point.
 Yeah, I mean, not not every business owns their space.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  I don't think a lot of them do.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6343.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I think how can we, you know, support those businesses.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6346.854s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  Matter of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6384.412s">[William Navarre]</a>:  Hello, William Navare, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.
 Uh, I basically support the zoning because Medford isn't full.
 We have room for more people.
 Um, I wanted to ask one specific question and basically that is have the, uh, consultants, you know, carefully, uh, studied and analyzed the, uh, cost in terms of construction of the set step backs.
 I know that they had that in Somerville step backs.
 I don't know if I misspoke and said setbacks, but step backs is what I'm referring to.
 And, um.
 And, and, you know, carefully considering the cost of those I know Somerville had those at one point they might have had to modify that I didn't get a chance to look into all the details, but you know just in terms of if somebody knows about the development cost of that.
 And if, if that's going to render a lot of development, unfeasible I would suggest that the board consider suggesting that the.
 you know, that it'd be made optional and that instead you could provide a bigger conventional setback, move the building further from the street and then it can just go straight up because it's already further from the street, maybe that's where the pocket park goes.
 Just an example based on
 what you folks find when you look at whether or not this is gonna be financially feasible to build the set, sorry, step backs.
 You can do the step back, that's expensive, is my understanding.
 But I'm interested to know what everybody's figured out when they've looked into that.
 Thanks.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6496.2s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Good evening, Claudia Fennelly, 36 Farrigan Ave.
 I've listened tonight to the proposal and there's no way in my mind that you can possibly do any of this without widening Salem Street or taking away all street parking.
 You have a, now you're going to expand the sidewalks to 12 feet wide on both sides.
 You're going to have a talk of a possible designated single bus lane.
 Then you have bicycle lane.
 Then you have two-lane traffic.
 And if you do widen the street, how much are you going into the neighborhoods?
 And how will this exist?
 How will this impact the existing non-compliant businesses that have no place to go back to?
 For example, the historical building on
 Park and Salem Street is a perfect example or even the fire station that just the city's invested all that money and re renovating so I just can't get there from here given your proposal the Comprehensiveness which brings me to the next point We're not London
 So I, and I stress that only because I did look up the firm that did this, and I don't know if they're affiliated with it, but we're not London.
 We're, you know, City of Medford, a small city relatively, and it's a very, very ambitious, designated, busy, very condensed area based on their proposal.
 And I don't know how these,
 Salem Street versus other areas in Medford were selected to be just built up with 10-story high hotels, but it seems a bit unfair to the people of Salem Street in the neighborhood comparatively to other neighborhoods which don't have aggressive planning.
 That's it.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6624.271s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, thank you, Claudia.
 I appreciate your thoughts on the street section, like how everything kind of goes together, as well as making sure that the work that's being proposed is contextual and appropriate.
 We're not London.
 There's a reason we live in Medford.
 We love Medford.
 If we left London, we'd be there.
 And yeah, I appreciate your question in terms of the selection process.
 So maybe we can provide some more insight into that process.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6656.995s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Well, maybe you could readjust things so it'd be more appropriately distributed across the city.
 If you are required by any state obligation to meet housing needs, appropriately distribute it so that you don't really make it impossible and a safety hazard to the people that live in this area.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6682.461s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And then just a quick point of clarification on the type of land that zoning applies to.
 Zoning only regulates the private land, so it wouldn't regulate the streets themselves.
 But we can dig more into some of those nuances, but just want to kind of put that out there.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6706.59s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Because it looked like on one of the design proposals that you extended back into the streets, the houses.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6715.233s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So we'll clarify.
 At this time, we do need to move on to a different public commenter.
 We'll do our best to address that.
 And then if not, let's continue the dialogue via email or potential future public comment periods.
 But thank you so much, Claudia.
 Really appreciate your thoughts.
 The next commenter we have is Lori.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6746.21s">[Lori Spinney-Flagg]</a>:  Laurie Spinney Flagg, 55 Garfield Avenue.
 I am opposed to this proposal.
 Obviously, if you look at your maps, I am the second house in from Garfield, which means, and the house directly beside me has been abandoned for the past five years after being built.
 Nobody's in that house.
 So I don't know if they're hanging on for these
 Maybe they have some insider knowledge that you are planning to do this, but that leaves my home subject to
 two pieces in which I will have no, I don't care if you put a little diagonal on it or not, it is going to tower over my home.
 I was extremely happy when the house next door to me went up a floor because it made it more consistent with the neighborhood.
 And I have to tell you, I bought this house 27 years ago and the traffic on Salem Street has only increased year after year after year.
 I used to take public transportation.
 The express bus used to be across the street that has been discontinued.
 I have not seen buses going to Malden Station, but very rarely.
 So I don't know how much you are really digging into what's going on on Salem Street, but as others have mentioned, there's a huge parking issue.
 What about water, trash pickup?
 What about the historical integrity of this area?
 I mean, you have homes that, my house was built in the 1890s.
 So, I mean, and we've been trying to
 rebuild over the course of the years that we've been here, what's going to happen to our property values when you bring all these new people into this section of the city?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6875.108s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I appreciate those concerns, Lori.
 Sounds like you're, I think we're like 10th thing at this point, concerns about traffic.
 Maybe you have a specific parcel that you're concerned about.

 Francis Street.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6956.62s">[Danielle Evans]</a>:  Hi, Kelly.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6957.1s">[Kelli Raso]</a>:  I would like to know what is the incentive to the city to agree to all this zoning changes?
 What is the advantage to the city itself?
 People are so concerned about their property values, the increase in traffic, the sudden and extreme changes.
 The Community Development Board progressing so quickly with
 things that are going to have long lasting effects to our city and without slowing careful consideration for what the ramifications will be, how will we unring this bell if things go sideways?
 This is the first property that's come up, you know, this is the first proposal in this seems somewhat small scale, but there's no telling the
 the magnitude of, once the zoning is permitted, what will stop everything from turning into six-story buildings, one after the other, after the other, after the other?
 I just, I'm very concerned about how quickly things are moving.
 Mr. Gabb was just approved.
 Why not take a minute and let Mr. Gabb develop, you know, if you,
 already approved it and you've decided that it's going to work, why do Salem Street simultaneously?
 The advantages to the developers, I still don't understand why the city has a stake in this and what you would ever entertain so many changes at the same time for.
 I feel like it's so rushed, it's so eminent, and it's not a well-thought plan.
 without a lot of potential problems.
 And it's very, very concerning.
 I don't understand it.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7081.379s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I appreciate that feedback, Kelly.
 making sure that we're doing this kind of intentionally, bringing everybody along with the process, and thinking about your six-story building comment, it may make sense for us to revisit some of those details just to clarify.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7100.645s">[Kelli Raso]</a>:  It's not even the height of the building, it's just once the floodgates are opened, how are we going to slow the roll in once you, you know, I feel like the developers are sort of pushing in that everything is being
 expedited because the developers have submitted plans.
 Well, you know, and to that end, I would also like to say that in notifying the public, I think that it should be on the developer to send the notifications through the post office with the return receipt requested so that we can be sure that people are actually being notified and that the, you know, the actual
 perimeters of the 300 or 400 feet is being met.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7148.544s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Allie, I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to move on to another public commenter.

 Yes.
 Great, thank you.
 I appreciate the time to speak.
 My name is Jean Nuzzo.
 I live at 35 Parish Street.
 I often speak on these matters and the impacts to our resident, and I'll send my comments along, my technical comments along for the record, but tonight I'm going to do something unusual, and I'm going to speak for myself, because you've made me a direct abutter in this.
 We've lived at our home for decades here on Parris Street.
 It's a full south-facing home with sustainability built that way before it was a trendy thing.
 Recently, we lost all the nearby 400-year-old silver maples and our summer shade to development.
 We've also lost a good portion of our sun path across all seasons to a new structure.
 The impacts of development on us have already been significant.
 Our costs to run our home have increased deeply already with heating and cooling and ice removal we never needed before.
 In your plan, you are now zoning that same parcel next door, similar in topography and size to mine, actually my lot is larger, to an MZ1IZ zone.
 With mechanical, ornamental, and not exercising the loopholes in your plan changes, I have a building potentially plus or minus 70 feet tall next to me.
 Three and a half stories alone, never mind six, would completely blot out my sun path entirely.
 My home will go dark.
 I will lose the balance of what remains of my trees, bushes, gardens.
 The nearby wildlife that we harbor will be obliterated.
 No solar and other green options for us.
 So I would like to know, why does 31 Paris Street get an MZ1 with IZ status and I do not?
 You've come down the street farther than anywhere else to get to that lot, so I'd like to understand why he gets it and I don't.
 And lastly, I'd like to thank the City for their religious reminders of what developers want at every meeting, for regularly stressing the needs of the developer profits over our environmental justice neighborhood and our neighbors,
 Thank you, Alicia.
 I'm sure the moneymakers appreciate your advocacy.
 Maybe look up what a betterment is and how cities leverage them to offset the cost to the residents.
 Maybe advocate for us.
 I'm so sorry.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7419.507s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  Good evening.
 My name is Maureen Wing.
 I live at 36 Dudley Street, and I'm not next to Salem Street, but I'm nonetheless concerned.
 I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak.
 I am very concerned about a six-story building being built on Salem Street.
 In terms of the butters of the people that are in the neighborhoods, I'm very, very concerned.
 We have a certain, I would say, view of our street, view of our neighborhoods, and I think six stories is ridiculous.
 The second thing is I am also echoing what other people think about the traffic concerns.
 It doesn't seem to me that anybody's been talking about if we've done a current traffic study,
 Salem Street is a parking lot many times of the day.
 That does impact public safety response as Melanie has outlined.
 I'm also concerned that the fire trucks come down from the fire right down Park Street when they're going to other areas in Medford, and there's parking on both sides of the street.
 The parking on side streets is both sides anyway, on many areas coming off Salem.
 And I'm very concerned that what are we doing about that?
 And what are we looking at in terms of the traffic on the street?
 And the other thing is, again, the impact on the schools in terms of the school population.
 I do oppose any methadone or CBD clinic on the Salem Street corridor.
 And the other thing I would like to say is that
 If we're going to have three to four story buildings, I would prefer that you're going to have parking off street underneath those building and have those things planned for that and not say it's a 1.5 space.
 That makes no sense to me.
 And could someone just please answer from before when this was going through everything, the three gas stations that are quite near each other.
 I had the sense that we left that open.
 I wasn't sure.
 Is that are they being removed?
 Are they being asked to move?
 It was just unclear to me what was going on with the three gas stations that are sort of diagonally near each other on Salem.
 Thank you.
 Sorry for all the bullet points.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7543.652s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  No, it's really great.
 It gives us a lot to work with, so I appreciate the insight, Maureen.
 I'm hearing, you know, echoed concerns about traffic and parking, public safety.
 Maybe we can dig in a little bit more to your
 Um, kind of, uh, the underground not underground, but, um, like, self contained parking for 3 to 4 stories.
 And then maybe we can get a quick answer on the gas stations.
 It was my understanding that they are not being asked to move.
 They're allowed to operate, you know.
 You know, keeping in mind.
 Earlier commenters, was that Patricia?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7584.736s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Madam Chair, if I might.
 Nobody is asked to move or change anything.
 Exactly.
 Period ever.
 It's what allowed if they wanted to redevelop or dramatically change, redo their property.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7600.166s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And that's applicable to the property owner.
 But if somebody has a lease, which is atypical with a gas station, they might have a long-term land lease, given the amount of capital improvements that are required for a gas station.
 But if a business did have a lease and the property owner decided to move in a different direction, that's the property owner's decision.
 And if the business owns the land that it's on, then that's the business's decision because the property owner and the business are one and the same.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7631.539s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Correct.
 But nobody would be asked to move ever under a zoning change.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7637.524s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yes, correct.
 Yeah, I think that's really helpful clarification.
 And thank you so much for asking the question again, Maureen.

 I'm going to echo off of one of the former commenters specifically in regards to the step back.
 These are an architectural usage in specific climate areas that don't experience the same amount of freeze thaw that this neighborhood would.
 be under, you're going to have significant water issues in every one of these buildings.
 No one on this board is going to care about that.
 The problem is, I don't believe there's a single licensed architect involved in any of these decisions.
 I'm not one of them.
 However, I do consult with them on a regular basis and I see these issues often.
 This is something you should drastically consider removing from the
 from the the amendments it's it's just a nightmare you're you're not gonna get you're you're trying to make compliances for the residents when in actuality you're just going to design really poor buildings um and further to that i wonder if there will be any sort of aesthetic reviews on any of these buildings such as products allowed to
 clad them with or what will be the longevity of each of these buildings?
 Has there been any sort of thought put into that end of the equation?
 So I have.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7773.854s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, John, I appreciate your concern towards like the materiality and the aesthetics of these issues.

</p>

 I just want to thank Paula and Emily for their presentation.
 I found it very helpful to understand the maps a little bit more and all of the codes and all of that.
 But one thing that it brought up, because again, I'm concerned with the same things that other people are, which is traffic, public safety and parking.
 But have either of you or even the community or the
 development board walked down Salem Street from the Rotary to Fellsway.
 Have either of you, that's just, it's a, you don't have to answer it, but have you ever done a tour of
 Salem Street, have you ever gone into Haines Square and spoken with any of the entrepreneurs who have some of them have been there for years and they have opinions about traffic and they have opinions about no bike racks and they have opinions about loitering and they have an opinion about trash.
 Have you personally spoken to anyone in Haines Square which would be
 Totally affected.
 And have you spoken to any residents?
 Have you observed trash on the street?
 Have you observed where people tend to park?
 I just, I just think that your maps are wonderful.
 Your information is wonderful, but there's nothing like boots on the ground.
 I do a lot of walking, so I walk around the area a lot, and I see a lot of things that could be improved.
 And I know that this is just zoning.
 It doesn't mean that a six-story building is going to go next to every spot that's labeled purple or whatever.
 I understand that.
 So my other question is, who is going to be encouraging this development?
 Is there a department in Medford that seeks to
 get the right kind of businesses here?
 Because what if it's all check cashing stores?
 And that type of business opportunity, who is going to be really monitoring that we're bringing in what the residents want?
 And has anyone talked to them?
 So thank you very much for my time and good luck.

 So yeah, I hear the more concerns about traffic, public safety, parking, your comments about the entrepreneurs in Haines Square, and then your concern for maintaining diversity of businesses so that it continues to serve the neighborhood.
 So thank you so much for those comments.
 Our next public commenter is Ren Bean.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8005.433s">[Ren Bean]</a>:  Hi there, Ren being from 37 Woodrow Avenue just on the other side of the rotary there from Salem Street, and I'm generally supportive of the zoning effort here.
 I think there are a lot of details to wade through to get it right.
 I think there certainly is the danger that
 the city with good intentions sort of charges in and gives permission for development.
 And then it's outsized for what the infrastructure can handle.
 I think there are some questions about electric and sewer, and of course, the traffic and parking, which all have merit.
 But my comments are specifically about the incentives.
 I wonder if there was financial equivalency considered in how folks can get the additional half and full stories, because if I were a developer just quickly looking at this, I'd say,
 Yeah, I'm going to do a fountain and a pocket park because there's no square footage on there, or I'm going to do three years at 15% below market rate for my commercial because that doesn't really cost me that much and I'm still making a profit.
 I'll take that rent and flip the building.
 Major profit.
 you know, and you, I think there's the risk here that people will take the path of least resistance and you'll end up with a street of fountains every other block or something like that.
 And you won't get some of the other incentives unless they're, you know, equivalent to each other and cost for the, to develop.
 So I, I mean, maybe, maybe that is there, but it just looks like there, there could be the opportunity to take advantage of some of these that aren't defined as granularly as the others.
 The other thing that I wanted to just...
 touch on is the 0.8 parking spaces for anything within half a mile of high-frequency transit, which, according to zoning law, is any mass transit, including a bus that runs three times an hour.
 I think the whole of the zone would be in that, based on the Better Bus Project.
 I would be a little bit concerned about all the street parking that would result from all the carve-outs for less than one parking spot per unit.
 You know, I think most of those folks almost it would be great if everyone took the bus.
 But the reality is most of the people that could afford to buy would be parking a car.
 They'd probably be eligible for resident permits.
 And, you know, I think we need to move away from driving cars and taking mass transit.
 But the reality is the bus three times an hour isn't going to take those cars off the road.
 And I, I hate to say traffic study because I don't tend to agree with some of the things that motivate a lot of those sentiments.
 But I think it would be wise.
 So thank you very much.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8167.365s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Ren.
 I hear your insight in terms of the proportionality of some of these incentives, as well as maybe some concerns about the parking minimums.
 So thank you for sharing those.
 Real quick check in with the board.
 Are we doing OK?
 Do we need a break?
 Want to make sure that we're all present.
 OK, thumbs up.
 OK.
 All right, seeing none, no objections.
 Thumbs up from Ari.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8221.956s">[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  Hello.
 My name is John Flagg.
 I live at 55 Garfield Ave.
 I don't have a lot of specifics.
 We really just started getting this information, kind of had to go through it all where everybody has regular jobs.
 But one thing I wanted to just bring up, and I'm sure it was just type of verbiage you guys wanted to use, but Selma Street's not a corridor.
 Selma Street is a collection of name arts.
 And it would be appreciated if it was looked at that way.
 I'll echo all the same things about traffic.
 Parking my street takes the brunt of parking for Salem Street.
 So if you're going to add more density on Salem Street without more parking, I guess they'll just, what they do now is park in front of my driveway.
 I guess that will just be every day.
 I saw historical character in some of the documents, and nobody seems to be addressing that.
 I just want to point out that the Sink 240 building has no relationship to any kind of historical character or myth.
 So I don't know how that building got in.
 My opinion, it's ugly, but nobody cares about that.
 But what I did want to ask is, what's the hurry here?
 You know, the communications, I know you guys started back in July, but nobody started even hearing about this until November.
 I'm trying to understand why we have to have this voted on in February.
 You need to have neighborhood input here.
 I'm right at the, I abut these changes.
 It just seems like we're rushing through to create more density without any kind of acknowledgement about what that density increase is going to do to the fabric of our neighborhood.
 I know you gave an email, and I will send an email with more specifics, but I just wanted to add my two cents in there.
 I do not support this proposal as it is right now.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8361.884s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Well, John, your input's worth a lot more than two cents.
 And I'm hearing the question like, why now?
 So I think it'll be helpful for us to provide some more insight to help answer that question.
 Our next public commenter is Alyssa Nugent.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8389.083s">[Alyssa Nugent]</a>:  Hi, Alyssa Nugent, 98 Sheridan Avenue.
 I am generally supportive of these changes.
 I appreciate that you took time to go back and look at the marijuana use and the zoning for that.
 I don't think that should be zoned in this area.
 I have some concerns about traffic and all that.
 But specifically, I have some concerns about the incentives to be able to build higher.
 It just seems like some of the options are very easy.
 A bench, the fountain, these are things that the developers would jump on to be able to have the extra
 the extra stories.
 And maybe considering all of the concern with parking, maybe something like below ground parking should be more than a half story.
 Maybe that should be a full story to incentivize that.
 And I think that in terms of creating more green spaces and making sure that we are making this a corridor that is pedestrian-minded and friendly to the neighborhood,
 that we really do focus on the incentives for putting in green space and making it a livable, walkable corridor, because that is where we want to move to, even if we do have major traffic issues related to the fact that the roads on both sides of the area are controlled by somebody besides Medford.
 So I would certainly ask that
 that the board think about that a little bit more.
 I love this neighborhood.
 I love walking this neighborhood with my kids.
 I can't wait to walk to the Roberts with them when they enroll there in a few years and it would be wonderful.
 We didn't have so many gas stations along the route and it was a little bit more beautified.
 We don't want to just push for fast development.
 We want very thoughtful development and that's what I'd like to see in the zoning plan.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8516.874s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you.
 Thank you, Alyssa.
 And I'm hearing comments that echo earlier commenters, you know, kind of concerned about this incentives menu.
 And I think, you know, we can do some work digging into that and kind of, you know, embed that with best practices, but combine it with what makes it really right for Medford.
 So thank you so much.

 I live at 302 Salem Street, which is right next to the pit on the corner of Salem and Park.
 And I just want to say how opposed we are to this zoning change.
 We were never notified.
 As abutters, you would think we would have been told that it could build six stories.
 We were never notified of this.
 The traffic, every day we go out.
 We have to go knocking on the neighbors' doors all around the businesses to get out of our driveway because there's no parking, and people are parking in front of our driveway.
 I can't imagine putting a six-story building next door with not enough parking.
 Where are these people going to park?
 And the traffic, I can't get out of my driveway.
 It takes like 10 to 15 minutes now.
 And the only chance I have of getting out is when the light changes and somebody stops to let me out.
 And I mean, I just can't imagine why we were never told of this.
 This has been a family home for over 60 years.
 And what about our quality of life?
 I mean, it's great for all these builders and stuff, but what about the people that have been in Medford and made Medford and lived here?
 Why don't we count?
 I just don't understand why.
 I mean, and rush, rush, rush, it's crazy.
 And what is our quality of life gonna be when a six-story building goes up next to a five feet from my property?
 I just don't understand.
 I'm so frustrated.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Medford is supposed to be so great, but I guess if you've lived here for years, you don't count anymore.
 So that's all I have to say, just how opposed we are to this zoning change.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8709.822s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I hear your opposition loud and clear, and I'm so sorry that you feel this way.
 Maybe we can learn more about the notification process.
 And I'm hearing a lot of your fellow public echo concerns about traffic, but your frustration is heard and noted.

 I just wanted to voice my support generally for the direction of the zoning.
 I know that there are a lot of concerns here, but my wife and I, we had our daughter in December, and the zoning proposals and changes that we see in the docket are really giving us hope that Medford is developing in the
 direction that we would be happy to see where businesses and resources are close and will continue to be close and welcoming.
 Yeah, Medford will become more welcoming to more businesses in our area, in our neighborhood.
 Yeah, I understand there's a lot of concerns, but
 Quality of life I find is best when the resources you need are as close to where you live and you have what you need close by and you don't necessarily need to get in your car and leave Medford or drive through traffic to go get to them.
 No specific details that I wanted to mention, but just general support for the direction of this overall.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8912.615s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Andrew.

</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8976.046s">[Marian Tomaszczuk]</a>:  Okay.
 Yes, Marianne Marianne Thomas look and I live at 29 Garfield Avenue.
 Mm-hmm.
 And that's right in Salem Street
 near nappies and I am extremely opposed to this and I feel that there's totally impossible to implement this.
 If you try to do all this building and have all this density, we will find ourselves like Chelsea and having whole blocks go up in flames and the firefighters will not be able to fight it because we will not be able to have the water power to fight the fires.
 We will possibly lose firefighters' lives in the process and I feel this is
 dangerous situation.
 We did absolutely no studies, no traffic studies, nothing with the fire safety, no types of any kind of studies at all.
 Talking about these green spaces is a farce because you're talking about 3,000 square foot lots.
 You're talking about a very narrow street and yet you want a 12-foot sidewalk
 80% of the lot's going to be covered.
 And yet, and then you're going to have a green space, mini park, I forgot what you called it.
 And there's no way that that can possibly happen on a 3000 square foot lot with, you know, six, six floors, or even three floors.
 It's just
 Impossible.
 You're not requiring them to have parking.
 There's not enough parking here now.
 I live halfway down Garfield Avenue and people from Salem Street park in front of my house all the time.
 This is an issue.
 In the morning, I volunteer at the senior center and I can't even get out.
 I don't drive, but the person that drives me, we can't go down Salem Street in the morning or the evening.
 And I also want to know if you are considering the letter you got from the mayor asking you to reconsider and not vote on this tonight.
 And I also don't understand if it's legal for you to vote on this when
 The changes you're talking about, they're not uploaded on the site.
 I looked, and how can you vote on something when you're talking to us about the changes, and yet there's nothing written that we can see?
 So if you vote on what you're talking about, and yet there's nothing written about that, so there's two different things.
 One thing that you're talking to us about, and one thing that's written.
 So that doesn't seem right to me.
 It doesn't seem legal.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9156.966s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I hear that concern, and I hear the echoing of concerns about public safety, the actual implementation of this.
 And regarding the letter, there is an option for us to continue.
 That would be up for the entire board to discuss.
 So I'll leave that to our discussion.
 But that is one of our options that we do have available this evening.
 And that may give us more time to kind of process and address the board's concerns and comments as well as the public concerns and comments as well.
 So thank you so much for your insight.

 I'm a former Medford City Councilor.
 I spent eight years on the council, and a majority of that was working on zoning.
 Even though I'm an attorney, it's such a nuanced field.
 I hired a Boston zoning attorney to walk me through it.
 So,
 I think a lot of these people feel like they need to do that, and some of them, as you may have heard earlier, have done just that, and they should not have to be put through that expense.
 But what I'm hearing tonight is that no one's protecting the neighborhoods, and the overwhelming majority of these people have come forward to say they are scared, they're nervous, and they don't like what they see.
 It used to be that the city council had one motto and that was protect the neighborhoods.
 What I hear from this city council is, and maybe from the mayor and hopefully not, let's protect the developers.
 The only thing I think that you people can do tonight is take this off the table.
 It's impossible to fix.
 It is so overwhelming.
 It is so high.
 It is so dense.
 You are going to ruin the neighborhoods and that should not happen.
 So I ask you to think very, very carefully about what you're doing and to consider who you're representing.
 You're representing the residents of the neighborhood, nobody else.
 You're not representing the OCD board or the mayor or the city councilors.
 Thank you.

 My name is Lisa Korber, 47A Chardon Ave.
 I want to express my tremendous opposition to this plan.
 I feel
 The integrity of this area of the city will be destroyed.
 No one is thinking about the traffic, the parking, all things that have already been echoed.
 I've been here my entire life.
 I am now a third generation in this city.
 Nobody's thinking about the children.
 Nobody's thinking about where the children are going to go to school.
 We have over 150 vacancies, apartment-wise, in this city to date.
 Why we need to put more housing, especially this area, and this area has a lot of empty apartments right now, is beyond me.
 There are things that have been done in my neck of the woods, friend's neck of the woods, that nobody's ever been, it's never been brought forth, and that's problematic.
 So I'm respectfully asking this committee to please table this, put it aside, get the neighbors involved, and let's have a discussion
 of realistic expectations.
 Protect the people that live here.

 In East Medford, Massachusetts.
 I get it.
 You want more development.
 I've always said Medford is the best location in New England next to Boston, proximity wise.
 However, Sill Street is already a busy street.
 So it seems to me your new rezoning will add a lot of new additional real estate tax to the city, to the city's coffers.
 But will this new money lower our real estate tax bill at all?
 Will it lower our real estate tax bill even one dollar or less?
 Okay, I guess I'll wait for an answer tomorrow.

 Maybe it's time
 East Medford to secede from the city and form our own city because we have the most valuable land, period.

 I lived on Mr. Gabb in 1955.
 That was the old highway to Boston, Route 38 for information's sake.
 When they built Route 93 in 1960,
 then we really didn't need Route 38, but we have it.
 It's a lousy place back then, street cars and trucks and mechanic places and things of that nature.
 And it has not been developed when it should have been 60 years ago.
 No, 64 years ago, 1960.
 It's a live industry.
 It's still the same street.
 And that's where you can go high on one side, on the 93 side, but you gotta lower our taxes.
 If you go up 10, 15, 20 stories, you put your own off rent on 93.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10078.973s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And all of these comments will be shared with the board for us to review.
 just to kind of confirm with the public.
 I see another member of the public who's raised their hand.

 I'm 14 right here, placed in Medford.
 And I wanted to just tell people that I'm getting old now.
 I've lived in Medford all my life.
 I've worked in Medford all my life.
 And I definitely,
 think that Medved is losing some of the charm that I grew up with.
 It's becoming like Maldon.
 If you look at Maldon Center, Maldon Center is terrible compared to when I was a kid.
 And I just wanted people to know that I definitely am opposed to almost any change, but I definitely, living on this little dead-end street, it's tough to get off my street.
 Especially, the way it's timed, like the cars come from my left and then
 There's nothing on the right and then by the time of the one side clears up the other side goes up and the people are very very disrespectful people won't slow down let you get out and you know, I definitely worry about just the
 the electricity.
 I know in my house here we have had electric issues because of the way the route the electricity is run in my street and and just
 In general, I just want to say I love Medford, I've always been here, and I always will, and my grandchildren are now here, and hopefully they're going to stay in Medford.
 So please consider this very, very carefully.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10240.813s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, James.
 And I appreciate your affection for Medford.
 I share that affection.

 We do have the two minute public comment limit, but I do encourage you to email if you have additional feedback.
 But I did really appreciate your comment.
 Thank you so much for sharing.
 I don't see any other hands.
 So let's see.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10283.398s">[Patricia Doherty]</a>:  Oh, I see a hand.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10284.278s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Do you want the consultants to respond to any of this?
 Yes, I do.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10294.108s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yes, I do.
 I do want.
 to hear some responses from the consultant.

</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10345.334s">[Lisa Serio]</a>:  Can you hear me?
 Yes.
 Hi lisa.
 Oh, I did this because I wanted I I kind of like tried to help paulette through this to see if she could maybe get this but okay, I I'll do it with her when I see her phone because I I Couldn't even find how to raise my hand for a second and then I found it under reactions But anyway, um, I wanted to say thank um, my name is lisa and I live at 18 paul road in medford, which is not on the

 It is always been convenient.
 Salem Street has always been convenient for me.
 If I need a hardware store, if I need food, if I need a drugstore, everything's there.
 You had a citizen say that he wants it to continue to be that way.
 It's always been that way.
 When you go to Haynes Square, you always can find everything that you need.
 So I just want, you know, to assure him that this has always been the way it's been in Haynes Square.
 It's also even been a little bit more attractive because the square, Medford Square, Salem Street leads right into Medford Square, and Medford Square was always
 vital part of the city, which has now become like a dead zone, which I don't understand why nobody's really thinking about that area more than all the other areas, because Medford used to have a supermarket, and we just used to have so many great, you know, department stores, Woolworths, Grant's, Baker's, Shoes, everything.
 We had everything down the square, and now there's nothing down the square.
 So, I mean, it's great that you're thinking about Salem Street, and I agree it's not a corridor, it's a neighborhood,
 But the square to me is really where, you know, like where we have to kind of like be thinking and trying to figure out how to revitalize that.
 But anyway, that's all.
 I just wanted to make sure I could get through to you and, you know, just to see if I could get through.
 But I do want to thank you because I thought the graphics were great.
 I kind of understood what's happening.
 I don't know if I agree with it, but at least I understood it.
 So that's it.
 I just wanted to thank you.
 And that's my comment.
 OK.
 Thanks.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10491.383s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Lisa.
 I agree.
 I thought the graphics were great.
 And I appreciate your insight about specific points in the neighborhood that might need a little extra special attention.
 The feedback is hard.
 Thank you so much for speaking.
 And if you are able to help Paulette deliver her comment, we'd love to hear it, whether it's through email or some other means.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10518.71s">[Lisa Serio]</a>:  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, normally I do these things in Medford, but I'm in Arizona doing this.

 Anyway, that's it.
 Thanks.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10533.961s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That is one of the benefits of doing these virtually.
 It makes it a little bit more accessible for people who may not be able to join in person.
 But we do have to put up with a couple of challenges.
 OK.
 So.
 I would like to flip this back to Emily and Paola.
 The public has provided a lot of feedback, super rich, super valuable.
 But I want to open it up just to hear back any concerns.
 I have, I think about 10 pages of notes.
 So there's a lot of material to cover, and we'll at least use this as a starting point.
 So Emily and Paola, if you're able to address.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10588.105s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Sim, obrigado, Senhora Presidente.
 Também quero repetir seus comentários sobre ouvir o público.
 Isto foi extraordinariamente útil.
 Agradeço muito a todos que dedicaram um tempo para estar aqui hoje para nos dar, seja o seu feedback uma crítica, uma afirmação ou um pedido de informação, foi tudo muito importante.
 Nós realmente apreciamos a oportunidade de ouvir você.
 Então, muito obrigado a todos.
 Quero abordar algumas coisas.
 Uma delas é que eu estava acostumado a ouvir a pessoa falar sobre o escritório londrino.
 Há uma empresa em Londres que tem o mesmo nome que nós.
 Um problema de usar sobrenome, certo?, é que existem pessoas no mundo todo que poderiam ter o mesmo sobrenome.
 Não somos afiliados a essa empresa de Londres.
 Somos uma empresa sediada em Massachusetts.
 Temos apenas um escritório.
 Estamos em Newburyport, então somos relativamente locais, mas eu só queria esclarecer esse mal-entendido.
 Peço desculpas à firma de Londres, mas não somos nós.
 Mais seriamente, quero abordar algumas coisas.
 Em primeiro lugar, em
 Recomendações de estacionamento.
 Houve alguns, entendemos a frustração em torno do estacionamento.
 Nós ouvimos isso.
 Queria esclarecer, acho que uma ou duas pessoas disseram algo sobre não exigir estacionamento.
 Não alteramos os requisitos de estacionamento.
 Na verdade, eles estão na tabela de uso ao lado de uso.
 é o número de vagas de estacionamento necessárias para cada uso.
 Na verdade, isso está no decreto de zoneamento da cidade no momento.
 Não fizemos alterações nesses requisitos de estacionamento.
 Alguém mencionou uma exigência de estacionamento de 0,8 vagas por unidade.
 Isso é um existente
 Requisito de habitação acessível para promover habitação acessível.
 Essa não é uma mudança que estamos fazendo.
 Acabamos de implementá-lo porque existe nos requisitos de estacionamento.
 Então, só para esclarecer isso.
 Ouvimos muitas preocupações sobre a proximidade da altura com as preocupações residenciais existentes sobre interrupções de energia solar.
 Também ouvi de outras comunidades a ideia de cortar o ar, cortar a energia solar, cortar, sabe, criar sombra.
 Também ouvimos que essas medidas retroativas podem não funcionar.
 É algo comum de se ver no zoneamento, mas isso não significa que não devamos reexaminar.
 Então, acho que, em vez de tentar responder a essas perguntas, gostaríamos de voltar, conversar com a equipe de planejamento urbano, dar uma nova olhada em algumas dessas disposições e conversar com vocês novamente.
 É por isso que ficamos felizes em receber comentários públicos para entender a melhor forma de responder a algumas das preocupações.
 Precisamos fazer algumas modificações?
 Certamente podemos olhar para isso.
 A outra coisa que ouvi que era semelhante no sentido de que deveríamos analisar novamente é que havia preocupações sobre o zoneamento de incentivos.
 Talvez algumas dessas coisas fossem fáceis demais.
 Para que conste, um único banco não dá um andar ou meio andar, embora eu possa ver como, sem uma metragem quadrada específica, algumas pessoas podem pensar isso.
 Então certamente podemos dar uma olhada nisso.
 Nós olhamos, eu sei que o chafariz foi mencionado, olhamos a ideia do chafariz porque vale um pouco do espaço porque não se trata apenas de fornecer o chafariz, mas também dos custos contínuos de água que o incorporador ou o proprietário do imóvel pagaria, os custos de manutenção,
 As fontes precisam ser drenadas no inverno e reparadas e restauradas, por isso é na verdade um custo mais significativo do que pode parecer à primeira vista, mas tudo isso é para dizer que estamos felizes em rever o zoneamento de incentivo e ver se há algum ajuste que devamos fazer conversando com
 ouça os comentários do conselho hoje ou trabalhe com a equipe de planejamento urbano.
 Estou apenas examinando minhas 10 páginas de anotações para ver se há mais alguma coisa específica antes de mencionar o tráfego.
 Um dos membros da equipe estava na Salem Street, então enfrentamos alguns dos mesmos problemas.
 Vamos ver.
 Existem muitas outras coisas sobre qualidade de vida.
 Quero dizer, ouvimos pessoas preocupadas com o uso na escola.
 Certamente podemos dar uma outra olhada na tabela de uso e ver se há alguma outra que precise ser modificada com base no que ouvimos hoje.
 Mas uma das razões para incentivar o comércio na escola é que se os pais acompanham os filhos à escola, por se tratar de uma escola primária,
 Esperamos continuar promovendo a caminhabilidade do bairro.
 A ideia de ter negócios ali era para que os pais pudessem fazer recados no caminho de casa.
 Então talvez a combinação de negócios não esteja certa, mas isso foi um motivo para
 E já existem empresas nessa área, o que foi motivo para agrupá-las ali.
 A calçada, acho que ouvi alguém preocupado que alargando a calçada estaríamos estreitando a rua.
 Agora, só para esclarecer isso, e talvez possamos fazer outro diagrama para destacar isso.
 Mas a ideia é que
 Eles teriam, se a calçada tivesse, digamos, 2,5 metros, eles teriam que adicionar mais 1,2 metros na propriedade privada como parte do empreendimento para fazer a calçada ter 3,6 metros de largura.
 Procurávamos uma largura adequada a todos os utilizadores, pessoas a conversar e a caminhar lado a lado, alguém a empurrar um carrinho de bebé.
 talvez para alguém que esteja a conversar com um amigo, alguém em cadeira de rodas, para que haja a possibilidade de ter um passeio suficientemente largo para ter toda aquela actividade e talvez para alguns dos negócios uma pequena zona de refeições exterior no verão.
 Mas é daí que veio a largura.
 E, finalmente, quero abordar o tráfego, as infra-estruturas e o impacto nos serviços públicos.
 Ouço você alto e claro.
 Isso é algo que é sempre uma preocupação nas comunidades com as quais trabalhamos.
 Acho que Alicia conversou com um diretor que conversou com ele antes.
 Normalmente os estudos de tráfego não são feitos em zoneamento, onde os estudos de tráfego são implementados é quando há uma proposta específica de desenvolvimento, eles podem vir até a cidade com uma proposta e os estudos de tráfego são necessários naquele momento.
 Então não, não somos engenheiros de tráfego.
 Somos planejadores.
 Somos designers urbanos.
 Não realizamos estudos de tráfego como parte disso, mas ouvimos sua preocupação.
 Continuaremos conversando com
 Com o nosso cliente, a cidade sobre essas preocupações e nós agradecemos.
 Eu acho que isso é um sucesso.
 tipo de perguntas de alto nível.
 Notei que Paola estava tomando notas.
 Acho que os funcionários da cidade estão tomando notas.
 Portanto, revisaremos tudo o que achamos que não abordamos e ficaremos felizes em conversar sobre maneiras de divulgar essa informação às pessoas.
 Alicia, não sei se há algo da sua parte que você gostaria de abordar também, ou Paola, se você tem mais alguma coisa que gostaria de acrescentar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11063.328s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sim Alicia, Paola, se você tiver algo a acrescentar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11068.533s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Sim, eu adoraria acrescentar que todas essas perguntas são muito boas.
 Tenho todos vocês aqui, Carlos, Dave, María Elena, Zachary, Cheryl, Klein, Julissa, Doreen, Melanie.
 Não vou ler todos eles.
 Eu tenho todos os seus comentários.
 Eu entendo que você está preocupado, você é proprietário de uma casa.
 e parece que estamos modificando bastante.
 Eu só queria esclarecer algumas coisas.
 As alturas que temos são exatamente as mesmas que você, exceto pelo zoneamento de incentivo.
 Os zoneamentos de incentivo são apenas
 para lotes voltados para a Rua Salem.
 Portanto, se você não estiver de frente para a Salem Street, terá no máximo três se estiver no MX1 e quatro se estiver no MX2.
 Então, eu queria deixar essas duas coisas bem claras.
 Coisas como a cervejaria não são permitidas no MX1 e MX2.
 Não são permitidos laboratórios ou pesquisas.
 Claro, a maconha não é permitida.
 Não me lembro da vinícola, mas podemos investigar isso.
 Existem também outras portarias que não estão no zoneamento de que se você estiver próximo a uma escola, não poderá ter um estabelecimento de maconha próximo a ela a uma certa distância da escola.
 Então, há outras coisas que protegem, obviamente, a segurança pública e infantil.
 Eu só quero ter certeza de que entendemos que quando falamos de comercial muita coisa pode acontecer agora com o seu zoneamento atual e esse é o hotel de 15 andares, então há coisas que precisamos mudar ou que acho que recomendo que sejam alteradas porque não é o caso.
 Não é o que você tem agora.
 Não protege.
 Há muito trânsito.
 Isso definitivamente adiciona tráfego.
 O apartamento dois, do outro lado de Fellsway, tem 15 andares e seis andares, todos residenciais.
 Então o comercial um e o apartamento dois têm seis andares por direito, o que não vamos fazer.
 Estamos fazendo mais quatro zoneamentos de incentivo.
 Então essas coisas têm muita certeza.
 No zoneamento de incentivos ouvi ótimas ideias.
 Acho que precisamos fazer algo em relação à distância ou
 para que não tenhamos fonte a cada 100 metros.
 Acho que esse é um bom ponto que devemos abordar e adoraríamos analisá-lo.
 Queremos que os desenvolvedores tenham que retribuir algo à comunidade se ganharem alguma densidade.
 Claro, a comunidade está sempre em nossas mentes.
 Quero compartilhar um mapa onde vamos conversar.
 Estamos estudando muitos bairros diferentes.
 Não é apenas a Salem Street.
 Fizemos a Avenida Mística.
 Seguimos agora para o bairro residencial.
 Estamos fazendo outros corredores como a Avenida Boston.
 Olharemos para a área de Wellington como uma transformação.
 É por isso que quero apresentar um plano que temos para 2025.
 Até 30 de junho, todos os diferentes temas que veremos.
 Também analisaremos as não conformidades e como resolvê-las e agilizar determinados processos.
 Por isso encorajo todos os interessados ​​a assistirem às reuniões do comitê e de planejamento, pois falaremos muito sobre o seu zoneamento.
 E nós amamos esses comentários.
 O que mais eu tenho aqui?
 Desculpe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11298.995s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Se não se importa que eu interrompa, esquecemos de mencionar West Medford Square e Medford Square.
 Estamos zoneando para isso também.
 Portanto, a nossa missão é realmente olhar para toda a cidade em resposta aos comentários e recomendações do plano abrangente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11317.259s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Sim, obrigado.
 Isso era outra coisa.
 Agora, às vezes parece que estamos fazendo o oposto, o que estamos tentando fazer com esse tipo de bairro misto, que não ficará apenas na Salem Street e Mystic, mas também nas praças.
 Teremos alguns nós nos bairros residenciais.
 Então, criamos isso
 áreas onde você precisa fazer suas necessidades básicas, compras, um café, uma padaria,
 Isso é necessário para torná-lo mais transitável.
 Então não temos uma pedra na cidade e o resto é residencial.
 Tentamos fazer essa combinação para que seja mais transitável e precisemos de menos carro.
 Então, nesse tipo de empreendimento o que se tenta é atender o bairro para que as pessoas do bairro andem até essas lojas e não haja muito trânsito.
 Essas são algumas das respostas que eu queria dar.
 Também conversamos com o Departamento de Obras Públicas.
 Dissemos a eles que estavam projetando um novo traçado para a rua.
 Eles entendem os problemas que as ruas enfrentam, mas não se trata de zoneamento.
 Isso está do seu lado quando se trata de seu design.
 Mas conversamos sobre isso com eles para ver se havia algum problema da parte deles.
 E eu acho que isso é tudo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11406.31s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sim, também ouvi comentários sobre os impactos económicos.
 Houve uma pergunta sobre impostos e impactos nas empresas.
 Eu adoraria ter mais informações sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11421.062s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Sim, desculpe, Alicia, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11426.324s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Quero dizer, talvez alguns dos comentários que eu faria se enquadrassem nisso.
 Então, a título de imagem, temos um Departamento de Desenvolvimento Econômico que reporta ao nosso escritório.
 Nosso diretor de desenvolvimento econômico esteve aqui esta tarde ouvindo.
 É por isso que, desde 2021, temos pessoas saindo, recrutando e procurando novos negócios e incentivando a entrada de diversos tipos de negócios.
 Não acho que ele esteja falando sobre... bem, deixe-me dizer, eles estão trabalhando nisso.
 E há algumas coisas que serão muito emocionantes em breve, especialmente em Medford Square.
 E nesse sentido também trabalhamos muito com a Câmara de Comércio.
 É por isso que a Câmara de Comércio organizou um café empresarial na semana passada para falar sobre o zoneamento da Salem Street.
 E eles o enviaram aos membros da câmara, mas a diretora executiva da câmara me disse que ela foi de porta em porta e enviou panfletos para todas as empresas em Haines Square e conversou com os proprietários de empresas.
 e tentei convencê-los a comparecer àquela reunião onde falaríamos sobre zoneamento em Haines Square.
 E não creio que nenhuma das pessoas que estiveram presentes naquele evento da Câmara de Comércio fosse realmente de Haines Square.
 E isso a frustrou muito porque ela conversou com empresários por toda Haynes Square.
 Eu mesmo ando e ando de bicicleta pela Salem Street e, ao fazer isso, conversei muito com alguns proprietários de imóveis e empresários em Haynes Square sobre isso.
 Em particular, alguém que possui um edifício e que adoraria ter apartamentos além do seu negócio e que anteriormente lhe foi negada a possibilidade de o fazer pelo Conselho de Apelações de Zoneamento.
 e isso permitiria que eles fizessem isso.
 Temos um prédio diferente que tinha um pequeno apartamento acima do negócio deles e aquele restaurante realmente obteve permissão; Você deve ter visto a Fiore Italia expandindo os apartamentos acima de sua propriedade.
 Portanto, sabemos que existem interesses de proprietários de empresas existentes.
 Houve alguns comentários de que estamos recebendo muitos desenvolvedores e só respondemos aos desenvolvedores e há uma licença de demonstração.
 Pessoalmente, tenho que assinar todas as autorizações de manifestação na cidade e não vi nenhuma na Salem Street nos últimos seis meses.
 Falei com um desenvolvedor
 quem tem interesse em um imóvel que já surgiu na frente da cidade.
 Houve muita conversa sobre isso, mas o dono do imóvel na 360 Salem Street ainda parece interessado na mudança.
 E o último incorporador interessado em seu imóvel quer fazer um térreo comercial com dois andares residenciais acima, o que atualmente não é permitido pelo zoneamento, que ele acredita que caberia aqui.
 E Park Street, esquina de Park com Salem,
 O buraco, desculpe.
 Isso é.
 Eles têm todas as licenças necessárias para construir aquele edifício e já as têm há mais de sete meses.
 E me disseram que já está de volta ao mercado vendendo.
 Há tantas coisas que podemos fazer.
 Damos permissão a alguém para construir o prédio.
 Se eles não construírem, não poderemos forçá-los a fazê-lo.
 Mas não estou ciente de outros desenvolvimentos.
 E direi que encorajamos fortemente os desenvolvedores a virem conversar.
 conosco sobre o que é permitido, o que poderia ser permitido e como trabalhar com a cidade.
 Portanto, se outras pessoas nesta ligação disserem, mas eu quero abrir um negócio, entre em contato com nosso escritório.
 Nossa equipe de desenvolvimento econômico quer ajudá-lo.
 Ou você conhece um desenvolvedor e ele não está conversando, ele deveria falar conosco, por favor.
 Então, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11655.341s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Essa é uma ideia muito útil, Alicia.
 E parece que muitas pessoas compartilharam
 Como anedotas pessoais ou informações que eles ouviram, e eu diria, você sabe, a melhor maneira de processar essas informações é, você sabe, compartilhar informações com a cidade porque eles podem confirmá-las.
 E é útil para nós do conselho sabermos os detalhes, para que possamos ter mais contexto.
 Quero dizer, Medford é enorme.
 Não podemos estar em todos os lugares ao mesmo tempo.
 Eu patrocino algumas empresas na Salem Street.
 De vez em quando fico preso na crise de Salem.
 E os motoristas de Massachusetts não mostram piedade.
 Então eu definitivamente sinto essa dor.
 Mas sim, é útil termos o máximo de informação possível.
 E todos vocês estão realmente prestando um serviço a si mesmos e a todos os demais em Medford, presentes e futuros, ao participarem deste processo.
 Vejo uma mão que foi levantada.
 Ainda estamos no período de comentários públicos.
 E só quero esclarecer que podemos encerrar o período de comentários públicos esta noite, mas isso não significa que o fecharemos durante toda a audiência.
 Estou curioso para ouvir o meu conselho, mas estou inclinado a continuar a discussão, a continuar a audiência.
 Há muito trabalho a fazer, ouvindo isso do público, dos conselheiros.
 Para mim, para Emily e Paula, para Alicia e Danielle, ainda há muito trabalho a fazer.
 Então, só para dar uma prévia às pessoas, não é o fim de ouvir você e de nós e de receber informações.
 Com isso quero ir para a mão que vejo levantada, o zoneamento da cidade.
 Por favor indique seu nome e endereço para registro.
 Você receberá uma solicitação para ativar o som e Alice iniciará o cronômetro.
 Vou enviar essa solicitação para ativar o som novamente.
 Isso é para zonear as pessoas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11807.35s">[Jean Nuzzo]</a>: Você pode me ouvir agora?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11808.57s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sim, olá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11809.471s">[Jean Nuzzo]</a>: Olá senhora presidente.
 Lamento falar novamente.
 Sou Jean Nuzzo, da Rua Parrish, 35.
 Sinto muito, tentamos... Espere, deixe-me, não ouvi uma resposta à minha pergunta relevante para 31 e por que eles foram zoneados multiuso com incentivos e meu pacote não.
 E eu gostaria dessa resposta.
 Não é uma declaração nova.
 Apenas aponta o fato de que este consultor de zoneamento e esta equipe não responderam à minha pergunta.
 Eles foram muito mais longe do que em qualquer outro lugar, até aquele terreno que é menor que o meu, deram um zoneamento inclusivo e pararam aí.
 E eu gostaria de saber quais foram os critérios deles para fazer isso, se você não se importa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11853.532s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Eu ouço isso.
 E eu tomei essa nota.
 E talvez para contextualizar mais, porque tenho certeza de que não respondemos a todas as perguntas.
 Não há como conseguirmos.
 Há muito conteúdo rico aqui para processarmos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11869.295s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Porque as pessoas podem ter uma pergunta semelhante.
 Quando tivemos nossas reuniões na prefeitura, uma das coisas que dissemos às pessoas, e percebo que não dissemos esta noite, é que olhamos para o que está lá fora e o que parecia fazer sentido para nós.
 Mas se houver um proprietário,
 cuja parcela é adjacente a esta e sente que a sua parcela não está zoneada corretamente, estamos muito abertos para que você nos envie seu endereço e possamos ver se deve ou não ser incluído porque os proprietários querem.
 É realmente válido.
 Portanto, digo isso não apenas para aquele palestrante, mas para qualquer pessoa que queira seu pacote específico.
 Isso é muito útil para nós.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11920.055s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: E estou ouvindo a direção.
 Jean, vou ativar seu som muito rapidamente só para confirmar o endereço.
 Então, garantimos que éramos muito claros sobre isso.
 Encorajo qualquer pessoa com preocupação semelhante a entrar em contato com a cidade.
 Partiremos daí.
 Nossa, eu acidentalmente silenciei você.
 Então, Jean, esse endereço é 31 Parrish Street, correto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11942.795s">[Jean Nuzzo]</a>: Paris Lake, França, eles têm 31 anos e eu tenho 35.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11946.418s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Ok, ok, é por isso que não consegui encontrar.
 Bem.
 Impressionante, muito obrigado.
 Eu realmente aprecio sua defesa de si mesmo.
 E muito obrigado pela sua paciência esta noite.
 Parece que pode haver um caminho a seguir que funcione para você.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11969.282s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Não há zoneamento de incentivo quando não estão voltados para a Salem Street.
 Então este é um MX porque já é um edifício residencial múltiplo.
 É por isso que é um MX1.
 Obviamente podemos estudar se adicionarmos outros anexos a isso, como disse Alicia.
 A única coisa é que estes não têm incentivos.
 Os incentivos são apenas para lotes voltados para a Rua Salem.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11999.199s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: E então perguntar especificamente sobre essa propriedade, tal como está agora, ela está atualmente não conforme?
 Eu preciso... Ok, vamos voltar a isso.
 Se você não estiver em conformidade, talvez não haja motivo para alterar o zoneamento desse lote específico.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12027.699s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Fizemos vários testes de não conformidade.
 Podemos voltar e verificar os mapas e ver como é.
 É por isso que é muito útil ter os endereços.
 Muito obrigado por nos fornecer eles.
 Não ouvi quando você mencionou o endereço antes.
 Então, obrigado novamente por ter esta reunião.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12047.8s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Não que isso importe, mas você verá algumas notas no caminho.
 Então, Ari, vejo sua mão levantada.
 Eu sei que você está se sentindo um pouco mal esta noite.
 É sobre isso que você está nos alertando?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12067.195s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Antes de encerrar, eu iria apresentar uma moção de votação para continuar com isso até uma determinada data.
 Acho que recebemos um feedback muito bom e, pelo menos para mim, o próximo passo óbvio é trabalhar duro.
 E eu gostaria de fazer essa moção, a menos que alguém tenha outro comentário.
 Vejo a mão de Peter.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12089.608s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Então, por que não, acho que do ponto de vista processual, preciso encerrar o período de comentários públicos esta noite, certo?
 Não, Danielle está balançando a cabeça.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12100.956s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Senhora Presidente, não, não precisa de fazer isso.
 Bem.
 Você pode encerrar o comentário público esta noite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12111.596s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Estou confuso agora.
 Basta ter a emoção, você pode dizer: não aceitaremos mais comentários públicos esta noite.
 Ok, fechando aqui.
 Não é esta noite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12123.487s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: E então eles votaram nele como uma cereja no topo da discrição para fazer isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12129.653s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Acho que não sei o que fazer com meus poderes.
 Mas agradeço a paciência de todos.
 Esta é a segunda reunião que presidi.
 Então, estamos todos aprendendo juntos e agradeço muito a paciência de todos.
 Então agora mesmo, ah, Adam.
 Neste momento, encerraremos os comentários públicos esta noite.
 Isso o leva às deliberações do conselho de administração.
 Ari, ouvi seu movimento.
 Você gostaria de fazer isso novamente para ter certeza de que estamos executando a ordem correta das operações?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12167.337s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Claro.
 Gostaria de propor que continuemos com isso.
 E esta é uma situação em que queremos fazer com uma data determinada ou apenas geral?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12177.641s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Para fazer isso em uma determinada data.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12179.397s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Ok, foi o que pensei.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12180.679s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Sim, rapidamente penso diferente da emoção à mesa, o que é indiscutível e você não aceitaria comentários adicionais.
 Portanto, só quero reconhecer que você pode querer ouvir os outros membros do conselho antes de votar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12196.418s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Quer dizer, sou totalmente a favor de continuar.
 Acho que temos muito trabalho a fazer.
 Annie, vejo que você não está muda e balança a cabeça.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12203.84s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Sim, apoio totalmente.
 Este é apenas o começo da conversa, então concordo definitivamente que devemos mudar para uma data específica e continuar a conversa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12218.805s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Peter, você tinha alguma ideia que queria ou queria oferecer?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12224.51s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Não, eu ia dizer com base no que ouvi dos comentários públicos e de Emily e Paola da Menace Associates, parece que eles têm coisas que desejam implementar antes de tomarmos uma decisão final, antes de tomarmos qualquer decisão sobre isso.
 Mas gostaria também de fazer um esclarecimento administrativo.
 Quando a audiência pública foi aberta, era tanto para a Salem Street quanto para o zoneamento de pontuação verde, sobre o qual ainda não ouvimos falar.
 Precisamos, por questões administrativas, ouvir o zoneamento da pontuação verde porque faz parte do mesmo item?
 Ou podemos votar para continuar apenas com a Salem Street e depois ouvir o zoneamento verde?
 Ou precisamos? Essas duas coisas estão relacionadas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12276.392s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sim, eu ouço o que você está dizendo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12277.453s">[Peter Calves]</a>: É realmente uma questão administrativa, desculpe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12281.536s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Quero dizer, essa é a parte realmente emocionante deste trabalho, mas muito importante.
 Temos que fazer as coisas da maneira certa, de forma consistente, para que as pessoas saibam no que estão se metendo.
 Danielle, vejo sua mão.
 Você teve uma resposta para isso?
 Ou você quer que eu passe por um?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12298.858s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Sim, posso ajudá-lo com a questão processual.
 Basicamente, foram dois documentos que foram encaminhados para fora da comissão.
 Mas esta é uma revisão gradual do zoneamento onde iremos dividi-la em pequenos pedaços.
 Então você abriu.
 Sim.
 Quero dizer, você poderia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12318.431s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: E incluí o conteúdo da zona verde como parte da audiência pública aberta.
 Então acho que tecnicamente poderíamos fechar esta noite.
 Eu só quero ter certeza de que está ótimo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12330.717s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Sim, continuando a audiência pública.
 Não chegamos a isso.
 Sim, não acho que isso seja um problema.
 E quanto às datas, a próxima é 5 de fevereiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12345.754s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Então, Danielle, o que você está dizendo é que talvez a gente fique na zona verde esta noite e depois como parte da continuação, a gente chega mais perto das 10 horas, sabe, os participantes do 108 perderam 60.
 Quero ter certeza de que isso é algo que você sabe que temos.
 hum quatro e quatro, sim, massa crítica e total apoio e total participação, então gosto dessa abordagem. Estou curioso para saber do conselho se alguém tiver alguma objeção. Acho que não, quer dizer, acho que está tudo bem. Quer dizer, como eu disse, acho que por tudo que ouvi do público e de Ellie e Paula, há trabalho a ser feito nisso, então prefiro</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12390.971s">[Peter Calves]</a>: deixe esse trabalho ser feito.
 E quando deliberamos, deliberamos sobre um produto acabado que as pessoas acreditam ser um produto acabado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12399.635s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sí.
 Acordado.
 Ben, Adam, Sabrina, ¿alguna idea?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12409.94s">[Ben Lavallee]</a>: Sim.
 Eu só, você pode me ouvir, Emily?
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12412.722s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12413.002s">[Ben Lavallee]</a>: Bem.
 Desculpe.
 Ainda estou em trânsito.
 Ei,
 uma rodada muito, muito convincente de comentários públicos, muito atenciosos e completos, e só quero transmitir gratidão. Eu também moro fora da praça e considero o corredor da Salem Street meu bairro de várias maneiras, crianças Roberts, a coisa toda, então eu realmente aprecio isso.
 Tudo o que foi dito esta noite, alguns destaques para mim, vou ser breve.
 Honre os residentes e os contribuintes como parte do processo, explique o porquê e tente descrever especificamente os benefícios potenciais.
 Acho que a empresa de consultoria fez isso parcialmente esta noite, então agradeço e espero que ouçamos mais sobre isso.
 Eu definitivamente ouvi as preocupações sobre o trânsito, os comentários sobre Roberts são uma parte realmente central de todo esse plano de rezoneamento, segurança pública e comodidades e, o mais importante, estou feliz por termos abordado isso.
 Emily, você abordou isso e eu agradeço.
 Entendendo as preocupações específicas do pacote, e acrescentarei outro plug-in, se você tiver uma preocupação específica do pacote, informe-os, entre em contato com a cidade e converse.
 Definitivamente é necessária muito mais conversa.
 Sou a favor de revisar todo o tópico.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12503.66s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Obrigado Ben.
 Tenho a aprovação de Adam.
 Perfeito, Sabrina.
 Legal.
 Portanto, neste ponto, encerrarei o período de comentários públicos desta noite.
 E vamos buscar uma moção para continuar tanto a questão do zoneamento quanto a questão da zona verde até uma determinada data, que parece ser 5 de fevereiro.
 Eu sei que temos um adiamento da Universidade Tufts naquela noite.
 Temos algum outro item planejado antes do conselho naquela noite?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12549.296s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Não, temos algo nessa área do caminho do casamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12555.76s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Tem a senhora presidente, através da presidência, sim, tem o loteamento que ainda precisa ser votado, mas isso deve ser bem rápido.
 Era basicamente a lista de tarefas do engenheiro municipal.
 mudanças nos planos, e Tufts é um curinga.
 É tudo o que temos, acho que são os únicos itens que estão na agenda.
 Devo salientar que o dia 19 é o próximo, é o segundo, ou não, o primeiro e o terceiro, é o terceiro, e essa é a semana de férias de fevereiro, e eu,
 Eu provavelmente desaconselharia dividir a semana de férias em zonas.
 Estarei ausente, mas liguei durante as férias.
 Estarei em Vermont.
 Acho que não seria bom para os moradores.
 Concordo.
 As pessoas estarão fora da cidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12609.157s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Portanto, não continuaria até essa data.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12612.159s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Bem, e se começarmos com o quinto?
 Porque ainda temos a zona verde.
 Pontuação verde.
 Pontuação verde, desculpe.
 Meu cérebro para de funcionar depois das 10, então é bom continuarmos.
 Mas temos a pontuação verde e então podemos ver onde estamos em termos de respostas a esses comentários públicos e partir daí.
 O que ouvi repetidas vezes, e com o que concordo totalmente, é tipo, você sabe, não vamos nos apressar.
 Não acho que devamos simplesmente parar, mas acho que devemos garantir que prossigamos de maneira ponderada e intencional.
 E eu realmente aprecio o trabalho que Emily e Paola fizeram, assim como Danielle e Alicia.
 para colocar isso na direção certa.
 Com todos os nossos poderes combinados, conseguimos isso.
 Estou novamente procurando uma moção para continuar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12667.871s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Farei uma moção para continuar a discussão sobre o Corredor de Salem e sobre o Verde no dia 5 de fevereiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12680.059s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Procurando por um segundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12680.879s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Eu segundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12684.246s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Obrigado, Pedro.
 Vamos fazer uma votação nominal.
 Vou apenas fazê-los como os vejo.
 Adam Behrens.
 Bem, entraremos em contato com você.
 Talvez precisemos.
 Sinto muito, não sei o que você está dizendo.
 Você vai escrever sim.
 Isso é aceitável para uma votação nominal?
 Sim.
 Bom.
 Bem.
 Obrigado, Adão.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12718.594s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Isso foi tudo para mim para mim.
 Obrigado.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12720.175s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Precisamos obter, você sabe, sinais de zoom para todos nós fazermos, mas obrigado por, eu, hum, uh, Sabrina Alpino, uh, Ben LaVallee, Annie String.
 Olá.
 Ari Peixeman.
 Sim.
 E Peter Kalfs.
 Sim.
 E eu, Emily Hedeman, também sou a favor do sim.
 Com isso, continuaremos até o dia 5 de fevereiro.
 Eu e meus outros membros do conselho dissemos isso e você sabe, penso em Emily e nas políticas, mas muito obrigado a todos os membros do público que aderiram.
 Sim, muito grato pelo seu conhecimento em compartilhar suas histórias pessoais, isso realmente significa muito.
 Você sabe, nós também somos seus vizinhos, e isso nos ajuda a ter um alcance mais amplo, você sabe, o que está acontecendo além do nosso círculo.
 Muito obrigado por se juntar a nós esta noite.
 Vejo você no próximo mês.
 E eu acho que sim. Temos algum outro item na agenda desta tarde?
 Adiamento.
 Bem.
 Então estou olhando... faço uma moção para encerrar.
 O movimento favorito de todos.
 Estou procurando por um segundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12810.851s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Apoiarei essa moção.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12812.712s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Obrigado pela segunda, Annie.
 E obrigado pelos aplausos, Jean.
 Eu aprecio isso.
 Não preciso ir para a cama esta noite.
 Então, vou fazer uma votação nominal.
 Eu te ligo quando te ver.

 E eu mesma, Emily Hedeman, também apoio o adiamento.
 Ótimo trabalho, diretoria.
