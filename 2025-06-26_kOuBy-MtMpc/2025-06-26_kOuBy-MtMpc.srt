1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:01,493
[SPEAKER_31]: So good evening everyone.

2
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:02,975
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Emily Henneman.

3
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:07,841
[SPEAKER_31]: I am chair of the Medford Community Development Board, and I'm calling the meeting to order.

4
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:11,265
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

[SPEAKER_15]: We also have Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of PDS.

35
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:21,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we had Sal DiStefano, the Director of Economic Development, if he's still here.

36
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:22,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I see Sal.

37
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,759
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Brenda Pike, who is the Climate Planner in our office.

38
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, Brenda.

39
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:36,863
[SPEAKER_15]: one of our student interns, Josh Needleman, who will be taking minutes tonight.

40
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:38,183
[SPEAKER_31]: Awesome.

41
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,904
[SPEAKER_31]: Important job, Josh.

42
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:44,905
[SPEAKER_31]: Thumbs up for minutes.

43
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:47,226
[SPEAKER_31]: I used to do that when I staffed a board.

44
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,166
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's an important job.

45
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:55,468
[SPEAKER_31]: So our first item on the agenda tonight is a new public hearing.

46
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:04,055
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had continuances for previous public hearings, but this is a new one, so I'm going to read the public hearing notice for the record.

47
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:11,885
[SPEAKER_31]: This is a rather long one, so I just wanted to give people a preview that you're going to hear my voice for a couple minutes.

48
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:27,505
[SPEAKER_31]: So the public hearing notice for the record is that the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on January 22nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m.

49
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:35,254
[SPEAKER_31]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.

50
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:45,109
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend section 94-2.1, which is division into districts, to add the Salem Street Quarter District.

51
00:03:46,969 --> 00:04:03,053
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend section 94-6.0, which refers to general regulations, to insert a new subsection to create the new green score zoning regulation and to state the applicability, standards, and calculation methodology therein.

52
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:18,403
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, specifically Table A, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District into the existing table and to designated the uses permitted therein.

53
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:33,048
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, specifically Table B, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

54
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:42,589
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend section 94-12, which is definitions, to amend and add various definitions.

55
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,632
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Salem Street Corridor District.

56
00:04:53,145 --> 00:05:08,569
[SPEAKER_31]: Amending the zoning map to create a new Salem Street Corridor District and to change the zoning district designation of various properties to place them within said district, as shown on a map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning, dated December 8th, 2024.

57
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:21,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Amend section 94-11.7, which is site plan review, to incorporate the green score regulation by adding submission requirements

58
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,752
[SPEAKER_31]: for the site plan review and modifications and establish a waiver process.

59
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:33,278
[SPEAKER_31]: We also include Zoom link meeting details in this notice.

60
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:40,005
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the Zoom meeting that you are all in presently and also posted this on the city website calendar.

61
00:05:41,545 --> 00:06:03,680
[SPEAKER_31]: I would also like to let everyone know that a subsequent public hearing on this same matter will be held by the Medford City Council on February 11th, 2025 at 7 p.m., excuse me, in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, which is 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom.

62
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,663
[SPEAKER_31]: So two different ways to be involved with that hearing.

63
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,666
[SPEAKER_31]: A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than November 29th, 2024.

64
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:28,940
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to start this off by asking staff if they have any introductory comments, and then we will be viewing a presentation from Emily Innes of Innes & Associates.

65
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,902
[SPEAKER_31]: There's going to be two aspects to it.

66
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:47,371
[SPEAKER_31]: So for people that were very patient with the list of different changes that we're reviewing and providing recommendations on tonight, there's kind of two different topics.

67
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:52,234
[SPEAKER_31]: There's the green score zoning, and then there's zoning itself.

68
00:06:52,394 --> 00:07:02,861
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're going to hear first about zoning, and then we're going to hear about green score zoning regulation, just to kind of set the stage for everyone and manage expectations.

69
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:13,905
[SPEAKER_31]: So Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and her team?

70
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:29,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Madam Chair, I do believe that NS Associates has a pretty solid introduction explaining a lot of the background, the timing, etc.

71
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:37,040
[SPEAKER_27]: But I did want to share for the public, this is not one of our normally scheduled weeks for the Community Development Board meetings.

72
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,303
[SPEAKER_27]: However, we were aware that we had a number, a large number of public hearings that we needed to

73
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:48,264
[SPEAKER_27]: here, and we wanted to give the zoning its due time.

74
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:58,147
[SPEAKER_27]: Last time we took up zoning after several public hearings, it was much too late and too difficult to process all that information late at night.

75
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,187
[SPEAKER_27]: So we thought this deserved its own separate hearing.

76
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:09,650
[SPEAKER_27]: For those who are not aware, the city board meeting actually went until midnight last week, and we could never have taken this up after that.

77
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,331
[SPEAKER_27]: which is why we're hearing this on a separate week.

78
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:18,493
[SPEAKER_27]: And we continue to have a pretty heavy caseload, even though we're meeting twice a month.

79
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:37,522
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that, I'm actually going to pass this off to Emily Innis and Paula Ramos-Martinez, too, because they will put this into the context of the comprehensive plan, which is something that Emily actually worked on with us for several years, as the board is aware.

80
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,344
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's sufficient.

81
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:42,829
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Alicia.

82
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,992
[SPEAKER_24]: With your permission, Madam Chair, for the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.

83
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:52,533
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm joined by my colleague Paula Ramos Martinez.

84
00:08:53,754 --> 00:09:07,601
[SPEAKER_24]: We are together going to give you a presentation starting with Paula first to go over the background to the zoning change for the Salem Street corridor, what we're doing, why we're doing it, information about that.

85
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:25,088
[SPEAKER_24]: I will then join you for the details of the zoning, so I can show you from the summary information where to find that within the language of the zoning itself, particularly important for many people on this call who may not deal with zoning on a regular basis, who just want to give them a guide to where to find it.

86
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:34,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Then at the appropriate moment, Hala will be back to you to explain the green score, again, what it is, why it is, and what the implications are.

87
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:35,853
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is our plan for tonight.

88
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:59,400
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just reiterate with what Alicia said I know Paola will talk to it as well but just said the this zoning process or rezoning process that we're in now was a recommendation of the comprehensive plan so we are essentially in the implementation stage of that recommendation by bringing forward the details that were envisioned in the plan.

89
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:06,609
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, and with your permission, I'm going to turn this over to Paola, who will share her screen and take us through the first part of the presentation.

90
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:07,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

91
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Emily.

92
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:11,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, everyone.

93
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,654
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Paola.

94
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:19,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam, if I may, I'm going to share my screen and start with the presentation.

95
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,823
[SPEAKER_31]: We can see your screen.

96
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:36,600
[SPEAKER_31]: We're looking at a meeting reminder, which no matter how many times you dismiss, they always pop back up.

97
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,342
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, now we got a presentation.

98
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,064
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, it's going a bit slow then.

99
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:47,409
[SPEAKER_31]: And we are looking at your presenter view.

100
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,110
[SPEAKER_31]: Now it's just the presentation.

101
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:55,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

102
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:59,038
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wanted to say, it was already said before, but we have

103
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,724
[SPEAKER_17]: two main things that we want to present today.

104
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:09,890
[SPEAKER_17]: One is going to be about Salem Street Corridor District and that is going to take the first part of this presentation.

105
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:20,037
[SPEAKER_17]: We will take questions and later on we will come back with the presentation and do the second part which is the green square.

106
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:26,341
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the agenda for Salem Street what I have is we're going to talk about the timeline.

107
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:27,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So what has

108
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:34,455
[SPEAKER_17]: what we did before and that made us come here at this meeting today.

109
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So what was the process before that?

110
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,278
[SPEAKER_17]: What are the opportunities for public comments?

111
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Not for this one alone, but because we're going to come back

112
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:52,689
[SPEAKER_17]: We are reviewing zoning, so we are going to do a lot of topics, very different topics.

113
00:11:53,509 --> 00:12:03,374
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to give to everyone what is the process when we take a new draft, what are the different

114
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:10,663
[SPEAKER_17]: phases that has to go through and when in those phases you could give comments.

115
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:17,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Then I'm going to do introduction of why this, why Salem, where does that come from.

116
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:28,216
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go into your current zoning, what is there now, and then we're going to show the proposed zoning map.

117
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:45,912
[SPEAKER_17]: The last two topics I'm going to give to Emily, and she's going to go through the draft, so the language, and she's going to talk first about the general changes that are being done to the Medford zoning ordinance, and then the new district that we are adding.

118
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And after that, we will do the Q&A.

119
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:53,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I must say that I'm very happy that there is so many people here today.

120
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,163
[SPEAKER_17]: So what was the timeline?

121
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,765
[SPEAKER_17]: When did this started?

122
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:05,808
[SPEAKER_17]: And what were the meetings that we had until today?

123
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:17,337
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did a workshop in July 24th, where we showed a lot of analysis that were done at a citywide level, and also for Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.

124
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:22,942
[SPEAKER_17]: And this analysis were very varied, but were showing us dimensions,

125
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:34,028
[SPEAKER_17]: of the lots, the existing zoning, non-conformities, transit, a lot of different topics.

126
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,991
[SPEAKER_17]: And all those topics were citywide, but also Mystic and Salem.

127
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:43,354
[SPEAKER_17]: So this helped us to get started with the analysis.

128
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:46,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in the August 14th, we brought the first proposal.

129
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,958
[SPEAKER_17]: We started with Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.

130
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:55,058
[SPEAKER_17]: In December 3rd, we did Mystic Avenue first.

131
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:57,819
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why you see a big gap between August and December.

132
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,600
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when we finished Mystic, we started with Salem Street.

133
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,001
[SPEAKER_17]: We presented the draft.

134
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:18,006
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in December 11, we presented the final with the comments and different little tweaks that we did to the first draft.

135
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:31,329
[SPEAKER_17]: In December 11th, the Planning, Permitting and Committee meeting, I referred and approved to refer this draft to the CDB and this is why we're here today.

136
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,473
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is the process?

137
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:51,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we're going to do, and this is going to be with every topic that we are going to bring forward for the rezoning, we're going to first in city council, and this is in the planning committee meetings, we're going to bring a new topic, we're going to present it.

138
00:14:52,361 --> 00:15:01,065
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we're going to listen from the councillors, from the city staff, and from the public, any comment that they may have.

139
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:11,168
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will come back another time to a planning committee meeting, and we will present the draft with the alterations that were needed.

140
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:17,309
[SPEAKER_17]: If everything goes well, then the city council can refer to the city board.

141
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:26,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Here again, we will hear from the public, from the board, and the board will vote.

142
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:33,911
[SPEAKER_17]: the topic and it can be referred again to the City Council and the City Council can give the final approval.

143
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:42,914
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a process and in every of these phases and stages the public has an opportunity to comment on it.

144
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:53,158
[SPEAKER_17]: We are telling you this because we are going to continue looking at different topics and this list is going to be updated every time that we present it.

145
00:15:53,938 --> 00:16:00,721
[SPEAKER_17]: So in gray, you're going to see different dates and topics.

146
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:04,743
[SPEAKER_17]: The gray says represented meetings that were already done.

147
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:10,446
[SPEAKER_17]: The red are the meetings that we're doing today, and that's Salem Street and Green Score topics.

148
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,008
[SPEAKER_17]: And the blue are the ones that will come in the future.

149
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,369
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is going to be updated.

150
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,130
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have the final dates.

151
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,892
[SPEAKER_17]: And every time that we present, we're going to

152
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:31,886
[SPEAKER_17]: let you know which are the new topics that we are working on and at what stage they are so that you can write it down and join any meeting that you would like.

153
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,688
[SPEAKER_17]: So where does it come from?

154
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Why we're doing this or why we're doing Salem Street?

155
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Where does it come from?

156
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:48,915
[SPEAKER_17]: So in 2023, January, it was published the Medfair Comprehensive Plan.

157
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:57,346
[SPEAKER_17]: In here, it was the work that was done by the city consultants, and there was a lot of public engagement.

158
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,989
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a two-year plan.

159
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:10,100
[SPEAKER_17]: In here, you can see and that are identified all the problems, opportunities that Medford has.

160
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:20,801
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, we see here, so at the end of this book, and I recommend anyone that is interested in, we are basing a rezoning on this.

161
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:25,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the principles values are taken from this comprehensive plan.

162
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,226
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the end, it has a

163
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:48,237
[SPEAKER_17]: very long list of strategies that are organized by topics and one for example the VP which is vibrant places 1.1.2 refers to rezone to allow mixed use in village centers as a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street.

164
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:54,288
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you can see on the right is the vision map that comes out of this comprehensive plan.

165
00:17:54,948 --> 00:18:13,215
[SPEAKER_17]: In this vision map you can see the corridors, so in here they were identified the corridors, squares and centres, transformational focus areas, green corridors, institutional anchors and different densities in the residential area.

166
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:36,565
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we are looking now is first we started with corridors, we started with Mystic Avenue, we're working now with Salem, later on we will look into the squares, we are looking now into neighborhood residential, so the low scale of the residential, and we will continue to look into every topic that was identified in this comprehensive plan.

167
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,649
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are going to look now at Salem Street,

168
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,919
[SPEAKER_17]: what is your current zoning and what does your current zoning allows.

169
00:18:49,739 --> 00:19:07,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So in zoning, whenever we're going to rezone or rewrite a part, a district, what we have to do is to look what is existing, what is your current zoning, what are the future trends,

170
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:14,532
[SPEAKER_17]: If there is a comprehensive plan, for example, like we do have in Medford, what are those values and goals that the city has?

171
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:20,176
[SPEAKER_17]: And implement that in our proposal.

172
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,879
[SPEAKER_17]: So what do you have in your current zoning?

173
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,344
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not exactly, especially in Salem Street, it's not exactly what you do have right now.

174
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:37,176
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we're going to look into is Salem Street, you have three different districts.

175
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:45,002
[SPEAKER_17]: You have apartment one district, and that is the majority of Salem Street is in that district.

176
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:50,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Then you have commercial one at the end in the corner with Salem Street and Felsway.

177
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,830
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in the other side of Felsway, you have apartment two.

178
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,499
[SPEAKER_17]: So what does it mean?

179
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,922
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have here the dimension standards.

180
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:07,486
[SPEAKER_17]: We have it in a different way than your table because the table is a bit of difficult to read.

181
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have it by district.

182
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:15,152
[SPEAKER_17]: And so your dimension standards in apartment one

183
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,213
[SPEAKER_17]: your maximum height is three stories.

184
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Then it can be four if it's assisted living.

185
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:28,739
[SPEAKER_17]: But let's say that your multi-dwelling is up to three stories.

186
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Your C1 is up to six stories.

187
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,484
[SPEAKER_17]: These are all heights by right.

188
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:45,927
[SPEAKER_17]: In the case that in C1, somebody wants to do a hotel, by right, you can do 15, 1.5 stories high.

189
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,349
[SPEAKER_17]: In apartment 2, we have something similar.

190
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:56,193
[SPEAKER_17]: We have 6 by right and 15 for any other permissible permitted structure.

191
00:20:56,974 --> 00:21:00,116
[SPEAKER_17]: So, this is what you have now in your current zoning.

192
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:06,099
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we see it a bit more like in a diagram illustration, what does it mean?

193
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:18,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Apartment one, that is this salmon pink that you have in Salem Street, in the majority of the Salem Street, you have, for example, single family maximum is 2.5.

194
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,403
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have, oh, sorry, there is a typo here.

195
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:25,984
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have multiple dwelling, it's three stories high.

196
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:30,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry, yeah, I know what it is, sorry.

197
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:42,544
[SPEAKER_17]: you have single family detached, that's 2.5, single family attached, that is your typical house, sorry, and that is three stories high, and then you have multiple dwelling that is three stories high.

198
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,689
[SPEAKER_17]: What happens in apartment one is that

199
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,275
[SPEAKER_17]: commercial use is not allowed.

200
00:21:50,996 --> 00:22:02,458
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have all the commercial buildings that are from 93 until commercial one are uses that are not allowed in your current zoning.

201
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:08,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if we go to commercial one, commercial use, yes, it is allowed.

202
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,719
[SPEAKER_17]: You can have multiple dwelling up to six stories.

203
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,920
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what is allowed right now.

204
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:18,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can have a hotel that is 15 stories high.

205
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:26,940
[SPEAKER_17]: With apartment is very similar, but instead of a hotel, what you have is any other principle structure that is allowed in apartment too.

206
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,802
[SPEAKER_17]: And the dwelling, multiple dwelling, it's also six stories high.

207
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:43,065
[SPEAKER_17]: So in our proposal, we don't think that those highs

208
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And those uses really reflect what you do have right now.

209
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:57,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you do have a lot of commercial that we do think it's important to keep and to make it conforming.

210
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:10,960
[SPEAKER_17]: You do have, sorry, you don't have the area to really let 15 stories high, not a hotel or any other.

211
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,600
[SPEAKER_17]: So we made a different proposal.

212
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,143
[SPEAKER_17]: We want also to have mixed use.

213
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:22,346
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we did is to create different sub-districts.

214
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,149
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to create a lot of diversity as it is already now.

215
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,792
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to look really into what you have and what really works.

216
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,275
[SPEAKER_17]: And the proposal comes from there.

217
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:37,517
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have two mixed uses.

218
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:39,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Mixed use one, that's the blue.

219
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Mixed use two, that is the reddish.

220
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we have commercial.

221
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:47,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Commercial is just one little parcel in here and I will explain why.

222
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:48,785
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the dark red.

223
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the rest is the yellow multi-unit residential.

224
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,164
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to start for the residential.

225
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:05,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Whenever we saw that the lot was entire, the whole block was entire, already existing, all residential, we kept it.

226
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:08,529
[SPEAKER_17]: We think it's very important.

227
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:15,092
[SPEAKER_17]: This corridor, it has commercial, but it also has residential and

228
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:24,571
[SPEAKER_17]: this is not a citywide corridor, this is not Mystic Avenue, this is a corridor that should serve the neighborhoods that are around it.

229
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:38,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do like the idea of the neighborhood coming in this corridor, so to have a mix of only residential, of mixed use, and a little bit of higher density mixed use.

230
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:44,987
[SPEAKER_17]: So mixed use one, it's whenever we have that mix of

231
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,916
[SPEAKER_17]: You have residential, but you also have commercial.

232
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:50,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So we kept it as a mixed use.

233
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:55,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Why the difference between- Paula, one quick note.

234
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:58,303
[SPEAKER_31]: Your audio is going in and out a little bit.

235
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:04,768
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm wondering if it's a bandwidth issue, which can sometimes be solved by turning off your own video.

236
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:19,187
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe just double check that any programs that are competing for bandwidth have been closed out as appropriate.

237
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I closed the video, so I hope that it's going better.

238
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I think it's a little bit better.

239
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:32,256
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I would encourage members of the community to message Alicia or Danielle if you... Sorry.

240
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:33,916
[SPEAKER_31]: No, no apology needed.

241
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:36,257
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, we're all doing our best in this virtual world.

242
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:37,557
[SPEAKER_31]: So we'll try this.

243
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,578
[SPEAKER_31]: If we need to revisit, we'll go from there.

244
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:41,158
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, perfect.

245
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:47,120
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is the difference between MixUse 1 and MixUse 2?

246
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,101
[SPEAKER_17]: So MixUse 2 was...

247
00:25:51,114 --> 00:26:04,131
[SPEAKER_17]: It's those areas that are connecting to a major service or to, like, for example, we have parks, we have other main streets like Washington streets.

248
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:33,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Streets that are connecting with these bigger activators, as for example, Park Street, where we have a school and we have the Hickey Park, or for example, on the really east that we have the Morrison Park, we have Spring Street that is also has some commercial areas and commercial nodes in there that has a higher, let's say, pedestrian, fluent pedestrian movement.

249
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:56,009
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to give it a different, let's say, a different density towards these areas so that we could have more commercial ground floor and make it more pedestrian and that, let's say, that these are like activity stepping stones along these streets.

250
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:56,569
[SPEAKER_17]: So, if I go...

251
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:03,883
[SPEAKER_17]: continue.

252
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:10,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so what are these districts and what are the dimensions standards that we are applying?

253
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:17,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So, for example, the multi-unit residential, the minimum lot area is 3000.

254
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,833
[SPEAKER_17]: We took this number because of what is existing there.

255
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:27,056
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of non-conforming because the minimum lot area is from 5000 and 6000.

256
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:36,288
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are a lot of non-conforming lots and we wanted to reduce those non-conforming lots.

257
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:40,795
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the minimum lot area gets to be reduced to 3,000 square feet.

258
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:43,500
[SPEAKER_17]: The maximum height is three stories.

259
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:50,078
[SPEAKER_17]: mix use one, minimum lot area is also 3000.

260
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,824
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to explain what is this difference between base height and maximum height.

261
00:27:56,785 --> 00:28:01,189
[SPEAKER_17]: So the base height, it's the height that you have by right.

262
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And in this case, for the mix use one is three stories.

263
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,515
[SPEAKER_17]: So by right three stories.

264
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:08,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if

265
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And here comes the incentive zoning that we will explain, and Emily will go through more in detail.

266
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:27,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Incentive zoning is when we let a developer increase their density if the developer gives something back to the community.

267
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:32,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And this giving something back to the community is something that is established.

268
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:36,049
[SPEAKER_17]: So it has to go through a menu of options and

269
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:57,296
[SPEAKER_17]: with standards and so if they think that is reasonable like for example increasing affordability or creating a pocket park for the neighborhood then we let them increase in mixed-use one a maximum of plus one story.

270
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So with incentive zoning mixed-use one could go to four stories high.

271
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:04,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Now in mixed-use two

272
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,373
[SPEAKER_17]: The minimum lot area is 3,000.

273
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:12,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Maximum height, and this is by right, is four stories.

274
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:13,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Four.

275
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:22,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, with incentive zoning, so if the developer gives something back to the community, they can increase by two stories.

276
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:27,518
[SPEAKER_17]: So maximum height with incentive zoning is six.

277
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the commercial, which in this case we have a very small

278
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:43,013
[SPEAKER_17]: a very small lot there, is minimum lot area 10,000 square feet, maximum height three stories, plus three of incentive zoning.

279
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:49,337
[SPEAKER_17]: So it will be the same as Mixis 2 at the end, but it has three of incentive zoning.

280
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:51,859
[SPEAKER_17]: So by right is three.

281
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,364
[SPEAKER_17]: We will talk more and Emily will go more through these dimensionless standards.

282
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:10,555
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to go through the map and in this map, we're going to see what is there right now and what is not permitted by your current zoning.

283
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:22,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So, any kind of commercial area that we have from the 93 towards Felsway, in this area, for example, this is not permitted.

284
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:30,890
[SPEAKER_17]: As well, the one that we see on the lower part, it's not permitted at the moment.

285
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:59,846
[SPEAKER_31]: um and then the three stories high multi-family this would be this it is permitted so when you say not permitted it doesn't mean that if this if these amendments were to pass like we would we would evict these businesses it means they're they're welcome and encouraged to continue to operate um as they see fit just to know

286
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, because maybe it's a bit confusing.

287
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:08,489
[SPEAKER_17]: What we're doing is that they will be permitted with our zoning.

288
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,273
[SPEAKER_17]: So with our proposal, they are permitted.

289
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:19,498
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is that right now, they are non-conforming by use.

290
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,001
[SPEAKER_31]: But they can still continue to operate regardless.

291
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:23,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yes.

292
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:29,987
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that if they want to increase their height by the current zoning,

293
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:34,916
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to go through a lot of bureaucracy by to they're not required.

294
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:35,456
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

295
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:39,217
[SPEAKER_17]: So, because the commercial use is not permitted in apartment.

296
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:48,640
[SPEAKER_17]: These are not these are non conforming that will change with our new proposal because they would be in the mixed district and commercial.

297
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,500
[SPEAKER_17]: It is permitted.

298
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

299
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:52,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

300
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:55,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So the same would happen here.

301
00:31:55,602 --> 00:32:04,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Every time that we see a commercial in your current zoning is not permitted, that would change in the new zoning.

302
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:09,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Gas station, for example, you do have some along Salem Street.

303
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:13,706
[SPEAKER_17]: These won't be permitted in the new zoning as well.

304
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:16,407
[SPEAKER_17]: So they continue to be non-conforming.

305
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:24,566
[SPEAKER_17]: As well, when we go, we continue another gas station and another gas station.

306
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:26,486
[SPEAKER_17]: They are very close, three of them.

307
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:31,589
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are non-permitted, non-conforming, and they will continue to be non-conforming.

308
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:38,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Then this commercial is non-conforming now, but it will be conforming with the new proposal.

309
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,634
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the residential lots.

310
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:48,517
[SPEAKER_17]: They are permitted now, and they continue to be conforming in the new proposal.

311
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:58,480
[SPEAKER_17]: We continue here, more residential, these are permitted now and they will continue to be permitted in the new proposal.

312
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:08,108
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are commercial that right now in your current zoning is not permitted, it will be permitted and conforming in the new proposal.

313
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,551
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the commercial one area.

314
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:20,286
[SPEAKER_17]: So all of them are permitted now and they continue to be permitted in the new zoning and this as well.

315
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:31,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So now I will explain this really red area that we have a lot that we have as commercial is mainly so that we think this gas station makes sense to be here.

316
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:33,598
[SPEAKER_17]: It's near Felsway.

317
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:36,140
[SPEAKER_17]: It's out of traffic from Salem Street.

318
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,442
[SPEAKER_17]: So we prefer that

319
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:47,822
[SPEAKER_17]: that we can keep and that we would like to continue, so this is conforming in the new proposal.

320
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:55,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So we also wanted to add this definition.

321
00:33:55,416 --> 00:34:06,222
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a business incubator because we think that this is a new definition that would attract certain types of business into this area.

322
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,965
[SPEAKER_17]: They can be very small, so not big scale.

323
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:13,467
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just going to read the definition.

324
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:20,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Business incubator is an organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service

325
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:25,815
[SPEAKER_17]: and create an achievable plan to make that product or service to market.

326
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:36,804
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as the shared office space.

327
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:41,007
[SPEAKER_17]: An incubator program can last for several months to a few years.

328
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:48,833
[SPEAKER_17]: We think also that this can create a lot of activation and a lot of community in this area.

329
00:34:53,696 --> 00:35:08,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And because we understand that people might be worried about having these mixed-use 1 and 2 next to their residential or single-family house, what we have come with is

330
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:21,995
[SPEAKER_17]: a neighborhood compatibility, and this is that when MX1 or 2 on commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subjected to this context standards.

331
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:26,639
[SPEAKER_17]: And that means that their side and rear setbacks are going to be from zero

332
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:42,354
[SPEAKER_17]: to 10 so they have to allow that setback so we have a little bit more of a space between the two buildings and then the height it's going to be increasing and following a 45 degree angle from the three

333
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:53,135
[SPEAKER_17]: stories minimum up to the six in case they go for the incentive zoning.

334
00:35:53,535 --> 00:36:00,738
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to really have this transition between mixed use one, two and commercial towards the residential.

335
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:03,959
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why we implement this as a development standard.

336
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:17,408
[SPEAKER_17]: What we also want to let very clear is that as we see this area is a pedestrian oriented area.

337
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:24,898
[SPEAKER_17]: We want this to be as active and for people in the center of this plan.

338
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:34,362
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we also have in these standards, like, for example, that the parking has to be on the rear side of the lot.

339
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So, what we have facing the street is the building.

340
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:42,246
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an active ground floor so that a lot of eyes are on the street.

341
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,367
[SPEAKER_17]: It feels safe.

342
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:44,407
[SPEAKER_17]: It feels active.

343
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:49,310
[SPEAKER_17]: We also, any new development has to provide 12 feet

344
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,391
[SPEAKER_17]: fit for the sidewalk.

345
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,771
[SPEAKER_17]: So the sidewalks right now are very small.

346
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:58,933
[SPEAKER_17]: We had this analysis in the very beginning.

347
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:06,695
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't think that is enough for new buildings to come here and to have this active and pedestrian activity.

348
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:12,057
[SPEAKER_17]: So to make it more safe we ask that any new building has to give that minimum

349
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:26,686
[SPEAKER_17]: space for the sidewalk of at least 12 feet, and then it has to have a minimum setback of three, if I'm not mistaken, so that we wanted really to make it as pedestrian as possible.

350
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:33,070
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to give now the... I'm going to stop now the presentation.

351
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,654
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to pass it to Emily, and she will guide us through the ordinance.

352
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Paola.

353
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,121
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just share my screen.

354
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:45,421
[SPEAKER_24]: Just one moment.

355
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:57,604
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, Paola has shown you the colorful images designed to explain the more technical aspects of what you're unfortunately about to see.

356
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:02,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Zoning can be kind of dry when you're not familiar with it.

357
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:10,927
[SPEAKER_24]: But I do want to show you where in the zoning ordinance to look for the things that Paola just mentioned.

358
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:23,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I believe the city board members received a staff memo on proposed changes that came out of the city council meeting and a couple of other implications from those conversations.

359
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:32,426
[SPEAKER_24]: I've already put them in here, I've highlighted them, so I'm going to show them to you as we go along and then Paola will show them to you again later when we go back to the presentation.

360
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,689
[SPEAKER_24]: So, the first thing is the division into districts, which we talked about already.

361
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:45,353
[SPEAKER_24]: When you establish a new zoning district, you have to put that into a certain part of the zoning ordinance.

362
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:55,758
[SPEAKER_24]: I should say, I think most of the people on the call are probably familiar with this, but just for those who have not looked at zoning changes before.

363
00:38:56,738 --> 00:39:07,828
[SPEAKER_24]: Zoning changes are not development projects, they set the stage, they give permission for things to happen, they give options for things to happen, but they don't require that things happen.

364
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:12,753
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that goes to what we were talking about earlier with the uses that are

365
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,534
[SPEAKER_24]: non-conforming under the current zoning.

366
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:19,675
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a couple of different goals as we approached this process.

367
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:30,297
[SPEAKER_24]: One, obviously, was, as Paola said, to make sure that we were following the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, implementing that after that long public process.

368
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:33,698
[SPEAKER_24]: But the other thing was, as we were looking at what was on the ground now,

369
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:50,568
[SPEAKER_24]: hearing maybe what people valued about their neighborhoods and understanding that many things, and this is true of almost every community in Massachusetts, many things that are physically present now are actually not allowed in the current zoning.

370
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:56,171
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's because many of our communities developed before zoning came into play.

371
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:57,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Some communities

372
00:39:57,992 --> 00:40:09,397
[SPEAKER_24]: didn't start putting zoning in place until the 60s, some were a little bit earlier, but most of our New England cities and towns are actually older than zoning.

373
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:21,083
[SPEAKER_24]: So, as we looked at this, just to clarify that we're also looking at giving permissions for things that were already there, making it easier for people to invest in their properties.

374
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:27,984
[SPEAKER_24]: because we were reducing the requirement for them to go and get a variance because their properties were non-conforming.

375
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:34,306
[SPEAKER_24]: So part of this is what we call right-sizing the zoning to what's already there, and I'll call out some of that.

376
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:42,447
[SPEAKER_24]: So unfortunately I'm going to scroll through and make you a little bit dizzy as we look at this, but the next key thing to note is the table of uses.

377
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Now for those of you who may have been

378
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:55,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Watching the changes when we did the Mystic Avenue corridor, you're going to recognize some of the terminology, the MX1, the MX2, and the commercial districts.

379
00:40:56,034 --> 00:41:05,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Those district types are also present in Mystic Avenue, but we are tailoring them to be appropriate for Salem Street, right?

380
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Because Mystic Avenue is a very different entity, a very different feel.

381
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:11,783
[SPEAKER_24]: a very different purpose than Salem Street.

382
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:18,706
[SPEAKER_24]: So the first thing we did was to add this MR, this multi-family residential district, which Paola explained.

383
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:21,907
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's new, that is not found in Salem Street.

384
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:34,492
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was to allow for housing that was variations or varieties of housing types that was more suited to a neighborhood corridor, a neighborhood area.

385
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:40,745
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the second thing, so you'll see that, you'll see the yellows, that's the MR coming in.

386
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:46,671
[SPEAKER_24]: It allows and disallows or allows by special permit, depending on the use.

387
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:54,899
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing you'll see is from time to time, you'll see a blue coming in under MX1, MX2, or commercial.

388
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,602
[SPEAKER_24]: You can see it here, for example, for co-living.

389
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:11,467
[SPEAKER_24]: That's when we're making a change from what's in Mystic Avenue, where we're specifically tailoring those district types to be appropriate for the Salem Street corridor, and I'm going to call out a couple of them as we scroll through.

390
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:20,291
[SPEAKER_24]: So, if you are interested, Paula gave an overview of what is and is not allowed in the different districts, but if you're interested in the specifics

391
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:25,534
[SPEAKER_24]: of what is and is not allowed, then you should go to this proposed table of uses.

392
00:42:25,654 --> 00:42:28,035
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe that all of these are online now.

393
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:35,399
[SPEAKER_24]: We will update it again, as we do after every meeting with the city board, we'll provide the new version.

394
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:49,947
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can see here, for example, adult use, there's a no in the commercial, you see that blue, that's because adult use is allowed in Mystic Avenue in the commercial sub-district, it's the only place in the city that it's allowed, so it is not allowed here.

395
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:55,229
[SPEAKER_24]: You will see also that we are proposing changes and Paula will go over this.

396
00:42:55,669 --> 00:43:03,513
[SPEAKER_24]: We're proposing changes to some of the medical office definitions we introduced this past spring.

397
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:14,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Earlier in the process, we are refining them to be more specific with both and consistent with both state and federal law and also with the needs of the overall city.

398
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:19,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the permissions, and I'll show you the definitions in a minute,

399
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,921
[SPEAKER_24]: are very much tailored to Salem Street and neighborhood needs here.

400
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:30,983
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll show you the definitions that go along with these, but just note that that's also a difference with the corridor.

401
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:46,007
[SPEAKER_24]: The other big one is that and where there's a major change is that in the Mystic Avenue District, the adult use marijuana uses are allowed, the various options that are not allowed in Salem Street.

402
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,209
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can see those called out here.

403
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:55,014
[SPEAKER_24]: And then motor vehicle related uses, as Paola mentioned, were not there.

404
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:56,335
[SPEAKER_24]: They're allowed in the commercial.

405
00:43:56,796 --> 00:44:00,298
[SPEAKER_24]: The light service station is allowed by special permit by the CD board.

406
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:02,040
[SPEAKER_24]: The other ones are not allowed.

407
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:14,079
[SPEAKER_24]: And then certain industrial uses, manufacturing, research and testing, things that are appropriate for Mystic Avenue are not appropriate for Salem Street.

408
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:15,479
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have removed those.

409
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:19,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a couple of tweaks in the parking that you see that are not major.

410
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's some other of those light industrial uses that are not allowed in Salem Street.

411
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:26,522
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is a change.

412
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:30,826
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we are done with the table of uses.

413
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:35,212
[SPEAKER_24]: So our next step is the table of dimensional requirements.

414
00:44:35,352 --> 00:44:39,457
[SPEAKER_24]: And so these are the changes that we've made to these.

415
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:42,661
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, multifamily MR district is new.

416
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:45,404
[SPEAKER_24]: You see the yellow coming in indicating that's a new

417
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:52,310
[SPEAKER_24]: district in this area, so all of these are very different from Mystic Avenue.

418
00:44:52,951 --> 00:45:00,456
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the blue, again, tailoring these district types, the mixed-use 1, the mixed-use 2, and the commercial for Salem Street.

419
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:02,978
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Paola went over the lot area.

420
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:07,822
[SPEAKER_24]: This was based on our evaluation, our analysis of the lot area in this

421
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:12,606
[SPEAKER_24]: neighborhood, the heights have been reduced.

422
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:18,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Anybody who saw the Mix 1, Mix 2 on Mystic Avenue, that's not applying here.

423
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:23,119
[SPEAKER_24]: We have reduced the heights as Paola suggested or described.

424
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:25,822
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a base height that's allowed as a right.

425
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:35,167
[SPEAKER_24]: that may have a maximum height, and these are for buildings up front on Salem Street, and they require that incentive zoning, which I'm going to show you.

426
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:43,772
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the step back in here that protects Salem Street from having the buildings sort of go straight up.

427
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:47,515
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a little bit of a setback there to make them more human scaled.

428
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's the business incubator coming in.

429
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Here are the new definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood medical office, and medical office.

430
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:05,102
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll note the difference between neighborhood medical office and medical office is that a neighborhood medical office is limited by size.

431
00:46:05,782 --> 00:46:12,023
[SPEAKER_24]: So it shall not exceed 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and is limited by the number of employees.

432
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,004
[SPEAKER_24]: It cannot have more than five employees.

433
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:26,107
[SPEAKER_31]: It's also where the adjacency, the commercial next to residential uses is, this table up here.

434
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:31,649
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it's further down, the adjacencies in the standards actually.

435
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:32,429
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, great.

436
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:32,869
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

437
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:33,109
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

438
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for calling that out.

439
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,270
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to actually swing down that.

440
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:41,872
[SPEAKER_24]: It's coming up in about three sections, but thank you for asking that question.

441
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:45,893
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have, this is the Salem Street now.

442
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:51,874
[SPEAKER_24]: So all of those sections that I just mentioned actually modified other parts of the zoning ordinance.

443
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:57,816
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we're getting into part of the zoning ordinance that establishes the Salem Street Corridor District.

444
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:07,498
[SPEAKER_24]: It has a purpose to it, which is the wider variety of uses and building types to support jobs, economic development near established residential neighborhoods.

445
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:14,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Paola mentioned that we were looking for neighborhood goods and services, neighborhood economic activity.

446
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,661
[SPEAKER_24]: So the idea is this provides options for living within walking distance of jobs, goods and services.

447
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:30,364
[SPEAKER_24]: We want mixed use, multifamily and commercial uses as a density appropriate to the walkable urban corridor, that's Salem Street itself, understanding that that's serving that wider neighborhood.

448
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:43,612
[SPEAKER_24]: And that we're establishing design standards to buffer the neighborhoods from a higher intensity of uses and we want this nice identity that's appropriate for Salem Street that reinforces what's there now.

449
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:49,534
[SPEAKER_24]: The applicability creates the sub-districts that we just described.

450
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:55,719
[SPEAKER_24]: And then this is that question that you asked Madam Chair, dimensional requirements and waivers.

451
00:47:55,799 --> 00:48:02,165
[SPEAKER_24]: That's where we start to refine the dimensional requirements to allow for the setbacks.

452
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:15,231
[SPEAKER_24]: the step-downs, so we have to, this is this first one, the front setback is the one that Pella mentioned where the facade has to be set back to create those wider sidewalks to make it more walkable.

453
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:22,795
[SPEAKER_24]: The side and rear setbacks are required next to an existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units.

454
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:27,877
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to have a landscape buffer or a fence with a landscape buffer on the other side.

455
00:48:29,098 --> 00:48:50,636
[SPEAKER_24]: Here are the height step back requirements, which is that neighborhood context and requires the massing of the building to be reduced closer to a building in any of the residential only districts and that's to allow for light, air, it keeps the existing residential buildings from being dwarfed by new buildings because they have to reduce that massing, reduce that height.

456
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:53,978
[SPEAKER_24]: We require the ground floor active frontage.

457
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:59,920
[SPEAKER_24]: We require some additional transitions to residential districts.

458
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,122
[SPEAKER_24]: We have setbacks for infill lots.

459
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:07,864
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, these are allows the infill building.

460
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:11,785
[SPEAKER_24]: An infill building is a new building on a vacant lot, for example.

461
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:15,987
[SPEAKER_24]: And it allows the infill building to match what's on the other side of it.

462
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,668
[SPEAKER_24]: So we keep the consistency with the neighborhood.

463
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:21,289
[SPEAKER_24]: We have height waivers.

464
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:22,869
[SPEAKER_24]: These are consistent.

465
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:24,350
[SPEAKER_24]: This is the step back waiver.

466
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:38,114
[SPEAKER_24]: So given that diagram, you can see that if you have a step back from Salem Street, and you have a step back from the residential neighborhood, and you might have a step back from another residential, at some point, you can't build a building.

467
00:49:38,514 --> 00:49:46,817
[SPEAKER_24]: And so the waiver allows the Community Development Board to reduce the dimensional requirements of any of the step backs

468
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:53,804
[SPEAKER_24]: but it requires that priority is given to keeping the step backs that reduce the massing next to residential buildings.

469
00:49:54,405 --> 00:50:03,034
[SPEAKER_24]: So in other words, you could reduce maybe the step back on Salem Street, but not the step back next to one of those three-story existing residential.

470
00:50:03,054 --> 00:50:04,856
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to put criteria around that.

471
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:07,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Interested in hearing people's opinions.

472
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,180
[SPEAKER_24]: The next piece is the development incentives.

473
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Paola mentioned this, and I want to stress that this is a menu.

474
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:24,904
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we heard some questions that people thought that maybe they were all stacked on top of each other, so somebody could do them all and get additional height.

475
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:33,587
[SPEAKER_24]: We added language that's in the pink here that says it only goes up to the maximum height that's in that table of dimensional requirements.

476
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:43,332
[SPEAKER_24]: There are a lot of options for achieving that community benefit, but if you're only allowed to have one extra story, you only get to choose one of those options.

477
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,795
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't say, I'm giving you two options, I should get two stories.

478
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:48,976
[SPEAKER_24]: You are limited to that one extra story.

479
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:51,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, the maximum that we have is

480
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:56,899
[SPEAKER_24]: three incentive floors on top of a three-story building to get to six stories.

481
00:50:56,959 --> 00:51:00,660
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is your limitation in this area.

482
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,361
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a six-story building, so it's either four and two or three and two.

483
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:11,262
[SPEAKER_24]: But none of these have changed except for the public parking.

484
00:51:11,823 --> 00:51:13,603
[SPEAKER_24]: We had heard comments

485
00:51:14,143 --> 00:51:18,906
[SPEAKER_24]: throughout the process that Salem Street, that area could use some additional parking.

486
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:21,708
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we've added public parking as a benefit.

487
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:29,412
[SPEAKER_24]: However, you'll see for the shared community, solar and public parking, these are topics we're still working on.

488
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:33,694
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have not set the requirement for the benefit yet.

489
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:37,957
[SPEAKER_24]: We're putting these in here to let people know that these are potential options.

490
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:44,140
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're going to confirm what the requirement would be for the benefit at a later date in the process.

491
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,662
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the design guidelines and applicability of the development standards.

492
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:57,926
[SPEAKER_24]: I do not, the sidewalk width is the only thing that changed from the other ones that we had developed.

493
00:51:58,026 --> 00:51:59,987
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just skimming down to see.

494
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:01,327
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, that was the only change.

495
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:10,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Development standards and design guidelines are used in the site plan approval and the special permit process.

496
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:21,302
[SPEAKER_24]: They are criteria to measure the developer's proposal and require that they meet certain standards or address certain guidelines.

497
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:27,347
[SPEAKER_24]: For anybody who had seen the earlier process, except for that sidewalk width, they should be familiar.

498
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:36,176
[SPEAKER_24]: And with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen and turn it back to Paola just so she can give us a summary of the changes from the original document that we sent you.

499
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:42,082
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we're happy to answer any questions from the board and from the public as appropriate.

500
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:43,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Paola?

501
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:50,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Chair, if I may, I'm going to share again the presentation.

502
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,959
[SPEAKER_17]: You see my screen now?

503
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:11,171
[SPEAKER_31]: Yep, we're viewing the slide with city recommendations.

504
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:18,991
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have five recommendations from the draft, the latest version.

505
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:27,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the first one is, as Emily explained, is to clarify that intent in the introduction of the development incentive bonus.

506
00:53:28,756 --> 00:53:39,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the section of the development incentives, we want to add so that it's clear that it's up to the maximum height under the section.

507
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,570
[SPEAKER_17]: of the table of the mentioned requirements.

508
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,211
[SPEAKER_17]: So the total paragraph will read in as follow.

509
00:53:46,792 --> 00:54:04,298
[SPEAKER_17]: In exchange for incorporating certain provisions that further the city's goal for affordability, economic development, environmental sustainability, climate and climate resiliency, applicants may receive development incentive bonuses that allow for certain development permissions beyond what is allowed as of right.

510
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:11,780
[SPEAKER_17]: up to the maximum height under section 94-4.1 table of dimension requirements.

511
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:19,822
[SPEAKER_17]: These permissions include one or more additional stories up to the maximum numbers of stories allowed in each sub-district.

512
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:25,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Additional stories must comply with any setback, stepback,

513
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:37,765
[SPEAKER_17]: sorry, there is a repetition, or other dimensional requirements and the development and design standards in 94-9.x.6 development standards.

514
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:49,868
[SPEAKER_17]: So, this is the first one, just to clarify, that is up to the maximum height under the section 94-4.1 that is in the table of dimensional requirements.

515
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:56,509
[SPEAKER_17]: The second is about some definitions that we wanted to modify.

516
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:10,753
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to delete the definitions for clinic, hospital, and medical office that we had in the previous with Mystic Avenue district and replacing them with the following definitions.

517
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:16,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So clinic is a clinic as defined in general law point C.111.

518
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:47,409
[SPEAKER_17]: section 52 hospital a hospital as defined in general law c.111 section 52 neighborhood medical office office of a physician dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital as defined in section 94.12.0 definitions the office area shall not exceed 1500 square feet of gross floor area and shall have no more than five employees

519
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:55,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Medical office, office of a physician, dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital is defined in section 94.12.0 definitions.

520
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,144
[SPEAKER_17]: The office area is greater than 1500 square feet and has more than 5 employees.

521
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:16,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that, the third is update the section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, to reflect the proposed definitions.

522
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:21,278
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have text to be removed, is crossed out, and the text to be added is in bold.

523
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:34,241
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have them at the end of the table, we include that neighborhood medical office, which is not allowed in multifamily district, but it is allowed in mixed use 1, 2, and commercial.

524
00:56:34,821 --> 00:56:39,062
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the medical office is not allowed in multifamily.

525
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:47,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have mixed use 1, 2, and commercial as a special permit.

526
00:56:47,624 --> 00:56:50,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the clinic is not allowed in any of the districts.

527
00:56:52,810 --> 00:57:01,896
[SPEAKER_17]: The fourth is to add to the section 94-9.x.3 dimensional requirements and waivers the following.

528
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:11,623
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we add two of those requirements, one requirement, one waiver, which is the height step back requirement.

529
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:15,446
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the text for the diagram that you saw.

530
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:18,588
[SPEAKER_17]: of the context.

531
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:33,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So for any lot within the MX1, MX2 or commercial district that abuts MRGR or apartment 1 district, a height setback is required along the lot line abutting the residential district.

532
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:44,164
[SPEAKER_17]: The height setback is calculated by a 45 degree angle beginning at the third floor and extending to the highest floor of the building in the MX1, MX2 or commercial district.

533
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:50,386
[SPEAKER_17]: The fourth, fifth and sixth floor shall not break the plane of that 45 degree angle.

534
00:57:51,306 --> 00:57:52,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have that a step waiver.

535
00:57:53,147 --> 00:58:13,613
[SPEAKER_17]: If a building is subject to a front step back and rear or side step back, the community development board may waive the strict dimensional requirement of any of the step backs provided that priority is given to retaining the step back, step backs that reduce the massing next to the residential buildings of five or fewer units.

536
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:23,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And last is the update to section 94-3.2, table of use regulations, table A, to remove marijuana as an allowed use.

537
00:58:24,483 --> 00:58:27,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Text to be removed is crossed out, text to be added is in bold.

538
00:58:28,264 --> 00:58:43,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we do is just changing for the MX1 and MX2, the adult marijuana establishment, the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, retail, and independent laboratory, instead of CDB, so a special permit, we change them to no.

539
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:45,889
[SPEAKER_17]: not permitted.

540
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:52,896
[SPEAKER_17]: And those are the changes that we propose and the city recommends.

541
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:02,404
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we will give the Q&A.

542
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:10,532
[SPEAKER_17]: We finished our presentation and we hope for any comments we will be answering them Emily, myself or city staff.

543
00:59:14,395 --> 00:59:14,635
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

544
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:15,456
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Paula.

545
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:16,377
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Emily.

546
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:18,479
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate the thorough presentation.

547
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:28,430
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to open it up to the Community Development Board for comments or questions from our group.

548
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:35,857
[SPEAKER_31]: Following that, we will open the public comment period, just to give a preview of what's next.

549
00:59:37,877 --> 00:59:45,581
[SPEAKER_31]: We have Annie, Peter, Sabrina, Ari, Adam, Ben, myself online from the board.

550
00:59:49,842 --> 00:59:59,950
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll just start with my first takeaway, which is really the alignment with the existing setup of Salem Street.

551
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,452
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that that presents a lot of opportunity.

552
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:17,143
[SPEAKER_31]: As I asked Paola, these non-conforming uses, do they, does that mean that they get kicked out or something bad happens to them?

553
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,891
[SPEAKER_31]: It almost means that they have more opportunity.

554
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:30,036
[SPEAKER_31]: So if they wanted to do something with their site or do something different commercially, they are now allowed by right.

555
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:32,698
[SPEAKER_31]: So I really like that.

556
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:39,544
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it's very considerate of the connections between commercial and residential.

557
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:46,269
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like your thoughts around step back, especially the connection between higher density

558
01:00:50,808 --> 01:00:58,191
[SPEAKER_31]: the housing, and it has some strangely specific questions about this neighborhood medical use.

559
01:01:00,451 --> 01:01:02,232
[SPEAKER_31]: But I can save that.

560
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:05,073
[SPEAKER_31]: It was really just why five employees?

561
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:18,438
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, that feels almost like an arbitrary number, and it feels weird to be regulating the count of employees, as well as questions around

562
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:26,018
[SPEAKER_31]: I think there was a comment that we don't allow neighborhood medical office and multifamily.

563
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:33,702
[SPEAKER_31]: And my first thought was there's people that operate their medical practice out of the first floor of their home.

564
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:46,028
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think that that's common enough to make a big issue of it, but I did just want to recognize that just in case that's a scenario that you all evaluated.

565
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:49,706
[SPEAKER_31]: So yeah, those are some of my initial thoughts.

566
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:59,250
[SPEAKER_31]: But maybe we can do like a round with the board, and then Paula and Emily, if you want to respond, because we might have some of the same concerns.

567
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,451
[SPEAKER_31]: I see Ari, they have their hand up.

568
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:09,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Innes Associates for the very detailed presentation and proposal.

569
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:16,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I live just on the other side of the rotary towards Medford square, so I'm very familiar with this corridor.

570
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:24,548
[SPEAKER_18]: And 1 of the things that I appreciate about it as a resident is that mixture of residential commercial businesses.

571
01:02:25,146 --> 01:02:27,927
[SPEAKER_18]: I can walk down the street and get a sandwich during my lunch break.

572
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:43,094
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that one of the great ironies of the greater Boston area is that many of the structures that we most value and people most like, the townhouses, the triple deckers, are disallowed by our zoning, and we can't build more of them.

573
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:51,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's very smart that we're aligning it to accurately describe what we have and allow for more development like what we already have.

574
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:55,700
[SPEAKER_18]: evidence through living that this is what is working for our community.

575
01:02:57,281 --> 01:03:00,762
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have any particularly detailed questions.

576
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:12,308
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking forward to hearing community feedback, but I think in general the approach here of allowing commercial and mixed zoning makes a lot of sense for this area.

577
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:20,533
[SPEAKER_31]: Adam, I see a hand.

578
01:03:21,249 --> 01:03:23,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to chime in as well.

579
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super helpful, especially in context with the Mystic Avenue zoning.

580
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when I first saw the proposals, my immediate reaction was like, oh Jesus, are we creating Mystic Avenue here?

581
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:58,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really helpful to see the consideration specific for this corridor that even though it might be called the same abbreviation, it's actually not permitting the exact same thing for Mystic Avenue.

582
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:05,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to voice that where coming in, I was like,

583
01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:19,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really trying to up zone this and so it was helpful to get the context of kind of a primary consideration of like, okay, let's, let's match to as much as we can to what's there.

584
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:29,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, um, you know, try to like ease ease into a little bit more density, but not do it in such a jarring way.

585
01:04:29,675 --> 01:04:29,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

586
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:37,786
[SPEAKER_31]: Then Sabrina, Peter, any thoughts?

587
01:04:39,267 --> 01:04:42,389
[SPEAKER_31]: Or Ari, any response to Adam's comment?

588
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:44,370
[SPEAKER_31]: I think you hit the nail on the head.

589
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_31]: We can use the same letters in the table, but we're clarifying that this is specifically for Salem Street.

590
01:04:56,018 --> 01:05:03,483
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that's some nuance that DePaula and Emily, your slides did a good job at differentiating.

591
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:13,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to say that I do appreciate the clarification on the height, because I know that's something that was confusing to people.

592
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:25,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And to understand that it is a hard maximum of six stories anywhere on the corridor, because I think that is something that I had heard concerns about.

593
01:05:25,749 --> 01:05:27,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad to see that that is the case.

594
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:29,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.

595
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:37,092
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm going to do a quick break because we're humans.

596
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:42,934
[SPEAKER_31]: Give Emily and Paula a little bit of time just to pull together some thoughts and responses.

597
01:05:43,474 --> 01:05:47,936
[SPEAKER_31]: But let's all meet back here in, let's say, five minutes.

598
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,206
[SPEAKER_31]: grab a water, bio break.

599
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:52,987
[SPEAKER_31]: And I do see a hand.

600
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:57,930
[SPEAKER_31]: We will be moving into the public comment period after we hear back from Emily and Paola.

601
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:03,433
[SPEAKER_31]: Feel free to raise your hand and we will get to you once we enter that portion of the meeting.

602
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,374
[SPEAKER_31]: Really excited to hear from the public.

603
01:06:05,414 --> 01:06:09,136
[SPEAKER_31]: We've got a great crowd, so should be good.

604
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,457
[SPEAKER_31]: But yep, we will be back in about five minutes.

605
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:19,712
[SPEAKER_27]: Normally, I actually had a comment before, like from the staff before you go to public.

606
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:22,073
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, so I gave Emily a heads up.

607
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:29,835
[SPEAKER_31]: She's going to defer to you and then we're going to hand it back to Emily and Paola for any responses to the board comments and then go into public comment.

608
01:06:32,616 --> 01:06:35,897
[SPEAKER_31]: So, Alicia, if you would like to provide some of that insight.

609
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:37,763
[SPEAKER_27]: Great, thank you.

610
01:06:38,283 --> 01:06:50,655
[SPEAKER_27]: So I did just want to reiterate that we had reviewed and met with the consultants since what originally was went to the CD board in your packet is exactly what went to the city council.

611
01:06:51,376 --> 01:06:59,284
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that is what the city council has to vote on, but they can be voting with amendments and they would vote on amendments that you recommend.

612
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:12,155
[SPEAKER_27]: And so what is this recommendations from the staff are amendments that have come up since it went to city council.

613
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:18,880
[SPEAKER_27]: But there was one that we had discussed and I think maybe there was a little miscommunication.

614
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,642
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I just wanted to mention it, not in that.

615
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:29,067
[SPEAKER_27]: So with the small medical office, the neighborhood medical, one of our thoughts was that

616
01:07:29,928 --> 01:07:57,098
[SPEAKER_27]: we should be looking at limiting the hours from 8 a.m to 7 p.m because we don't want off medical offices and stuff we don't want people in people's neighborhoods next to people's homes coming and going at very early hours or very late hours so like you wouldn't want an urgent care open till midnight next to somebody's house or you wouldn't want them that kind of stuff going on and so that was one of the recommendations was to have

617
01:07:58,418 --> 01:08:00,360
[SPEAKER_27]: and hours of operations.

618
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:12,029
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's also something in a big picture way that we want to be looking at in our zoning across the board is what are the hours of operations and how are they allowed in zoning?

619
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:21,176
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a paragraph in zoning that currently limits hours of operations, but it doesn't apply to medical offices.

620
01:08:22,337 --> 01:08:26,801
[SPEAKER_27]: And it might be different if it was in a strip mall than it is if it was next to someone's home.

621
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:28,185
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

622
01:08:29,766 --> 01:08:35,170
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, thinking about the implementation, the actual use, and the day-to-day clientele.

623
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:37,171
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a good lens to apply to this.

624
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:39,533
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Alicia.

625
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:41,714
[SPEAKER_31]: Emily and Paula?

626
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:48,173
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to respond 1st to that and then to the comments from the board.

627
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,216
[SPEAKER_24]: We agree on hours of operation.

628
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:56,541
[SPEAKER_24]: It was, as I said, as Alicia said, it was a miscommunication that was left off our text.

629
01:08:57,082 --> 01:09:02,107
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're just pulling the correct sentence and we'll have it for you by the end of the meeting.

630
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:07,451
[SPEAKER_24]: or at the appropriate point to discuss it, but we agree that that's an important piece.

631
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:15,096
[SPEAKER_24]: I think you had asked why the difference and again, it goes back to tailoring uses for the neighborhood.

632
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:24,103
[SPEAKER_24]: It is quite common to think about the impact of different uses on a neighborhood in terms of

633
01:09:25,143 --> 01:09:27,525
[SPEAKER_24]: the scale of a business or use.

634
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:47,878
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the issues we had heard coming from the community was something like this, like a business that had clients coming to it, the impact of traffic on it, given that Salem Street is not only a corridor in the sense that it leads from one place to another, right?

635
01:09:47,898 --> 01:09:52,241
[SPEAKER_24]: That's how the comprehensive plan was defining corridors, is that they were important streets.

636
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:57,762
[SPEAKER_24]: that took people from one part of Medford to another part of Medford, but it's also a neighborhood.

637
01:09:57,962 --> 01:10:01,143
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we wanted to think about the scale of certain businesses.

638
01:10:01,683 --> 01:10:03,924
[SPEAKER_24]: This is one that came up.

639
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:12,266
[SPEAKER_24]: The size, the number of employees, the hours of operations are all methods of limiting that scale.

640
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:21,248
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've got a smaller scale, which could be as a right with special site plan review rather, we have a larger scale that could be a special permit and let's just have a higher

641
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:29,070
[SPEAKER_24]: higher level of review before it comes into an area.

642
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:41,175
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to stress, I was delighted to hear the city board members picking up on this idea of tailoring Salem Street to match what's there now.

643
01:10:41,315 --> 01:10:45,297
[SPEAKER_24]: I do want to reinforce that zoning presents options.

644
01:10:45,397 --> 01:10:48,698
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't require somebody to change their property.

645
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:55,081
[SPEAKER_24]: So, a business that's non-conforming now that would have to go through a variance process to invest in it.

646
01:10:55,401 --> 01:11:09,828
[SPEAKER_24]: A homeowner maybe whose current house is on a lot that doesn't meet the minimum lot requirements would also be non-conforming for certain things, might have to go for a variance.

647
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:11,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of our goal was to reduce that.

648
01:11:11,749 --> 01:11:13,590
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't mean the business has to change.

649
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:24,098
[SPEAKER_24]: doesn't mean the homeowner has to do anything, but if they choose to, the pathway is a little bit more clear for them now if the zoning is passed than it would have been otherwise.

650
01:11:25,539 --> 01:11:32,625
[SPEAKER_24]: Zoning changes are about creating those opportunities, and in this case, with the addition of development standards,

651
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:45,715
[SPEAKER_24]: the ability to do design guidelines, it is also about putting appropriate community controls on some of those uses, some of those potential buildings that could come in if people make certain decisions with their property.

652
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:58,466
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just wanted to reinforce that we were trying very hard to respect what Salem Street was while giving the people who live, work, own businesses there now opportunities for the future.

653
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:11,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, one thing as well, we do allow home occupation in multi-residential.

654
01:12:11,852 --> 01:12:29,017
[SPEAKER_17]: So if they have a small business and they want one doctor or something practicing from their home, that is possible in the residential because home occupation in the table of uses,

655
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:30,104
[SPEAKER_17]: is permitted.

656
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,825
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to flag that.

657
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:42,627
[SPEAKER_24]: And with that, we're happy to listen to comments from the public as well.

658
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:46,108
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

659
01:12:47,448 --> 01:12:54,030
[SPEAKER_31]: OK, so I see some hands raised.

660
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:57,831
[SPEAKER_31]: Let me pull my notes back.

661
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:10,550
[SPEAKER_31]: So I will now open, or just real quick, do any other board members have any follow-up questions to what Emily or Paolo said?

662
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:14,693
[SPEAKER_31]: No, okay, and feel free to just throw your hands up or unmute yourself.

663
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:18,897
[SPEAKER_31]: Strong no from Annie, thank you.

664
01:13:21,232 --> 01:13:24,095
[SPEAKER_31]: So I will now open the public comment period.

665
01:13:24,796 --> 01:13:31,362
[SPEAKER_31]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

666
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,506
[SPEAKER_31]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

667
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:39,750
[SPEAKER_31]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

668
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:55,219
[SPEAKER_31]: Reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members outside of technical difficulties to city staff, as it's not part of public record.

669
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,863
[SPEAKER_31]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical issues, message Danielle, message Alicia, and they'll make sure

670
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,749
[SPEAKER_31]: You enter the queue.

671
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:12,156
[SPEAKER_31]: We are limiting speaking to two minutes per person.

672
01:14:13,277 --> 01:14:18,263
[SPEAKER_31]: Part of the reason we do this is, you know, especially for topics like this, we have a lot of people that we want to hear from.

673
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:22,949
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to make sure everybody is heard in an equitable manner.

674
01:14:23,889 --> 01:14:29,412
[SPEAKER_31]: The two-minute limit has worked previously for meetings, so we're going to be using that for this meeting.

675
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:38,796
[SPEAKER_31]: If you have more to add, or you want to respond to others' comments, I encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov.

676
01:14:39,357 --> 01:14:41,337
[SPEAKER_31]: All of those comments get shared with the board.

677
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,679
[SPEAKER_31]: We review them before every meeting.

678
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:47,701
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, those, they don't just go into a black hole.

679
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:52,125
[SPEAKER_31]: So I want to encourage people to also use that email address as well as, you know, speaking up this evening.

680
01:14:53,005 --> 01:15:04,274
[SPEAKER_31]: And this is such a great opportunity to hear directly from the public, because what we at the community development board are tasked with is making recommendations to the city council.

681
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:05,875
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, we can.

682
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:15,895
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, be a little creative and, you know, pass this back to the city council based on the amendments that we propose.

683
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,937
[SPEAKER_31]: So excited to hear what everybody has to say.

684
01:15:18,957 --> 01:15:24,400
[SPEAKER_31]: Alicia is going to help me manage the public comment queue.

685
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,241
[SPEAKER_31]: I think I can manage it okay.

686
01:15:28,382 --> 01:15:33,885
[SPEAKER_31]: But Alicia, do you have any overview for the written comments that have been received?

687
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:36,907
[SPEAKER_31]: Or Danielle?

688
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:42,191
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't prepare a summary today to share that out.

689
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:45,113
[SPEAKER_31]: That's OK.

690
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,774
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been reading them as they've been coming in.

691
01:15:47,494 --> 01:15:51,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, I might share that there are ones that were sent directly to me.

692
01:15:52,038 --> 01:15:55,420
[SPEAKER_27]: I found that there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was in the zoning.

693
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:04,066
[SPEAKER_27]: So I have been trying on a case-by-case basis to reply to residents with sort of more information about what was in them.

694
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:13,771
[SPEAKER_27]: partially because a lot of the concerns were around things that were either not correct or were being changed.

695
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,312
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to reiterate a lot of that.

696
01:16:16,412 --> 01:16:17,132
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure, sure.

697
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:26,796
[SPEAKER_31]: But yeah, the public comment period is a time to provide your feedback, but also ask clarifying questions if there's something that doesn't really click or doesn't make sense.

698
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:30,277
[SPEAKER_31]: So encourage everybody to ask questions as well.

699
01:16:30,357 --> 01:16:32,338
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you, Alisa, for providing

700
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:36,480
[SPEAKER_31]: more updated feedback to the public that sent in questions.

701
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:42,384
[SPEAKER_31]: So I just want to make sure I'm keeping track of everyone.

702
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:52,130
[SPEAKER_31]: So the first public commenter that I see is Carlos Cabreras.

703
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:54,952
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

704
01:16:56,253 --> 01:16:57,373
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address.

705
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:59,094
[SPEAKER_31]: Alicia will start a timer.

706
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:05,006
[SPEAKER_40]: Hi, how are you?

707
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,287
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, my name is Carlos Cabrejas.

708
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:09,807
[SPEAKER_40]: I live at 224 Salem Street.

709
01:17:10,768 --> 01:17:16,409
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you for taking the time for this presentation, especially Paul, that was very thorough.

710
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:27,031
[SPEAKER_40]: So my question is, what is the plan to alleviate the already busy corridor that Salem Street is, you know, bringing all of these

711
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:32,058
[SPEAKER_40]: you know, development, houses, businesses, traffic is only going to get worse.

712
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:38,221
[SPEAKER_40]: What is the plan to make these, to mitigate the, yeah, what I said already, bad traffic that we have?

713
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:39,142
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

714
01:17:43,244 --> 01:17:43,904
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Carlos.

715
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:45,525
[SPEAKER_31]: Appreciate the question.

716
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:58,629
[SPEAKER_31]: And for anybody that hasn't done these before, we typically hear all of the public comment, and then we'll pass it back to Emily and Paola to provide a little bit more insight.

717
01:18:00,731 --> 01:18:04,094
[SPEAKER_31]: And then we as a board will deliberate and go from there.

718
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:08,998
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see is Dave McKenna.

719
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,722
[SPEAKER_31]: Dave, you're going to get a request to unmute.

720
01:18:14,418 --> 01:18:22,582
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, Marielena, I might've accidentally clicked your name, but we're gonna start with Dave.

721
01:18:22,742 --> 01:18:23,663
[SPEAKER_31]: Where did Dave go?

722
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:30,667
[SPEAKER_31]: We might've lost Dave.

723
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:38,791
[SPEAKER_31]: Let me look at the attendee list.

724
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,201
[SPEAKER_27]: I just sent him an unmute.

725
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:45,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, there we go.

726
01:18:46,562 --> 01:18:47,943
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

727
01:18:47,963 --> 01:18:51,624
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for the presentation.

728
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:55,066
[SPEAKER_39]: I am generally supportive.

729
01:18:56,306 --> 01:19:01,969
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, David McKenna to vine street, just a half a block from Salem.

730
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:07,652
[SPEAKER_39]: Generally supportive of the new development because it will increase our tax base, which I think is really important.

731
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:10,693
[SPEAKER_39]: So we can improve city services for all residents.

732
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:18,696
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, and also, uh, really supportive because this will provide just more housing and we are in a housing crisis.

733
01:19:19,136 --> 01:19:23,637
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, multifamily housing, condos and apartments are more affordable than single family.

734
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:32,418
[SPEAKER_39]: So, um, for people looking to downsize or for, um, we'll just have more housing options and I'm excited about that.

735
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:40,040
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, on the incentives, uh, I think it's great that by right, it's just three to four stories, which is what's currently existing.

736
01:19:41,004 --> 01:19:46,990
[SPEAKER_39]: And then if there's an extra community benefit, then the developer could go beyond the three to four stories.

737
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:53,075
[SPEAKER_39]: The affordable housing community benefit seems really important.

738
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:55,738
[SPEAKER_39]: But my favorite one is the pocket parks.

739
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:05,767
[SPEAKER_39]: And I had a question about this because we could really use more green space along Salem, and developers are incentivized to provide a public pocket park.

740
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:15,276
[SPEAKER_39]: If they were to provide maybe the equivalent of two pocket parks or just more larger green space, would they get an additional incentive for that?

741
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:17,277
[SPEAKER_39]: Can they use that incentive maybe twice?

742
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:27,058
[SPEAKER_39]: And the seating, the extra bonus for seating in the park or the fountain, to me, does not really, it's not that valuable.

743
01:20:27,378 --> 01:20:28,399
[SPEAKER_39]: It's the green space.

744
01:20:29,059 --> 01:20:30,399
[SPEAKER_39]: A park should have seating in it.

745
01:20:30,419 --> 01:20:33,520
[SPEAKER_39]: So I think that should just be a requirement of the incentive for the pocket park.

746
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,360
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't really care about the fountain.

747
01:20:38,392 --> 01:20:44,075
[SPEAKER_39]: So any way to increase the amount of green space would be really beneficial.

748
01:20:44,555 --> 01:20:44,855
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

749
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:46,756
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Dave.

750
01:20:50,617 --> 01:20:55,979
[SPEAKER_31]: And as we hear questions, we got a really solid recommendation from city staff.

751
01:20:56,439 --> 01:21:06,723
[SPEAKER_31]: As we hear questions that come up again and again, we may pause to address those throughout this public comment period just to make sure that, you know, we're all kind of working on this together.

752
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:12,050
[SPEAKER_31]: or to offer clarifications.

753
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:17,632
[SPEAKER_31]: Marie-Elena, you're going to get a request to unmute.

754
01:21:17,652 --> 01:21:19,733
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

755
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:24,655
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Marie-Elena Tetchi Bariola, 62 Sheridan Ave.

756
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:28,056
[SPEAKER_32]: I will try to keep it brief because I feel like I have a lot of questions, but I'll keep it to two.

757
01:21:28,996 --> 01:21:30,097
[SPEAKER_32]: One, thank you for the presentation.

758
01:21:31,063 --> 01:21:34,325
[SPEAKER_32]: It's very detailed, but my brain also doesn't work this way.

759
01:21:34,405 --> 01:21:35,885
[SPEAKER_32]: So like, it's a lot to process.

760
01:21:35,905 --> 01:21:44,029
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that's probably true for a lot of people, you know, mix one, mix two, I get really kind of becoming that zoning stuff kind of just like jumbles in my mind.

761
01:21:46,112 --> 01:21:48,835
[SPEAKER_32]: So some additional visuals might be helpful.

762
01:21:48,895 --> 01:21:55,263
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of the slides were helpful, but it would have been really helpful to say, this is what's here now, and this is what we're proposing.

763
01:21:55,283 --> 01:21:58,286
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I think she mentioned it, but I was having a hard time keeping track of it.

764
01:21:59,087 --> 01:21:59,868
[SPEAKER_32]: So that would be helpful.

765
01:21:59,908 --> 01:22:05,595
[SPEAKER_32]: But question wise, I think maybe what a lot of people, or at least myself anyway, is concerned about is,

766
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:20,545
[SPEAKER_32]: Is the definition of the differentiation between medical offices, clinic, medical facility, like on the heels of a methadone clinic being proposed in the area, it seems like, OK, so now they're changing the definitions.

767
01:22:20,985 --> 01:22:27,810
[SPEAKER_32]: So I've been trying to figure out where are the original definitions to compare it to what the new amended ones are.

768
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:29,070
[SPEAKER_32]: So that would be helpful.

769
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:32,093
[SPEAKER_32]: But also, I think it might have been you, actually, that said,

770
01:22:33,576 --> 01:22:38,478
[SPEAKER_32]: You you're not you don't think that like like why should we limit the number of employees in a medical office?

771
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:53,723
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually totally disagree with that I think that we should like I think because then what we're coming up against is Maybe an urgent care or something and you know We just came out of we're in a post-covid world where there were lines in urgent cares like outside And I don't want that in my neighborhood.

772
01:22:53,743 --> 01:22:57,465
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't want you know, whether this happens again or not like that's

773
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:01,668
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, you have people like lining the street to get a COVID test, right?

774
01:23:01,828 --> 01:23:03,489
[SPEAKER_32]: Or, you know, anything like that.

775
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:05,750
[SPEAKER_32]: And even if they open at eight o'clock, people line up at seven, 730.

776
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:12,996
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think that that is a concern, because when you don't limit the number of medical employees, you end up with offices like that.

777
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:16,258
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, where it says just a physician, well, what does that mean?

778
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:18,420
[SPEAKER_32]: Could they actually put them at the clinic if they

779
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,421
[SPEAKER_32]: filed it under something different.

780
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:23,564
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's a major concern and there's my two seconds left.

781
01:23:24,105 --> 01:23:28,449
[SPEAKER_32]: The other concern is like for all these increased housing, what do we do with these students?

782
01:23:28,489 --> 01:23:30,430
[SPEAKER_32]: These schools are so overcrowded right now.

783
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:33,093
[SPEAKER_32]: Like if there are all these kids, what do we do with that?

784
01:23:34,554 --> 01:23:36,636
[SPEAKER_31]: Those are all really great questions and really great points.

785
01:23:36,996 --> 01:23:40,900
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate your insight around the neighborhood medical office.

786
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:50,452
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see is Zachary Chertok.

787
01:23:54,715 --> 01:23:56,657
[SPEAKER_31]: You should be getting a request to unmute.

788
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:58,839
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

789
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:03,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Zachary Chertok at 5 Allmont, right at the corner of Allmont and Salem.

790
01:24:04,264 --> 01:24:06,565
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a list of questions, but the technical ones I'll email.

791
01:24:06,605 --> 01:24:07,766
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to worry about that now.

792
01:24:07,786 --> 01:24:12,088
[SPEAKER_23]: I also apologize that my lighting makes me look like I'm going to say a soliloquy here.

793
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:17,091
[SPEAKER_23]: And Danielle, I also apologize for speaking through the chat.

794
01:24:17,151 --> 01:24:18,992
[SPEAKER_23]: I forgot about the discernment in public records.

795
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:20,813
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you for pointing that out.

796
01:24:21,734 --> 01:24:27,977
[SPEAKER_23]: The two questions that I think could be generally answered here, one is, and this might have been stated, so it's more a point of clarification, is

797
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:48,853
[SPEAKER_23]: When buildings that are nonconforming seek to change the exterior of their building, when I've consulted and are advised on projects in other cities around this, including Boston and Providence around economic development, those buildings would require to go through a variance for continued approval and expansion of the building and its current use.

798
01:24:50,195 --> 01:25:01,256
[SPEAKER_23]: Will that be part of the variance process, or in terms of your efforts to streamline the language and verbiage around your variance requirements, is that expected to be relaxed?

799
01:25:02,146 --> 01:25:04,548
[SPEAKER_23]: The second one is for the IZ extensions to scale.

800
01:25:05,868 --> 01:25:12,413
[SPEAKER_23]: Can the menu of options that are going to be provided for those IZs be published a little bit more clear and front and center?

801
01:25:13,793 --> 01:25:24,380
[SPEAKER_23]: And can we be given notification around when it's solidified and what those are, as well as what the proximity to any proposed construction would be, what the requirements in terms of distance from them are?

802
01:25:25,341 --> 01:25:31,345
[SPEAKER_23]: I've worked in places where you can offer a park to the city in exchange for an exemption versus it having to be feet from the building.

803
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:36,306
[SPEAKER_23]: So distance designations would be preferred.

804
01:25:36,406 --> 01:26:00,412
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I'll echo the transportation concerns, especially since three boundary points around the zone are controlled by state agencies with land owned not by the city, including the I-93 Rotary, the Fellsway West, and the intersection at the Fellsway West and Salem Street, with a traffic signal that has been horribly unmistimed with the Fellsway East signal for some time, been trying to reach DCR for years.

805
01:26:01,552 --> 01:26:25,244
[SPEAKER_23]: um and um and you know it just needs there needs to be a stronger partnership for that and it's sorry i know i'm over but that's not just a quarter it's a designated trucking route a state route overlay for route 60 as well okay this is all really helpful insight and it sounds like you have some really solid experience so thank you for sharing that with with us this evening

806
01:26:29,835 --> 01:26:32,919
[SPEAKER_31]: I see Patricia as the next public commenter.

807
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:41,369
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

808
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,673
[SPEAKER_31]: And please state your name and address for the record, please.

809
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:46,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Patricia Ciappelli.

810
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:49,200
[SPEAKER_07]: 53 Garfield Avenue.

811
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:56,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to make sure that the Community Development Board got our legal letter from a group of neighbors this evening.

812
01:26:57,589 --> 01:27:03,275
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 837 people that have voted no for this corridor expansion.

813
01:27:04,357 --> 01:27:10,442
[SPEAKER_07]: No one has been included in any community involvement questions.

814
01:27:10,723 --> 01:27:14,886
[SPEAKER_07]: All we hear is, we think you need, we've decided.

815
01:27:15,287 --> 01:27:17,308
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the voters and the taxpayers?

816
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:24,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel confident in the next week, we will have over a thousand people in this neighborhood that do not want this corridor.

817
01:27:25,275 --> 01:27:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a social justice neighborhood, as our legal letter imply, who have done nothing to offer any kind of, there's language barriers, nothing has been done in another language, nothing has been done regarding a reverse 911 call.

818
01:27:45,137 --> 01:27:52,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's despicable the way this has been hidden from the neighbors and the constituents in this neighborhood.

819
01:27:52,642 --> 01:28:02,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Salem Street, if you would even bother to come over here at six o'clock in the morning and six o'clock at night, you would see bumper to bumper traffic.

820
01:28:03,048 --> 01:28:05,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is all of this rezoning.

821
01:28:05,589 --> 01:28:10,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just too much, too fast, too big, too dense.

822
01:28:11,032 --> 01:28:17,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not what this neighborhood needs and nothing that the voters, the homeowners and the taxpayers want.

823
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:26,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all know that, you know, you have to do something to expand some of the living.

824
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,381
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is ridiculous.

825
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not taking into concern the neighborhood at all.

826
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are prepared to take legal action.

827
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:36,668
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate that.

828
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:41,290
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hear your concerns about the notice and the way it's been communicated.

829
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:45,472
[SPEAKER_31]: So maybe that's something we can dig into a little bit just to find out more.

830
01:28:45,532 --> 01:28:46,893
[SPEAKER_31]: But thank you so much, Patricia.

831
01:28:46,913 --> 01:28:49,054
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate you commenting.

832
01:28:52,516 --> 01:28:54,336
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is Jane.

833
01:28:54,677 --> 01:28:57,358
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute, Jane Marcus.

834
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:02,829
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

835
01:29:02,849 --> 01:29:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Jane Marcus.

836
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 65 Tainter Street.

837
01:29:08,933 --> 01:29:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I live around the corner from the Roberts Elementary School.

838
01:29:13,136 --> 01:29:22,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And from my perspective, this plan is about a corridor, but it really should be about the Roberts Elementary School neighborhood.

839
01:29:23,603 --> 01:29:30,610
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the epicenter of the proposed density directly abutting the Roberts Elementary School.

840
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:41,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are so many of these businesses that I find inappropriate to put next to an elementary school with first graders and second graders walking to school.

841
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want them walking by methadone clinics where there are addicts.

842
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:48,126
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want them walking past a brewery.

843
01:29:48,486 --> 01:29:50,988
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want them walking past a winery.

844
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:56,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super glad to see all the marijuana businesses have been removed from the plan.

845
01:29:56,431 --> 01:29:57,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that.

846
01:29:57,932 --> 01:29:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried about that as well.

847
01:30:00,214 --> 01:30:07,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I also feel that there's an opportunity here with some of these zoning decisions to have mental health, rehab,

848
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:19,583
[SPEAKER_04]: halfway houses, homeless shelters and churches, other things that are wonderful for the community, but not next to a school.

849
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:28,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want school children to be worried on their way to school about an addict or a drunk that they're going to encounter on the way to school.

850
01:30:29,345 --> 01:30:35,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the kids to walk to school with joy and with the promise of learning something.

851
01:30:35,707 --> 01:30:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel if we have educational facilities that are likely to be halfway houses or something else, those are not appropriate.

852
01:30:45,374 --> 01:30:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Private clubs that serve alcohol, not appropriate.

853
01:30:49,597 --> 01:30:56,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Any kind of facility which is going to have temporary visitors, such as a hotel,

854
01:30:57,242 --> 01:31:03,366
[SPEAKER_04]: may have sex offenders who are in the hotel for weeks or months under the radar.

855
01:31:03,726 --> 01:31:12,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And we won't even know that there are sex offenders watching our children to see who the lonely and the vulnerable ones on the playground might be.

856
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ask the board, please consider this from the viewpoint that this is next to an elementary school.

857
01:31:20,217 --> 01:31:21,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will really thank you for that.

858
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:27,134
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I hear your concerns about the uses that are proximate to the elementary school.

859
01:31:27,234 --> 01:31:31,277
[SPEAKER_31]: So maybe that's something we can dig a little bit deeper and share more information.

860
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:32,798
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Jane.

861
01:31:32,818 --> 01:31:35,120
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate your questions and your comments.

862
01:31:38,883 --> 01:31:44,087
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see is Cheryl R. You're going to get a request to unmute.

863
01:31:45,728 --> 01:31:48,210
[SPEAKER_31]: And please state your name and address for the record, please.

864
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:52,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

865
01:31:52,153 --> 01:31:56,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 281 Park Street, which is the epicenter of the neighborhood node.

866
01:31:57,055 --> 01:32:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Park Street currently gets about 2,000 cars per day, and Salem Street, according to the 2022 study, was at 18,000 a day.

867
01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:13,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to note that this presentation doesn't match the zoning that is uploaded, so you are voting on whether or not you are recommending the pot.

868
01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:14,022
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not gone.

869
01:32:14,423 --> 01:32:16,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone through three versions and was not removed.

870
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:20,126
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning is not informed by any studies.

871
01:32:20,806 --> 01:32:30,073
[SPEAKER_05]: How we came to the point that we're reducing lot size by 70% to 3,000 square feet for a six-story building is extreme.

872
01:32:30,413 --> 01:32:33,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The incentives are so easy to max out height.

873
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:37,138
[SPEAKER_05]: A bench, a fountain will get you to six feet and a heartbeat.

874
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And why is the narrowest, busiest section, Park and Salem, a node for intense

875
01:32:43,862 --> 01:32:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: zoning, which is their words.

876
01:32:45,683 --> 01:32:48,385
[SPEAKER_05]: How are the desirable uses chosen?

877
01:32:48,725 --> 01:33:02,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Dorms, which Rocco DiRico at Tufts says he doesn't want, and informed the city that he didn't want them, and just wants to build on his own land, but they're still offering dorms, or offering shelters, or offering hotels.

878
01:33:03,274 --> 01:33:07,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you're getting away from the methadone dispensary with the way that we're wording things.

879
01:33:08,357 --> 01:33:12,880
[SPEAKER_05]: The research and testing labs, the dog daycare has no ordinance written yet.

880
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:21,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't want a poorly staffed methadone clinic opening because they're trying to squeeze in to some niche employee count.

881
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are the special permits for pot growing, processing, retails, and labs, whoever thought that was appropriate?

882
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:41,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are we allowing a five-foot buffer with an eight-foot fence to shield a single-family home from a six-story building plus mechanicals, which according to state law can go up to 150% of the original height?

883
01:33:45,082 --> 01:33:47,222
[SPEAKER_05]: The comprehensive plan called for studies.

884
01:33:47,442 --> 01:33:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It called for strategies to avoid displacement of the environmental justice neighborhoods.

885
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all we're seeing here.

886
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:56,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning should be informed by facts.

887
01:33:56,444 --> 01:33:58,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The community should have been involved.

888
01:33:58,604 --> 01:34:02,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alicia said the zoning was based on developers wants to build.

889
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:09,566
[SPEAKER_05]: There's at least one demo permit already on the table in the red zone and the hole in the ground will be back for his six stories.

890
01:34:09,586 --> 01:34:13,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And he told your board before that the city said he could build more.

891
01:34:13,627 --> 01:34:16,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Profits should not be more important than the people that live here.

892
01:34:16,378 --> 01:34:16,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

893
01:34:19,703 --> 01:34:20,383
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Cheryl.

894
01:34:20,683 --> 01:34:22,064
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate your comments.

895
01:34:23,544 --> 01:34:33,668
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot there between the traffic, you have some feedback, like, you know, are the many options really commensurate with what's being delivered?

896
01:34:34,668 --> 01:34:43,371
[SPEAKER_31]: Some questions about the uses, and then I'm curious about this mechanical percentage, so maybe we can address that at some point.

897
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,192
[SPEAKER_31]: But thank you so much, Cheryl.

898
01:34:46,312 --> 01:34:47,673
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate your comments.

899
01:34:50,599 --> 01:34:56,222
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter I see is Klein170172.

900
01:34:57,362 --> 01:35:01,484
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute shortly, and please state your name and address for the record.

901
01:35:01,504 --> 01:35:08,868
[SPEAKER_31]: And if there's two people with you and you would both like a two-minute comment period, we can do that.

902
01:35:09,828 --> 01:35:12,510
[SPEAKER_31]: But if you just want to be combined, that's also acceptable.

903
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:14,922
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine, I'll just be myself.

904
01:35:16,362 --> 01:35:17,402
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ralph Klein.

905
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:21,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I own and reside at 172 Park Street.

906
01:35:21,864 --> 01:35:25,225
[SPEAKER_00]: My family also resides at 170, my sister Ruth.

907
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:35,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're on the fifth house down, fifth property down on Park Street, on the opposite side of the Roberts from Salem.

908
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:41,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Their proposal has three of the four properties barely conform.

909
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:45,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at this.

910
01:35:45,038 --> 01:35:46,138
[SPEAKER_00]: 184 has 2,065.

911
01:35:46,178 --> 01:35:46,418
[SPEAKER_00]: 182 has 2,265 feet.

912
01:35:46,438 --> 01:35:47,019
[SPEAKER_00]: The next property has 3,000.

913
01:35:47,339 --> 01:35:50,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next piece of property has 3,500.

914
01:35:50,081 --> 01:35:51,161
[SPEAKER_00]: The combined frontage of this is 165 feet.

915
01:35:51,181 --> 01:35:55,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And from Salem Street to my property line is approximately 130 to 140 feet.

916
01:36:13,332 --> 01:36:22,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have a six-story building running the length of my property with these non-conforming properties that don't even make the limit, but they're in the red zone.

917
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:25,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the parking.

918
01:36:26,183 --> 01:36:38,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they put the condominiums on Salem Street, on Court Street, across from JRA Cycles, Park Street has become the dumping ground for all the vehicles that can't park there.

919
01:36:38,972 --> 01:36:51,320
[SPEAKER_00]: for the part of building on the opposite side, JRA Cycles, there's five cars that come down here every day, park their vehicle, take their bicycle off, and ride it to JRA Cycles around the corner.

920
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:54,883
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think I'm kidding, come down Park Street and look at it.

921
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:59,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I cross Salem Street every day at least twice.

922
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:02,446
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandkids go to the Roberts Junior High School.

923
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:04,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Traffic is horrible.

924
01:37:04,586 --> 01:37:07,548
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not listen to the crossing guards.

925
01:37:08,108 --> 01:37:10,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I've almost gotten hit twice with a crossing guard there.

926
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:14,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to propose more buildings there?

927
01:37:15,991 --> 01:37:16,911
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ridiculous.

928
01:37:17,772 --> 01:37:18,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

929
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:20,033
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Raul.

930
01:37:20,174 --> 01:37:27,919
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear your concerns about the parking and the traffic and also kind of the lot areas and frontages for some specific properties.

931
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,001
[SPEAKER_31]: So those will be important things for us to address.

932
01:37:37,146 --> 01:37:39,988
[SPEAKER_31]: The next commenter that I see is Julissa.

933
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:41,809
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

934
01:37:41,929 --> 01:37:44,071
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

935
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:44,131
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi.

936
01:37:57,434 --> 01:37:59,915
[SPEAKER_31]: Jalissa, if you're speaking, we can't hear you, unfortunately.

937
01:37:59,935 --> 01:38:12,559
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to send them a quick message.

938
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,161
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, Alicia or Danielle, can you send a message to them?

939
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:19,702
[SPEAKER_31]: We may have to come back to them.

940
01:38:24,812 --> 01:38:26,633
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, Julissa, we're gonna come back to you.

941
01:38:27,894 --> 01:38:28,855
[SPEAKER_31]: We have your name written down.

942
01:38:28,915 --> 01:38:34,338
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll come back to you right after our next public commenter and see if we can resolve our technical issues.

943
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:42,143
[SPEAKER_31]: If not, we'll share the Medford Community Development Board email address with you and make sure that we get your insight.

944
01:38:43,064 --> 01:38:45,666
[SPEAKER_31]: So the next public commenter that I see is Doreen.

945
01:38:46,406 --> 01:38:48,407
[SPEAKER_31]: Doreen, you're gonna get a request to unmute.

946
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:51,790
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

947
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:55,339
[SPEAKER_34]: It's Doreen O'Hare, Malden Street.

948
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:00,184
[SPEAKER_34]: I want you to know I'm opposed to this.

949
01:39:00,284 --> 01:39:03,508
[SPEAKER_34]: The traffic on Salem Street is insane right now.

950
01:39:03,989 --> 01:39:07,873
[SPEAKER_34]: Just trying to get down that street will take you 25 minutes to a half an hour.

951
01:39:09,054 --> 01:39:15,759
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, so it's already, I don't know what kind of study was done to see the traffic repercussions if this were to be implemented.

952
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:19,482
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, I'm also concerned about the first responders.

953
01:39:19,762 --> 01:39:34,092
[SPEAKER_34]: If everyone decides to follow this new zoning and we have both sides of Salem Street with six stories or whatever is allowed, how is that going to impact not only our schools, but the first responders that have to get to those schools?

954
01:39:37,695 --> 01:39:38,015
[SPEAKER_34]: That's all.

955
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:45,117
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm hearing traffic first responders impact schools.

956
01:39:45,658 --> 01:39:45,878
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

957
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:49,002
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, it takes so long to get down that road.

958
01:39:49,082 --> 01:39:57,673
[SPEAKER_34]: And honestly, if think about the DPW to if both sides of the street are six feet high, it's going to impact how the snow melts.

959
01:39:58,394 --> 01:39:59,274
[SPEAKER_34]: you know, everything.

960
01:39:59,414 --> 01:40:04,275
[SPEAKER_34]: So definitely it needs to be more thoughtful in the process.

961
01:40:04,335 --> 01:40:06,436
[SPEAKER_34]: I think there's way too many factors.

962
01:40:07,256 --> 01:40:14,258
[SPEAKER_34]: And you were talking about the hours of different, you know, in the mixed use zones, um, or commercial zones for that matter.

963
01:40:14,658 --> 01:40:24,860
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, you talk about, you don't want a medical office to say past seven, but what if you have a regular commercial business open till nine, 10 o'clock at night, um, those people are parking somewhere.

964
01:40:26,108 --> 01:40:29,211
[SPEAKER_34]: And we have, you know, residents that's trying to park their cars.

965
01:40:31,273 --> 01:40:31,914
[SPEAKER_34]: That's all I have.

966
01:40:31,974 --> 01:40:32,334
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

967
01:40:33,335 --> 01:40:33,976
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Doreen.

968
01:40:35,597 --> 01:40:41,022
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I think, you know, hours for other uses may be something that we can provide some recommendations around.

969
01:40:43,244 --> 01:40:51,332
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, Julissa, I am going to send you another request to unmute.

970
01:40:57,619 --> 01:40:57,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello.

971
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:57,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

972
01:40:58,381 --> 01:40:59,465
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you hear me?

973
01:40:59,545 --> 01:40:59,806
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

974
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:00,107
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

975
01:41:00,649 --> 01:41:01,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for your patience.

976
01:41:01,812 --> 01:41:03,016
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a little troubleshooting there.

977
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:04,282
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for your patience.

978
01:41:04,322 --> 01:41:05,023
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate it.

979
01:41:05,183 --> 01:41:06,684
[SPEAKER_31]: No problem.

980
01:41:06,704 --> 01:41:07,284
[SPEAKER_31]: For the record.

981
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:08,464
[SPEAKER_20]: No problem.

982
01:41:08,484 --> 01:41:09,805
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Julissa Almendarez.

983
01:41:10,645 --> 01:41:14,847
[SPEAKER_20]: I live with my mother, Maria Rodriguez, at 174 Park Street.

984
01:41:15,768 --> 01:41:20,330
[SPEAKER_20]: My friend Jeff is also here, who's been overhearing, you know, the whole presentation.

985
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:22,151
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for that.

986
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:28,314
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess the question we have, and I'll have my friend Jeff speak, you can explain a little bit better, is this.

987
01:41:30,559 --> 01:41:32,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi folks, just a quick question.

988
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:39,901
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 174 Park Street, we're currently zoned apartment one, and it's changing to mixed two, commercial mixed two.

989
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:45,443
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a house behind a house, so we're kind of the second tier behind the frontage.

990
01:41:46,303 --> 01:41:52,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is, for the homeowners here, will they now become nonconforming?

991
01:41:52,184 --> 01:41:54,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's a single family detached home.

992
01:41:55,485 --> 01:42:05,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it changes to mix two, commercial mix two, are they limited in their ability to sell to another residential use down the road?

993
01:42:11,988 --> 01:42:17,549
[SPEAKER_31]: We can answer that question later, but you have about a minute left if you have any other comments, feedback.

994
01:42:17,569 --> 01:42:19,090
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's a great question.

995
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:20,510
[SPEAKER_31]: I used to live in our unit, so.

996
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:38,759
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as, I feel like the other, you know, the other public members have pretty much addressed kind of like similar concerns like traffic, you know, what kind of businesses, you know, are being allowed if they're like appropriate, because we do live next to the school.

997
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:47,345
[SPEAKER_20]: And then yeah, as far as like, you know, what the building heights are, you know, considering

998
01:42:48,045 --> 01:42:53,791
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, what we have around here with these homes, if we have like a, you know, a big eyesore.

999
01:42:55,233 --> 01:42:59,878
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think everybody else has pretty much explained it a little bit better than, you know, than that.

1000
01:43:00,098 --> 01:43:02,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's pretty much in the same plane as everybody else.

1001
01:43:03,763 --> 01:43:04,844
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I think you did a great job.

1002
01:43:05,284 --> 01:43:07,927
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you so much, Julissa and Jeff, for your comments.

1003
01:43:08,007 --> 01:43:08,488
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate it.

1004
01:43:08,508 --> 01:43:08,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1005
01:43:08,828 --> 01:43:09,549
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1006
01:43:12,842 --> 01:43:15,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is Melanie.

1007
01:43:16,144 --> 01:43:20,567
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.

1008
01:43:25,309 --> 01:43:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is Melanie Tringali calling from 116 Forest Street, but I do own a property at 178 Park Street as well.

1009
01:43:34,094 --> 01:43:37,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic.

1010
01:43:37,997 --> 01:43:39,878
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there was a traffic study done at all.

1011
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:47,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new.

1012
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:52,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Properties apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them.

1013
01:43:52,386 --> 01:43:58,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well.

1014
01:43:58,312 --> 01:44:00,293
[SPEAKER_14]: How does this impact our water our sewer?

1015
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:07,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts.

1016
01:44:07,613 --> 01:44:12,315
[SPEAKER_14]: I know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating.

1017
01:44:12,335 --> 01:44:18,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school.

1018
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:23,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand why that was even considered to have.

1019
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:29,826
[SPEAKER_14]: commercial zoning at up to six stories next to a public school.

1020
01:44:30,486 --> 01:44:36,953
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous.

1021
01:44:37,033 --> 01:44:42,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school.

1022
01:44:45,382 --> 01:44:51,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns.

1023
01:44:52,167 --> 01:45:05,117
[SPEAKER_14]: The only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business.

1024
01:45:05,157 --> 01:45:09,280
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into

1025
01:45:12,292 --> 01:45:17,318
[SPEAKER_14]: reality, there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right?

1026
01:45:17,418 --> 01:45:27,590
[SPEAKER_14]: If they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of

1027
01:45:30,084 --> 01:45:31,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Availability to make more money.

1028
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:35,209
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced.

1029
01:45:35,889 --> 01:45:37,030
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all I have.

1030
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:38,832
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a great point.

1031
01:45:39,452 --> 01:45:41,594
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I mean, not not every business owns their space.

1032
01:45:42,134 --> 01:45:43,215
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think a lot of them do.

1033
01:45:43,436 --> 01:45:46,058
[SPEAKER_31]: I think how can we, you know, support those businesses.

1034
01:45:46,854 --> 01:46:02,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Matter of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.

1035
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:05,791
[SPEAKER_31]: That's helpful to know.

1036
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:06,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Melanie.

1037
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:07,432
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate it.

1038
01:46:07,972 --> 01:46:08,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1039
01:46:08,173 --> 01:46:08,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1040
01:46:12,628 --> 01:46:17,249
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, the next public commenter that we have is Navare.

1041
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,190
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1042
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:22,691
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1043
01:46:24,412 --> 01:46:27,893
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello, William Navare, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

1044
01:46:29,821 --> 01:46:33,204
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, I basically support the zoning because Medford isn't full.

1045
01:46:33,404 --> 01:46:34,564
[SPEAKER_38]: We have room for more people.

1046
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:47,413
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, I wanted to ask one specific question and basically that is have the, uh, consultants, you know, carefully, uh, studied and analyzed the, uh, cost in terms of construction of the set step backs.

1047
01:46:48,274 --> 01:46:51,676
[SPEAKER_38]: I know that they had that in Somerville step backs.

1048
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:55,519
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if I misspoke and said setbacks, but step backs is what I'm referring to.

1049
01:46:55,539 --> 01:46:56,880
[SPEAKER_38]: And, um.

1050
01:46:58,755 --> 01:47:11,546
[SPEAKER_38]: And, and, you know, carefully considering the cost of those I know Somerville had those at one point they might have had to modify that I didn't get a chance to look into all the details, but you know just in terms of if somebody knows about the development cost of that.

1051
01:47:12,607 --> 01:47:20,054
[SPEAKER_38]: And if, if that's going to render a lot of development, unfeasible I would suggest that the board consider suggesting that the.

1052
01:47:20,614 --> 01:47:33,458
[SPEAKER_38]: you know, that it'd be made optional and that instead you could provide a bigger conventional setback, move the building further from the street and then it can just go straight up because it's already further from the street, maybe that's where the pocket park goes.

1053
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:36,860
[SPEAKER_38]: Just an example based on

1054
01:47:39,048 --> 01:47:46,150
[SPEAKER_38]: what you folks find when you look at whether or not this is gonna be financially feasible to build the set, sorry, step backs.

1055
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:49,831
[SPEAKER_38]: You can do the step back, that's expensive, is my understanding.

1056
01:47:49,871 --> 01:47:53,612
[SPEAKER_38]: But I'm interested to know what everybody's figured out when they've looked into that.

1057
01:47:53,692 --> 01:47:54,013
[SPEAKER_38]: Thanks.

1058
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:58,954
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, William, I like your focus on the real implementation of this.

1059
01:47:59,854 --> 01:48:02,475
[SPEAKER_31]: We can definitely get some more insight on that.

1060
01:48:02,595 --> 01:48:02,975
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1061
01:48:05,236 --> 01:48:08,037
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that we have is Claudia F.

1062
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:14,094
[SPEAKER_31]: Claudia, you're going to get a request to unmute and please state your name and address for the record, please.

1063
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:20,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening, Claudia Fennelly, 36 Farrigan Ave.

1064
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:32,184
[SPEAKER_28]: I've listened tonight to the proposal and there's no way in my mind that you can possibly do any of this without widening Salem Street or taking away all street parking.

1065
01:48:32,224 --> 01:48:38,045
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a, now you're going to expand the sidewalks to 12 feet wide on both sides.

1066
01:48:38,425 --> 01:48:42,806
[SPEAKER_28]: You're going to have a talk of a possible designated single bus lane.

1067
01:48:43,586 --> 01:48:46,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Then you have bicycle lane.

1068
01:48:46,508 --> 01:48:48,970
[SPEAKER_28]: Then you have two-lane traffic.

1069
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:54,633
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you do widen the street, how much are you going into the neighborhoods?

1070
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:56,114
[SPEAKER_28]: And how will this exist?

1071
01:48:56,475 --> 01:49:04,060
[SPEAKER_28]: How will this impact the existing non-compliant businesses that have no place to go back to?

1072
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,421
[SPEAKER_28]: For example, the historical building on

1073
01:49:07,862 --> 01:49:28,752
[SPEAKER_28]: Park and Salem Street is a perfect example or even the fire station that just the city's invested all that money and re renovating so I just can't get there from here given your proposal the Comprehensiveness which brings me to the next point We're not London

1074
01:49:29,692 --> 01:49:39,801
[SPEAKER_28]: So I, and I stress that only because I did look up the firm that did this, and I don't know if they're affiliated with it, but we're not London.

1075
01:49:40,301 --> 01:49:54,153
[SPEAKER_28]: We're, you know, City of Medford, a small city relatively, and it's a very, very ambitious, designated, busy, very condensed area based on their proposal.

1076
01:49:55,034 --> 01:49:56,455
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't know how these,

1077
01:49:57,216 --> 01:50:21,169
[SPEAKER_28]: Salem Street versus other areas in Medford were selected to be just built up with 10-story high hotels, but it seems a bit unfair to the people of Salem Street in the neighborhood comparatively to other neighborhoods which don't have aggressive planning.

1078
01:50:21,289 --> 01:50:21,889
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

1079
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,370
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1080
01:50:24,271 --> 01:50:25,431
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, thank you, Claudia.

1081
01:50:25,592 --> 01:50:37,776
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate your thoughts on the street section, like how everything kind of goes together, as well as making sure that the work that's being proposed is contextual and appropriate.

1082
01:50:38,236 --> 01:50:38,856
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not London.

1083
01:50:40,577 --> 01:50:41,698
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a reason we live in Medford.

1084
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:42,438
[SPEAKER_31]: We love Medford.

1085
01:50:42,858 --> 01:50:44,098
[SPEAKER_31]: If we left London, we'd be there.

1086
01:50:47,241 --> 01:50:50,626
[SPEAKER_31]: And yeah, I appreciate your question in terms of the selection process.

1087
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:55,793
[SPEAKER_31]: So maybe we can provide some more insight into that process.

1088
01:50:56,995 --> 01:51:02,122
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, maybe you could readjust things so it'd be more appropriately distributed across the city.

1089
01:51:04,106 --> 01:51:18,097
[SPEAKER_28]: If you are required by any state obligation to meet housing needs, appropriately distribute it so that you don't really make it impossible and a safety hazard to the people that live in this area.

1090
01:51:22,461 --> 01:51:30,567
[SPEAKER_31]: And then just a quick point of clarification on the type of land that zoning applies to.

1091
01:51:34,365 --> 01:51:41,148
[SPEAKER_31]: Zoning only regulates the private land, so it wouldn't regulate the streets themselves.

1092
01:51:42,288 --> 01:51:46,570
[SPEAKER_31]: But we can dig more into some of those nuances, but just want to kind of put that out there.

1093
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:54,413
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it looked like on one of the design proposals that you extended back into the streets, the houses.

1094
01:51:55,233 --> 01:51:56,234
[SPEAKER_31]: So we'll clarify.

1095
01:51:56,254 --> 01:51:59,996
[SPEAKER_31]: At this time, we do need to move on to a different public commenter.

1096
01:52:00,016 --> 01:52:03,839
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll do our best to address that.

1097
01:52:03,939 --> 01:52:10,363
[SPEAKER_31]: And then if not, let's continue the dialogue via email or potential future public comment periods.

1098
01:52:10,664 --> 01:52:11,644
[SPEAKER_31]: But thank you so much, Claudia.

1099
01:52:11,744 --> 01:52:12,885
[SPEAKER_31]: Really appreciate your thoughts.

1100
01:52:13,385 --> 01:52:13,606
Thank you.

1101
01:52:15,747 --> 01:52:18,549
[SPEAKER_31]: The next commenter we have is Lori.

1102
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:21,411
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1103
01:52:21,791 --> 01:52:24,293
[SPEAKER_31]: And please state your name and address for the record, please.

1104
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:29,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Laurie Spinney Flagg, 55 Garfield Avenue.

1105
01:52:30,471 --> 01:52:33,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I am opposed to this proposal.

1106
01:52:34,453 --> 01:52:48,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, if you look at your maps, I am the second house in from Garfield, which means, and the house directly beside me has been abandoned for the past five years after being built.

1107
01:52:49,377 --> 01:52:51,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody's in that house.

1108
01:52:51,718 --> 01:52:54,799
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if they're hanging on for these

1109
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:02,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they have some insider knowledge that you are planning to do this, but that leaves my home subject to

1110
01:53:04,722 --> 01:53:15,032
[SPEAKER_12]: two pieces in which I will have no, I don't care if you put a little diagonal on it or not, it is going to tower over my home.

1111
01:53:15,052 --> 01:53:24,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I was extremely happy when the house next door to me went up a floor because it made it more consistent with the neighborhood.

1112
01:53:26,142 --> 01:53:38,030
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to tell you, I bought this house 27 years ago and the traffic on Salem Street has only increased year after year after year.

1113
01:53:39,671 --> 01:53:41,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to take public transportation.

1114
01:53:42,012 --> 01:53:46,475
[SPEAKER_12]: The express bus used to be across the street that has been discontinued.

1115
01:53:47,075 --> 01:53:51,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not seen buses going to Malden Station, but very rarely.

1116
01:53:53,544 --> 01:54:04,626
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know how much you are really digging into what's going on on Salem Street, but as others have mentioned, there's a huge parking issue.

1117
01:54:05,126 --> 01:54:07,547
[SPEAKER_12]: What about water, trash pickup?

1118
01:54:07,987 --> 01:54:11,407
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the historical integrity of this area?

1119
01:54:11,987 --> 01:54:16,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you have homes that, my house was built in the 1890s.

1120
01:54:17,468 --> 01:54:19,989
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, and we've been trying to

1121
01:54:21,475 --> 01:54:31,635
[SPEAKER_12]: rebuild over the course of the years that we've been here, what's going to happen to our property values when you bring all these new people into this section of the city?

1122
01:54:35,108 --> 01:54:36,970
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I appreciate those concerns, Lori.

1123
01:54:36,990 --> 01:54:43,558
[SPEAKER_31]: Sounds like you're, I think we're like 10th thing at this point, concerns about traffic.

1124
01:54:44,959 --> 01:54:49,384
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe you have a specific parcel that you're concerned about.

1125
01:54:50,105 --> 01:54:51,727
[SPEAKER_31]: So I really appreciate your insight.

1126
01:54:51,767 --> 01:54:55,712
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much for joining the public comment and sharing your thoughts.

1127
01:54:58,847 --> 01:55:01,648
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that we have is Sharon.

1128
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:05,069
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1129
01:55:05,129 --> 01:55:07,790
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

1130
01:55:22,276 --> 01:55:24,057
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, I'm going to send that request through again.

1131
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:30,616
[SPEAKER_31]: Bless you, Alicia.

1132
01:55:30,636 --> 01:55:33,918
[SPEAKER_31]: Why don't we come back to Sharon?

1133
01:55:35,298 --> 01:55:39,961
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll go to the next speaker, and then we'll circle right back, see if we can grab her.

1134
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:44,784
[SPEAKER_31]: So the next public speaker that I see is labeled iPad KR.

1135
01:55:46,125 --> 01:55:49,567
[SPEAKER_31]: Please say your name and address for the record.

1136
01:55:53,077 --> 01:55:55,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Kelly Brasso, 35 St.

1137
01:55:55,379 --> 01:55:56,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis Street.

1138
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:56,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Kelly.

1139
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:03,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know what is the incentive to the city to agree to all this zoning changes?

1140
01:56:03,465 --> 01:56:06,708
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the advantage to the city itself?

1141
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: People are so concerned about their property values, the increase in traffic, the sudden and extreme changes.

1142
01:56:16,656 --> 01:56:21,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The Community Development Board progressing so quickly with

1143
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are going to have long lasting effects to our city and without slowing careful consideration for what the ramifications will be, how will we unring this bell if things go sideways?

1144
01:56:39,997 --> 01:56:49,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first property that's come up, you know, this is the first proposal in this seems somewhat small scale, but there's no telling the

1145
01:56:52,086 --> 01:57:05,689
[SPEAKER_03]: the magnitude of, once the zoning is permitted, what will stop everything from turning into six-story buildings, one after the other, after the other, after the other?

1146
01:57:05,709 --> 01:57:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I'm very concerned about how quickly things are moving.

1147
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:13,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Gabb was just approved.

1148
01:57:15,311 --> 01:57:20,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not take a minute and let Mr. Gabb develop, you know, if you,

1149
01:57:22,102 --> 01:57:27,323
[SPEAKER_03]: already approved it and you've decided that it's going to work, why do Salem Street simultaneously?

1150
01:57:28,784 --> 01:57:40,687
[SPEAKER_03]: The advantages to the developers, I still don't understand why the city has a stake in this and what you would ever entertain so many changes at the same time for.

1151
01:57:42,168 --> 01:57:50,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's so rushed, it's so eminent, and it's not a well-thought plan.

1152
01:57:51,644 --> 01:57:54,909
[SPEAKER_03]: without a lot of potential problems.

1153
01:57:55,029 --> 01:57:56,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very, very concerning.

1154
01:57:56,932 --> 01:57:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand it.

1155
01:58:01,379 --> 01:58:02,961
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I appreciate that feedback, Kelly.

1156
01:58:06,262 --> 01:58:20,625
[SPEAKER_31]: making sure that we're doing this kind of intentionally, bringing everybody along with the process, and thinking about your six-story building comment, it may make sense for us to revisit some of those details just to clarify.

1157
01:58:20,645 --> 01:58:34,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even the height of the building, it's just once the floodgates are opened, how are we going to slow the roll in once you, you know, I feel like the developers are sort of pushing in that everything is being

1158
01:58:35,981 --> 01:58:39,702
[SPEAKER_03]: expedited because the developers have submitted plans.

1159
01:58:39,922 --> 01:59:01,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, and to that end, I would also like to say that in notifying the public, I think that it should be on the developer to send the notifications through the post office with the return receipt requested so that we can be sure that people are actually being notified and that the, you know, the actual

1160
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:07,943
[SPEAKER_03]: perimeters of the 300 or 400 feet is being met.

1161
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:12,267
[SPEAKER_31]: Allie, I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to move on to another public commenter.

1162
01:59:12,507 --> 01:59:20,813
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear what you're saying about notification and have written that down as something to take away from your- Two minutes isn't a conversation either.

1163
01:59:20,973 --> 01:59:22,494
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate that.

1164
01:59:22,534 --> 01:59:24,595
[SPEAKER_31]: We are enforcing the two minute limit.

1165
01:59:25,156 --> 01:59:26,837
[SPEAKER_31]: We're already a minute and a half over.

1166
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:33,143
[SPEAKER_31]: If you have more comments, I'd encourage you to email the Medford Community Development Board.

1167
01:59:33,343 --> 01:59:34,584
[SPEAKER_31]: But thank you so much for commenting.

1168
01:59:34,604 --> 01:59:36,666
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate your thoughts and insight.

1169
01:59:37,287 --> 01:59:40,610
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm taking notes for how we can address it.

1170
01:59:42,572 --> 01:59:48,197
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to try to go back to Sharon, see if we are able to unmute.

1171
01:59:48,237 --> 01:59:50,540
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1172
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:08,380
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for putting that email in the chat, Alicia, for people to provide continued comments.

1173
02:00:11,061 --> 02:00:16,644
[SPEAKER_31]: Looks like I'm still not having luck with share and unmuting, so I'm going to move on.

1174
02:00:16,664 --> 02:00:23,508
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is identified as JMN.

1175
02:00:24,688 --> 02:00:26,109
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1176
02:00:26,309 --> 02:00:29,291
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1177
02:00:29,311 --> 02:00:30,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, can you hear me?

1178
02:00:31,212 --> 02:00:31,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1179
02:00:32,125 --> 02:00:32,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

1180
02:00:33,305 --> 02:00:34,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the time to speak.

1181
02:00:34,706 --> 02:00:36,226
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Jean Nuzzo.

1182
02:00:36,747 --> 02:00:38,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 35 Parish Street.

1183
02:00:39,748 --> 02:00:52,292
[SPEAKER_16]: I often speak on these matters and the impacts to our resident, and I'll send my comments along, my technical comments along for the record, but tonight I'm going to do something unusual, and I'm going to speak for myself, because you've made me a direct abutter in this.

1184
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,822
[SPEAKER_16]: We've lived at our home for decades here on Parris Street.

1185
02:00:56,383 --> 02:01:02,488
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a full south-facing home with sustainability built that way before it was a trendy thing.

1186
02:01:03,429 --> 02:01:09,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Recently, we lost all the nearby 400-year-old silver maples and our summer shade to development.

1187
02:01:10,255 --> 02:01:14,539
[SPEAKER_16]: We've also lost a good portion of our sun path across all seasons to a new structure.

1188
02:01:15,463 --> 02:01:18,727
[SPEAKER_16]: The impacts of development on us have already been significant.

1189
02:01:19,127 --> 02:01:25,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Our costs to run our home have increased deeply already with heating and cooling and ice removal we never needed before.

1190
02:01:26,455 --> 02:01:38,723
[SPEAKER_16]: In your plan, you are now zoning that same parcel next door, similar in topography and size to mine, actually my lot is larger, to an MZ1IZ zone.

1191
02:01:39,223 --> 02:01:50,711
[SPEAKER_16]: With mechanical, ornamental, and not exercising the loopholes in your plan changes, I have a building potentially plus or minus 70 feet tall next to me.

1192
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:58,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Three and a half stories alone, never mind six, would completely blot out my sun path entirely.

1193
02:01:58,694 --> 02:01:59,734
[SPEAKER_16]: My home will go dark.

1194
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: I will lose the balance of what remains of my trees, bushes, gardens.

1195
02:02:04,557 --> 02:02:07,939
[SPEAKER_16]: The nearby wildlife that we harbor will be obliterated.

1196
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:10,700
[SPEAKER_16]: No solar and other green options for us.

1197
02:02:11,301 --> 02:02:18,605
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to know, why does 31 Paris Street get an MZ1 with IZ status and I do not?

1198
02:02:19,325 --> 02:02:25,389
[SPEAKER_16]: You've come down the street farther than anywhere else to get to that lot, so I'd like to understand why he gets it and I don't.

1199
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:37,058
[SPEAKER_16]: And lastly, I'd like to thank the City for their religious reminders of what developers want at every meeting, for regularly stressing the needs of the developer profits over our environmental justice neighborhood and our neighbors,

1200
02:02:37,518 --> 02:02:38,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Alicia.

1201
02:02:38,638 --> 02:02:41,179
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure the moneymakers appreciate your advocacy.

1202
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:46,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe look up what a betterment is and how cities leverage them to offset the cost to the residents.

1203
02:02:46,941 --> 02:02:48,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe advocate for us.

1204
02:02:48,602 --> 02:02:49,602
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so sorry.

1205
02:02:49,702 --> 02:02:52,143
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to have to cut you off.

1206
02:02:52,703 --> 02:02:53,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm done.

1207
02:02:53,363 --> 02:02:53,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1208
02:02:54,464 --> 02:02:55,744
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much for your comments.

1209
02:02:56,645 --> 02:03:00,146
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to remind people that we're trying to comment on the zoning.

1210
02:03:00,886 --> 02:03:03,387
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not commenting on individuals.

1211
02:03:04,187 --> 02:03:06,909
[SPEAKER_31]: So let's try to maintain that decorum.

1212
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:20,656
[SPEAKER_31]: But I did hear your concerns, Jean, around the impacts on your specific property and your passion about living kind of a sustainable and low impact lifestyle.

1213
02:03:21,597 --> 02:03:22,977
[SPEAKER_31]: That's something that I also try to do.

1214
02:03:23,077 --> 02:03:24,558
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm hearing those concerns.

1215
02:03:24,578 --> 02:03:25,439
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for sharing.

1216
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:31,522
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter we have is Moe Wing.

1217
02:03:34,065 --> 02:03:35,526
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1218
02:03:35,986 --> 02:03:38,507
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1219
02:03:39,507 --> 02:03:40,027
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1220
02:03:40,408 --> 02:03:41,808
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Maureen Wing.

1221
02:03:41,848 --> 02:03:47,971
[SPEAKER_26]: I live at 36 Dudley Street, and I'm not next to Salem Street, but I'm nonetheless concerned.

1222
02:03:48,591 --> 02:03:50,352
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1223
02:03:51,092 --> 02:03:55,714
[SPEAKER_26]: I am very concerned about a six-story building being built on Salem Street.

1224
02:03:56,907 --> 02:04:02,611
[SPEAKER_26]: In terms of the butters of the people that are in the neighborhoods, I'm very, very concerned.

1225
02:04:02,851 --> 02:04:09,555
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a certain, I would say, view of our street, view of our neighborhoods, and I think six stories is ridiculous.

1226
02:04:10,395 --> 02:04:14,358
[SPEAKER_26]: The second thing is I am also echoing what other people think about the traffic concerns.

1227
02:04:14,818 --> 02:04:18,400
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't seem to me that anybody's been talking about if we've done a current traffic study,

1228
02:04:18,928 --> 02:04:21,629
[SPEAKER_26]: Salem Street is a parking lot many times of the day.

1229
02:04:22,229 --> 02:04:27,271
[SPEAKER_26]: That does impact public safety response as Melanie has outlined.

1230
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:35,994
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm also concerned that the fire trucks come down from the fire right down Park Street when they're going to other areas in Medford, and there's parking on both sides of the street.

1231
02:04:37,554 --> 02:04:42,596
[SPEAKER_26]: The parking on side streets is both sides anyway, on many areas coming off Salem.

1232
02:04:43,236 --> 02:04:46,718
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm very concerned that what are we doing about that?

1233
02:04:47,258 --> 02:04:49,819
[SPEAKER_26]: And what are we looking at in terms of the traffic on the street?

1234
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:54,921
[SPEAKER_26]: And the other thing is, again, the impact on the schools in terms of the school population.

1235
02:04:56,142 --> 02:05:01,424
[SPEAKER_26]: I do oppose any methadone or CBD clinic on the Salem Street corridor.

1236
02:05:02,645 --> 02:05:06,106
[SPEAKER_26]: And the other thing I would like to say is that

1237
02:05:06,998 --> 02:05:17,500
[SPEAKER_26]: If we're going to have three to four story buildings, I would prefer that you're going to have parking off street underneath those building and have those things planned for that and not say it's a 1.5 space.

1238
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,641
[SPEAKER_26]: That makes no sense to me.

1239
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:26,282
[SPEAKER_26]: And could someone just please answer from before when this was going through everything, the three gas stations that are quite near each other.

1240
02:05:26,302 --> 02:05:29,203
[SPEAKER_26]: I had the sense that we left that open.

1241
02:05:29,243 --> 02:05:29,823
[SPEAKER_26]: I wasn't sure.

1242
02:05:29,843 --> 02:05:31,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that are they being removed?

1243
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:32,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Are they being asked to move?

1244
02:05:33,404 --> 02:05:39,149
[SPEAKER_26]: It was just unclear to me what was going on with the three gas stations that are sort of diagonally near each other on Salem.

1245
02:05:39,309 --> 02:05:39,629
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1246
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:42,792
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry for all the bullet points.

1247
02:05:43,652 --> 02:05:44,913
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's really great.

1248
02:05:44,993 --> 02:05:48,176
[SPEAKER_31]: It gives us a lot to work with, so I appreciate the insight, Maureen.

1249
02:05:48,196 --> 02:05:52,259
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm hearing, you know, echoed concerns about traffic and parking, public safety.

1250
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:56,623
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe we can dig in a little bit more to your

1251
02:05:57,558 --> 02:06:04,323
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, kind of, uh, the underground not underground, but, um, like, self contained parking for 3 to 4 stories.

1252
02:06:05,244 --> 02:06:08,446
[SPEAKER_31]: And then maybe we can get a quick answer on the gas stations.

1253
02:06:08,826 --> 02:06:12,549
[SPEAKER_31]: It was my understanding that they are not being asked to move.

1254
02:06:12,749 --> 02:06:14,650
[SPEAKER_31]: They're allowed to operate, you know.

1255
02:06:15,851 --> 02:06:17,232
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, keeping in mind.

1256
02:06:18,733 --> 02:06:24,155
[SPEAKER_31]: Earlier commenters, was that Patricia?

1257
02:06:24,736 --> 02:06:26,857
[SPEAKER_27]: Madam Chair, if I might.

1258
02:06:26,917 --> 02:06:30,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody is asked to move or change anything.

1259
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:30,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Exactly.

1260
02:06:30,718 --> 02:06:31,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Period ever.

1261
02:06:31,879 --> 02:06:39,642
[SPEAKER_27]: It's what allowed if they wanted to redevelop or dramatically change, redo their property.

1262
02:06:40,166 --> 02:06:41,987
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's applicable to the property owner.

1263
02:06:42,287 --> 02:06:54,690
[SPEAKER_31]: But if somebody has a lease, which is atypical with a gas station, they might have a long-term land lease, given the amount of capital improvements that are required for a gas station.

1264
02:06:55,251 --> 02:07:01,852
[SPEAKER_31]: But if a business did have a lease and the property owner decided to move in a different direction, that's the property owner's decision.

1265
02:07:03,793 --> 02:07:11,519
[SPEAKER_31]: And if the business owns the land that it's on, then that's the business's decision because the property owner and the business are one and the same.

1266
02:07:11,539 --> 02:07:12,520
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

1267
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:17,144
[SPEAKER_27]: But nobody would be asked to move ever under a zoning change.

1268
02:07:17,524 --> 02:07:18,425
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, correct.

1269
02:07:19,366 --> 02:07:21,087
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I think that's really helpful clarification.

1270
02:07:21,127 --> 02:07:23,169
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you so much for asking the question again, Maureen.

1271
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:24,070
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1272
02:07:25,911 --> 02:07:27,873
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you for the confirmation, Alicia.

1273
02:07:29,868 --> 02:07:33,129
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see is Apple's iPhone.

1274
02:07:33,809 --> 02:07:35,870
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1275
02:07:36,690 --> 02:07:38,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1276
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:45,873
[SPEAKER_06]: This is John Souza, 359 Winsor Street.

1277
02:07:49,417 --> 02:07:58,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to echo off of one of the former commenters specifically in regards to the step back.

1278
02:08:00,226 --> 02:08:15,619
[SPEAKER_06]: These are an architectural usage in specific climate areas that don't experience the same amount of freeze thaw that this neighborhood would.

1279
02:08:17,633 --> 02:08:23,497
[SPEAKER_06]: be under, you're going to have significant water issues in every one of these buildings.

1280
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:27,300
[SPEAKER_06]: No one on this board is going to care about that.

1281
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:34,145
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, I don't believe there's a single licensed architect involved in any of these decisions.

1282
02:08:34,345 --> 02:08:35,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not one of them.

1283
02:08:36,367 --> 02:08:42,392
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do consult with them on a regular basis and I see these issues often.

1284
02:08:42,412 --> 02:08:47,636
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something you should drastically consider removing from the

1285
02:08:50,018 --> 02:09:15,139
[SPEAKER_06]: from the the amendments it's it's just a nightmare you're you're not gonna get you're you're trying to make compliances for the residents when in actuality you're just going to design really poor buildings um and further to that i wonder if there will be any sort of aesthetic reviews on any of these buildings such as products allowed to

1286
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:22,702
[SPEAKER_06]: clad them with or what will be the longevity of each of these buildings?

1287
02:09:23,502 --> 02:09:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any sort of thought put into that end of the equation?

1288
02:09:32,005 --> 02:09:32,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have.

1289
02:09:33,854 --> 02:09:41,078
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, John, I appreciate your concern towards like the materiality and the aesthetics of these issues.

1290
02:09:41,738 --> 02:09:48,621
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's a little outside the scope of zoning, but would want to get some confirmation from city staff.

1291
02:09:49,442 --> 02:09:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's outside the scope of zoning, why would it go into the planning end of it?

1292
02:09:57,846 --> 02:09:58,866
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll get back to you on that.

1293
02:09:59,447 --> 02:09:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1294
02:10:01,407 --> 02:10:02,328
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, good questions.

1295
02:10:04,435 --> 02:10:04,915
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, John.

1296
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:13,562
[SPEAKER_31]: So the next public commenter that I'm seeing is Anne.

1297
02:10:14,463 --> 02:10:16,264
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1298
02:10:17,165 --> 02:10:18,826
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1299
02:10:18,846 --> 02:10:23,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Anne Sullivan, Central Ave.

1300
02:10:24,073 --> 02:10:28,097
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank Paula and Emily for their presentation.

1301
02:10:28,137 --> 02:10:33,402
[SPEAKER_22]: I found it very helpful to understand the maps a little bit more and all of the codes and all of that.

1302
02:10:33,843 --> 02:10:42,011
[SPEAKER_22]: But one thing that it brought up, because again, I'm concerned with the same things that other people are, which is traffic, public safety and parking.

1303
02:10:42,832 --> 02:10:46,736
[SPEAKER_22]: But have either of you or even the community or the

1304
02:10:47,759 --> 02:10:53,786
[SPEAKER_22]: development board walked down Salem Street from the Rotary to Felsway.

1305
02:10:54,387 --> 02:10:59,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Have either of you, that's just, it's a, you don't have to answer it, but have you ever done a tour of

1306
02:11:01,472 --> 02:11:17,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Salem Street, have you ever gone into Haines Square and spoken with any of the entrepreneurs who have some of them have been there for years and they have opinions about traffic and they have opinions about no bike racks and they have opinions about loitering and they have an opinion about trash.

1307
02:11:18,305 --> 02:11:22,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you personally spoken to anyone in Haines Square which would be

1308
02:11:22,988 --> 02:11:23,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Totally affected.

1309
02:11:23,889 --> 02:11:26,493
[SPEAKER_22]: And have you spoken to any residents?

1310
02:11:26,533 --> 02:11:28,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you observed trash on the street?

1311
02:11:28,315 --> 02:11:30,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you observed where people tend to park?

1312
02:11:31,959 --> 02:11:35,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I just think that your maps are wonderful.

1313
02:11:35,704 --> 02:11:39,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Your information is wonderful, but there's nothing like boots on the ground.

1314
02:11:40,209 --> 02:11:44,973
[SPEAKER_22]: I do a lot of walking, so I walk around the area a lot, and I see a lot of things that could be improved.

1315
02:11:45,954 --> 02:11:48,436
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that this is just zoning.

1316
02:11:48,516 --> 02:11:56,283
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't mean that a six-story building is going to go next to every spot that's labeled purple or whatever.

1317
02:11:56,383 --> 02:11:57,224
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand that.

1318
02:11:57,584 --> 02:12:02,128
[SPEAKER_22]: So my other question is, who is going to be encouraging this development?

1319
02:12:02,288 --> 02:12:04,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a department in Medford that seeks to

1320
02:12:06,532 --> 02:12:09,374
[SPEAKER_22]: get the right kind of businesses here?

1321
02:12:09,455 --> 02:12:11,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Because what if it's all check cashing stores?

1322
02:12:12,577 --> 02:12:24,889
[SPEAKER_22]: And that type of business opportunity, who is going to be really monitoring that we're bringing in what the residents want?

1323
02:12:25,029 --> 02:12:26,470
[SPEAKER_22]: And has anyone talked to them?

1324
02:12:27,091 --> 02:12:31,355
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you very much for my time and good luck.

1325
02:12:33,981 --> 02:12:34,601
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Anne.

1326
02:12:35,342 --> 02:12:36,722
[SPEAKER_31]: We've really thoughtful comments like this.

1327
02:12:36,782 --> 02:12:38,123
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think we need luck.

1328
02:12:39,243 --> 02:12:43,845
[SPEAKER_31]: We need really passionate public members like you.

1329
02:12:43,865 --> 02:12:59,831
[SPEAKER_31]: So yeah, I hear the more concerns about traffic, public safety, parking, your comments about the entrepreneurs in Haines Square, and then your concern for maintaining diversity of businesses so that it continues to serve the neighborhood.

1330
02:12:59,851 --> 02:13:02,212
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you so much for those comments.

1331
02:13:03,755 --> 02:13:08,197
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is Ren Bean.

1332
02:13:09,117 --> 02:13:10,798
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1333
02:13:11,158 --> 02:13:18,561
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I'm just going to do a quick check in with the board, see if we need a break or if we want to keep going, just to give everybody a preview.

1334
02:13:18,801 --> 02:13:20,862
[SPEAKER_31]: But Ren Bean, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1335
02:13:22,002 --> 02:13:24,283
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1336
02:13:25,433 --> 02:13:36,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi there, Ren being from 37 Woodrow Avenue just on the other side of the rotary there from Salem Street, and I'm generally supportive of the zoning effort here.

1337
02:13:36,838 --> 02:13:39,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there are a lot of details to wade through to get it right.

1338
02:13:39,699 --> 02:13:41,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there certainly is the danger that

1339
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:50,466
[SPEAKER_09]: the city with good intentions sort of charges in and gives permission for development.

1340
02:13:50,586 --> 02:13:55,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's outsized for what the infrastructure can handle.

1341
02:13:55,308 --> 02:14:01,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there are some questions about electric and sewer, and of course, the traffic and parking, which all have merit.

1342
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:05,892
[SPEAKER_09]: But my comments are specifically about the incentives.

1343
02:14:06,332 --> 02:14:17,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there was financial equivalency considered in how folks can get the additional half and full stories, because if I were a developer just quickly looking at this, I'd say,

1344
02:14:18,478 --> 02:14:31,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going to do a fountain and a pocket park because there's no square footage on there, or I'm going to do three years at 15% below market rate for my commercial because that doesn't really cost me that much and I'm still making a profit.

1345
02:14:31,850 --> 02:14:33,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take that rent and flip the building.

1346
02:14:33,951 --> 02:14:34,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Major profit.

1347
02:14:36,133 --> 02:14:45,657
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and you, I think there's the risk here that people will take the path of least resistance and you'll end up with a street of fountains every other block or something like that.

1348
02:14:46,038 --> 02:14:54,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And you won't get some of the other incentives unless they're, you know, equivalent to each other and cost for the, to develop.

1349
02:14:55,202 --> 02:15:04,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, I mean, maybe, maybe that is there, but it just looks like there, there could be the opportunity to take advantage of some of these that aren't defined as granularly as the others.

1350
02:15:05,565 --> 02:15:07,128
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I wanted to just...

1351
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:22,427
[SPEAKER_09]: touch on is the 0.8 parking spaces for anything within half a mile of high-frequency transit, which, according to zoning law, is any mass transit, including a bus that runs three times an hour.

1352
02:15:23,627 --> 02:15:28,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the whole of the zone would be in that, based on the Better Bus Project.

1353
02:15:29,530 --> 02:15:37,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be a little bit concerned about all the street parking that would result from all the carve-outs for less than one parking spot per unit.

1354
02:15:38,313 --> 02:15:41,775
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think most of those folks almost it would be great if everyone took the bus.

1355
02:15:41,795 --> 02:15:46,197
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reality is most of the people that could afford to buy would be parking a car.

1356
02:15:46,257 --> 02:15:47,998
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd probably be eligible for resident permits.

1357
02:15:48,618 --> 02:15:52,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I think we need to move away from driving cars and taking mass transit.

1358
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:56,822
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reality is the bus three times an hour isn't going to take those cars off the road.

1359
02:15:57,743 --> 02:16:04,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I hate to say traffic study because I don't tend to agree with some of the things that motivate a lot of those sentiments.

1360
02:16:04,266 --> 02:16:05,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it would be wise.

1361
02:16:05,887 --> 02:16:06,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much.

1362
02:16:07,365 --> 02:16:08,445
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Ren.

1363
02:16:08,625 --> 02:16:18,728
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear your insight in terms of the proportionality of some of these incentives, as well as maybe some concerns about the parking minimums.

1364
02:16:19,809 --> 02:16:20,969
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you for sharing those.

1365
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:24,870
[SPEAKER_31]: Real quick check in with the board.

1366
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:27,611
[SPEAKER_31]: Are we doing OK?

1367
02:16:27,671 --> 02:16:29,012
[SPEAKER_31]: Do we need a break?

1368
02:16:29,912 --> 02:16:31,853
[SPEAKER_31]: Want to make sure that we're all present.

1369
02:16:33,173 --> 02:16:34,053
[SPEAKER_31]: OK, thumbs up.

1370
02:16:36,334 --> 02:16:36,454
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

1371
02:16:38,067 --> 02:16:40,368
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, seeing none, no objections.

1372
02:16:40,508 --> 02:16:41,288
[SPEAKER_31]: Thumbs up from Ari.

1373
02:16:41,308 --> 02:16:41,708
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1374
02:16:41,888 --> 02:16:42,609
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Peter.

1375
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:43,889
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

1376
02:16:44,429 --> 02:16:48,051
[SPEAKER_31]: If there's no objections, we're going to keep going and continue with public comment.

1377
02:16:51,612 --> 02:16:55,174
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that we have is Bilbo.

1378
02:16:55,794 --> 02:16:58,055
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1379
02:16:59,135 --> 02:17:00,796
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1380
02:17:01,956 --> 02:17:02,296
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello.

1381
02:17:02,957 --> 02:17:03,937
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is John Flagg.

1382
02:17:03,997 --> 02:17:05,658
[SPEAKER_36]: I live at 55 Garfield Ave.

1383
02:17:07,764 --> 02:17:10,125
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't have a lot of specifics.

1384
02:17:10,485 --> 02:17:17,368
[SPEAKER_36]: We really just started getting this information, kind of had to go through it all where everybody has regular jobs.

1385
02:17:17,448 --> 02:17:26,832
[SPEAKER_36]: But one thing I wanted to just bring up, and I'm sure it was just type of verbiage you guys wanted to use, but Selma Street's not a corridor.

1386
02:17:27,132 --> 02:17:29,133
[SPEAKER_36]: Selma Street is a collection of name arts.

1387
02:17:30,113 --> 02:17:33,574
[SPEAKER_36]: And it would be appreciated if it was looked at that way.

1388
02:17:35,895 --> 02:17:38,018
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll echo all the same things about traffic.

1389
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:44,525
[SPEAKER_36]: Parking my street takes the brunt of parking for Salem Street.

1390
02:17:44,565 --> 02:17:52,715
[SPEAKER_36]: So if you're going to add more density on Salem Street without more parking, I guess they'll just, what they do now is park in front of my driveway.

1391
02:17:52,755 --> 02:17:54,057
[SPEAKER_36]: I guess that will just be every day.

1392
02:17:56,214 --> 02:18:01,815
[SPEAKER_36]: I saw historical character in some of the documents, and nobody seems to be addressing that.

1393
02:18:02,356 --> 02:18:08,878
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to point out that the Sink 240 building has no relationship to any kind of historical character or myth.

1394
02:18:10,178 --> 02:18:12,759
[SPEAKER_36]: So I don't know how that building got in.

1395
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,701
[SPEAKER_36]: My opinion, it's ugly, but nobody cares about that.

1396
02:18:19,181 --> 02:18:22,263
[SPEAKER_36]: But what I did want to ask is, what's the hurry here?

1397
02:18:24,995 --> 02:18:33,063
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, the communications, I know you guys started back in July, but nobody started even hearing about this until November.

1398
02:18:34,645 --> 02:18:38,409
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm trying to understand why we have to have this voted on in February.

1399
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:42,172
[SPEAKER_36]: You need to have neighborhood input here.

1400
02:18:43,414 --> 02:18:47,077
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm right at the, I abut these changes.

1401
02:18:49,561 --> 02:19:03,313
[SPEAKER_36]: It just seems like we're rushing through to create more density without any kind of acknowledgement about what that density increase is going to do to the fabric of our neighborhood.

1402
02:19:06,075 --> 02:19:14,322
[SPEAKER_36]: I know you gave an email, and I will send an email with more specifics, but I just wanted to add my two cents in there.

1403
02:19:17,198 --> 02:19:20,142
[SPEAKER_36]: I do not support this proposal as it is right now.

1404
02:19:20,702 --> 02:19:21,063
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1405
02:19:21,884 --> 02:19:24,186
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, John, your input's worth a lot more than two cents.

1406
02:19:25,428 --> 02:19:27,710
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm hearing the question like, why now?

1407
02:19:28,451 --> 02:19:36,601
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think it'll be helpful for us to provide some more insight to help answer that question.

1408
02:19:39,184 --> 02:19:42,427
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is Alyssa Nugent.

1409
02:19:43,588 --> 02:19:44,970
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1410
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:47,112
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1411
02:19:49,083 --> 02:19:51,704
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Alyssa Nugent, 98 Sheridan Avenue.

1412
02:19:53,244 --> 02:19:56,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I am generally supportive of these changes.

1413
02:19:56,925 --> 02:20:03,266
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that you took time to go back and look at the marijuana use and the zoning for that.

1414
02:20:03,326 --> 02:20:06,167
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think that should be zoned in this area.

1415
02:20:06,187 --> 02:20:11,068
[SPEAKER_21]: I have some concerns about traffic and all that.

1416
02:20:11,828 --> 02:20:17,413
[SPEAKER_21]: But specifically, I have some concerns about the incentives to be able to build higher.

1417
02:20:18,193 --> 02:20:22,997
[SPEAKER_21]: It just seems like some of the options are very easy.

1418
02:20:23,017 --> 02:20:34,326
[SPEAKER_21]: A bench, the fountain, these are things that the developers would jump on to be able to have the extra

1419
02:20:35,506 --> 02:20:37,688
[SPEAKER_21]: the extra stories.

1420
02:20:38,589 --> 02:20:47,515
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe considering all of the concern with parking, maybe something like below ground parking should be more than a half story.

1421
02:20:47,555 --> 02:20:50,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe that should be a full story to incentivize that.

1422
02:20:51,417 --> 02:21:02,745
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that in terms of creating more green spaces and making sure that we are making this a corridor that is pedestrian-minded and friendly to the neighborhood,

1423
02:21:04,498 --> 02:21:23,575
[SPEAKER_21]: that we really do focus on the incentives for putting in green space and making it a livable, walkable corridor, because that is where we want to move to, even if we do have major traffic issues related to the fact that the roads on both sides of the area are controlled by somebody besides Medford.

1424
02:21:25,136 --> 02:21:28,239
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would certainly ask that

1425
02:21:28,779 --> 02:21:31,581
[SPEAKER_21]: that the board think about that a little bit more.

1426
02:21:31,601 --> 02:21:33,962
[SPEAKER_21]: I love this neighborhood.

1427
02:21:33,982 --> 02:21:36,463
[SPEAKER_21]: I love walking this neighborhood with my kids.

1428
02:21:36,523 --> 02:21:43,667
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't wait to walk to the Roberts with them when they enroll there in a few years and it would be wonderful.

1429
02:21:43,687 --> 02:21:48,209
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't have so many gas stations along the route and it was a little bit more beautified.

1430
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:51,891
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't want to just push for fast development.

1431
02:21:51,931 --> 02:21:56,413
[SPEAKER_21]: We want very thoughtful development and that's what I'd like to see in the zoning plan.

1432
02:21:56,874 --> 02:21:57,174
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1433
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:59,241
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Alyssa.

1434
02:22:00,001 --> 02:22:05,365
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm hearing comments that echo earlier commenters, you know, kind of concerned about this incentives menu.

1435
02:22:05,505 --> 02:22:16,133
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think, you know, we can do some work digging into that and kind of, you know, embed that with best practices, but combine it with what makes it really right for Medford.

1436
02:22:16,153 --> 02:22:17,794
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you so much.

1437
02:22:18,855 --> 02:22:22,478
[SPEAKER_31]: Our next public commenter is Paulette Vardemedian.

1438
02:22:23,058 --> 02:22:25,400
[SPEAKER_31]: Paulette, you're gonna get a request to unmute.

1439
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,842
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1440
02:22:37,218 --> 02:22:40,079
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to send that request to unmute through again.

1441
02:22:40,099 --> 02:22:56,647
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, we're going to come back to you after our next public commenter, and we'll try again.

1442
02:22:56,667 --> 02:23:04,010
[SPEAKER_31]: If you're having technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia, and they can help you out.

1443
02:23:06,239 --> 02:23:12,364
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought we had another public commenter, but maybe they just jumped.

1444
02:23:13,284 --> 02:23:16,547
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that we're going to go to is Donna Messina.

1445
02:23:17,247 --> 02:23:19,168
[SPEAKER_31]: Donna, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1446
02:23:19,208 --> 02:23:21,030
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1447
02:23:22,477 --> 02:23:23,918
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, my name is Donna Messina.

1448
02:23:23,938 --> 02:23:29,142
[SPEAKER_25]: I live at 302 Salem Street, which is right next to the pit on the corner of Salem and Park.

1449
02:23:29,823 --> 02:23:33,165
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just want to say how opposed we are to this zoning change.

1450
02:23:33,545 --> 02:23:34,606
[SPEAKER_25]: We were never notified.

1451
02:23:34,746 --> 02:23:38,669
[SPEAKER_25]: As abutters, you would think we would have been told that it could build six stories.

1452
02:23:38,749 --> 02:23:40,070
[SPEAKER_25]: We were never notified of this.

1453
02:23:40,631 --> 02:23:42,832
[SPEAKER_25]: The traffic, every day we go out.

1454
02:23:43,153 --> 02:23:51,359
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to go knocking on the neighbors' doors all around the businesses to get out of our driveway because there's no parking, and people are parking in front of our driveway.

1455
02:23:52,659 --> 02:23:58,161
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't imagine putting a six-story building next door with not enough parking.

1456
02:23:58,201 --> 02:23:59,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are these people going to park?

1457
02:23:59,641 --> 02:24:01,982
[SPEAKER_25]: And the traffic, I can't get out of my driveway.

1458
02:24:02,042 --> 02:24:04,503
[SPEAKER_25]: It takes like 10 to 15 minutes now.

1459
02:24:04,563 --> 02:24:10,625
[SPEAKER_25]: And the only chance I have of getting out is when the light changes and somebody stops to let me out.

1460
02:24:11,485 --> 02:24:16,687
[SPEAKER_25]: And I mean, I just can't imagine why we were never told of this.

1461
02:24:19,396 --> 02:24:22,178
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been a family home for over 60 years.

1462
02:24:22,599 --> 02:24:24,340
[SPEAKER_25]: And what about our quality of life?

1463
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:30,965
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's great for all these builders and stuff, but what about the people that have been in Medford and made Medford and lived here?

1464
02:24:31,445 --> 02:24:32,386
[SPEAKER_25]: Why don't we count?

1465
02:24:33,627 --> 02:24:35,368
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't understand why.

1466
02:24:35,388 --> 02:24:38,951
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, and rush, rush, rush, it's crazy.

1467
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:46,757
[SPEAKER_25]: And what is our quality of life gonna be when a six-story building goes up next to a five feet from my property?

1468
02:24:48,675 --> 02:24:49,796
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't understand.

1469
02:24:49,816 --> 02:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so frustrated.

1470
02:24:51,076 --> 02:24:53,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1471
02:24:53,076 --> 02:24:54,097
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1472
02:24:54,517 --> 02:25:00,298
[SPEAKER_25]: Medford is supposed to be so great, but I guess if you've lived here for years, you don't count anymore.

1473
02:25:01,798 --> 02:25:07,200
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's all I have to say, just how opposed we are to this zoning change.

1474
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:08,020
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1475
02:25:09,822 --> 02:25:15,684
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear your opposition loud and clear, and I'm so sorry that you feel this way.

1476
02:25:19,065 --> 02:25:21,166
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe we can learn more about the notification process.

1477
02:25:21,266 --> 02:25:30,669
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm hearing a lot of your fellow public echo concerns about traffic, but your frustration is heard and noted.

1478
02:25:30,689 --> 02:25:32,490
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you so much for commenting.

1479
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:37,211
[SPEAKER_31]: It really means a lot to have you here and having you share your perspective.

1480
02:25:38,032 --> 02:25:38,452
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1481
02:25:38,952 --> 02:25:39,252
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1482
02:25:42,544 --> 02:25:44,305
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're going to try to go back to Paulette.

1483
02:25:45,326 --> 02:25:49,829
[SPEAKER_31]: Paulette Vartabedian, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1484
02:25:50,989 --> 02:25:52,930
[SPEAKER_31]: And please state your name and address for the record.

1485
02:25:52,950 --> 02:25:55,272
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I think I saw unmute.

1486
02:26:13,617 --> 02:26:20,139
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, it seems like we might be having trouble with the unmute function on your end.

1487
02:26:21,499 --> 02:26:26,661
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd encourage you to message Alicia or Danielle if you're having any technical difficulties.

1488
02:26:27,521 --> 02:26:29,982
[SPEAKER_31]: We really want to hear your public comment.

1489
02:26:31,102 --> 02:26:38,084
[SPEAKER_31]: So if hearing it tonight at the hearing is not possible, then I would encourage you to email the

1490
02:26:41,689 --> 02:26:43,591
[SPEAKER_31]: The email address that's been dropped in the chat.

1491
02:26:45,212 --> 02:26:52,778
[SPEAKER_31]: Just quick note in the chat, just please don't message the city board with any comments related to this matter.

1492
02:26:52,838 --> 02:26:56,881
[SPEAKER_31]: We wanna make sure that we're respecting the process here, abiding by open meeting laws.

1493
02:26:58,983 --> 02:27:02,125
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see is Andrew McRobert.

1494
02:27:03,926 --> 02:27:05,688
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1495
02:27:05,928 --> 02:27:08,170
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1496
02:27:09,692 --> 02:27:11,613
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi there, I'm Andrew McRobert from 63 Road.

1497
02:27:11,813 --> 02:27:18,318
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to voice my support generally for the direction of the zoning.

1498
02:27:18,338 --> 02:27:37,650
[SPEAKER_37]: I know that there are a lot of concerns here, but my wife and I, we had our daughter in December, and the zoning proposals and changes that we see in the docket are really giving us hope that Medford is developing in the

1499
02:27:38,733 --> 02:27:48,304
[SPEAKER_37]: direction that we would be happy to see where businesses and resources are close and will continue to be close and welcoming.

1500
02:27:48,404 --> 02:27:54,291
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, Medford will become more welcoming to more businesses in our area, in our neighborhood.

1501
02:27:54,311 --> 02:27:58,756
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I understand there's a lot of concerns, but

1502
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:18,880
[SPEAKER_37]: Quality of life I find is best when the resources you need are as close to where you live and you have what you need close by and you don't necessarily need to get in your car and leave Medford or drive through traffic to go get to them.

1503
02:28:22,027 --> 02:28:30,533
[SPEAKER_37]: No specific details that I wanted to mention, but just general support for the direction of this overall.

1504
02:28:30,674 --> 02:28:31,014
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1505
02:28:32,615 --> 02:28:33,195
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Andrew.

1506
02:28:33,215 --> 02:28:34,176
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate the support.

1507
02:28:34,196 --> 02:28:46,025
[SPEAKER_31]: I think support combined with the really thoughtful, direct feedback we've received from the public will move this in the right direction.

1508
02:28:50,871 --> 02:29:00,142
[SPEAKER_31]: The next participant that I have, it says owner's iPhone, but I do see the name Marion.

1509
02:29:01,584 --> 02:29:03,947
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1510
02:29:04,888 --> 02:29:07,792
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1511
02:29:08,653 --> 02:29:09,194
[SPEAKER_31]: Marion.

1512
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:35,626
[SPEAKER_31]: Maryanne Thomas check Okay Hello, hi we can hear you.

1513
02:29:36,046 --> 02:29:36,426
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1514
02:29:36,567 --> 02:29:42,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, Marianne Marianne Thomas look and I live at 29 Garfield Avenue.

1515
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:42,670
[SPEAKER_29]: Mm-hmm.

1516
02:29:43,111 --> 02:29:45,352
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's right in Salem Street

1517
02:29:46,504 --> 02:29:54,994
[SPEAKER_29]: near nappies and I am extremely opposed to this and I feel that there's totally impossible to implement this.

1518
02:29:58,188 --> 02:30:18,837
[SPEAKER_29]: If you try to do all this building and have all this density, we will find ourselves like Chelsea and having whole blocks go up in flames and the firefighters will not be able to fight it because we will not be able to have the water power to fight the fires.

1519
02:30:19,137 --> 02:30:25,800
[SPEAKER_29]: We will possibly lose firefighters' lives in the process and I feel this is

1520
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:27,961
[SPEAKER_29]: dangerous situation.

1521
02:30:28,061 --> 02:30:39,367
[SPEAKER_29]: We did absolutely no studies, no traffic studies, nothing with the fire safety, no types of any kind of studies at all.

1522
02:30:40,447 --> 02:30:47,831
[SPEAKER_29]: Talking about these green spaces is a farce because you're talking about 3,000 square foot lots.

1523
02:30:48,492 --> 02:30:54,795
[SPEAKER_29]: You're talking about a very narrow street and yet you want a 12-foot sidewalk

1524
02:30:57,068 --> 02:30:58,389
[SPEAKER_29]: 80% of the lot's going to be covered.

1525
02:30:59,891 --> 02:31:05,416
[SPEAKER_29]: And yet, and then you're going to have a green space, mini park, I forgot what you called it.

1526
02:31:06,256 --> 02:31:18,287
[SPEAKER_29]: And there's no way that that can possibly happen on a 3000 square foot lot with, you know, six, six floors, or even three floors.

1527
02:31:18,948 --> 02:31:19,508
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just

1528
02:31:20,447 --> 02:31:20,987
[SPEAKER_29]: Impossible.

1529
02:31:21,528 --> 02:31:23,449
[SPEAKER_29]: You're not requiring them to have parking.

1530
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:25,591
[SPEAKER_29]: There's not enough parking here now.

1531
02:31:25,611 --> 02:31:32,996
[SPEAKER_29]: I live halfway down Garfield Avenue and people from Salem Street park in front of my house all the time.

1532
02:31:34,657 --> 02:31:36,158
[SPEAKER_29]: This is an issue.

1533
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:42,483
[SPEAKER_29]: In the morning, I volunteer at the senior center and I can't even get out.

1534
02:31:43,479 --> 02:31:49,143
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't drive, but the person that drives me, we can't go down Salem Street in the morning or the evening.

1535
02:31:49,424 --> 02:32:00,572
[SPEAKER_29]: And I also want to know if you are considering the letter you got from the mayor asking you to reconsider and not vote on this tonight.

1536
02:32:01,192 --> 02:32:04,535
[SPEAKER_29]: And I also don't understand if it's legal for you to vote on this when

1537
02:32:05,035 --> 02:32:09,398
[SPEAKER_29]: The changes you're talking about, they're not uploaded on the site.

1538
02:32:09,838 --> 02:32:19,305
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked, and how can you vote on something when you're talking to us about the changes, and yet there's nothing written that we can see?

1539
02:32:19,765 --> 02:32:26,509
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you vote on what you're talking about, and yet there's nothing written about that, so there's two different things.

1540
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:29,692
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing that you're talking to us about, and one thing that's written.

1541
02:32:30,753 --> 02:32:34,302
[SPEAKER_29]: So that doesn't seem right to me.

1542
02:32:34,322 --> 02:32:35,305
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't seem legal.

1543
02:32:35,886 --> 02:32:36,247
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1544
02:32:36,966 --> 02:32:45,391
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I hear that concern, and I hear the echoing of concerns about public safety, the actual implementation of this.

1545
02:32:45,411 --> 02:32:50,254
[SPEAKER_31]: And regarding the letter, there is an option for us to continue.

1546
02:32:50,274 --> 02:32:53,335
[SPEAKER_31]: That would be up for the entire board to discuss.

1547
02:32:55,376 --> 02:32:58,098
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'll leave that to our discussion.

1548
02:32:58,138 --> 02:33:00,780
[SPEAKER_31]: But that is one of our options that we do have available this evening.

1549
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:11,008
[SPEAKER_31]: And that may give us more time to kind of process and address the board's concerns and comments as well as the public concerns and comments as well.

1550
02:33:12,089 --> 02:33:14,071
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you so much for your insight.

1551
02:33:17,033 --> 02:33:23,979
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that I see, it's an email address, pbdoherty01 at comcast.net.

1552
02:33:24,139 --> 02:33:25,701
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request on mute.

1553
02:33:26,261 --> 02:33:28,003
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1554
02:33:29,765 --> 02:33:32,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Patricia Brady Doherty, 190 West Street.

1555
02:33:34,288 --> 02:33:36,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a former Medford City Councilor.

1556
02:33:36,089 --> 02:33:40,372
[SPEAKER_13]: I spent eight years on the council, and a majority of that was working on zoning.

1557
02:33:41,472 --> 02:33:45,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though I'm an attorney, it's such a nuanced field.

1558
02:33:46,115 --> 02:33:49,097
[SPEAKER_13]: I hired a Boston zoning attorney to walk me through it.

1559
02:33:51,418 --> 02:33:51,579
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

1560
02:33:52,657 --> 02:34:01,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of these people feel like they need to do that, and some of them, as you may have heard earlier, have done just that, and they should not have to be put through that expense.

1561
02:34:02,741 --> 02:34:16,667
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I'm hearing tonight is that no one's protecting the neighborhoods, and the overwhelming majority of these people have come forward to say they are scared, they're nervous, and they don't like what they see.

1562
02:34:18,084 --> 02:34:22,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It used to be that the city council had one motto and that was protect the neighborhoods.

1563
02:34:23,388 --> 02:34:31,274
[SPEAKER_13]: What I hear from this city council is, and maybe from the mayor and hopefully not, let's protect the developers.

1564
02:34:32,454 --> 02:34:36,217
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing I think that you people can do tonight is take this off the table.

1565
02:34:36,798 --> 02:34:38,018
[SPEAKER_13]: It's impossible to fix.

1566
02:34:38,819 --> 02:34:39,980
[SPEAKER_13]: It is so overwhelming.

1567
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:41,201
[SPEAKER_13]: It is so high.

1568
02:34:41,541 --> 02:34:42,422
[SPEAKER_13]: It is so dense.

1569
02:34:42,742 --> 02:34:46,785
[SPEAKER_13]: You are going to ruin the neighborhoods and that should not happen.

1570
02:34:48,375 --> 02:34:53,437
[SPEAKER_13]: So I ask you to think very, very carefully about what you're doing and to consider who you're representing.

1571
02:34:54,357 --> 02:34:58,279
[SPEAKER_13]: You're representing the residents of the neighborhood, nobody else.

1572
02:34:58,679 --> 02:35:02,960
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not representing the OCD board or the mayor or the city councilors.

1573
02:35:04,021 --> 02:35:04,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1574
02:35:06,293 --> 02:35:09,794
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, first of all, thank you so much for your service as a city councilor.

1575
02:35:09,814 --> 02:35:14,295
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate you joining and providing comment tonight.

1576
02:35:14,975 --> 02:35:21,296
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think this echoes other comments in terms of like, you know, why now?

1577
02:35:21,896 --> 02:35:25,117
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's, you know, be really thoughtful and intentional with this process.

1578
02:35:25,157 --> 02:35:29,578
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you so much for providing those comments and that insight.

1579
02:35:29,598 --> 02:35:31,118
[SPEAKER_31]: You're welcome.

1580
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:36,392
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter we have is Lisa Korber.

1581
02:35:40,034 --> 02:35:42,015
[SPEAKER_31]: Lisa, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1582
02:35:42,115 --> 02:35:44,037
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1583
02:35:44,057 --> 02:35:45,718
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi there.

1584
02:35:46,038 --> 02:35:51,181
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Lisa Korber, 47A Chardon Ave.

1585
02:35:51,201 --> 02:35:58,665
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to express my tremendous opposition to this plan.

1586
02:36:00,386 --> 02:36:01,027
[SPEAKER_33]: I feel

1587
02:36:02,032 --> 02:36:06,715
[SPEAKER_33]: The integrity of this area of the city will be destroyed.

1588
02:36:07,976 --> 02:36:14,920
[SPEAKER_33]: No one is thinking about the traffic, the parking, all things that have already been echoed.

1589
02:36:16,201 --> 02:36:18,042
[SPEAKER_33]: I've been here my entire life.

1590
02:36:19,663 --> 02:36:22,205
[SPEAKER_33]: I am now a third generation in this city.

1591
02:36:24,226 --> 02:36:25,767
[SPEAKER_33]: Nobody's thinking about the children.

1592
02:36:27,649 --> 02:36:31,830
[SPEAKER_33]: Nobody's thinking about where the children are going to go to school.

1593
02:36:32,951 --> 02:36:41,213
[SPEAKER_33]: We have over 150 vacancies, apartment-wise, in this city to date.

1594
02:36:42,733 --> 02:36:54,357
[SPEAKER_33]: Why we need to put more housing, especially this area, and this area has a lot of empty apartments right now, is beyond me.

1595
02:36:57,060 --> 02:37:10,188
[SPEAKER_33]: There are things that have been done in my neck of the woods, friend's neck of the woods, that nobody's ever been, it's never been brought forth, and that's problematic.

1596
02:37:11,249 --> 02:37:25,238
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm respectfully asking this committee to please table this, put it aside, get the neighbors involved, and let's have a discussion

1597
02:37:26,503 --> 02:37:28,885
[SPEAKER_33]: of realistic expectations.

1598
02:37:29,565 --> 02:37:32,267
[SPEAKER_33]: Protect the people that live here.

1599
02:37:33,467 --> 02:37:33,868
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1600
02:37:34,888 --> 02:37:35,649
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Lisa.

1601
02:37:36,369 --> 02:37:40,772
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate the insight, the passion, the perspective.

1602
02:37:41,572 --> 02:37:43,033
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really helpful for us to hear this.

1603
02:37:44,554 --> 02:37:47,416
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you so much for joining the public hearing.

1604
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:55,421
[SPEAKER_31]: The next public commenter that we have

1605
02:37:57,156 --> 02:38:00,618
[SPEAKER_31]: is Sharon Dieso.

1606
02:38:00,638 --> 02:38:07,543
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.

1607
02:38:07,563 --> 02:38:22,552
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to send that request through again.

1608
02:38:24,708 --> 02:38:28,072
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, if you're able to unmute, please do so.

1609
02:38:37,782 --> 02:38:40,925
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, we're going to move forward with the next public commenter, but we'll come right back to you.

1610
02:38:40,945 --> 02:38:44,910
[SPEAKER_31]: If you're having any technical difficulties, please message Alicia or

1611
02:38:48,408 --> 02:38:55,529
[SPEAKER_31]: Danielle, and I just got a note that Paulette has figured out her technical difficulties.

1612
02:38:55,989 --> 02:38:57,810
[SPEAKER_31]: So Paulette, we're going to come back to you.

1613
02:38:58,370 --> 02:39:01,931
[SPEAKER_31]: Paulette Varnabedian, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1614
02:39:04,791 --> 02:39:06,931
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1615
02:39:11,432 --> 02:39:14,653
[SPEAKER_31]: I saw the unmute flash quickly, so I know we're

1616
02:39:15,685 --> 02:39:16,975
[SPEAKER_31]: We're heading in the right direction.

1617
02:39:16,995 --> 02:39:18,326
[SPEAKER_31]: We really want to hear from you.

1618
02:39:32,968 --> 02:39:38,312
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, it seems like we still may be having challenges, so we're going to move on to the next commenter.

1619
02:39:39,293 --> 02:39:42,215
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, it looks like you're online.

1620
02:39:42,536 --> 02:39:43,977
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1621
02:39:44,037 --> 02:39:46,699
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1622
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:54,625
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to send through that unmute request again.

1623
02:39:54,645 --> 02:39:58,108
[SPEAKER_31]: This is Sharon D'Ieso, or Sharon D'Ieso.

1624
02:40:08,557 --> 02:40:09,577
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon, you're still muted.

1625
02:40:09,597 --> 02:40:18,740
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, Sharon, I saw that you lowered your hand.

1626
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:29,723
[SPEAKER_31]: If you do want to provide comment, you know, send a note to Danielle or Alicia, and we'll make sure that you've got the tech support you need or the email address to provide comment.

1627
02:40:31,016 --> 02:40:35,777
[SPEAKER_31]: The next comment that we have, the name is Fire East Ford Tau.

1628
02:40:36,517 --> 02:40:38,098
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1629
02:40:39,198 --> 02:40:41,379
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1630
02:40:42,419 --> 02:40:43,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, are we going?

1631
02:40:44,179 --> 02:40:45,440
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, we can hear you.

1632
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:47,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, miss.

1633
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:51,221
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Andrew Castagnetti of Cushing Street.

1634
02:40:51,961 --> 02:40:52,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1635
02:40:53,141 --> 02:40:55,702
[SPEAKER_10]: In East Medford, Massachusetts.

1636
02:40:57,282 --> 02:40:57,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

1637
02:40:58,663 --> 02:40:59,903
[SPEAKER_10]: You want more development.

1638
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:08,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always said Medford is the best location in New England next to Boston, proximity wise.

1639
02:41:10,147 --> 02:41:15,751
[SPEAKER_10]: However, Sill Street is already a busy street.

1640
02:41:18,133 --> 02:41:29,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So it seems to me your new rezoning will add a lot of new additional real estate tax to the city, to the city's coffers.

1641
02:41:30,448 --> 02:41:35,969
[SPEAKER_10]: But will this new money lower our real estate tax bill at all?

1642
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:45,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it lower our real estate tax bill even one dollar or less?

1643
02:41:49,871 --> 02:41:52,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I guess I'll wait for an answer tomorrow.

1644
02:41:53,752 --> 02:41:56,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I said this before and I'll say it again.

1645
02:41:56,753 --> 02:41:58,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's time

1646
02:41:59,587 --> 02:42:08,494
[SPEAKER_10]: East Medford to secede from the city and form our own city because we have the most valuable land, period.

1647
02:42:10,276 --> 02:42:10,756
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

1648
02:42:10,876 --> 02:42:12,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Sikav is our best bet.

1649
02:42:13,479 --> 02:42:15,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks if you're listening and good night.

1650
02:42:16,941 --> 02:42:22,286
[SPEAKER_31]: Andrew, I am listening and I appreciate your question around, you know, the why of this.

1651
02:42:25,603 --> 02:42:26,383
[SPEAKER_31]: this work?

1652
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:29,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the real estate tax lower by even $1.

1653
02:42:30,265 --> 02:42:34,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been going up since I've been born every year, more than two and a half percent.

1654
02:42:37,387 --> 02:42:40,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the overrides, it's more like 8%.

1655
02:42:41,689 --> 02:42:45,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tough for a lot of people that are on seniors, they're on fixed incomes.

1656
02:42:46,031 --> 02:42:47,971
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I appreciate your patience.

1657
02:42:47,991 --> 02:42:48,812
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing a good job.

1658
02:42:49,352 --> 02:42:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

1659
02:42:50,794 --> 02:42:55,035
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Andrew, and you're doing a great job of providing insight and comments.

1660
02:42:55,975 --> 02:43:03,157
[SPEAKER_31]: And, you know, perhaps, you know, there needs to be, you know, more clarity in terms of the why and the benefits.

1661
02:43:04,257 --> 02:43:07,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm personally.

1662
02:43:07,758 --> 02:43:09,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I lived on Mr. Gabb in 1955.

1663
02:43:09,738 --> 02:43:14,719
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the old highway to Boston, Route 38 for information's sake.

1664
02:43:15,219 --> 02:43:15,999
[SPEAKER_10]: When they built Route 93 in 1960,

1665
02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:23,832
[SPEAKER_10]: then we really didn't need Route 38, but we have it.

1666
02:43:24,232 --> 02:43:32,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lousy place back then, street cars and trucks and mechanic places and things of that nature.

1667
02:43:33,779 --> 02:43:38,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has not been developed when it should have been 60 years ago.

1668
02:43:38,243 --> 02:43:39,163
[SPEAKER_10]: No, 64 years ago, 1960.

1669
02:43:43,345 --> 02:43:44,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a live industry.

1670
02:43:44,807 --> 02:43:46,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still the same street.

1671
02:43:47,972 --> 02:43:54,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where you can go high on one side, on the 93 side, but you gotta lower our taxes.

1672
02:43:54,721 --> 02:43:58,927
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go up 10, 15, 20 stories, you put your own off rent on 93.

1673
02:44:00,149 --> 02:44:04,511
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so sorry Andrew, we're going to have to move on to another public commenter.

1674
02:44:04,531 --> 02:44:09,673
[SPEAKER_31]: I do really appreciate the historical context.

1675
02:44:09,854 --> 02:44:11,574
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really helpful to hear that.

1676
02:44:12,595 --> 02:44:13,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for commenting.

1677
02:44:13,995 --> 02:44:25,421
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so sorry Andrew, we're going to have to move on to a different commenter, but I encourage you to reach out to city staff via the provided email if you have any more

1678
02:44:26,321 --> 02:44:30,404
[SPEAKER_31]: I need more feedback to share, but thank you so much for your comments.

1679
02:44:32,626 --> 02:44:36,168
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to try Paulette one last time.

1680
02:44:37,989 --> 02:44:41,612
[SPEAKER_31]: Paulette Vardibedian, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1681
02:44:56,105 --> 02:45:02,567
[SPEAKER_31]: It seems like unfortunately, technical difficulties may prevent us from hearing Paulette's comment this evening.

1682
02:45:02,587 --> 02:45:10,909
[SPEAKER_31]: But Paulette, I encourage you to reach out via the email address that has been provided.

1683
02:45:10,929 --> 02:45:13,650
[SPEAKER_31]: Danielle, I see your hand is raised.

1684
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:20,692
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you heard from anybody that's had technical difficulties that we should go to or anything else?

1685
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:29,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm starting to lose track of who is who, but I think, Sharon, did she speak?

1686
02:45:30,046 --> 02:45:31,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Because she had trouble unmuting.

1687
02:45:31,787 --> 02:45:33,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I see it looks like she's unmuted.

1688
02:45:35,751 --> 02:45:38,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless she doesn't have a microphone, I'd have to check.

1689
02:45:39,313 --> 02:45:40,114
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, that was.

1690
02:45:42,692 --> 02:45:43,493
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, she's unmuted.

1691
02:45:43,553 --> 02:45:51,698
[SPEAKER_31]: That may have been in response to my unmute request when she had her hand raised, but I don't see their hand raised anymore.

1692
02:45:51,818 --> 02:45:53,819
[SPEAKER_31]: Would you be able to send her a message?

1693
02:45:54,599 --> 02:45:59,703
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Madam Chair, from the participants list, she doesn't have a microphone next to her.

1694
02:46:00,023 --> 02:46:03,565
[SPEAKER_27]: She doesn't have a microphone connected.

1695
02:46:03,685 --> 02:46:06,527
[SPEAKER_27]: Sharon, you'll have to message us.

1696
02:46:11,422 --> 02:46:12,203
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, my apologies.

1697
02:46:12,283 --> 02:46:13,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I should have noticed that.

1698
02:46:14,585 --> 02:46:16,206
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that's a good flag, Alicia.

1699
02:46:16,326 --> 02:46:18,868
[SPEAKER_31]: And sometimes these Zoom meetings are great.

1700
02:46:20,289 --> 02:46:22,351
[SPEAKER_31]: But there are still some technical nuances there.

1701
02:46:22,371 --> 02:46:27,896
[SPEAKER_31]: And we appreciate everyone's patience while we deal with those.

1702
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:32,880
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's see.

1703
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:35,242
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't see any more hands raised right now.

1704
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:47,103
[SPEAKER_31]: have we received any comments while we've been hearing from the public, Alicia, Danielle, any emails that we should address?

1705
02:46:49,063 --> 02:46:55,225
[SPEAKER_27]: There are three new emails in there, but I haven't read them because I've been working the timer.

1706
02:46:55,545 --> 02:46:56,125
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1707
02:46:57,405 --> 02:47:02,786
[SPEAKER_27]: And the first one is asking about particularly traffic studies, is it going to be done traffic studies?

1708
02:47:02,806 --> 02:47:04,087
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that we should just ask

1709
02:47:06,864 --> 02:47:18,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, Emily, to sort of just speak on the process, because from our development perspective, traffic studies are done on a case-by-case basis per project.

1710
02:47:19,193 --> 02:47:22,795
[SPEAKER_27]: But she could speak to it from a zoning perspective.

1711
02:47:25,017 --> 02:47:29,160
[SPEAKER_27]: And then please address the traffic flow problems.

1712
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:31,121
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't heard any answers yet.

1713
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:38,103
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the third question, the third one was also from somebody who spoke.

1714
02:47:48,208 --> 02:47:51,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, I just don't want to read this entire thing out.

1715
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:57,312
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a little bit more complicated about building ordinances and public safety corridor plans.

1716
02:47:58,973 --> 02:48:02,075
[SPEAKER_31]: And all of these comments will be shared with the board for us to review.

1717
02:48:03,786 --> 02:48:06,387
[SPEAKER_31]: just to kind of confirm with the public.

1718
02:48:08,589 --> 02:48:11,250
[SPEAKER_31]: I see another member of the public who's raised their hand.

1719
02:48:12,831 --> 02:48:15,852
[SPEAKER_31]: James Sampson, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1720
02:48:16,753 --> 02:48:18,854
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1721
02:48:22,073 --> 02:48:23,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, can you hear me?

1722
02:48:23,994 --> 02:48:24,254
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I can.

1723
02:48:24,774 --> 02:48:26,455
[SPEAKER_11]: It's James Sampson.

1724
02:48:27,155 --> 02:48:30,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm 14 right here, placed in Medford.

1725
02:48:31,596 --> 02:48:37,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to just tell people that I'm getting old now.

1726
02:48:38,179 --> 02:48:40,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I've lived in Medford all my life.

1727
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:43,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I've worked in Medford all my life.

1728
02:48:43,841 --> 02:48:46,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And I definitely,

1729
02:48:47,318 --> 02:48:54,861
[SPEAKER_11]: think that Medved is losing some of the charm that I grew up with.

1730
02:48:56,502 --> 02:49:00,623
[SPEAKER_11]: It's becoming like Maldon.

1731
02:49:00,683 --> 02:49:09,006
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at Maldon Center, Maldon Center is terrible compared to when I was a kid.

1732
02:49:10,967 --> 02:49:27,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted people to know that I definitely am opposed to almost any change, but I definitely, living on this little dead-end street, it's tough to get off my street.

1733
02:49:29,518 --> 02:49:38,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially, the way it's timed, like the cars come from my left and then

1734
02:49:39,283 --> 02:50:00,143
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing on the right and then by the time of the one side clears up the other side goes up and the people are very very disrespectful people won't slow down let you get out and you know, I definitely worry about just the

1735
02:50:01,044 --> 02:50:02,345
[SPEAKER_11]: the electricity.

1736
02:50:02,365 --> 02:50:18,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I know in my house here we have had electric issues because of the way the route the electricity is run in my street and and just

1737
02:50:19,162 --> 02:50:34,090
[SPEAKER_11]: In general, I just want to say I love Medford, I've always been here, and I always will, and my grandchildren are now here, and hopefully they're going to stay in Medford.

1738
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:37,952
[SPEAKER_11]: So please consider this very, very carefully.

1739
02:50:39,433 --> 02:50:39,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1740
02:50:40,813 --> 02:50:41,473
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, James.

1741
02:50:41,894 --> 02:50:43,875
[SPEAKER_31]: And I appreciate your affection for Medford.

1742
02:50:43,995 --> 02:50:44,936
[SPEAKER_31]: I share that affection.

1743
02:50:44,996 --> 02:50:51,660
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hope your grandchildren and their grandchildren can have a place in Medford, because it is such a great place to be.

1744
02:50:52,601 --> 02:50:52,901
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

1745
02:50:53,422 --> 02:50:53,822
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1746
02:50:54,262 --> 02:50:54,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1747
02:50:55,363 --> 02:50:55,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did.

1748
02:50:58,265 --> 02:50:59,206
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

1749
02:50:59,766 --> 02:51:05,710
[SPEAKER_31]: We do have the two minute public comment limit, but I do encourage you to email if you have additional feedback.

1750
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:09,032
[SPEAKER_31]: But I did really appreciate your comment.

1751
02:51:09,072 --> 02:51:10,033
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much for sharing.

1752
02:51:14,269 --> 02:51:16,711
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't see any other hands.

1753
02:51:18,953 --> 02:51:22,477
[SPEAKER_31]: So let's see.

1754
02:51:23,398 --> 02:51:24,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I see a hand.

1755
02:51:24,278 --> 02:51:27,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you want the consultants to respond to any of this?

1756
02:51:28,322 --> 02:51:29,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I do.

1757
02:51:29,704 --> 02:51:33,647
[SPEAKER_27]: Also a presentation on the green score that we have this evening?

1758
02:51:34,108 --> 02:51:34,808
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I do.

1759
02:51:35,209 --> 02:51:35,749
[SPEAKER_31]: I do want.

1760
02:51:37,708 --> 02:51:40,250
[SPEAKER_31]: to hear some responses from the consultant.

1761
02:51:40,990 --> 02:51:43,772
[SPEAKER_31]: I did see another member of the public raise their hand.

1762
02:51:49,615 --> 02:51:51,136
[SPEAKER_31]: Sometimes I take a minute to think.

1763
02:51:52,517 --> 02:51:53,858
[SPEAKER_31]: It's this new thing I'm trying.

1764
02:51:53,878 --> 02:51:54,438
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

1765
02:52:10,707 --> 02:52:16,256
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're going to go to the next member of the public, Lisa Serio.

1766
02:52:16,417 --> 02:52:18,140
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1767
02:52:18,861 --> 02:52:20,564
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1768
02:52:25,334 --> 02:52:25,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me?

1769
02:52:26,395 --> 02:52:26,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1770
02:52:26,795 --> 02:52:27,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi lisa.

1771
02:52:27,816 --> 02:52:50,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I did this because I wanted I I kind of like tried to help paulette through this to see if she could maybe get this but okay, I I'll do it with her when I see her phone because I I Couldn't even find how to raise my hand for a second and then I found it under reactions But anyway, um, I wanted to say thank um, my name is lisa and I live at 18 paul road in medford, which is not on the

1772
02:52:50,975 --> 02:53:08,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Salem street area, but nonetheless, um, it's in the saint francis area Um, I want to say thank you emily and thank you paula for your presentation um, but I just wanted to also say that um Yeah, we've i've lived in medford my whole life and um

1773
02:53:09,737 --> 02:53:11,918
[SPEAKER_19]: It is always been convenient.

1774
02:53:12,738 --> 02:53:14,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Salem Street has always been convenient for me.

1775
02:53:15,259 --> 02:53:20,520
[SPEAKER_19]: If I need a hardware store, if I need food, if I need a drugstore, everything's there.

1776
02:53:21,801 --> 02:53:26,482
[SPEAKER_19]: You had a citizen say that he wants it to continue to be that way.

1777
02:53:26,542 --> 02:53:27,743
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always been that way.

1778
02:53:28,163 --> 02:53:31,624
[SPEAKER_19]: When you go to Haynes Square, you always can find everything that you need.

1779
02:53:32,284 --> 02:53:37,306
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want, you know, to assure him that this has always been the way it's been in Haynes Square.

1780
02:53:37,746 --> 02:53:46,549
[SPEAKER_19]: It's also even been a little bit more attractive because the square, Medford Square, Salem Street leads right into Medford Square, and Medford Square was always

1781
02:53:47,649 --> 02:54:08,394
[SPEAKER_19]: vital part of the city, which has now become like a dead zone, which I don't understand why nobody's really thinking about that area more than all the other areas, because Medford used to have a supermarket, and we just used to have so many great, you know, department stores, Woolworths, Grant's, Baker's, Shoes, everything.

1782
02:54:08,434 --> 02:54:11,875
[SPEAKER_19]: We had everything down the square, and now there's nothing down the square.

1783
02:54:12,235 --> 02:54:17,316
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, it's great that you're thinking about Salem Street, and I agree it's not a corridor, it's a neighborhood,

1784
02:54:18,277 --> 02:54:29,405
[SPEAKER_19]: But the square to me is really where, you know, like where we have to kind of like be thinking and trying to figure out how to revitalize that.

1785
02:54:29,485 --> 02:54:31,546
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, that's all.

1786
02:54:31,586 --> 02:54:35,569
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to make sure I could get through to you and, you know, just to see if I could get through.

1787
02:54:35,909 --> 02:54:39,252
[SPEAKER_19]: But I do want to thank you because I thought the graphics were great.

1788
02:54:39,352 --> 02:54:41,854
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of understood what's happening.

1789
02:54:41,954 --> 02:54:44,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if I agree with it, but at least I understood it.

1790
02:54:45,116 --> 02:54:45,817
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's it.

1791
02:54:45,837 --> 02:54:47,038
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank you.

1792
02:54:47,118 --> 02:54:48,780
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's my comment.

1793
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:49,481
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1794
02:54:50,261 --> 02:54:50,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1795
02:54:51,383 --> 02:54:52,063
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Lisa.

1796
02:54:52,083 --> 02:54:52,844
[SPEAKER_31]: I agree.

1797
02:54:52,924 --> 02:54:54,926
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought the graphics were great.

1798
02:54:55,106 --> 02:55:03,155
[SPEAKER_31]: And I appreciate your insight about specific points in the neighborhood that might need a little extra special attention.

1799
02:55:05,738 --> 02:55:06,598
[SPEAKER_31]: The feedback is hard.

1800
02:55:06,779 --> 02:55:07,800
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much for speaking.

1801
02:55:07,860 --> 02:55:18,510
[SPEAKER_31]: And if you are able to help Paulette deliver her comment, we'd love to hear it, whether it's through email or some other means.

1802
02:55:18,710 --> 02:55:24,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, I just wanted to let you know, normally I do these things in Medford, but I'm in Arizona doing this.

1803
02:55:25,077 --> 02:55:25,857
[SPEAKER_19]: It's incredible.

1804
02:55:26,818 --> 02:55:27,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for joining us.

1805
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:31,880
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm amazing that I'm in MedFed, but not in MedFed.

1806
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:33,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, that's it.

1807
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:33,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1808
02:55:33,961 --> 02:55:36,162
[SPEAKER_31]: That is one of the benefits of doing these virtually.

1809
02:55:36,182 --> 02:55:40,983
[SPEAKER_31]: It makes it a little bit more accessible for people who may not be able to join in person.

1810
02:55:41,103 --> 02:55:44,665
[SPEAKER_31]: But we do have to put up with a couple of challenges.

1811
02:55:44,685 --> 02:55:44,725
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

1812
02:55:44,745 --> 02:55:46,065
[SPEAKER_31]: So.

1813
02:55:52,064 --> 02:55:57,426
[SPEAKER_31]: I would like to flip this back to Emily and Paola.

1814
02:55:59,046 --> 02:56:03,127
[SPEAKER_31]: The public has provided a lot of feedback, super rich, super valuable.

1815
02:56:05,368 --> 02:56:09,889
[SPEAKER_31]: But I want to open it up just to hear back any concerns.

1816
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:15,031
[SPEAKER_31]: I have, I think about 10 pages of notes.

1817
02:56:16,231 --> 02:56:21,193
[SPEAKER_31]: So there's a lot of material to cover, and we'll at least use this as a starting point.

1818
02:56:22,721 --> 02:56:25,763
[SPEAKER_31]: So Emily and Paola, if you're able to address.

1819
02:56:28,105 --> 02:56:29,466
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

1820
02:56:30,167 --> 02:56:34,370
[SPEAKER_24]: I also want to echo your comments about hearing from the public.

1821
02:56:34,410 --> 02:56:36,351
[SPEAKER_24]: This was extraordinarily helpful.

1822
02:56:36,932 --> 02:56:50,082
[SPEAKER_24]: Really appreciate everybody who took the time to be here today to provide, whether your feedback was a criticism or an affirmation or a request for information, all of it was very important.

1823
02:56:50,602 --> 02:56:53,645
[SPEAKER_24]: We really appreciate that opportunity to hear from you.

1824
02:56:53,665 --> 02:56:54,746
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you all very much.

1825
02:56:55,947 --> 02:56:58,449
[SPEAKER_24]: I do want to address a couple of things.

1826
02:56:58,589 --> 02:57:04,874
[SPEAKER_24]: One of them is I was, I'm used to hear the person talk about the firm from London.

1827
02:57:04,914 --> 02:57:08,477
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a firm in London that has the same name that we do.

1828
02:57:08,917 --> 02:57:13,581
[SPEAKER_24]: A problem of using a last name, right, is that there are people all over the world who might have the same last name.

1829
02:57:15,142 --> 02:57:17,284
[SPEAKER_24]: We are not affiliated with that London firm.

1830
02:57:17,324 --> 02:57:19,606
[SPEAKER_24]: We are a Massachusetts-based firm.

1831
02:57:20,186 --> 02:57:21,447
[SPEAKER_24]: We have just one office.

1832
02:57:22,908 --> 02:57:31,956
[SPEAKER_24]: We're up in Newburyport, so we're relatively local, but I did want to just clarify that misunderstanding.

1833
02:57:33,037 --> 02:57:35,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Apologies to the London firm, but they're not us.

1834
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:41,043
[SPEAKER_24]: More seriously, I do want to address a couple of things.

1835
02:57:41,404 --> 02:57:42,545
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, on

1836
02:57:42,965 --> 02:57:45,147
[SPEAKER_24]: parking recommendations.

1837
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:49,630
[SPEAKER_24]: There were a few, we understand the frustration around parking.

1838
02:57:50,110 --> 02:57:51,391
[SPEAKER_24]: We do hear that.

1839
02:57:52,112 --> 02:57:58,036
[SPEAKER_24]: I did want to clarify, I think one or two people said something about not requiring parking.

1840
02:57:58,596 --> 02:58:00,658
[SPEAKER_24]: We have not changed the parking requirements.

1841
02:58:00,698 --> 02:58:03,840
[SPEAKER_24]: They're actually in the table of uses next to the use.

1842
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:07,262
[SPEAKER_24]: is how many parking spaces required for each use.

1843
02:58:07,743 --> 02:58:11,946
[SPEAKER_24]: That's actually in the city's zoning ordinance right now.

1844
02:58:11,986 --> 02:58:14,728
[SPEAKER_24]: We have made no changes to those parking requirements.

1845
02:58:16,529 --> 02:58:21,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody mentioned a parking requirement of 0.8 spaces per unit.

1846
02:58:21,693 --> 02:58:23,314
[SPEAKER_24]: That is an existing

1847
02:58:26,056 --> 02:58:30,358
[SPEAKER_24]: affordable housing requirement to promote affordable housing.

1848
02:58:30,398 --> 02:58:32,199
[SPEAKER_24]: That is not a change that we're making.

1849
02:58:32,219 --> 02:58:36,901
[SPEAKER_24]: We just brought it through because it's existing in the parking requirements.

1850
02:58:37,001 --> 02:58:38,822
[SPEAKER_24]: So just to clarify that.

1851
02:58:40,023 --> 02:58:52,950
[SPEAKER_24]: We heard a lot of concern about height proximity to the existing residential concerns about cutting off solar

1852
02:58:55,931 --> 02:59:04,575
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard from other communities, too, the idea of cutting off air, cutting off solar, cutting off, you know, creating shadow.

1853
02:59:06,235 --> 02:59:09,657
[SPEAKER_24]: We also heard that these step backs maybe don't work.

1854
02:59:09,697 --> 02:59:17,240
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a common thing to see in zoning, but, you know, that doesn't mean we shouldn't take another look at it.

1855
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:29,671
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think rather than trying to answer those questions, we would like to go back, talk to the city planning staff, just have another look at some of those provisions and come back to you.

1856
02:59:29,691 --> 02:59:36,238
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we are delighted to have public comment is to understand how best we can answer some of the concerns.

1857
02:59:36,298 --> 02:59:37,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we need to make some modifications?

1858
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:40,321
[SPEAKER_24]: We can certainly look at that.

1859
02:59:41,502 --> 02:59:50,070
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing that I heard that was kind of similar in that we should take another look at it is there were concerns about the incentive zoning.

1860
02:59:50,110 --> 02:59:52,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe some of these things were too easy.

1861
02:59:53,072 --> 03:00:05,162
[SPEAKER_24]: For the record, a single bench does not get you a story or a half story, although I could see how without specific square footages, some people might think that.

1862
03:00:05,262 --> 03:00:06,804
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can certainly take a look at that.

1863
03:00:07,424 --> 03:00:27,577
[SPEAKER_24]: We did look, I know fountain was called out, we did look at the idea of the fountain because as being worthy of some of the space because it's not just about providing the fountain, it's also the ongoing water costs which would be paid by the developer or the property owner, the maintenance costs,

1864
03:00:28,337 --> 03:00:46,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Fountains do have to be drained in the winter and repaired and restored, so it's actually a more significant cost than it might look on the face of it, but all that to say that we're happy to relook at the incentive zoning and see if there are some adjustments that we should make in talking with

1865
03:00:46,939 --> 03:00:53,941
[SPEAKER_24]: hearing the feedback from the board today or from working with the city planning staff.

1866
03:00:54,641 --> 03:01:04,423
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just checking my also 10 pages of notes to see if there's anything else specifically before I mentioned traffic.

1867
03:01:04,803 --> 03:01:14,786
[SPEAKER_24]: We did have one of the team members have been down Salem Street, so we've experienced some of the same issues.

1868
03:01:16,806 --> 03:01:17,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see.

1869
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:22,328
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a number of other things about quality of life.

1870
03:01:22,509 --> 03:01:27,851
[SPEAKER_24]: I do want to say we heard people concerned about uses around the school.

1871
03:01:29,871 --> 03:01:36,674
[SPEAKER_24]: We can certainly take another look at the table of uses and see if there's any others that should be modified based on what we've heard today.

1872
03:01:36,694 --> 03:01:45,398
[SPEAKER_24]: But one of the reasons for encouraging commercial around the school is so that if parents are walking their children to school, it being an elementary school,

1873
03:01:46,078 --> 03:01:49,884
[SPEAKER_24]: We're hoping to continue to promote the walkability of the neighborhood.

1874
03:01:49,904 --> 03:01:55,272
[SPEAKER_24]: The idea of having businesses there were that parents could run errands on their way home.

1875
03:01:56,534 --> 03:02:01,021
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe the mix of businesses isn't the right business, but that was a reason for

1876
03:02:01,722 --> 03:02:06,147
[SPEAKER_24]: And there are already businesses in that area that was a reason for clustering them there.

1877
03:02:06,167 --> 03:02:14,495
[SPEAKER_24]: The sidewalk, I think I heard somebody concerned that by widening the sidewalk, we would be narrowing the road.

1878
03:02:15,396 --> 03:02:20,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, just to clarify that, and maybe we can do another another diagram to sort of bring that out.

1879
03:02:20,781 --> 03:02:22,123
[SPEAKER_24]: But the idea is that

1880
03:02:23,224 --> 03:02:33,892
[SPEAKER_24]: They would be, if the sidewalk is, say, 8 feet, they would have to add on another 4 feet on the private property as part of the development to make the sidewalk 12 feet wide.

1881
03:02:34,332 --> 03:02:43,980
[SPEAKER_24]: We were looking for a width that would be appropriate for all users, people talking and walking next to each other, somebody pushing a stroller.

1882
03:02:44,460 --> 03:02:57,187
[SPEAKER_24]: coming maybe towards somebody who is talking with a friend, somebody in a wheelchair, so that there's the ability to have a wide enough sidewalk to have all that activity and maybe for some of the businesses a little outdoor dining in the summer.

1883
03:02:58,288 --> 03:02:59,789
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's where the width came from.

1884
03:03:00,629 --> 03:03:08,257
[SPEAKER_24]: And then finally, I do want to address traffic, infrastructure, impact on public services.

1885
03:03:08,737 --> 03:03:09,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Hear you loud and clear.

1886
03:03:09,838 --> 03:03:15,604
[SPEAKER_24]: This is something that is always of concern in the communities that we're working with.

1887
03:03:15,624 --> 03:03:18,667
[SPEAKER_24]: I think Alicia spoke to a director who spoke to it earlier.

1888
03:03:19,828 --> 03:03:35,319
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't typically do traffic studies in zoning, where the traffic studies come in place is when a specific development proposal is, can they come to the city with a proposal and the traffic studies are required at that point.

1889
03:03:36,119 --> 03:03:38,721
[SPEAKER_24]: So, no, we are not traffic engineers.

1890
03:03:38,781 --> 03:03:39,641
[SPEAKER_24]: We are planners.

1891
03:03:40,142 --> 03:03:41,022
[SPEAKER_24]: We are urban designers.

1892
03:03:41,062 --> 03:03:46,266
[SPEAKER_24]: We have not done traffic studies as part of this, but we hear your concern.

1893
03:03:46,846 --> 03:03:49,168
[SPEAKER_24]: We will continue to talk with

1894
03:03:49,508 --> 03:03:53,315
[SPEAKER_24]: With our client, the city about those concerns and we appreciate that.

1895
03:03:53,335 --> 03:03:56,280
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's hit.

1896
03:03:57,777 --> 03:04:01,079
[SPEAKER_24]: most of the sort of the high level questions.

1897
03:04:01,599 --> 03:04:03,239
[SPEAKER_24]: I noticed Paola was taking notes.

1898
03:04:03,299 --> 03:04:05,540
[SPEAKER_24]: I think members of the city staff are taking notes.

1899
03:04:06,021 --> 03:04:14,544
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will go back through and anything that we feel that we haven't addressed, we're happy to talk about the ways of getting that information out to people.

1900
03:04:15,365 --> 03:04:21,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Alicia, I don't know if there's anything on your side that you also want to address or Paola, if you have anything else you want to add.

1901
03:04:23,328 --> 03:04:25,229
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, Alicia, Paola, if you have anything to add.

1902
03:04:28,533 --> 03:04:32,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would love to add, these are all very good questions.

1903
03:04:32,875 --> 03:04:42,161
[SPEAKER_17]: I have every one of you in here, Carlos, Dave, Maria Elena, Zachary, Cheryl, Klein, Julissa, Doreen, Melanie.

1904
03:04:42,262 --> 03:04:43,342
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to read them all.

1905
03:04:43,722 --> 03:04:44,883
[SPEAKER_17]: I have all your comments.

1906
03:04:45,384 --> 03:04:49,726
[SPEAKER_17]: I do understand that you're worried, you own a house.

1907
03:04:51,400 --> 03:04:53,741
[SPEAKER_17]: and it seems that we are modifying a lot.

1908
03:04:54,121 --> 03:04:56,343
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to clarify certain things.

1909
03:04:57,883 --> 03:05:05,227
[SPEAKER_17]: The heights that we have are exactly the same as you have, except for the incentive zoning.

1910
03:05:05,768 --> 03:05:07,689
[SPEAKER_17]: The incentive zoning are only

1911
03:05:09,150 --> 03:05:11,291
[SPEAKER_17]: for the lots facing Salem Street.

1912
03:05:11,952 --> 03:05:19,239
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're not facing Salem Street, you're going to have a three maximum if you're in MX1 and four if you're in MX2.

1913
03:05:19,739 --> 03:05:23,122
[SPEAKER_17]: So those two things I wanted to be very clear.

1914
03:05:24,143 --> 03:05:28,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Things like brewery we do not allow in MX1 and MX2.

1915
03:05:29,608 --> 03:05:31,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Lab or research are not allowed.

1916
03:05:32,690 --> 03:05:34,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Marijuana of course are not allowed.

1917
03:05:34,672 --> 03:05:37,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't remember winery, but we can look into that.

1918
03:05:38,456 --> 03:05:50,969
[SPEAKER_17]: There are also other ordinances that are not in zoning that if it's next to a school, you cannot have a marijuana establishment next to certain distance to the school.

1919
03:05:51,369 --> 03:05:57,275
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are other things that protect, obviously, child and public safety.

1920
03:05:59,358 --> 03:06:17,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure that we understand that when we are talking about commercial one a lot of things can happen right now with your current zoning and that is the hotel 15 stories high so there are things that we do need to change or that I think I recommend that it should be changed because it does not

1921
03:06:18,898 --> 03:06:19,998
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not what you have now.

1922
03:06:20,418 --> 03:06:22,719
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't protect.

1923
03:06:23,199 --> 03:06:25,159
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a lot of traffic.

1924
03:06:25,640 --> 03:06:27,200
[SPEAKER_17]: That's definitely adding traffic.

1925
03:06:28,060 --> 03:06:35,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Apartment two in the other side of Felsway is 15 stories high and six stories all residential.

1926
03:06:35,102 --> 03:06:41,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So commercial one and apartment two are six stories by right, which we are not doing that.

1927
03:06:41,463 --> 03:06:44,164
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing four plus the incentive zoning.

1928
03:06:44,964 --> 03:06:47,347
[SPEAKER_17]: So those things to make very sure.

1929
03:06:48,329 --> 03:06:51,112
[SPEAKER_17]: In the incentive zonings, I've heard great ideas.

1930
03:06:51,193 --> 03:06:56,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we do need to do something about the distance or

1931
03:06:57,295 --> 03:07:01,078
[SPEAKER_17]: so that we don't have a fountain every 100 meters.

1932
03:07:01,498 --> 03:07:06,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that's a good point and that we should address and we would love to study that.

1933
03:07:07,382 --> 03:07:13,786
[SPEAKER_17]: We want the developers have to give something back to the community if they gain some density.

1934
03:07:14,086 --> 03:07:17,649
[SPEAKER_17]: So of course, in our mind is always the community.

1935
03:07:19,230 --> 03:07:21,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to share one map where we are going to talk

1936
03:07:22,512 --> 03:07:26,154
[SPEAKER_17]: We are studying a lot of different neighborhoods.

1937
03:07:26,615 --> 03:07:28,096
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not only Salem Street.

1938
03:07:28,516 --> 03:07:29,997
[SPEAKER_17]: We did Mystic Avenue.

1939
03:07:30,997 --> 03:07:33,619
[SPEAKER_17]: We are now going to the residential neighborhood.

1940
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:37,802
[SPEAKER_17]: We are doing other corridors like Boston Avenue.

1941
03:07:37,822 --> 03:07:43,405
[SPEAKER_17]: We will look into Wellington area as a transformation.

1942
03:07:43,425 --> 03:07:46,167
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to give a plan that we have for 2025.

1943
03:07:47,828 --> 03:07:51,531
[SPEAKER_17]: until June 30th, all the different topics that we will look into.

1944
03:07:51,591 --> 03:07:58,297
[SPEAKER_17]: We will look into non-conformities as well, and how to address it, streamline certain processes.

1945
03:07:58,697 --> 03:08:09,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So I encourage all that are interested to connect to planning and committee meetings, because we're going to talk a lot about your zoning.

1946
03:08:10,267 --> 03:08:11,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And we love these comments.

1947
03:08:15,372 --> 03:08:16,713
[SPEAKER_17]: What else I have here?

1948
03:08:16,773 --> 03:08:17,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1949
03:08:18,995 --> 03:08:23,858
[SPEAKER_24]: If you don't mind me interrupting, we forgot to mention West Medford square and Medford square.

1950
03:08:23,898 --> 03:08:25,719
[SPEAKER_24]: We're also zoning for that.

1951
03:08:25,879 --> 03:08:36,187
[SPEAKER_24]: So it really is our remit is to look town wide to in response to the comments and the recommendations of the comprehensive plan.

1952
03:08:37,259 --> 03:08:37,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you.

1953
03:08:37,879 --> 03:08:39,400
[SPEAKER_17]: That was another thing.

1954
03:08:40,060 --> 03:08:53,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, sometimes it seems that we are doing the opposite, what we're trying to do with these type of mixed neighborhoods, which are going to be not only in Salem Street and Mystic, are going to be also in the squares.

1955
03:08:53,165 --> 03:08:56,907
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to have some nodes in the residential districts.

1956
03:08:56,967 --> 03:08:59,548
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we create this

1957
03:09:01,710 --> 03:09:07,504
[SPEAKER_17]: areas where you do need to do your basic needs, groceries, a cafe, a bakery,

1958
03:09:09,672 --> 03:09:13,295
[SPEAKER_17]: that needs to, so in order to make it more walkable.

1959
03:09:13,656 --> 03:09:16,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't have one stone in the city and then the rest is residential.

1960
03:09:16,938 --> 03:09:22,143
[SPEAKER_17]: We try to do this mix so that it is more walkable and we need less car.

1961
03:09:22,583 --> 03:09:32,712
[SPEAKER_17]: So these type of developments, what it tried is to serve the neighborhood so that the people in the neighborhood would walk towards these stores and it's not really traffic

1962
03:09:35,637 --> 03:09:39,639
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are some of the answers that I wanted to give.

1963
03:09:40,039 --> 03:09:42,480
[SPEAKER_17]: We also talked to the Department of Public Works.

1964
03:09:43,340 --> 03:09:47,062
[SPEAKER_17]: We told about that they are designing new layout for the street.

1965
03:09:47,122 --> 03:09:52,864
[SPEAKER_17]: They do understand the problems that the street is facing, but it's not on zoning.

1966
03:09:52,964 --> 03:09:55,545
[SPEAKER_17]: That's on their side about their layout.

1967
03:09:56,325 --> 03:10:01,647
[SPEAKER_17]: But we did talk about this with them to see if there was any issues from their end.

1968
03:10:03,267 --> 03:10:04,589
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's it.

1969
03:10:06,310 --> 03:10:09,353
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I also heard comments about the economic impacts.

1970
03:10:11,796 --> 03:10:16,220
[SPEAKER_31]: There was a question around taxes, impacts on businesses.

1971
03:10:16,240 --> 03:10:19,444
[SPEAKER_31]: I would love to have some more info on that.

1972
03:10:21,062 --> 03:10:25,623
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, sorry, Alicia, go ahead on that.

1973
03:10:26,324 --> 03:10:31,805
[SPEAKER_27]: I say, perhaps some of the things comments that I was going to offer sort of dovetail around that.

1974
03:10:32,606 --> 03:10:38,067
[SPEAKER_27]: So, in the picture way, we do have a Department of Economic Development that falls under our office.

1975
03:10:38,127 --> 03:10:42,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Our economic development director was on here earlier this evening, listening in.

1976
03:10:43,589 --> 03:10:56,136
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we do have people now since only since 2021, who go out and recruit and look for new businesses and encourage different kinds of businesses to come in.

1977
03:10:57,417 --> 03:11:02,019
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think I'm speaking out of, well, let me just say that they have been working on that.

1978
03:11:02,099 --> 03:11:07,202
[SPEAKER_27]: And there are some things that are coming soon that are very exciting, particularly in Medford Square.

1979
03:11:09,449 --> 03:11:14,991
[SPEAKER_27]: And along those lines, we also work a lot with the Chamber of Commerce.

1980
03:11:15,411 --> 03:11:23,135
[SPEAKER_27]: And so the Chamber of Commerce held a coffee for businesses last week to talk about Salem Street zoning.

1981
03:11:23,835 --> 03:11:34,039
[SPEAKER_27]: And they mailed it out to chamber members, but the executive director of the chamber told me that she went door to door and flyer to every business in Haines Square and talked to business owners.

1982
03:11:34,479 --> 03:11:39,606
[SPEAKER_27]: and tried to get them to come to that meeting that we were going to be talking about zoning in Haines Square.

1983
03:11:39,626 --> 03:11:50,380
[SPEAKER_27]: And I do not believe that any of the people who were there for that Chamber of Commerce event were actually from Haines Square.

1984
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:56,184
[SPEAKER_27]: and she was very frustrated by that because she went and spoke to business owners throughout Haynes Square.

1985
03:11:56,825 --> 03:12:06,913
[SPEAKER_27]: I do walk and bike up Salem Street myself and have, in doing that, talked to some owners, business owners, a lot in Haynes Square about this.

1986
03:12:07,513 --> 03:12:17,681
[SPEAKER_27]: In particular, one who owns a building that would love to have apartments on top of his business and he's previously been turned down by the Zoning Board of Appeals from doing that.

1987
03:12:18,201 --> 03:12:19,683
[SPEAKER_27]: and this would allow them to do that.

1988
03:12:20,043 --> 03:12:31,917
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a different building that had a small apartment above their business and that restaurant has in fact gotten permission, you may have seen Fiore Italy expanding the apartments above his property.

1989
03:12:32,818 --> 03:12:36,442
[SPEAKER_27]: So we know that there are interests from existing business owners

1990
03:12:37,864 --> 03:12:46,109
[SPEAKER_27]: There was some comment that we are getting like tons of developers and we're only answering to developers and that there's like a demo permit.

1991
03:12:46,390 --> 03:12:54,235
[SPEAKER_27]: I personally have to sign all demo permits in the city and I haven't seen one for Salem Street in the last six months.

1992
03:12:55,016 --> 03:12:56,357
[SPEAKER_27]: I've spoken to one developer

1993
03:12:56,837 --> 03:13:01,519
[SPEAKER_27]: who is interested in a property that has already come up in front of the city.

1994
03:13:01,659 --> 03:13:07,682
[SPEAKER_27]: There was some talking about it, but the property owner at 360 Salem Street still seems to be interested in change.

1995
03:13:08,363 --> 03:13:20,929
[SPEAKER_27]: And the latest developer who's interested in his property wants to do ground floor commercial with two floors of residential above, which is not currently allowed by zoning, which feels that it would fit here.

1996
03:13:21,469 --> 03:13:24,451
[SPEAKER_27]: And the Park Street, the corner of Park and Salem,

1997
03:13:25,331 --> 03:13:26,712
[SPEAKER_27]: The pit, I'm sorry.

1998
03:13:27,092 --> 03:13:27,472
[SPEAKER_27]: It is.

1999
03:13:28,813 --> 03:13:34,395
[SPEAKER_27]: They have all the permissions that they need to build that building and they've had them for more than seven months.

2000
03:13:34,796 --> 03:13:38,597
[SPEAKER_27]: And I've been told that it's back on the market being sold again.

2001
03:13:38,938 --> 03:13:40,999
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's just so much that we can do.

2002
03:13:41,039 --> 03:13:43,060
[SPEAKER_27]: We give somebody permission to build the building.

2003
03:13:43,580 --> 03:13:46,901
[SPEAKER_27]: If they don't build it, we really actually can't force them to.

2004
03:13:48,102 --> 03:13:50,263
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm not aware of other development.

2005
03:13:50,803 --> 03:13:54,065
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will say that we strongly encourage developers to come talk

2006
03:13:54,165 --> 03:13:57,808
[SPEAKER_27]: to us about what's allowed, what might be allowed, how do you work with the city.

2007
03:13:58,168 --> 03:14:04,933
[SPEAKER_27]: So if other people on this call are saying, but I want to open a business, please reach out to our office.

2008
03:14:05,033 --> 03:14:06,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Our economic development staff want to help you.

2009
03:14:07,395 --> 03:14:12,319
[SPEAKER_27]: Or you know a developer and they're not talking, they should talk to us, please.

2010
03:14:12,919 --> 03:14:13,720
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

2011
03:14:15,341 --> 03:14:18,123
[SPEAKER_31]: That's really, really helpful insight, Alicia.

2012
03:14:19,605 --> 03:14:22,106
[SPEAKER_31]: And it seems like a lot of people shared

2013
03:14:24,016 --> 03:14:37,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Like personal anecdotes or information that that they've, you know, heard, and I would say, you know, the best way to, you know, to process that information is, you know, share information with the city because they can they can confirm.

2014
03:14:40,592 --> 03:14:46,956
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's helpful for us on the board to know specifics, just so we can have more context.

2015
03:14:47,676 --> 03:14:49,377
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, Medford's huge.

2016
03:14:49,937 --> 03:14:51,058
[SPEAKER_31]: We can't be everywhere at once.

2017
03:14:53,339 --> 03:14:55,541
[SPEAKER_31]: I patronize a couple of businesses on Salem Street.

2018
03:14:56,061 --> 03:15:00,023
[SPEAKER_31]: I get caught in the gridlock on Salem every once in a while.

2019
03:15:00,143 --> 03:15:02,825
[SPEAKER_31]: And Massachusetts drivers have no mercy.

2020
03:15:03,185 --> 03:15:05,106
[SPEAKER_31]: So I definitely feel that pain.

2021
03:15:07,087 --> 03:15:10,010
[SPEAKER_31]: But yeah, it's helpful for us to have as much information as possible.

2022
03:15:10,110 --> 03:15:20,278
[SPEAKER_31]: And you all are really doing yourselves and everybody else in Medford present and future a service by being involved with this process.

2023
03:15:21,659 --> 03:15:24,621
[SPEAKER_31]: I do see a hand that has been raised.

2024
03:15:24,681 --> 03:15:26,383
[SPEAKER_31]: We are still in the public comment period.

2025
03:15:26,403 --> 03:15:34,690
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just want to clarify that we might close public comment period tonight, but it doesn't mean we're closing it for the whole hearing.

2026
03:15:36,887 --> 03:15:43,536
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm curious to hear from my board, but I'm leaning towards continuing the discussion, continuing the hearing.

2027
03:15:44,257 --> 03:15:53,269
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of big work that needs to be done, hearing that from the public, from the board members.

2028
03:15:54,548 --> 03:15:59,934
[SPEAKER_31]: For myself, from Emily and Paula, from Alicia and Danielle, there's still a lot of work to be done.

2029
03:15:59,995 --> 03:16:09,025
[SPEAKER_31]: So just to give people a preview, this is not the end of hearing from you and hearing from us and receiving information.

2030
03:16:11,615 --> 03:16:17,056
[SPEAKER_31]: With that, I want to go to the hand that I see raised, zoning for the people.

2031
03:16:17,816 --> 03:16:21,417
[SPEAKER_31]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2032
03:16:21,717 --> 03:16:26,197
[SPEAKER_31]: You're going to get a request to unmute, and Alicia will start the timer.

2033
03:16:26,217 --> 03:16:38,920
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to send that unmute request again.

2034
03:16:38,940 --> 03:16:41,160
[SPEAKER_31]: This is for zoning for people.

2035
03:16:47,350 --> 03:16:48,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me now?

2036
03:16:48,570 --> 03:16:49,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, hi.

2037
03:16:49,471 --> 03:16:52,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Madam Chairperson.

2038
03:16:52,972 --> 03:16:54,372
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry to speak again.

2039
03:16:54,393 --> 03:16:56,653
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Jean Nuzzo at 35 Parrish Street.

2040
03:16:57,053 --> 03:17:09,318
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so sorry, we've tried to- Just hold on, let me, I didn't hear a response to my question relevant to 31 and why they were zoned for multi-use with incentivized and my parcel was not.

2041
03:17:10,078 --> 03:17:11,439
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like that answer.

2042
03:17:11,539 --> 03:17:12,820
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a new statement.

2043
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:19,424
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just pointing out the fact that this zoning consultant and this team did not answer my question.

2044
03:17:19,804 --> 03:17:28,009
[SPEAKER_16]: They came well beyond where they've gone everywhere else to that parcel that's smaller than mine and gave him inclusionary zoning and stopped there.

2045
03:17:28,289 --> 03:17:33,372
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to understand from them what their criteria was for doing that, if you don't mind.

2046
03:17:33,532 --> 03:17:34,173
[SPEAKER_31]: I hear that.

2047
03:17:34,513 --> 03:17:36,434
[SPEAKER_31]: And I did take that note.

2048
03:17:39,186 --> 03:17:42,829
[SPEAKER_31]: And maybe to provide some more context, because I'm sure we didn't answer every question.

2049
03:17:42,869 --> 03:17:44,231
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no way we could.

2050
03:17:44,291 --> 03:17:48,635
[SPEAKER_31]: There's so much rich content here for us to process.

2051
03:17:49,295 --> 03:17:51,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Because people might have the similar question.

2052
03:17:51,877 --> 03:18:03,488
[SPEAKER_27]: When we were having our public meetings back with the city council, one of the things we've said to people, and I realize we didn't say this evening, is that we looked at what exists and what seemed to make sense for us.

2053
03:18:03,848 --> 03:18:05,530
[SPEAKER_27]: But if there is a property owner,

2054
03:18:06,070 --> 03:18:23,710
[SPEAKER_27]: whose parcel is adjacent to this and they feel that their parcel is not correctly zoned we are very open to that send us you know your address and we can look and see if it should or should not be included because the property owners desire to be

2055
03:18:25,832 --> 03:18:27,412
[SPEAKER_27]: is a really valid one.

2056
03:18:28,153 --> 03:18:37,215
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm saying this not just to that speaker, but to anybody who wanted their particular parcel.

2057
03:18:37,815 --> 03:18:39,055
[SPEAKER_27]: That is very helpful for us.

2058
03:18:40,055 --> 03:18:41,816
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm hearing the address.

2059
03:18:42,676 --> 03:18:45,756
[SPEAKER_31]: Jean, I'm going to unmute you really quickly just to confirm the address.

2060
03:18:45,816 --> 03:18:47,617
[SPEAKER_31]: So we make sure we have that crystal clear.

2061
03:18:47,637 --> 03:18:50,697
[SPEAKER_31]: I encourage anybody else who has a similar concern, reach out to the city.

2062
03:18:51,118 --> 03:18:51,778
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll go from there.

2063
03:18:55,329 --> 03:18:57,611
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, shoot, I just accidentally muted you.

2064
03:18:57,871 --> 03:19:02,355
[SPEAKER_31]: So Jean, that address is 31 Parrish Street, is that correct?

2065
03:19:02,795 --> 03:19:05,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Paris Lake, France, they're 31 and I'm 35.

2066
03:19:06,418 --> 03:19:08,179
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, okay, that's why I couldn't find it.

2067
03:19:09,660 --> 03:19:09,920
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

2068
03:19:11,542 --> 03:19:12,663
[SPEAKER_31]: Awesome, thank you so much.

2069
03:19:12,963 --> 03:19:14,824
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate your advocacy for yourself.

2070
03:19:15,585 --> 03:19:18,707
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you so much for your patience this evening.

2071
03:19:19,308 --> 03:19:22,130
[SPEAKER_31]: Sounds like there could be a path forward here that works for you.

2072
03:19:29,282 --> 03:19:33,204
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no incentive zonings when they are not facing Salem Street.

2073
03:19:33,744 --> 03:19:38,686
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is an MX because it's already a multi residential building.

2074
03:19:39,266 --> 03:19:40,327
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why it's an MX1.

2075
03:19:42,308 --> 03:19:49,573
[SPEAKER_17]: We can obviously study if we include other adjunct abutters to that one, as Alicia said.

2076
03:19:51,034 --> 03:19:53,215
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing is that these do not have incentives.

2077
03:19:53,395 --> 03:19:58,339
[SPEAKER_17]: The incentives are only for Salem Street facing lots.

2078
03:19:58,859 --> 03:19:59,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2079
03:19:59,199 --> 03:20:04,703
[SPEAKER_31]: And then to specifically ask about that property, as it is now, is it currently non-conforming?

2080
03:20:08,725 --> 03:20:16,391
[SPEAKER_31]: I need to- Okay, let's get back to that.

2081
03:20:17,011 --> 03:20:24,957
[SPEAKER_31]: If it's not non-conforming, then maybe there is little to no case to change the zoning for that specific parcel.

2082
03:20:27,699 --> 03:20:31,701
[SPEAKER_24]: We did multiple tests of non-conformity.

2083
03:20:31,822 --> 03:20:36,505
[SPEAKER_24]: We can go back and check the maps and see what that looks like.

2084
03:20:37,214 --> 03:20:39,215
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's very helpful having the addresses.

2085
03:20:39,275 --> 03:20:41,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much for providing them.

2086
03:20:41,877 --> 03:20:44,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't quite hear it when you mentioned the address earlier.

2087
03:20:44,358 --> 03:20:47,780
[SPEAKER_24]: So thanks again to have this meeting.

2088
03:20:47,800 --> 03:20:52,222
[SPEAKER_31]: Not that it matters, but you'll see some notes come on your way.

2089
03:20:54,163 --> 03:20:57,505
[SPEAKER_31]: So Ari, I see your hand raised.

2090
03:20:58,346 --> 03:21:00,807
[SPEAKER_31]: I know you're feeling a little under the weather this evening.

2091
03:21:00,827 --> 03:21:06,210
[SPEAKER_31]: Is that what you're giving us a heads up on?

2092
03:21:07,195 --> 03:21:15,144
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to, before calling it an evening, I was going to make a motion for a vote to continue this to a date certain.

2093
03:21:15,164 --> 03:21:22,331
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've gotten a lot of great feedback, and at least to me, the very obvious next step is to go and do a bunch of work.

2094
03:21:23,112 --> 03:21:27,397
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to make that motion, barring anyone having other comment.

2095
03:21:27,457 --> 03:21:28,358
[SPEAKER_18]: I see Peter's hand.

2096
03:21:29,608 --> 03:21:36,873
[SPEAKER_31]: So why don't I, I think procedurally, I do need to close the public comment period for this evening, correct?

2097
03:21:38,895 --> 03:21:40,936
[SPEAKER_31]: No, Danielle's shaking her head.

2098
03:21:40,956 --> 03:21:43,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chair, no, you don't have to do that.

2099
03:21:43,859 --> 03:21:44,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2100
03:21:44,659 --> 03:21:48,222
[SPEAKER_15]: You can just close in the public comment tonight.

2101
03:21:51,596 --> 03:21:52,417
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm confused now.

2102
03:21:52,997 --> 03:21:58,022
[SPEAKER_27]: You just have the emotion, you can just say, we're not going to take any more public comment tonight.

2103
03:21:58,182 --> 03:22:01,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, closing it here.

2104
03:22:01,545 --> 03:22:02,866
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not tonight.

2105
03:22:03,487 --> 03:22:07,570
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you voted on it as a cherry of the discretion to just do that.

2106
03:22:08,071 --> 03:22:08,191
So

2107
03:22:09,653 --> 03:22:12,536
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know what to do with my powers, I guess.

2108
03:22:13,436 --> 03:22:15,118
[SPEAKER_31]: But I appreciate everybody's patience.

2109
03:22:15,558 --> 03:22:17,840
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the second meeting where I'm chair.

2110
03:22:18,561 --> 03:22:22,644
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're all learning together, and I really appreciate everybody's patience.

2111
03:22:23,165 --> 03:22:26,408
[SPEAKER_31]: So at this time, oh, Adam.

2112
03:22:28,069 --> 03:22:31,832
[SPEAKER_31]: At this time, we are going to close the public comment for tonight.

2113
03:22:33,213 --> 03:22:34,915
[SPEAKER_31]: That brings it to board deliberations.

2114
03:22:37,893 --> 03:22:39,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Ari, I heard your motion.

2115
03:22:40,034 --> 03:22:46,317
[SPEAKER_31]: Would you like to just make it again just to make sure we're kind of doing the right order of operations?

2116
03:22:47,337 --> 03:22:47,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure thing.

2117
03:22:48,638 --> 03:22:51,479
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to move that we continue this.

2118
03:22:51,819 --> 03:22:57,321
[SPEAKER_18]: And is this a situation where we want to do it to date certain or just general?

2119
03:22:57,641 --> 03:22:58,902
[SPEAKER_27]: To do it to a date certain.

2120
03:22:59,397 --> 03:23:00,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's what I thought.

2121
03:23:00,679 --> 03:23:07,349
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I quickly I think different from emotion to table, which is like undebatable and you wouldn't take any additional comment.

2122
03:23:07,730 --> 03:23:12,978
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I just want to recognize that you may want to hear from other members of the board before you actually vote to.

2123
03:23:16,418 --> 03:23:18,759
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, I'm in support of continuing.

2124
03:23:18,779 --> 03:23:21,019
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we've got a lot of work to do.

2125
03:23:21,319 --> 03:23:23,820
[SPEAKER_31]: Annie, I see you're unmuted, shaking your head.

2126
03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:27,201
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I totally support that.

2127
03:23:27,321 --> 03:23:35,603
[SPEAKER_30]: This is just the beginning of the conversation, so I definitely agree we need to move it to a specific date and continue the conversation.

2128
03:23:38,805 --> 03:23:43,930
[SPEAKER_31]: Peter, did you have any insight you wanted to offer, or were you looking to?

2129
03:23:44,510 --> 03:24:01,245
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was going to say just based on what I've heard both from the public comment and both from Emily and Paola from Menace Associates, it seems like they have things they want to apply further before we make any definitive, before we make any decisions on this.

2130
03:24:02,737 --> 03:24:07,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would also just a point of, just an administrative point of clarification.

2131
03:24:09,282 --> 03:24:15,226
[SPEAKER_08]: When you opened the public hearing, it was for both Salem Street and the green score zoning, which we haven't yet heard about.

2132
03:24:15,966 --> 03:24:24,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we, for administrative reasons, need to hear the green score zoning because it's part of the same item?

2133
03:24:25,133 --> 03:24:31,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Or can we vote to continue just Salem Street and then hear the green score zoning?

2134
03:24:33,389 --> 03:24:36,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do we have to, are those two things linked?

2135
03:24:36,392 --> 03:24:37,433
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

2136
03:24:37,453 --> 03:24:40,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really an administrative question, sorry.

2137
03:24:41,536 --> 03:24:48,222
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, that's the really exciting part of this work, but very important.

2138
03:24:48,322 --> 03:24:53,486
[SPEAKER_31]: We have to do things the right way, consistently, so that people know what they're getting into.

2139
03:24:53,607 --> 03:24:54,427
[SPEAKER_31]: Danielle, I see your hand.

2140
03:24:54,447 --> 03:24:55,428
[SPEAKER_31]: Did you have an answer to that?

2141
03:24:55,448 --> 03:24:57,410
[SPEAKER_31]: Or do you want me to go through one?

2142
03:24:58,858 --> 03:25:02,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I can help you with the procedural question.

2143
03:25:03,021 --> 03:25:07,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically, it was two papers that were referred out of committee.

2144
03:25:07,444 --> 03:25:14,628
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is a phased zoning overhaul where we're breaking it up into bite-sized pieces.

2145
03:25:14,688 --> 03:25:15,569
[SPEAKER_15]: So you opened it.

2146
03:25:16,209 --> 03:25:16,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2147
03:25:17,370 --> 03:25:17,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you could.

2148
03:25:18,431 --> 03:25:21,993
[SPEAKER_31]: And I included the green zone content as part of the open public hearing.

2149
03:25:24,812 --> 03:25:28,955
[SPEAKER_31]: So I guess we could technically close the for this evening.

2150
03:25:28,975 --> 03:25:30,697
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to make sure that's super.

2151
03:25:30,717 --> 03:25:33,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, continuing the public hearing.

2152
03:25:33,439 --> 03:25:34,320
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't get to it.

2153
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:38,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't think that is a problem.

2154
03:25:38,643 --> 03:25:43,207
[SPEAKER_15]: And for as far as the dates, so the next one is February 5th.

2155
03:25:45,754 --> 03:26:00,280
[SPEAKER_31]: So Danielle what you're saying is, maybe we hold on the green zone this evening, and then as part of the continuation because we are we are approaching 10 o'clock, you know, we participants at 108 we've lost 60.

2156
03:26:00,440 --> 03:26:04,202
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to make sure that this is something that you know we we have.

2157
03:26:05,342 --> 03:26:29,910
[SPEAKER_31]: um four and four yeah critical mass and and full support and full participation around so i i like that approach i'm curious to hear from the board if anybody has any uh objection i think that's no i mean i i i think that's fine i mean like i said i think i think from every everything i've heard from both the public and from ellie and paula there's work to be done on this so i'd prefer

2158
03:26:30,971 --> 03:26:31,912
[SPEAKER_08]: let that work be done.

2159
03:26:31,952 --> 03:26:39,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we deliberate, we deliberate on a finished product that people believe is a finished product.

2160
03:26:39,635 --> 03:26:39,815
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2161
03:26:40,716 --> 03:26:41,056
[SPEAKER_31]: Agreed.

2162
03:26:41,076 --> 03:26:47,719
[SPEAKER_31]: Ben, Adam, Sabrina, any thoughts?

2163
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:50,241
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2164
03:26:50,301 --> 03:26:52,001
[SPEAKER_41]: I'll just, can you hear me okay, Emily?

2165
03:26:52,021 --> 03:26:52,262
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2166
03:26:52,722 --> 03:26:52,922
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2167
03:26:53,002 --> 03:26:53,322
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

2168
03:26:53,382 --> 03:26:53,542
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry.

2169
03:26:53,562 --> 03:26:54,643
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm still in transit.

2170
03:26:54,763 --> 03:26:54,843
[SPEAKER_41]: Um,

2171
03:26:56,533 --> 03:27:18,662
[SPEAKER_41]: very very compelling round of public commentary very thoughtful and thorough and i just want to convey appreciation i also live just outside the square and consider the salem street corridor to be my neighborhood in many ways um kids at the roberts the whole deal so i just really appreciate

2172
03:27:19,662 --> 03:27:23,566
[SPEAKER_41]: Everything that was said tonight, a couple highlights for me, I'll be brief.

2173
03:27:25,287 --> 03:27:35,516
[SPEAKER_41]: Honoring the residents and taxpayers as part of the process, addressing the why, and trying to really specifically outline the potential benefits.

2174
03:27:35,836 --> 03:27:42,082
[SPEAKER_41]: I think the consulting firm did that partially tonight, so I appreciate that and hopefully we'll hear more of that.

2175
03:27:43,203 --> 03:27:59,270
[SPEAKER_41]: Definitely heard the concerns about traffic, the commentary around the Roberts being a really central part of this entire rezoning considered plan, public safety and services, and importantly, I'm glad we addressed it.

2176
03:28:00,450 --> 03:28:02,991
[SPEAKER_41]: Emily, you addressed it, and I appreciate that.

2177
03:28:03,552 --> 03:28:15,277
[SPEAKER_41]: Understanding parcel-specific concerns, and I'll just put another plug in for if you have a parcel-specific concern, please, you know, make it known, reach out to the city, have the conversation.

2178
03:28:15,417 --> 03:28:18,898
[SPEAKER_41]: So definitely a lot more conversation needed.

2179
03:28:18,918 --> 03:28:21,719
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm supportive of revisiting the whole topic.

2180
03:28:23,660 --> 03:28:24,200
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Ben.

2181
03:28:24,220 --> 03:28:27,862
[SPEAKER_31]: I have thumbs up from Adam.

2182
03:28:30,285 --> 03:28:31,485
[SPEAKER_31]: Thumbs up, Sabrina.

2183
03:28:31,545 --> 03:28:31,825
[SPEAKER_31]: Cool.

2184
03:28:32,526 --> 03:28:38,607
[SPEAKER_31]: So at this point, I'm going to close the public comment period for this evening.

2185
03:28:40,707 --> 03:28:53,730
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're going to be looking for a motion to continue both the zoning topic and the green zone topic to a date certain, which looks like it's February 5th.

2186
03:28:53,871 --> 03:28:58,652
[SPEAKER_31]: I know that we have a continuance from Tufts University that evening.

2187
03:29:00,712 --> 03:29:08,296
[SPEAKER_31]: do we have any other anticipated topics in front of the board that evening?

2188
03:29:09,296 --> 03:29:15,279
[SPEAKER_30]: No, we have something up in that bridal path area.

2189
03:29:15,760 --> 03:29:24,064
[SPEAKER_15]: There's Madam Chair, through the chair, yes, there's the subdivision that still needs to be voted on, but that should be rather quick.

2190
03:29:24,204 --> 03:29:28,906
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just basically the punch list from the city engineer.

2191
03:29:29,516 --> 03:29:35,182
[SPEAKER_15]: changes to the plans, and the Tufts one is a wild card.

2192
03:29:37,144 --> 03:29:41,589
[SPEAKER_15]: That is all that we, I believe it's the only items that are on the agenda.

2193
03:29:42,249 --> 03:29:51,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I should note that the 19th is the next, is the second, or no, the first and third, is the third, and that is February vacation week, and I would,

2194
03:29:52,708 --> 03:29:56,590
[SPEAKER_15]: probably advise not zoning on the vacation week.

2195
03:29:57,270 --> 03:29:59,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be away, but I've called in on vacations.

2196
03:29:59,912 --> 03:30:00,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be in Vermont.

2197
03:30:01,333 --> 03:30:04,374
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would not be good for the residents.

2198
03:30:04,955 --> 03:30:05,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

2199
03:30:05,435 --> 03:30:09,137
[SPEAKER_15]: People are going to be out of town.

2200
03:30:09,157 --> 03:30:10,478
[SPEAKER_30]: So I would not continue to that date.

2201
03:30:12,159 --> 03:30:14,220
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, what if we start with the fifth?

2202
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:17,222
[SPEAKER_31]: Because we still have the green zone.

2203
03:30:18,162 --> 03:30:18,803
[SPEAKER_31]: Green score.

2204
03:30:19,443 --> 03:30:20,624
[SPEAKER_31]: Green score, excuse me.

2205
03:30:22,285 --> 03:30:26,847
[SPEAKER_31]: My brain stops working after 10, so it's good we're continuing.

2206
03:30:26,867 --> 03:30:35,212
[SPEAKER_31]: But we have the green score, and then we can see where we are in terms of responses to these public comments and kind of go from there.

2207
03:30:37,515 --> 03:30:42,078
[SPEAKER_31]: What I heard again and again, and I totally agree with, is like, you know, let's not rush this.

2208
03:30:42,098 --> 03:30:49,943
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think we need to just stop, but I think we need to make sure that we're proceeding thoughtfully, intentionally.

2209
03:30:49,963 --> 03:30:55,507
[SPEAKER_31]: And I really appreciate the work Emily and Paola have done, as well as Danielle and Alicia.

2210
03:30:56,223 --> 03:30:58,585
[SPEAKER_31]: to put this in the right direction.

2211
03:30:58,605 --> 03:31:02,988
[SPEAKER_31]: So all our powers combined, we got this.

2212
03:31:04,128 --> 03:31:06,990
[SPEAKER_31]: So again, I'm looking for a motion to continue.

2213
03:31:07,871 --> 03:31:18,698
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll make a motion to continue the discussion on the Salem Corridor and on Green on February 5th.

2214
03:31:20,059 --> 03:31:20,859
[SPEAKER_31]: Looking for a second.

2215
03:31:20,879 --> 03:31:23,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I second.

2216
03:31:24,246 --> 03:31:24,826
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Peter.

2217
03:31:25,186 --> 03:31:27,267
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

2218
03:31:28,028 --> 03:31:30,789
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just going to do them as I see them.

2219
03:31:31,710 --> 03:31:32,410
[SPEAKER_31]: Adam Behrens.

2220
03:31:38,513 --> 03:31:40,634
[SPEAKER_31]: OK, we'll come back to you.

2221
03:31:41,575 --> 03:31:42,095
[SPEAKER_31]: We might need.

2222
03:31:42,115 --> 03:31:48,518
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry, I don't know what you're saying.

2223
03:31:51,232 --> 03:31:51,952
[SPEAKER_31]: You'll type yes.

2224
03:31:52,372 --> 03:31:54,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Is that acceptable for a roll call vote?

2225
03:31:55,073 --> 03:31:55,273
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2226
03:31:55,653 --> 03:31:55,874
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.
