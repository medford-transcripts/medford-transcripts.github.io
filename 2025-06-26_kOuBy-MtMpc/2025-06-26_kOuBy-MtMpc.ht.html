    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=0.271s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So good evening everyone.
 My name is Emily Henneman.
 I am chair of the Medford Community Development Board, and I'm calling the meeting to order.
 Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.
 This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.
 No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.
 A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting on progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website.
 If despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.
 And a reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.
 I would also like everyone to know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, medfordma.org.
 Clicking on current CD board filings and Danielle or a member of the staff will drop that link in the chat.
 We are going to start with roll call attendance.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=115.58s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Good to have you as vice.
 And myself, Chair Emily Hedeman.
 Danielle, can you please introduce any staff from the call?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=127.055s">[Danielle Evans]</a>:  Yes, myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.
 We also have Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of PDS.
 I think we had Sal DiStefano, the Director of Economic Development, if he's still here.
 Yeah, I see Sal.
 We have Brenda Pike, who is the Climate Planner in our office.
 Welcome, Brenda.
 one of our student interns, Josh Needleman, who will be taking minutes tonight.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=157.803s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Awesome.
 Important job, Josh.
 Thumbs up for minutes.
 I used to do that when I staffed a board.
 So it's an important job.
 So our first item on the agenda tonight is a new public hearing.
 We've had continuances for previous public hearings, but this is a new one, so I'm going to read the public hearing notice for the record.
 This is a rather long one, so I just wanted to give people a preview that you're going to hear my voice for a couple minutes.
 So the public hearing notice for the record is that the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on January 22nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m.
 via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.
 Amend section 94-2.1, which is division into districts, to add the Salem Street Quarter District.
 Amend section 94-6.0, which refers to general regulations, to insert a new subsection to create the new green score zoning regulation and to state the applicability, standards, and calculation methodology therein.
 Amend Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, specifically Table A, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District into the existing table and to designated the uses permitted therein.
 Amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, specifically Table B, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein.
 Amend section 94-12, which is definitions, to amend and add various definitions.
 Amend section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Salem Street Corridor District.
 Amending the zoning map to create a new Salem Street Corridor District and to change the zoning district designation of various properties to place them within said district, as shown on a map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning, dated December 8th, 2024.
 Amend section 94-11.7, which is site plan review, to incorporate the green score regulation by adding submission requirements
 for the site plan review and modifications and establish a waiver process.
 We also include Zoom link meeting details in this notice.
 This is the Zoom meeting that you are all in presently and also posted this on the city website calendar.
 I would also like to let everyone know that a subsequent public hearing on this same matter will be held by the Medford City Council on February 11th, 2025 at 7 p.m., excuse me, in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, which is 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom.
 So two different ways to be involved with that hearing.
 A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than November 29th, 2024.
 I'd like to start this off by asking staff if they have any introductory comments, and then we will be viewing a presentation from Emily Innes of Innes & Associates.
 There's going to be two aspects to it.
 So for people that were very patient with the list of different changes that we're reviewing and providing recommendations on tonight, there's kind of two different topics.
 There's the green score zoning, and then there's zoning itself.
 So we're going to hear first about zoning, and then we're going to hear about green score zoning regulation, just to kind of set the stage for everyone and manage expectations.
 So Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and her team?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=440.592s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Madam Chair, I do believe that NS Associates has a pretty solid introduction explaining a lot of the background, the timing, etc.
 But I did want to share for the public, this is not one of our normally scheduled weeks for the Community Development Board meetings.
 However, we were aware that we had a number, a large number of public hearings that we needed to
 here, and we wanted to give the zoning its due time.
 Last time we took up zoning after several public hearings, it was much too late and too difficult to process all that information late at night.
 So we thought this deserved its own separate hearing.
 For those who are not aware, the city board meeting actually went until midnight last week, and we could never have taken this up after that.
 which is why we're hearing this on a separate week.
 And we continue to have a pretty heavy caseload, even though we're meeting twice a month.
 So with that, I'm actually going to pass this off to Emily Innis and Paula Ramos-Martinez, too, because they will put this into the context of the comprehensive plan, which is something that Emily actually worked on with us for several years, as the board is aware.
 I think that's sufficient.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=522.088s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Alicia.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=525.05s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  With your permission, Madam Chair, for the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.
 I'm joined by my colleague Paula Ramos Martinez.
 We are together going to give you a presentation starting with Paula first to go over the background to the zoning change for the Salem Street corridor, what we're doing, why we're doing it, information about that.
 I will then join you for the details of the zoning, so I can show you from the summary information where to find that within the language of the zoning itself, particularly important for many people on this call who may not deal with zoning on a regular basis, who just want to give them a guide to where to find it.
 Then at the appropriate moment, Hala will be back to you to explain the green score, again, what it is, why it is, and what the implications are.
 So that is our plan for tonight.
 I will just reiterate with what Alicia said I know Paola will talk to it as well but just said the this zoning process or rezoning process that we're in now was a recommendation of the comprehensive plan so we are essentially in the implementation stage of that recommendation by bringing forward the details that were envisioned in the plan.
 With that, and with your permission, I'm going to turn this over to Paola, who will share her screen and take us through the first part of the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=607.71s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Great.
 Thank you, Emily.
 Hello, everyone.
 This is Paola.
 Madam, if I may, I'm going to share my screen and start with the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=625.201s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  We can see your screen.
 We're looking at a meeting reminder, which no matter how many times you dismiss, they always pop back up.
 All right, now we got a presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=639.943s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  OK, it's going a bit slow then.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=642.084s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And we are looking at your presenter view.
 Now it's just the presentation.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=650.131s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Great.
 So I wanted to say, it was already said before, but we have
 two main things that we want to present today.
 One is going to be about Salem Street Corridor District and that is going to take the first part of this presentation.
 We will take questions and later on we will come back with the presentation and do the second part which is the green square.
 So in the agenda for Salem Street what I have is we're going to talk about the timeline.
 So what has
 what we did before and that made us come here at this meeting today.
 So what was the process before that?
 What are the opportunities for public comments?
 Not for this one alone, but because we're going to come back
 We are reviewing zoning, so we are going to do a lot of topics, very different topics.
 I want to give to everyone what is the process when we take a new draft, what are the different
 phases that has to go through and when in those phases you could give comments.
 Then I'm going to do introduction of why this, why Salem, where does that come from.
 We're going to go into your current zoning, what is there now, and then we're going to show the proposed zoning map.
 The last two topics I'm going to give to Emily, and she's going to go through the draft, so the language, and she's going to talk first about the general changes that are being done to the Medford zoning ordinance, and then the new district that we are adding.
 And after that, we will do the Q&A.
 I must say that I'm very happy that there is so many people here today.
 So what was the timeline?
 When did this started?
 And what were the meetings that we had until today?
 So we did a workshop in July 24th, where we showed a lot of analysis that were done at a citywide level, and also for Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.
 And this analysis were very varied, but were showing us dimensions,
 of the lots, the existing zoning, non-conformities, transit, a lot of different topics.
 And all those topics were citywide, but also Mystic and Salem.
 So this helped us to get started with the analysis.
 And then in the August 14th, we brought the first proposal.
 We started with Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.
 In December 3rd, we did Mystic Avenue first.
 That's why you see a big gap between August and December.
 And then when we finished Mystic, we started with Salem Street.
 We presented the draft.
 And then in December 11, we presented the final with the comments and different little tweaks that we did to the first draft.
 In December 11th, the Planning, Permitting and Committee meeting, I referred and approved to refer this draft to the CDB and this is why we're here today.
 So what is the process?
 So what we're going to do, and this is going to be with every topic that we are going to bring forward for the rezoning, we're going to first in city council, and this is in the planning committee meetings, we're going to bring a new topic, we're going to present it.
 And here we're going to listen from the councillors, from the city staff, and from the public, any comment that they may have.
 So we will come back another time to a planning committee meeting, and we will present the draft with the alterations that were needed.
 If everything goes well, then the city council can refer to the city board.
 Here again, we will hear from the public, from the board, and the board will vote.
 the topic and it can be referred again to the City Council and the City Council can give the final approval.
 So this is a process and in every of these phases and stages the public has an opportunity to comment on it.
 We are telling you this because we are going to continue looking at different topics and this list is going to be updated every time that we present it.
 So in gray, you're going to see different dates and topics.
 The gray says represented meetings that were already done.
 The red are the meetings that we're doing today, and that's Salem Street and Green Score topics.
 And the blue are the ones that will come in the future.
 So this is going to be updated.
 So we have the final dates.
 And every time that we present, we're going to
 let you know which are the new topics that we are working on and at what stage they are so that you can write it down and join any meeting that you would like.
 So where does it come from?
 Why we're doing this or why we're doing Salem Street?
 Where does it come from?
 So in 2023, January, it was published the Medfair Comprehensive Plan.
 In here, it was the work that was done by the city consultants, and there was a lot of public engagement.
 It was a two-year plan.
 In here, you can see and that are identified all the problems, opportunities that Medford has.
 So for example, we see here, so at the end of this book, and I recommend anyone that is interested in, we are basing a rezoning on this.
 So all the principles values are taken from this comprehensive plan.
 And at the end, it has a
 very long list of strategies that are organized by topics and one for example the VP which is vibrant places 1.1.2 refers to rezone to allow mixed use in village centers as a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street.
 So what you can see on the right is the vision map that comes out of this comprehensive plan.
 In this vision map you can see the corridors, so in here they were identified the corridors, squares and centres, transformational focus areas, green corridors, institutional anchors and different densities in the residential area.
 So what we are looking now is first we started with corridors, we started with Mystic Avenue, we're working now with Salem, later on we will look into the squares, we are looking now into neighborhood residential, so the low scale of the residential, and we will continue to look into every topic that was identified in this comprehensive plan.
 So we are going to look now at Salem Street,
 what is your current zoning and what does your current zoning allows.
 So in zoning, whenever we're going to rezone or rewrite a part, a district, what we have to do is to look what is existing, what is your current zoning, what are the future trends,
 If there is a comprehensive plan, for example, like we do have in Medford, what are those values and goals that the city has?
 And implement that in our proposal.
 So what do you have in your current zoning?
 It's not exactly, especially in Salem Street, it's not exactly what you do have right now.
 So what we're going to look into is Salem Street, you have three different districts.
 You have apartment one district, and that is the majority of Salem Street is in that district.
 Then you have commercial one at the end in the corner with Salem Street and Fellsway.
 And then in the other side of Fellsway, you have apartment two.
 So what does it mean?
 So we have here the dimension standards.
 We have it in a different way than your table because the table is a bit of difficult to read.
 So we have it by district.
 And so your dimension standards in apartment one
 your maximum height is three stories.
 Then it can be four if it's assisted living.
 But let's say that your multi-dwelling is up to three stories.
 Your C1 is up to six stories.
 These are all heights by right.
 In the case that in C1, somebody wants to do a hotel, by right, you can do 15, 1.5 stories high.
 In apartment 2, we have something similar.
 We have 6 by right and 15 for any other permissible permitted structure.
 So, this is what you have now in your current zoning.
 So if we see it a bit more like in a diagram illustration, what does it mean?
 Apartment one, that is this salmon pink that you have in Salem Street, in the majority of the Salem Street, you have, for example, single family maximum is 2.5.
 If you have, oh, sorry, there is a typo here.
 If you have multiple dwelling, it's three stories high.
 Oh, sorry, yeah, I know what it is, sorry.
 you have single family detached, that's 2.5, single family attached, that is your typical house, sorry, and that is three stories high, and then you have multiple dwelling that is three stories high.
 What happens in apartment one is that
 commercial use is not allowed.
 So you have all the commercial buildings that are from 93 until commercial one are uses that are not allowed in your current zoning.
 Now, if we go to commercial one, commercial use, yes, it is allowed.
 You can have multiple dwelling up to six stories.
 This is what is allowed right now.
 And you can have a hotel that is 15 stories high.
 With apartment is very similar, but instead of a hotel, what you have is any other principle structure that is allowed in apartment too.
 And the dwelling, multiple dwelling, it's also six stories high.
 So in our proposal, we don't think that those highs
 And those uses really reflect what you do have right now.
 Because you do have a lot of commercial that we do think it's important to keep and to make it conforming.
 You do have, sorry, you don't have the area to really let 15 stories high, not a hotel or any other.
 So we made a different proposal.
 We want also to have mixed use.
 So what we did is to create different sub-districts.
 We wanted to create a lot of diversity as it is already now.
 We wanted to look really into what you have and what really works.
 And the proposal comes from there.
 So we have two mixed uses.
 Mixed use one, that's the blue.
 Mixed use two, that is the reddish.
 Then we have commercial.
 Commercial is just one little parcel in here and I will explain why.
 This is the dark red.
 And then the rest is the yellow multi-unit residential.
 So I'm going to start for the residential.
 Whenever we saw that the lot was entire, the whole block was entire, already existing, all residential, we kept it.
 We think it's very important.
 This corridor, it has commercial, but it also has residential and
 this is not a citywide corridor, this is not Mystic Avenue, this is a corridor that should serve the neighborhoods that are around it.
 So we do like the idea of the neighborhood coming in this corridor, so to have a mix of only residential, of mixed use, and a little bit of higher density mixed use.
 So mixed use one, it's whenever we have that mix of
 You have residential, but you also have commercial.
 So we kept it as a mixed use.
 Why the difference between- Paula, one quick note.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1495.701s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Your audio is going in and out a little bit.
 I'm wondering if it's a bandwidth issue, which can sometimes be solved by turning off your own video.
 Maybe just double check that any programs that are competing for bandwidth have been closed out as appropriate.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1520.312s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Okay, I closed the video, so I hope that it's going better.
 Yes, I think it's a little bit better.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1526.594s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I would encourage members of the community to message Alicia or Danielle if you... Sorry.
 No, no apology needed.
 You know, we're all doing our best in this virtual world.
 So we'll try this.
 If we need to revisit, we'll go from there.
 Okay, perfect.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1543.939s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So what is the difference between MixUse 1 and MixUse 2?
 So MixUse 2 was...
 It's those areas that are connecting to a major service or to, like, for example, we have parks, we have other main streets like Washington streets.
 Streets that are connecting with these bigger activators, as for example, Park Street, where we have a school and we have the Hickey Park, or for example, on the really east that we have the Morrison Park, we have Spring Street that is also has some commercial areas and commercial nodes in there that has a higher, let's say, pedestrian, fluent pedestrian movement.
 We wanted to give it a different, let's say, a different density towards these areas so that we could have more commercial ground floor and make it more pedestrian and that, let's say, that these are like activity stepping stones along these streets.
 So, if I go...
 continue.
 Yes, so what are these districts and what are the dimensions standards that we are applying?
 So, for example, the multi-unit residential, the minimum lot area is 3000.
 We took this number because of what is existing there.
 We have a lot of non-conforming because the minimum lot area is from 5000 and 6000.
 So there are a lot of non-conforming lots and we wanted to reduce those non-conforming lots.
 And so the minimum lot area gets to be reduced to 3,000 square feet.
 The maximum height is three stories.
 mix use one, minimum lot area is also 3000.
 And I'm going to explain what is this difference between base height and maximum height.
 So the base height, it's the height that you have by right.
 And in this case, for the mix use one is three stories.
 So by right three stories.
 Now, if
 And here comes the incentive zoning that we will explain, and Emily will go through more in detail.
 Incentive zoning is when we let a developer increase their density if the developer gives something back to the community.
 And this giving something back to the community is something that is established.
 So it has to go through a menu of options and
 with standards and so if they think that is reasonable like for example increasing affordability or creating a pocket park for the neighborhood then we let them increase in mixed-use one a maximum of plus one story.
 So with incentive zoning mixed-use one could go to four stories high.
 Now in mixed-use two
 The minimum lot area is 3,000.
 Maximum height, and this is by right, is four stories.
 Four.
 Now, with incentive zoning, so if the developer gives something back to the community, they can increase by two stories.
 So maximum height with incentive zoning is six.
 And then the commercial, which in this case we have a very small
 a very small lot there, is minimum lot area 10,000 square feet, maximum height three stories, plus three of incentive zoning.
 So it will be the same as Mixis 2 at the end, but it has three of incentive zoning.
 So by right is three.
 We will talk more and Emily will go more through these dimensionless standards.
 We are going to go through the map and in this map, we're going to see what is there right now and what is not permitted by your current zoning.
 So, any kind of commercial area that we have from the 93 towards Fellsway, in this area, for example, this is not permitted.
 As well, the one that we see on the lower part, it's not permitted at the moment.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1832.026s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  um and then the three stories high multi-family this would be this it is permitted so when you say not permitted it doesn't mean that if this if these amendments were to pass like we would we would evict these businesses it means they're they're welcome and encouraged to continue to operate um as they see fit just to know
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1860.903s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Sorry, because maybe it's a bit confusing.
 What we're doing is that they will be permitted with our zoning.
 So with our proposal, they are permitted.
 And this is that right now, they are non-conforming by use.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1880.539s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  But they can still continue to operate regardless.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1883.321s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Yes, yes.
 It's just that if they want to increase their height by the current zoning,
 They have to go through a lot of bureaucracy by to they're not required.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.236s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.536s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So, because the commercial use is not permitted in apartment.
 These are not these are non conforming that will change with our new proposal because they would be in the mixed district and commercial.
 It is permitted.
 Thank you.
 Sure.
 So the same would happen here.
 Every time that we see a commercial in your current zoning is not permitted, that would change in the new zoning.
 Gas station, for example, you do have some along Salem Street.
 These won't be permitted in the new zoning as well.
 So they continue to be non-conforming.
 As well, when we go, we continue another gas station and another gas station.
 They are very close, three of them.
 So these are non-permitted, non-conforming, and they will continue to be non-conforming.
 Then this commercial is non-conforming now, but it will be conforming with the new proposal.
 These are the residential lots.
 They are permitted now, and they continue to be conforming in the new proposal.
 We continue here, more residential, these are permitted now and they will continue to be permitted in the new proposal.
 And these are commercial that right now in your current zoning is not permitted, it will be permitted and conforming in the new proposal.
 This is the commercial one area.
 So all of them are permitted now and they continue to be permitted in the new zoning and this as well.
 So now I will explain this really red area that we have a lot that we have as commercial is mainly so that we think this gas station makes sense to be here.
 It's near Fellsway.
 It's out of traffic from Salem Street.
 So we prefer that
 that we can keep and that we would like to continue, so this is conforming in the new proposal.
 So we also wanted to add this definition.
 This is a business incubator because we think that this is a new definition that would attract certain types of business into this area.
 They can be very small, so not big scale.
 So I'm just going to read the definition.
 Business incubator is an organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service
 and create an achievable plan to make that product or service to market.
 In addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as the shared office space.
 An incubator program can last for several months to a few years.
 We think also that this can create a lot of activation and a lot of community in this area.
 And because we understand that people might be worried about having these mixed-use 1 and 2 next to their residential or single-family house, what we have come with is
 a neighborhood compatibility, and this is that when MX1 or 2 on commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subjected to this context standards.
 And that means that their side and rear setbacks are going to be from zero
 to 10 so they have to allow that setback so we have a little bit more of a space between the two buildings and then the height it's going to be increasing and following a 45 degree angle from the three
 stories minimum up to the six in case they go for the incentive zoning.
 So we want to really have this transition between mixed use one, two and commercial towards the residential.
 So that's why we implement this as a development standard.
 What we also want to let very clear is that as we see this area is a pedestrian oriented area.
 We want this to be as active and for people in the center of this plan.
 So, we also have in these standards, like, for example, that the parking has to be on the rear side of the lot.
 So, what we have facing the street is the building.
 We have an active ground floor so that a lot of eyes are on the street.
 It feels safe.
 It feels active.
 We also, any new development has to provide 12 feet
 fit for the sidewalk.
 So the sidewalks right now are very small.
 We had this analysis in the very beginning.
 We don't think that is enough for new buildings to come here and to have this active and pedestrian activity.
 So to make it more safe we ask that any new building has to give that minimum
 space for the sidewalk of at least 12 feet, and then it has to have a minimum setback of three, if I'm not mistaken, so that we wanted really to make it as pedestrian as possible.
 So I'm going to give now the... I'm going to stop now the presentation.
 I'm going to pass it to Emily, and she will guide us through the ordinance.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2261.54s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  Thank you, Paola.
 I will just share my screen.
 Just one moment.
 Now, Paola has shown you the colorful images designed to explain the more technical aspects of what you're unfortunately about to see.
 Zoning can be kind of dry when you're not familiar with it.
 But I do want to show you where in the zoning ordinance to look for the things that Paola just mentioned.
 Also, I believe the city board members received a staff memo on proposed changes that came out of the city council meeting and a couple of other implications from those conversations.
 I've already put them in here, I've highlighted them, so I'm going to show them to you as we go along and then Paola will show them to you again later when we go back to the presentation.
 So, the first thing is the division into districts, which we talked about already.
 When you establish a new zoning district, you have to put that into a certain part of the zoning ordinance.
 I should say, I think most of the people on the call are probably familiar with this, but just for those who have not looked at zoning changes before.
 Zoning changes are not development projects, they set the stage, they give permission for things to happen, they give options for things to happen, but they don't require that things happen.
 And I think that goes to what we were talking about earlier with the uses that are
 non-conforming under the current zoning.
 We had a couple of different goals as we approached this process.
 One, obviously, was, as Paola said, to make sure that we were following the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, implementing that after that long public process.
 But the other thing was, as we were looking at what was on the ground now,
 hearing maybe what people valued about their neighborhoods and understanding that many things, and this is true of almost every community in Massachusetts, many things that are physically present now are actually not allowed in the current zoning.
 And that's because many of our communities developed before zoning came into play.
 Some communities
 didn't start putting zoning in place until the 60s, some were a little bit earlier, but most of our New England cities and towns are actually older than zoning.
 So, as we looked at this, just to clarify that we're also looking at giving permissions for things that were already there, making it easier for people to invest in their properties.
 because we were reducing the requirement for them to go and get a variance because their properties were non-conforming.
 So part of this is what we call right-sizing the zoning to what's already there, and I'll call out some of that.
 So unfortunately I'm going to scroll through and make you a little bit dizzy as we look at this, but the next key thing to note is the table of uses.
 Now for those of you who may have been
 Watching the changes when we did the Mystic Avenue corridor, you're going to recognize some of the terminology, the MX1, the MX2, and the commercial districts.
 Those district types are also present in Mystic Avenue, but we are tailoring them to be appropriate for Salem Street, right?
 Because Mystic Avenue is a very different entity, a very different feel.
 a very different purpose than Salem Street.
 So the first thing we did was to add this MR, this multi-family residential district, which Paola explained.
 So that's new, that is not found in Salem Street.
 And that was to allow for housing that was variations or varieties of housing types that was more suited to a neighborhood corridor, a neighborhood area.
 And then the second thing, so you'll see that, you'll see the yellows, that's the MR coming in.
 It allows and disallows or allows by special permit, depending on the use.
 The other thing you'll see is from time to time, you'll see a blue coming in under MX1, MX2, or commercial.
 You can see it here, for example, for co-living.
 That's when we're making a change from what's in Mystic Avenue, where we're specifically tailoring those district types to be appropriate for the Salem Street corridor, and I'm going to call out a couple of them as we scroll through.
 So, if you are interested, Paula gave an overview of what is and is not allowed in the different districts, but if you're interested in the specifics
 of what is and is not allowed, then you should go to this proposed table of uses.
 And I believe that all of these are online now.
 We will update it again, as we do after every meeting with the city board, we'll provide the new version.
 So you can see here, for example, adult use, there's a no in the commercial, you see that blue, that's because adult use is allowed in Mystic Avenue in the commercial sub-district, it's the only place in the city that it's allowed, so it is not allowed here.
 You will see also that we are proposing changes and Paula will go over this.
 We're proposing changes to some of the medical office definitions we introduced this past spring.
 Earlier in the process, we are refining them to be more specific with both and consistent with both state and federal law and also with the needs of the overall city.
 And then the permissions, and I'll show you the definitions in a minute,
 are very much tailored to Salem Street and neighborhood needs here.
 So I'll show you the definitions that go along with these, but just note that that's also a difference with the corridor.
 The other big one is that and where there's a major change is that in the Mystic Avenue District, the adult use marijuana uses are allowed, the various options that are not allowed in Salem Street.
 So you can see those called out here.
 And then motor vehicle related uses, as Paola mentioned, were not there.
 They're allowed in the commercial.
 The light service station is allowed by special permit by the CD board.
 The other ones are not allowed.
 And then certain industrial uses, manufacturing, research and testing, things that are appropriate for Mystic Avenue are not appropriate for Salem Street.
 So we have removed those.
 And there's a couple of tweaks in the parking that you see that are not major.
 Here's some other of those light industrial uses that are not allowed in Salem Street.
 And that is a change.
 And then we are done with the table of uses.
 So our next step is the table of dimensional requirements.
 And so these are the changes that we've made to these.
 So again, multifamily MR district is new.
 You see the yellow coming in indicating that's a new
 district in this area, so all of these are very different from Mystic Avenue.
 And then the blue, again, tailoring these district types, the mixed-use 1, the mixed-use 2, and the commercial for Salem Street.
 So, Paola went over the lot area.
 This was based on our evaluation, our analysis of the lot area in this
 neighborhood, the heights have been reduced.
 Anybody who saw the Mix 1, Mix 2 on Mystic Avenue, that's not applying here.
 We have reduced the heights as Paola suggested or described.
 We have a base height that's allowed as a right.
 that may have a maximum height, and these are for buildings up front on Salem Street, and they require that incentive zoning, which I'm going to show you.
 We have the step back in here that protects Salem Street from having the buildings sort of go straight up.
 There's a little bit of a setback there to make them more human scaled.
 Here's the business incubator coming in.
 Here are the new definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood medical office, and medical office.
 You'll note the difference between neighborhood medical office and medical office is that a neighborhood medical office is limited by size.
 So it shall not exceed 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and is limited by the number of employees.
 It cannot have more than five employees.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2776.204s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  It's also where the adjacency, the commercial next to residential uses is, this table up here.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2786.967s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  Oh, it's further down, the adjacencies in the standards actually.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 Thank you for calling that out.
 I'm going to actually swing down that.
 It's coming up in about three sections, but thank you for asking that question.
 So we have, this is the Salem Street now.
 So all of those sections that I just mentioned actually modified other parts of the zoning ordinance.
 Now we're getting into part of the zoning ordinance that establishes the Salem Street Corridor District.
 It has a purpose to it, which is the wider variety of uses and building types to support jobs, economic development near established residential neighborhoods.
 Paola mentioned that we were looking for neighborhood goods and services, neighborhood economic activity.
 So the idea is this provides options for living within walking distance of jobs, goods and services.
 We want mixed use, multifamily and commercial uses as a density appropriate to the walkable urban corridor, that's Salem Street itself, understanding that that's serving that wider neighborhood.
 And that we're establishing design standards to buffer the neighborhoods from a higher intensity of uses and we want this nice identity that's appropriate for Salem Street that reinforces what's there now.
 The applicability creates the sub-districts that we just described.
 And then this is that question that you asked Madam Chair, dimensional requirements and waivers.
 That's where we start to refine the dimensional requirements to allow for the setbacks.
 the step-downs, so we have to, this is this first one, the front setback is the one that Pella mentioned where the facade has to be set back to create those wider sidewalks to make it more walkable.
 The side and rear setbacks are required next to an existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units.
 We have to have a landscape buffer or a fence with a landscape buffer on the other side.
 Here are the height step back requirements, which is that neighborhood context and requires the massing of the building to be reduced closer to a building in any of the residential only districts and that's to allow for light, air, it keeps the existing residential buildings from being dwarfed by new buildings because they have to reduce that massing, reduce that height.
 We require the ground floor active frontage.
 We require some additional transitions to residential districts.
 We have setbacks for infill lots.
 So again, these are allows the infill building.
 An infill building is a new building on a vacant lot, for example.
 And it allows the infill building to match what's on the other side of it.
 So we keep the consistency with the neighborhood.
 We have height waivers.
 These are consistent.
 This is the step back waiver.
 So given that diagram, you can see that if you have a step back from Salem Street, and you have a step back from the residential neighborhood, and you might have a step back from another residential, at some point, you can't build a building.
 And so the waiver allows the Community Development Board to reduce the dimensional requirements of any of the step backs
 but it requires that priority is given to keeping the step backs that reduce the massing next to residential buildings.
 So in other words, you could reduce maybe the step back on Salem Street, but not the step back next to one of those three-story existing residential.
 We want to put criteria around that.
 Interested in hearing people's opinions.
 The next piece is the development incentives.
 Paola mentioned this, and I want to stress that this is a menu.
 I think we heard some questions that people thought that maybe they were all stacked on top of each other, so somebody could do them all and get additional height.
 We added language that's in the pink here that says it only goes up to the maximum height that's in that table of dimensional requirements.
 There are a lot of options for achieving that community benefit, but if you're only allowed to have one extra story, you only get to choose one of those options.
 You can't say, I'm giving you two options, I should get two stories.
 You are limited to that one extra story.
 Obviously, the maximum that we have is
 three incentive floors on top of a three-story building to get to six stories.
 So that is your limitation in this area.
 It's a six-story building, so it's either four and two or three and two.
 But none of these have changed except for the public parking.
 We had heard comments
 throughout the process that Salem Street, that area could use some additional parking.
 And so we've added public parking as a benefit.
 However, you'll see for the shared community, solar and public parking, these are topics we're still working on.
 So we have not set the requirement for the benefit yet.
 We're putting these in here to let people know that these are potential options.
 And we're going to confirm what the requirement would be for the benefit at a later date in the process.
 And then the design guidelines and applicability of the development standards.
 I do not, the sidewalk width is the only thing that changed from the other ones that we had developed.
 I'm just skimming down to see.
 Yes, that was the only change.
 Development standards and design guidelines are used in the site plan approval and the special permit process.
 They are criteria to measure the developer's proposal and require that they meet certain standards or address certain guidelines.
 For anybody who had seen the earlier process, except for that sidewalk width, they should be familiar.
 And with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen and turn it back to Paola just so she can give us a summary of the changes from the original document that we sent you.
 And then we're happy to answer any questions from the board and from the public as appropriate.
 Paola?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3166.046s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Madam Chair, if I may, I'm going to share again the presentation.
 You see my screen now?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3187.979s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yep, we're viewing the slide with city recommendations.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3193.108s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So we have five recommendations from the draft, the latest version.
 And so the first one is, as Emily explained, is to clarify that intent in the introduction of the development incentive bonus.
 So in the section of the development incentives, we want to add so that it's clear that it's up to the maximum height under the section.
 of the table of the mentioned requirements.
 So the total paragraph will read in as follow.
 In exchange for incorporating certain provisions that further the city's goal for affordability, economic development, environmental sustainability, climate and climate resiliency, applicants may receive development incentive bonuses that allow for certain development permissions beyond what is allowed as of right.
 up to the maximum height under section 94-4.1 table of dimension requirements.
 These permissions include one or more additional stories up to the maximum numbers of stories allowed in each sub-district.
 Additional stories must comply with any setback, stepback,
 sorry, there is a repetition, or other dimensional requirements and the development and design standards in 94-9.x.6 development standards.
 So, this is the first one, just to clarify, that is up to the maximum height under the section 94-4.1 that is in the table of dimensional requirements.
 The second is about some definitions that we wanted to modify.
 So we want to delete the definitions for clinic, hospital, and medical office that we had in the previous with Mystic Avenue district and replacing them with the following definitions.
 So clinic is a clinic as defined in general law point C.111.
 section 52 hospital a hospital as defined in general law c.111 section 52 neighborhood medical office office of a physician dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital as defined in section 94.12.0 definitions the office area shall not exceed 1500 square feet of gross floor area and shall have no more than five employees
 Medical office, office of a physician, dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital is defined in section 94.12.0 definitions.
 The office area is greater than 1500 square feet and has more than 5 employees.
 So with that, the third is update the section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, to reflect the proposed definitions.
 So we have text to be removed, is crossed out, and the text to be added is in bold.
 So we have them at the end of the table, we include that neighborhood medical office, which is not allowed in multifamily district, but it is allowed in mixed use 1, 2, and commercial.
 And then the medical office is not allowed in multifamily.
 And then we have mixed use 1, 2, and commercial as a special permit.
 And then the clinic is not allowed in any of the districts.
 The fourth is to add to the section 94-9.x.3 dimensional requirements and waivers the following.
 So, we add two of those requirements, one requirement, one waiver, which is the height step back requirement.
 And this is the text for the diagram that you saw.
 of the context.
 So for any lot within the MX1, MX2 or commercial district that abuts MRGR or apartment 1 district, a height setback is required along the lot line abutting the residential district.
 The height setback is calculated by a 45 degree angle beginning at the third floor and extending to the highest floor of the building in the MX1, MX2 or commercial district.
 The fourth, fifth and sixth floor shall not break the plane of that 45 degree angle.
 And then we have that a step waiver.
 If a building is subject to a front step back and rear or side step back, the community development board may waive the strict dimensional requirement of any of the step backs provided that priority is given to retaining the step back, step backs that reduce the massing next to the residential buildings of five or fewer units.
 And last is the update to section 94-3.2, table of use regulations, table A, to remove marijuana as an allowed use.
 Text to be removed is crossed out, text to be added is in bold.
 So what we do is just changing for the MX1 and MX2, the adult marijuana establishment, the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, retail, and independent laboratory, instead of CDB, so a special permit, we change them to no.
 not permitted.
 And those are the changes that we propose and the city recommends.
 So now we will give the Q&A.
 We finished our presentation and we hope for any comments we will be answering them Emily, myself or city staff.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3554.395s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
 Thank you, Paula.
 Thank you, Emily.
 I really appreciate the thorough presentation.
 I'm going to open it up to the Community Development Board for comments or questions from our group.
 Following that, we will open the public comment period, just to give a preview of what's next.
 We have Annie, Peter, Sabrina, Ari, Adam, Ben, myself online from the board.
 I'll just start with my first takeaway, which is really the alignment with the existing setup of Salem Street.
 I think that that presents a lot of opportunity.
 As I asked Paola, these non-conforming uses, do they, does that mean that they get kicked out or something bad happens to them?
 It almost means that they have more opportunity.
 So if they wanted to do something with their site or do something different commercially, they are now allowed by right.
 So I really like that.
 I think it's very considerate of the connections between commercial and residential.
 I'd like your thoughts around step back, especially the connection between higher density
 the housing, and it has some strangely specific questions about this neighborhood medical use.
 But I can save that.
 It was really just why five employees?
 I mean, that feels almost like an arbitrary number, and it feels weird to be regulating the count of employees, as well as questions around
 I think there was a comment that we don't allow neighborhood medical office and multifamily.
 And my first thought was there's people that operate their medical practice out of the first floor of their home.
 I don't think that that's common enough to make a big issue of it, but I did just want to recognize that just in case that's a scenario that you all evaluated.
 So yeah, those are some of my initial thoughts.
 But maybe we can do like a round with the board, and then Paula and Emily, if you want to respond, because we might have some of the same concerns.
 I see Ari, they have their hand up.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3723.992s">[Ari Fishman]</a>:  Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Innes Associates for the very detailed presentation and proposal.
 Um, I live just on the other side of the rotary towards Medford square, so I'm very familiar with this corridor.
 And 1 of the things that I appreciate about it as a resident is that mixture of residential commercial businesses.
 I can walk down the street and get a sandwich during my lunch break.
 And I think that one of the great ironies of the greater Boston area is that many of the structures that we most value and people most like, the townhouses, the triple deckers, are disallowed by our zoning, and we can't build more of them.
 So I think it's very smart that we're aligning it to accurately describe what we have and allow for more development like what we already have.
 evidence through living that this is what is working for our community.
 I don't have any particularly detailed questions.
 I'm looking forward to hearing community feedback, but I think in general the approach here of allowing commercial and mixed zoning makes a lot of sense for this area.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3799.392s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Adam, I see a hand.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3801.249s">[Adam Behrens]</a>:  Yeah, I just wanted to chime in as well.
 It was super helpful, especially in context with the Mystic Avenue zoning.
 I think when I first saw the proposals, my immediate reaction was like, oh Jesus, are we creating Mystic Avenue here?
 It was really helpful to see the consideration specific for this corridor that even though it might be called the same abbreviation, it's actually not permitting the exact same thing for Mystic Avenue.
 I just wanted to voice that where coming in, I was like,
 We're really trying to up zone this and so it was helpful to get the context of kind of a primary consideration of like, okay, let's, let's match to as much as we can to what's there.
 And then, um, um, you know, try to like ease ease into a little bit more density, but not do it in such a jarring way.
 So.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3875.364s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Then Sabrina, Peter, any thoughts?
 Or Ari, any response to Adam's comment?
 I think you hit the nail on the head.
 We can use the same letters in the table, but we're clarifying that this is specifically for Salem Street.
 And I think that's some nuance that DePaula and Emily, your slides did a good job at differentiating.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3907.463s">[Peter Calves]</a>:  I'm just going to say that I do appreciate the clarification on the height, because I know that's something that was confusing to people.
 And to understand that it is a hard maximum of six stories anywhere on the corridor, because I think that is something that I had heard concerns about.
 And I'm glad to see that that is the case.
 Agreed.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3932.73s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So I'm going to do a quick break because we're humans.
 Give Emily and Paula a little bit of time just to pull together some thoughts and responses.
 But let's all meet back here in, let's say, five minutes.
 grab a water, bio break.
 And I do see a hand.
 We will be moving into the public comment period after we hear back from Emily and Paola.
 Feel free to raise your hand and we will get to you once we enter that portion of the meeting.
 Really excited to hear from the public.
 We've got a great crowd, so should be good.
 But yep, we will be back in about five minutes.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3974.471s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Normally, I actually had a comment before, like from the staff before you go to public.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3980.233s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, so I gave Emily a heads up.
 She's going to defer to you and then we're going to hand it back to Emily and Paola for any responses to the board comments and then go into public comment.
 So, Alicia, if you would like to provide some of that insight.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3996.942s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Great, thank you.
 So I did just want to reiterate that we had reviewed and met with the consultants since what originally was went to the CD board in your packet is exactly what went to the city council.
 And so that is what the city council has to vote on, but they can be voting with amendments and they would vote on amendments that you recommend.
 And so what is this recommendations from the staff are amendments that have come up since it went to city council.
 But there was one that we had discussed and I think maybe there was a little miscommunication.
 And so I just wanted to mention it, not in that.
 So with the small medical office, the neighborhood medical, one of our thoughts was that
 we should be looking at limiting the hours from 8 a.m to 7 p.m because we don't want off medical offices and stuff we don't want people in people's neighborhoods next to people's homes coming and going at very early hours or very late hours so like you wouldn't want an urgent care open till midnight next to somebody's house or you wouldn't want them that kind of stuff going on and so that was one of the recommendations was to have
 and hours of operations.
 And that's also something in a big picture way that we want to be looking at in our zoning across the board is what are the hours of operations and how are they allowed in zoning?
 There is a paragraph in zoning that currently limits hours of operations, but it doesn't apply to medical offices.
 And it might be different if it was in a strip mall than it is if it was next to someone's home.
 Sure.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4109.766s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, thinking about the implementation, the actual use, and the day-to-day clientele.
 That's a good lens to apply to this.
 Thank you, Alicia.
 Emily and Paula?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4122.928s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  I'm happy to respond 1st to that and then to the comments from the board.
 We agree on hours of operation.
 It was, as I said, as Alicia said, it was a miscommunication that was left off our text.
 So we're just pulling the correct sentence and we'll have it for you by the end of the meeting.
 or at the appropriate point to discuss it, but we agree that that's an important piece.
 I think you had asked why the difference and again, it goes back to tailoring uses for the neighborhood.
 It is quite common to think about the impact of different uses on a neighborhood in terms of
 the scale of a business or use.
 And one of the issues we had heard coming from the community was something like this, like a business that had clients coming to it, the impact of traffic on it, given that Salem Street is not only a corridor in the sense that it leads from one place to another, right?
 That's how the comprehensive plan was defining corridors, is that they were important streets.
 that took people from one part of Medford to another part of Medford, but it's also a neighborhood.
 And so we wanted to think about the scale of certain businesses.
 This is one that came up.
 The size, the number of employees, the hours of operations are all methods of limiting that scale.
 So we've got a smaller scale, which could be as a right with special site plan review rather, we have a larger scale that could be a special permit and let's just have a higher
 higher level of review before it comes into an area.
 And I do want to stress, I was delighted to hear the city board members picking up on this idea of tailoring Salem Street to match what's there now.
 I do want to reinforce that zoning presents options.
 It doesn't require somebody to change their property.
 So, a business that's non-conforming now that would have to go through a variance process to invest in it.
 A homeowner maybe whose current house is on a lot that doesn't meet the minimum lot requirements would also be non-conforming for certain things, might have to go for a variance.
 Part of our goal was to reduce that.
 It doesn't mean the business has to change.
 doesn't mean the homeowner has to do anything, but if they choose to, the pathway is a little bit more clear for them now if the zoning is passed than it would have been otherwise.
 Zoning changes are about creating those opportunities, and in this case, with the addition of development standards,
 the ability to do design guidelines, it is also about putting appropriate community controls on some of those uses, some of those potential buildings that could come in if people make certain decisions with their property.
 But I just wanted to reinforce that we were trying very hard to respect what Salem Street was while giving the people who live, work, own businesses there now opportunities for the future.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4322.169s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  Also, one thing as well, we do allow home occupation in multi-residential.
 So if they have a small business and they want one doctor or something practicing from their home, that is possible in the residential because home occupation in the table of uses,
 is permitted.
 I just wanted to flag that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4359.706s">[Emily Innes]</a>:  And with that, we're happy to listen to comments from the public as well.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4365.808s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Great.
 OK, so I see some hands raised.
 Let me pull my notes back.
 So I will now open, or just real quick, do any other board members have any follow-up questions to what Emily or Paolo said?
 No, okay, and feel free to just throw your hands up or unmute yourself.
 Strong no from Annie, thank you.
 So I will now open the public comment period.
 Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.
 You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.
 Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.
 Reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members outside of technical difficulties to city staff, as it's not part of public record.
 However, if a participant is having audio or other technical issues, message Danielle, message Alicia, and they'll make sure
 You enter the queue.
 We are limiting speaking to two minutes per person.
 Part of the reason we do this is, you know, especially for topics like this, we have a lot of people that we want to hear from.
 We want to make sure everybody is heard in an equitable manner.
 The two-minute limit has worked previously for meetings, so we're going to be using that for this meeting.
 If you have more to add, or you want to respond to others' comments, I encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov.
 All of those comments get shared with the board.
 We review them before every meeting.
 So, you know, those, they don't just go into a black hole.
 So I want to encourage people to also use that email address as well as, you know, speaking up this evening.
 And this is such a great opportunity to hear directly from the public, because what we at the community development board are tasked with is making recommendations to the city council.
 So, you know, we can.
 you know, be a little creative and, you know, pass this back to the city council based on the amendments that we propose.
 So excited to hear what everybody has to say.
 Alicia is going to help me manage the public comment queue.
 I think I can manage it okay.
 But Alicia, do you have any overview for the written comments that have been received?
 Or Danielle?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4538.688s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  I didn't prepare a summary today to share that out.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4543.792s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That's OK.
 We've been reading them as they've been coming in.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4547.494s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Actually, I might share that there are ones that were sent directly to me.
 I found that there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was in the zoning.
 So I have been trying on a case-by-case basis to reply to residents with sort of more information about what was in them.
 partially because a lot of the concerns were around things that were either not correct or were being changed.
 I don't want to reiterate a lot of that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4576.412s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Sure, sure.
 But yeah, the public comment period is a time to provide your feedback, but also ask clarifying questions if there's something that doesn't really click or doesn't make sense.
 So encourage everybody to ask questions as well.
 And thank you, Alisa, for providing
 more updated feedback to the public that sent in questions.
 So I just want to make sure I'm keeping track of everyone.
 So the first public commenter that I see is Carlos Cabreras.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address.
 Alicia will start a timer.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4623.846s">[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  Hi, how are you?
 Yeah, my name is Carlos Cabrejas.
 I live at 224 Salem Street.
 So thank you for taking the time for this presentation, especially Paul, that was very thorough.
 So my question is, what is the plan to alleviate the already busy corridor that Salem Street is, you know, bringing all of these
 you know, development, houses, businesses, traffic is only going to get worse.
 What is the plan to make these, to mitigate the, yeah, what I said already, bad traffic that we have?
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4663.244s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Carlos.
 Appreciate the question.
 And for anybody that hasn't done these before, we typically hear all of the public comment, and then we'll pass it back to Emily and Paola to provide a little bit more insight.
 And then we as a board will deliberate and go from there.
 The next public commenter that I see is Dave McKenna.
 Dave, you're going to get a request to unmute.
 Sorry, Marielena, I might've accidentally clicked your name, but we're gonna start with Dave.
 Where did Dave go?
 We might've lost Dave.
 Let me look at the attendee list.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4722.02s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  I just sent him an unmute.
 Um, there we go.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4726.562s">[David McKenna]</a>:  Okay.
 Thank you for the presentation.
 I am generally supportive.
 Oh, David McKenna to vine street, just a half a block from Salem.
 Generally supportive of the new development because it will increase our tax base, which I think is really important.
 So we can improve city services for all residents.
 Um, and also, uh, really supportive because this will provide just more housing and we are in a housing crisis.
 Um, multifamily housing, condos and apartments are more affordable than single family.
 So, um, for people looking to downsize or for, um, we'll just have more housing options and I'm excited about that.
 Um, on the incentives, uh, I think it's great that by right, it's just three to four stories, which is what's currently existing.
 And then if there's an extra community benefit, then the developer could go beyond the three to four stories.
 The affordable housing community benefit seems really important.
 But my favorite one is the pocket parks.
 And I had a question about this because we could really use more green space along Salem, and developers are incentivized to provide a public pocket park.
 If they were to provide maybe the equivalent of two pocket parks or just more larger green space, would they get an additional incentive for that?
 Can they use that incentive maybe twice?
 And the seating, the extra bonus for seating in the park or the fountain, to me, does not really, it's not that valuable.
 It's the green space.
 A park should have seating in it.
 So I think that should just be a requirement of the incentive for the pocket park.
 I don't really care about the fountain.
 So any way to increase the amount of green space would be really beneficial.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4846.255s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Dave.
 And as we hear questions, we got a really solid recommendation from city staff.
 As we hear questions that come up again and again, we may pause to address those throughout this public comment period just to make sure that, you know, we're all kind of working on this together.
 or to offer clarifications.
 Marie-Elena, you're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4880.373s">[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  Hi, Marie-Elena Tetchi Bariola, 62 Sheridan Ave.
 I will try to keep it brief because I feel like I have a lot of questions, but I'll keep it to two.
 One, thank you for the presentation.
 It's very detailed, but my brain also doesn't work this way.
 So like, it's a lot to process.
 And I think that's probably true for a lot of people, you know, mix one, mix two, I get really kind of becoming that zoning stuff kind of just like jumbles in my mind.
 So some additional visuals might be helpful.
 Some of the slides were helpful, but it would have been really helpful to say, this is what's here now, and this is what we're proposing.
 Because I think she mentioned it, but I was having a hard time keeping track of it.
 So that would be helpful.
 But question wise, I think maybe what a lot of people, or at least myself anyway, is concerned about is,
 Is the definition of the differentiation between medical offices, clinic, medical facility, like on the heels of a methadone clinic being proposed in the area, it seems like, OK, so now they're changing the definitions.
 So I've been trying to figure out where are the original definitions to compare it to what the new amended ones are.
 So that would be helpful.
 But also, I think it might have been you, actually, that said,
 You you're not you don't think that like like why should we limit the number of employees in a medical office?
 I actually totally disagree with that I think that we should like I think because then what we're coming up against is Maybe an urgent care or something and you know We just came out of we're in a post-covid world where there were lines in urgent cares like outside And I don't want that in my neighborhood.
 I don't want you know, whether this happens again or not like that's
 you know, you have people like lining the street to get a COVID test, right?
 Or, you know, anything like that.
 And even if they open at eight o'clock, people line up at seven, 730.
 So I think that that is a concern, because when you don't limit the number of medical employees, you end up with offices like that.
 And, you know, where it says just a physician, well, what does that mean?
 Could they actually put them at the clinic if they
 filed it under something different.
 I think that's a major concern and there's my two seconds left.
 The other concern is like for all these increased housing, what do we do with these students?
 These schools are so overcrowded right now.
 Like if there are all these kids, what do we do with that?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5014.554s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Those are all really great questions and really great points.
 I appreciate your insight around the neighborhood medical office.
 The next public commenter that I see is Zachary Chertok.
 You should be getting a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5039.861s">[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  Zachary Chertok at 5 Allmont, right at the corner of Allmont and Salem.
 I have a list of questions, but the technical ones I'll email.
 I'm not going to worry about that now.
 I also apologize that my lighting makes me look like I'm going to say a soliloquy here.
 And Danielle, I also apologize for speaking through the chat.
 I forgot about the discernment in public records.
 So thank you for pointing that out.
 The two questions that I think could be generally answered here, one is, and this might have been stated, so it's more a point of clarification, is
 When buildings that are nonconforming seek to change the exterior of their building, when I've consulted and are advised on projects in other cities around this, including Boston and Providence around economic development, those buildings would require to go through a variance for continued approval and expansion of the building and its current use.
 Will that be part of the variance process, or in terms of your efforts to streamline the language and verbiage around your variance requirements, is that expected to be relaxed?
 The second one is for the IZ extensions to scale.
 Can the menu of options that are going to be provided for those IZs be published a little bit more clear and front and center?
 And can we be given notification around when it's solidified and what those are, as well as what the proximity to any proposed construction would be, what the requirements in terms of distance from them are?
 I've worked in places where you can offer a park to the city in exchange for an exemption versus it having to be feet from the building.
 So distance designations would be preferred.
 And then I'll echo the transportation concerns, especially since three boundary points around the zone are controlled by state agencies with land owned not by the city, including the I-93 Rotary, the Fellsway West, and the intersection at the Fellsway West and Salem Street, with a traffic signal that has been horribly unmistimed with the Fellsway East signal for some time, been trying to reach DCR for years.
 um and um and you know it just needs there needs to be a stronger partnership for that and it's sorry i know i'm over but that's not just a quarter it's a designated trucking route a state route overlay for route 60 as well okay this is all really helpful insight and it sounds like you have some really solid experience so thank you for sharing that with with us this evening

 53 Garfield Avenue.
 I just wanted to make sure that the Community Development Board got our legal letter from a group of neighbors this evening.
 We have 837 people that have voted no for this corridor expansion.
 No one has been included in any community involvement questions.
 All we hear is, we think you need, we've decided.
 What about the voters and the taxpayers?
 I feel confident in the next week, we will have over a thousand people in this neighborhood that do not want this corridor.
 This is a social justice neighborhood, as our legal letter imply, who have done nothing to offer any kind of, there's language barriers, nothing has been done in another language, nothing has been done regarding a reverse 911 call.
 And I think it's despicable the way this has been hidden from the neighbors and the constituents in this neighborhood.
 Salem Street, if you would even bother to come over here at six o'clock in the morning and six o'clock at night, you would see bumper to bumper traffic.
 And I think this is all of this rezoning.
 It is just too much, too fast, too big, too dense.
 It is not what this neighborhood needs and nothing that the voters, the homeowners and the taxpayers want.
 And we all know that, you know, you have to do something to expand some of the living.
 But this is ridiculous.
 It's not taking into concern the neighborhood at all.
 And we are prepared to take legal action.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5315.928s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I appreciate that.

 But thank you so much, Patricia.
 I really appreciate you commenting.
 Our next public commenter is Jane.
 You're going to get a request to unmute, Jane Marcus.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5342.849s">[Jane Marcus]</a>:  Hi, my name is Jane Marcus.
 I'm 65 Tainter Street.
 I live around the corner from the Roberts Elementary School.
 And from my perspective, this plan is about a corridor, but it really should be about the Roberts Elementary School neighborhood.
 We have the epicenter of the proposed density directly abutting the Roberts Elementary School.
 And there are so many of these businesses that I find inappropriate to put next to an elementary school with first graders and second graders walking to school.
 We don't want them walking by methadone clinics where there are addicts.
 We don't want them walking past a brewery.
 We don't want them walking past a winery.
 I'm super glad to see all the marijuana businesses have been removed from the plan.
 Thank you very much for that.
 I was worried about that as well.
 I also feel that there's an opportunity here with some of these zoning decisions to have mental health, rehab,
 halfway houses, homeless shelters and churches, other things that are wonderful for the community, but not next to a school.
 I don't want school children to be worried on their way to school about an addict or a drunk that they're going to encounter on the way to school.
 I want the kids to walk to school with joy and with the promise of learning something.
 And I feel if we have educational facilities that are likely to be halfway houses or something else, those are not appropriate.
 Private clubs that serve alcohol, not appropriate.
 Any kind of facility which is going to have temporary visitors, such as a hotel,
 may have sex offenders who are in the hotel for weeks or months under the radar.
 And we won't even know that there are sex offenders watching our children to see who the lonely and the vulnerable ones on the playground might be.
 So I ask the board, please consider this from the viewpoint that this is next to an elementary school.
 And I will really thank you for that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5482.671s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I hear your concerns about the uses that are proximate to the elementary school.
 So maybe that's something we can dig a little bit deeper and share more information.

 And please state your name and address for the record, please.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5510.572s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.
 I live at 281 Park Street, which is the epicenter of the neighborhood node.
 Park Street currently gets about 2,000 cars per day, and Salem Street, according to the 2022 study, was at 18,000 a day.
 It's important to note that this presentation doesn't match the zoning that is uploaded, so you are voting on whether or not you are recommending the pot.
 That's not gone.
 It's gone through three versions and was not removed.
 The zoning is not informed by any studies.
 How we came to the point that we're reducing lot size by 70% to 3,000 square feet for a six-story building is extreme.
 The incentives are so easy to max out height.
 A bench, a fountain will get you to six feet and a heartbeat.
 And why is the narrowest, busiest section, Park and Salem, a node for intense
 zoning, which is their words.
 How are the desirable uses chosen?
 Dorms, which Rocco DiRico at Tufts says he doesn't want, and informed the city that he didn't want them, and just wants to build on his own land, but they're still offering dorms, or offering shelters, or offering hotels.
 I don't think you're getting away from the methadone dispensary with the way that we're wording things.
 The research and testing labs, the dog daycare has no ordinance written yet.
 And we don't want a poorly staffed methadone clinic opening because they're trying to squeeze in to some niche employee count.
 Why are the special permits for pot growing, processing, retails, and labs, whoever thought that was appropriate?
 And why are we allowing a five-foot buffer with an eight-foot fence to shield a single-family home from a six-story building plus mechanicals, which according to state law can go up to 150% of the original height?
 The comprehensive plan called for studies.
 It called for strategies to avoid displacement of the environmental justice neighborhoods.
 And that's all we're seeing here.
 The zoning should be informed by facts.
 The community should have been involved.
 And Alicia said the zoning was based on developers wants to build.
 There's at least one demo permit already on the table in the red zone and the hole in the ground will be back for his six stories.
 And he told your board before that the city said he could build more.
 Profits should not be more important than the people that live here.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5659.703s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Cheryl.
 I really appreciate your comments.
 There's a lot there between the traffic, you have some feedback, like, you know, are the many options really commensurate with what's being delivered?
 Some questions about the uses, and then I'm curious about this mechanical percentage, so maybe we can address that at some point.
 But thank you so much, Cheryl.

 My name is Ralph Klein.
 I own and reside at 172 Park Street.
 My family also resides at 170, my sister Ruth.
 Now, we're on the fifth house down, fifth property down on Park Street, on the opposite side of the Roberts from Salem.
 Their proposal has three of the four properties barely conform.
 Let me look at this.
 184 has 2,065.
 182 has 2,265 feet.
 The next property has 3,000.
 And the next piece of property has 3,500.
 The combined frontage of this is 165 feet.
 And from Salem Street to my property line is approximately 130 to 140 feet.
 I could have a six-story building running the length of my property with these non-conforming properties that don't even make the limit, but they're in the red zone.
 Also, the parking.
 Since they put the condominiums on Salem Street, on Court Street, across from JRA Cycles, Park Street has become the dumping ground for all the vehicles that can't park there.
 for the part of building on the opposite side, JRA Cycles, there's five cars that come down here every day, park their vehicle, take their bicycle off, and ride it to JRA Cycles around the corner.
 If you think I'm kidding, come down Park Street and look at it.
 I cross Salem Street every day at least twice.
 My grandkids go to the Roberts Junior High School.
 Traffic is horrible.
 They do not listen to the crossing guards.
 I've almost gotten hit twice with a crossing guard there.
 I mean, to propose more buildings there?
 This is ridiculous.

 I want you to know I'm opposed to this.
 The traffic on Salem Street is insane right now.
 Just trying to get down that street will take you 25 minutes to a half an hour.
 Um, so it's already, I don't know what kind of study was done to see the traffic repercussions if this were to be implemented.
 Um, I'm also concerned about the first responders.
 If everyone decides to follow this new zoning and we have both sides of Salem Street with six stories or whatever is allowed, how is that going to impact not only our schools, but the first responders that have to get to those schools?
 That's all.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5979.75s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I'm hearing traffic first responders impact schools.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5986.859s">[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  I mean, it takes so long to get down that road.
 And honestly, if think about the DPW to if both sides of the street are six feet high, it's going to impact how the snow melts.
 you know, everything.
 So definitely it needs to be more thoughtful in the process.
 I think there's way too many factors.
 And you were talking about the hours of different, you know, in the mixed use zones, um, or commercial zones for that matter.
 You know, you talk about, you don't want a medical office to say past seven, but what if you have a regular commercial business open till nine, 10 o'clock at night, um, those people are parking somewhere.
 And we have, you know, residents that's trying to park their cars.

</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6090.559s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  Hi folks, just a quick question.
 We're at 174 Park Street, we're currently zoned apartment one, and it's changing to mixed two, commercial mixed two.
 We're a house behind a house, so we're kind of the second tier behind the frontage.
 And my question is, for the homeowners here, will they now become nonconforming?
 Right now it's a single family detached home.
 And so if it changes to mix two, commercial mix two, are they limited in their ability to sell to another residential use down the road?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6131.988s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  We can answer that question later, but you have about a minute left if you have any other comments, feedback.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6142.168s">[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  As far as, I feel like the other, you know, the other public members have pretty much addressed kind of like similar concerns like traffic, you know, what kind of businesses, you know, are being allowed if they're like appropriate, because we do live next to the school.
 And then yeah, as far as like, you know, what the building heights are, you know, considering
 you know, what we have around here with these homes, if we have like a, you know, a big eyesore.
 But I think everybody else has pretty much explained it a little bit better than, you know, than that.
 So it's pretty much in the same plane as everybody else.

 Just a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic.
 I don't think there was a traffic study done at all.
 Um, I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new.
 Properties apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them.
 Um, I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well.
 How does this impact our water our sewer?
 And our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts.
 I know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating.
 I'm very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school.
 I don't understand why that was even considered to have.
 commercial zoning at up to six stories next to a public school.
 If you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous.
 And if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school.
 I'm trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns.
 The only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business.
 But I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into
 reality, there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right?
 If they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of
 Availability to make more money.
 A lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced.
 So that's all I have.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6337.551s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That's a great point.
 Yeah, I mean, not not every business owns their space.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  I don't think a lot of them do.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6343.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I think how can we, you know, support those businesses.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6346.854s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  Matter of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6384.412s">[William Navarre]</a>:  Hello, William Navare, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.
 Uh, I basically support the zoning because Medford isn't full.
 We have room for more people.
 Um, I wanted to ask one specific question and basically that is have the, uh, consultants, you know, carefully, uh, studied and analyzed the, uh, cost in terms of construction of the set step backs.
 I know that they had that in Somerville step backs.
 I don't know if I misspoke and said setbacks, but step backs is what I'm referring to.
 And, um.
 And, and, you know, carefully considering the cost of those I know Somerville had those at one point they might have had to modify that I didn't get a chance to look into all the details, but you know just in terms of if somebody knows about the development cost of that.
 And if, if that's going to render a lot of development, unfeasible I would suggest that the board consider suggesting that the.
 you know, that it'd be made optional and that instead you could provide a bigger conventional setback, move the building further from the street and then it can just go straight up because it's already further from the street, maybe that's where the pocket park goes.
 Just an example based on
 what you folks find when you look at whether or not this is gonna be financially feasible to build the set, sorry, step backs.
 You can do the step back, that's expensive, is my understanding.
 But I'm interested to know what everybody's figured out when they've looked into that.
 Thanks.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6496.2s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Good evening, Claudia Fennelly, 36 Farrigan Ave.
 I've listened tonight to the proposal and there's no way in my mind that you can possibly do any of this without widening Salem Street or taking away all street parking.
 You have a, now you're going to expand the sidewalks to 12 feet wide on both sides.
 You're going to have a talk of a possible designated single bus lane.
 Then you have bicycle lane.
 Then you have two-lane traffic.
 And if you do widen the street, how much are you going into the neighborhoods?
 And how will this exist?
 How will this impact the existing non-compliant businesses that have no place to go back to?
 For example, the historical building on
 Park and Salem Street is a perfect example or even the fire station that just the city's invested all that money and re renovating so I just can't get there from here given your proposal the Comprehensiveness which brings me to the next point We're not London
 So I, and I stress that only because I did look up the firm that did this, and I don't know if they're affiliated with it, but we're not London.
 We're, you know, City of Medford, a small city relatively, and it's a very, very ambitious, designated, busy, very condensed area based on their proposal.
 And I don't know how these,
 Salem Street versus other areas in Medford were selected to be just built up with 10-story high hotels, but it seems a bit unfair to the people of Salem Street in the neighborhood comparatively to other neighborhoods which don't have aggressive planning.
 That's it.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6624.271s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, thank you, Claudia.
 I appreciate your thoughts on the street section, like how everything kind of goes together, as well as making sure that the work that's being proposed is contextual and appropriate.
 We're not London.
 There's a reason we live in Medford.
 We love Medford.
 If we left London, we'd be there.
 And yeah, I appreciate your question in terms of the selection process.
 So maybe we can provide some more insight into that process.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6656.995s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Well, maybe you could readjust things so it'd be more appropriately distributed across the city.
 If you are required by any state obligation to meet housing needs, appropriately distribute it so that you don't really make it impossible and a safety hazard to the people that live in this area.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6682.461s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And then just a quick point of clarification on the type of land that zoning applies to.
 Zoning only regulates the private land, so it wouldn't regulate the streets themselves.
 But we can dig more into some of those nuances, but just want to kind of put that out there.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6706.59s">[Claudia Fennelly]</a>:  Because it looked like on one of the design proposals that you extended back into the streets, the houses.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6715.233s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  So we'll clarify.
 At this time, we do need to move on to a different public commenter.
 We'll do our best to address that.
 And then if not, let's continue the dialogue via email or potential future public comment periods.
 But thank you so much, Claudia.
 Really appreciate your thoughts.
 The next commenter we have is Lori.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6746.21s">[Lori Spinney-Flagg]</a>:  Laurie Spinney Flagg, 55 Garfield Avenue.
 I am opposed to this proposal.
 Obviously, if you look at your maps, I am the second house in from Garfield, which means, and the house directly beside me has been abandoned for the past five years after being built.
 Nobody's in that house.
 So I don't know if they're hanging on for these
 Maybe they have some insider knowledge that you are planning to do this, but that leaves my home subject to
 two pieces in which I will have no, I don't care if you put a little diagonal on it or not, it is going to tower over my home.
 I was extremely happy when the house next door to me went up a floor because it made it more consistent with the neighborhood.
 And I have to tell you, I bought this house 27 years ago and the traffic on Salem Street has only increased year after year after year.
 I used to take public transportation.
 The express bus used to be across the street that has been discontinued.
 I have not seen buses going to Malden Station, but very rarely.
 So I don't know how much you are really digging into what's going on on Salem Street, but as others have mentioned, there's a huge parking issue.
 What about water, trash pickup?
 What about the historical integrity of this area?
 I mean, you have homes that, my house was built in the 1890s.
 So, I mean, and we've been trying to
 rebuild over the course of the years that we've been here, what's going to happen to our property values when you bring all these new people into this section of the city?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6875.108s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I appreciate those concerns, Lori.
 Sounds like you're, I think we're like 10th thing at this point, concerns about traffic.
 Maybe you have a specific parcel that you're concerned about.

 Francis Street.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6956.62s">[Danielle Evans]</a>:  Hi, Kelly.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6957.1s">[Kelli Raso]</a>:  I would like to know what is the incentive to the city to agree to all this zoning changes?
 What is the advantage to the city itself?
 People are so concerned about their property values, the increase in traffic, the sudden and extreme changes.
 The Community Development Board progressing so quickly with
 things that are going to have long lasting effects to our city and without slowing careful consideration for what the ramifications will be, how will we unring this bell if things go sideways?
 This is the first property that's come up, you know, this is the first proposal in this seems somewhat small scale, but there's no telling the
 the magnitude of, once the zoning is permitted, what will stop everything from turning into six-story buildings, one after the other, after the other, after the other?
 I just, I'm very concerned about how quickly things are moving.
 Mr. Gabb was just approved.
 Why not take a minute and let Mr. Gabb develop, you know, if you,
 already approved it and you've decided that it's going to work, why do Salem Street simultaneously?
 The advantages to the developers, I still don't understand why the city has a stake in this and what you would ever entertain so many changes at the same time for.
 I feel like it's so rushed, it's so eminent, and it's not a well-thought plan.
 without a lot of potential problems.
 And it's very, very concerning.
 I don't understand it.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7081.379s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I appreciate that feedback, Kelly.
 making sure that we're doing this kind of intentionally, bringing everybody along with the process, and thinking about your six-story building comment, it may make sense for us to revisit some of those details just to clarify.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7100.645s">[Kelli Raso]</a>:  It's not even the height of the building, it's just once the floodgates are opened, how are we going to slow the roll in once you, you know, I feel like the developers are sort of pushing in that everything is being
 expedited because the developers have submitted plans.
 Well, you know, and to that end, I would also like to say that in notifying the public, I think that it should be on the developer to send the notifications through the post office with the return receipt requested so that we can be sure that people are actually being notified and that the, you know, the actual
 perimeters of the 300 or 400 feet is being met.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7148.544s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Allie, I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to move on to another public commenter.

 Yes.
 Great, thank you.
 I appreciate the time to speak.
 My name is Jean Nuzzo.
 I live at 35 Parish Street.
 I often speak on these matters and the impacts to our resident, and I'll send my comments along, my technical comments along for the record, but tonight I'm going to do something unusual, and I'm going to speak for myself, because you've made me a direct abutter in this.
 We've lived at our home for decades here on Parris Street.
 It's a full south-facing home with sustainability built that way before it was a trendy thing.
 Recently, we lost all the nearby 400-year-old silver maples and our summer shade to development.
 We've also lost a good portion of our sun path across all seasons to a new structure.
 The impacts of development on us have already been significant.
 Our costs to run our home have increased deeply already with heating and cooling and ice removal we never needed before.
 In your plan, you are now zoning that same parcel next door, similar in topography and size to mine, actually my lot is larger, to an MZ1IZ zone.
 With mechanical, ornamental, and not exercising the loopholes in your plan changes, I have a building potentially plus or minus 70 feet tall next to me.
 Three and a half stories alone, never mind six, would completely blot out my sun path entirely.
 My home will go dark.
 I will lose the balance of what remains of my trees, bushes, gardens.
 The nearby wildlife that we harbor will be obliterated.
 No solar and other green options for us.
 So I would like to know, why does 31 Paris Street get an MZ1 with IZ status and I do not?
 You've come down the street farther than anywhere else to get to that lot, so I'd like to understand why he gets it and I don't.
 And lastly, I'd like to thank the City for their religious reminders of what developers want at every meeting, for regularly stressing the needs of the developer profits over our environmental justice neighborhood and our neighbors,
 Thank you, Alicia.
 I'm sure the moneymakers appreciate your advocacy.
 Maybe look up what a betterment is and how cities leverage them to offset the cost to the residents.
 Maybe advocate for us.
 I'm so sorry.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7419.507s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  Good evening.
 My name is Maureen Wing.
 I live at 36 Dudley Street, and I'm not next to Salem Street, but I'm nonetheless concerned.
 I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak.
 I am very concerned about a six-story building being built on Salem Street.
 In terms of the butters of the people that are in the neighborhoods, I'm very, very concerned.
 We have a certain, I would say, view of our street, view of our neighborhoods, and I think six stories is ridiculous.
 The second thing is I am also echoing what other people think about the traffic concerns.
 It doesn't seem to me that anybody's been talking about if we've done a current traffic study,
 Salem Street is a parking lot many times of the day.
 That does impact public safety response as Melanie has outlined.
 I'm also concerned that the fire trucks come down from the fire right down Park Street when they're going to other areas in Medford, and there's parking on both sides of the street.
 The parking on side streets is both sides anyway, on many areas coming off Salem.
 And I'm very concerned that what are we doing about that?
 And what are we looking at in terms of the traffic on the street?
 And the other thing is, again, the impact on the schools in terms of the school population.
 I do oppose any methadone or CBD clinic on the Salem Street corridor.
 And the other thing I would like to say is that
 If we're going to have three to four story buildings, I would prefer that you're going to have parking off street underneath those building and have those things planned for that and not say it's a 1.5 space.
 That makes no sense to me.
 And could someone just please answer from before when this was going through everything, the three gas stations that are quite near each other.
 I had the sense that we left that open.
 I wasn't sure.
 Is that are they being removed?
 Are they being asked to move?
 It was just unclear to me what was going on with the three gas stations that are sort of diagonally near each other on Salem.
 Thank you.
 Sorry for all the bullet points.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7543.652s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  No, it's really great.
 It gives us a lot to work with, so I appreciate the insight, Maureen.
 I'm hearing, you know, echoed concerns about traffic and parking, public safety.
 Maybe we can dig in a little bit more to your
 Um, kind of, uh, the underground not underground, but, um, like, self contained parking for 3 to 4 stories.
 And then maybe we can get a quick answer on the gas stations.
 It was my understanding that they are not being asked to move.
 They're allowed to operate, you know.
 You know, keeping in mind.
 Earlier commenters, was that Patricia?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7584.736s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Madam Chair, if I might.
 Nobody is asked to move or change anything.
 Exactly.
 Period ever.
 It's what allowed if they wanted to redevelop or dramatically change, redo their property.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7600.166s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And that's applicable to the property owner.
 But if somebody has a lease, which is atypical with a gas station, they might have a long-term land lease, given the amount of capital improvements that are required for a gas station.
 But if a business did have a lease and the property owner decided to move in a different direction, that's the property owner's decision.
 And if the business owns the land that it's on, then that's the business's decision because the property owner and the business are one and the same.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7631.539s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Correct.
 But nobody would be asked to move ever under a zoning change.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7637.524s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yes, correct.
 Yeah, I think that's really helpful clarification.
 And thank you so much for asking the question again, Maureen.

 I'm going to echo off of one of the former commenters specifically in regards to the step back.
 These are an architectural usage in specific climate areas that don't experience the same amount of freeze thaw that this neighborhood would.
 be under, you're going to have significant water issues in every one of these buildings.
 No one on this board is going to care about that.
 The problem is, I don't believe there's a single licensed architect involved in any of these decisions.
 I'm not one of them.
 However, I do consult with them on a regular basis and I see these issues often.
 This is something you should drastically consider removing from the
 from the the amendments it's it's just a nightmare you're you're not gonna get you're you're trying to make compliances for the residents when in actuality you're just going to design really poor buildings um and further to that i wonder if there will be any sort of aesthetic reviews on any of these buildings such as products allowed to
 clad them with or what will be the longevity of each of these buildings?
 Has there been any sort of thought put into that end of the equation?
 So I have.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=7773.854s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, John, I appreciate your concern towards like the materiality and the aesthetics of these issues.

</p>

 I just want to thank Paula and Emily for their presentation.
 I found it very helpful to understand the maps a little bit more and all of the codes and all of that.
 But one thing that it brought up, because again, I'm concerned with the same things that other people are, which is traffic, public safety and parking.
 But have either of you or even the community or the
 development board walked down Salem Street from the Rotary to Fellsway.
 Have either of you, that's just, it's a, you don't have to answer it, but have you ever done a tour of
 Salem Street, have you ever gone into Haines Square and spoken with any of the entrepreneurs who have some of them have been there for years and they have opinions about traffic and they have opinions about no bike racks and they have opinions about loitering and they have an opinion about trash.
 Have you personally spoken to anyone in Haines Square which would be
 Totally affected.
 And have you spoken to any residents?
 Have you observed trash on the street?
 Have you observed where people tend to park?
 I just, I just think that your maps are wonderful.
 Your information is wonderful, but there's nothing like boots on the ground.
 I do a lot of walking, so I walk around the area a lot, and I see a lot of things that could be improved.
 And I know that this is just zoning.
 It doesn't mean that a six-story building is going to go next to every spot that's labeled purple or whatever.
 I understand that.
 So my other question is, who is going to be encouraging this development?
 Is there a department in Medford that seeks to
 get the right kind of businesses here?
 Because what if it's all check cashing stores?
 And that type of business opportunity, who is going to be really monitoring that we're bringing in what the residents want?
 And has anyone talked to them?
 So thank you very much for my time and good luck.

 So yeah, I hear the more concerns about traffic, public safety, parking, your comments about the entrepreneurs in Haines Square, and then your concern for maintaining diversity of businesses so that it continues to serve the neighborhood.
 So thank you so much for those comments.
 Our next public commenter is Ren Bean.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8005.433s">[Ren Bean]</a>:  Hi there, Ren being from 37 Woodrow Avenue just on the other side of the rotary there from Salem Street, and I'm generally supportive of the zoning effort here.
 I think there are a lot of details to wade through to get it right.
 I think there certainly is the danger that
 the city with good intentions sort of charges in and gives permission for development.
 And then it's outsized for what the infrastructure can handle.
 I think there are some questions about electric and sewer, and of course, the traffic and parking, which all have merit.
 But my comments are specifically about the incentives.
 I wonder if there was financial equivalency considered in how folks can get the additional half and full stories, because if I were a developer just quickly looking at this, I'd say,
 Yeah, I'm going to do a fountain and a pocket park because there's no square footage on there, or I'm going to do three years at 15% below market rate for my commercial because that doesn't really cost me that much and I'm still making a profit.
 I'll take that rent and flip the building.
 Major profit.
 you know, and you, I think there's the risk here that people will take the path of least resistance and you'll end up with a street of fountains every other block or something like that.
 And you won't get some of the other incentives unless they're, you know, equivalent to each other and cost for the, to develop.
 So I, I mean, maybe, maybe that is there, but it just looks like there, there could be the opportunity to take advantage of some of these that aren't defined as granularly as the others.
 The other thing that I wanted to just...
 touch on is the 0.8 parking spaces for anything within half a mile of high-frequency transit, which, according to zoning law, is any mass transit, including a bus that runs three times an hour.
 I think the whole of the zone would be in that, based on the Better Bus Project.
 I would be a little bit concerned about all the street parking that would result from all the carve-outs for less than one parking spot per unit.
 You know, I think most of those folks almost it would be great if everyone took the bus.
 But the reality is most of the people that could afford to buy would be parking a car.
 They'd probably be eligible for resident permits.
 And, you know, I think we need to move away from driving cars and taking mass transit.
 But the reality is the bus three times an hour isn't going to take those cars off the road.
 And I, I hate to say traffic study because I don't tend to agree with some of the things that motivate a lot of those sentiments.
 But I think it would be wise.
 So thank you very much.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8167.365s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Ren.
 I hear your insight in terms of the proportionality of some of these incentives, as well as maybe some concerns about the parking minimums.
 So thank you for sharing those.
 Real quick check in with the board.
 Are we doing OK?
 Do we need a break?
 Want to make sure that we're all present.
 OK, thumbs up.
 OK.
 All right, seeing none, no objections.
 Thumbs up from Ari.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8221.956s">[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  Hello.
 My name is John Flagg.
 I live at 55 Garfield Ave.
 I don't have a lot of specifics.
 We really just started getting this information, kind of had to go through it all where everybody has regular jobs.
 But one thing I wanted to just bring up, and I'm sure it was just type of verbiage you guys wanted to use, but Selma Street's not a corridor.
 Selma Street is a collection of name arts.
 And it would be appreciated if it was looked at that way.
 I'll echo all the same things about traffic.
 Parking my street takes the brunt of parking for Salem Street.
 So if you're going to add more density on Salem Street without more parking, I guess they'll just, what they do now is park in front of my driveway.
 I guess that will just be every day.
 I saw historical character in some of the documents, and nobody seems to be addressing that.
 I just want to point out that the Sink 240 building has no relationship to any kind of historical character or myth.
 So I don't know how that building got in.
 My opinion, it's ugly, but nobody cares about that.
 But what I did want to ask is, what's the hurry here?
 You know, the communications, I know you guys started back in July, but nobody started even hearing about this until November.
 I'm trying to understand why we have to have this voted on in February.
 You need to have neighborhood input here.
 I'm right at the, I abut these changes.
 It just seems like we're rushing through to create more density without any kind of acknowledgement about what that density increase is going to do to the fabric of our neighborhood.
 I know you gave an email, and I will send an email with more specifics, but I just wanted to add my two cents in there.
 I do not support this proposal as it is right now.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8361.884s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Well, John, your input's worth a lot more than two cents.
 And I'm hearing the question like, why now?
 So I think it'll be helpful for us to provide some more insight to help answer that question.
 Our next public commenter is Alyssa Nugent.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8389.083s">[Alyssa Nugent]</a>:  Hi, Alyssa Nugent, 98 Sheridan Avenue.
 I am generally supportive of these changes.
 I appreciate that you took time to go back and look at the marijuana use and the zoning for that.
 I don't think that should be zoned in this area.
 I have some concerns about traffic and all that.
 But specifically, I have some concerns about the incentives to be able to build higher.
 It just seems like some of the options are very easy.
 A bench, the fountain, these are things that the developers would jump on to be able to have the extra
 the extra stories.
 And maybe considering all of the concern with parking, maybe something like below ground parking should be more than a half story.
 Maybe that should be a full story to incentivize that.
 And I think that in terms of creating more green spaces and making sure that we are making this a corridor that is pedestrian-minded and friendly to the neighborhood,
 that we really do focus on the incentives for putting in green space and making it a livable, walkable corridor, because that is where we want to move to, even if we do have major traffic issues related to the fact that the roads on both sides of the area are controlled by somebody besides Medford.
 So I would certainly ask that
 that the board think about that a little bit more.
 I love this neighborhood.
 I love walking this neighborhood with my kids.
 I can't wait to walk to the Roberts with them when they enroll there in a few years and it would be wonderful.
 We didn't have so many gas stations along the route and it was a little bit more beautified.
 We don't want to just push for fast development.
 We want very thoughtful development and that's what I'd like to see in the zoning plan.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8516.874s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you.
 Thank you, Alyssa.
 And I'm hearing comments that echo earlier commenters, you know, kind of concerned about this incentives menu.
 And I think, you know, we can do some work digging into that and kind of, you know, embed that with best practices, but combine it with what makes it really right for Medford.
 So thank you so much.

 I live at 302 Salem Street, which is right next to the pit on the corner of Salem and Park.
 And I just want to say how opposed we are to this zoning change.
 We were never notified.
 As abutters, you would think we would have been told that it could build six stories.
 We were never notified of this.
 The traffic, every day we go out.
 We have to go knocking on the neighbors' doors all around the businesses to get out of our driveway because there's no parking, and people are parking in front of our driveway.
 I can't imagine putting a six-story building next door with not enough parking.
 Where are these people going to park?
 And the traffic, I can't get out of my driveway.
 It takes like 10 to 15 minutes now.
 And the only chance I have of getting out is when the light changes and somebody stops to let me out.
 And I mean, I just can't imagine why we were never told of this.
 This has been a family home for over 60 years.
 And what about our quality of life?
 I mean, it's great for all these builders and stuff, but what about the people that have been in Medford and made Medford and lived here?
 Why don't we count?
 I just don't understand why.
 I mean, and rush, rush, rush, it's crazy.
 And what is our quality of life gonna be when a six-story building goes up next to a five feet from my property?
 I just don't understand.
 I'm so frustrated.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Medford is supposed to be so great, but I guess if you've lived here for years, you don't count anymore.
 So that's all I have to say, just how opposed we are to this zoning change.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8709.822s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  I hear your opposition loud and clear, and I'm so sorry that you feel this way.
 Maybe we can learn more about the notification process.
 And I'm hearing a lot of your fellow public echo concerns about traffic, but your frustration is heard and noted.

 I just wanted to voice my support generally for the direction of the zoning.
 I know that there are a lot of concerns here, but my wife and I, we had our daughter in December, and the zoning proposals and changes that we see in the docket are really giving us hope that Medford is developing in the
 direction that we would be happy to see where businesses and resources are close and will continue to be close and welcoming.
 Yeah, Medford will become more welcoming to more businesses in our area, in our neighborhood.
 Yeah, I understand there's a lot of concerns, but
 Quality of life I find is best when the resources you need are as close to where you live and you have what you need close by and you don't necessarily need to get in your car and leave Medford or drive through traffic to go get to them.
 No specific details that I wanted to mention, but just general support for the direction of this overall.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8912.615s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Andrew.

</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8976.046s">[Marian Tomaszczuk]</a>:  Okay.
 Yes, Marianne Marianne Thomas look and I live at 29 Garfield Avenue.
 Mm-hmm.
 And that's right in Salem Street
 near nappies and I am extremely opposed to this and I feel that there's totally impossible to implement this.
 If you try to do all this building and have all this density, we will find ourselves like Chelsea and having whole blocks go up in flames and the firefighters will not be able to fight it because we will not be able to have the water power to fight the fires.
 We will possibly lose firefighters' lives in the process and I feel this is
 dangerous situation.
 We did absolutely no studies, no traffic studies, nothing with the fire safety, no types of any kind of studies at all.
 Talking about these green spaces is a farce because you're talking about 3,000 square foot lots.
 You're talking about a very narrow street and yet you want a 12-foot sidewalk
 80% of the lot's going to be covered.
 And yet, and then you're going to have a green space, mini park, I forgot what you called it.
 And there's no way that that can possibly happen on a 3000 square foot lot with, you know, six, six floors, or even three floors.
 It's just
 Impossible.
 You're not requiring them to have parking.
 There's not enough parking here now.
 I live halfway down Garfield Avenue and people from Salem Street park in front of my house all the time.
 This is an issue.
 In the morning, I volunteer at the senior center and I can't even get out.
 I don't drive, but the person that drives me, we can't go down Salem Street in the morning or the evening.
 And I also want to know if you are considering the letter you got from the mayor asking you to reconsider and not vote on this tonight.
 And I also don't understand if it's legal for you to vote on this when
 The changes you're talking about, they're not uploaded on the site.
 I looked, and how can you vote on something when you're talking to us about the changes, and yet there's nothing written that we can see?
 So if you vote on what you're talking about, and yet there's nothing written about that, so there's two different things.
 One thing that you're talking to us about, and one thing that's written.
 So that doesn't seem right to me.
 It doesn't seem legal.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9156.966s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yeah, I hear that concern, and I hear the echoing of concerns about public safety, the actual implementation of this.
 And regarding the letter, there is an option for us to continue.
 That would be up for the entire board to discuss.
 So I'll leave that to our discussion.
 But that is one of our options that we do have available this evening.
 And that may give us more time to kind of process and address the board's concerns and comments as well as the public concerns and comments as well.
 So thank you so much for your insight.

 I'm a former Medford City Councilor.
 I spent eight years on the council, and a majority of that was working on zoning.
 Even though I'm an attorney, it's such a nuanced field.
 I hired a Boston zoning attorney to walk me through it.
 So,
 I think a lot of these people feel like they need to do that, and some of them, as you may have heard earlier, have done just that, and they should not have to be put through that expense.
 But what I'm hearing tonight is that no one's protecting the neighborhoods, and the overwhelming majority of these people have come forward to say they are scared, they're nervous, and they don't like what they see.
 It used to be that the city council had one motto and that was protect the neighborhoods.
 What I hear from this city council is, and maybe from the mayor and hopefully not, let's protect the developers.
 The only thing I think that you people can do tonight is take this off the table.
 It's impossible to fix.
 It is so overwhelming.
 It is so high.
 It is so dense.
 You are going to ruin the neighborhoods and that should not happen.
 So I ask you to think very, very carefully about what you're doing and to consider who you're representing.
 You're representing the residents of the neighborhood, nobody else.
 You're not representing the OCD board or the mayor or the city councilors.
 Thank you.

 My name is Lisa Korber, 47A Chardon Ave.
 I want to express my tremendous opposition to this plan.
 I feel
 The integrity of this area of the city will be destroyed.
 No one is thinking about the traffic, the parking, all things that have already been echoed.
 I've been here my entire life.
 I am now a third generation in this city.
 Nobody's thinking about the children.
 Nobody's thinking about where the children are going to go to school.
 We have over 150 vacancies, apartment-wise, in this city to date.
 Why we need to put more housing, especially this area, and this area has a lot of empty apartments right now, is beyond me.
 There are things that have been done in my neck of the woods, friend's neck of the woods, that nobody's ever been, it's never been brought forth, and that's problematic.
 So I'm respectfully asking this committee to please table this, put it aside, get the neighbors involved, and let's have a discussion
 of realistic expectations.
 Protect the people that live here.

 In East Medford, Massachusetts.
 I get it.
 You want more development.
 I've always said Medford is the best location in New England next to Boston, proximity wise.
 However, Sill Street is already a busy street.
 So it seems to me your new rezoning will add a lot of new additional real estate tax to the city, to the city's coffers.
 But will this new money lower our real estate tax bill at all?
 Will it lower our real estate tax bill even one dollar or less?
 Okay, I guess I'll wait for an answer tomorrow.

 Maybe it's time
 East Medford to secede from the city and form our own city because we have the most valuable land, period.

 I lived on Mr. Gabb in 1955.
 That was the old highway to Boston, Route 38 for information's sake.
 When they built Route 93 in 1960,
 then we really didn't need Route 38, but we have it.
 It's a lousy place back then, street cars and trucks and mechanic places and things of that nature.
 And it has not been developed when it should have been 60 years ago.
 No, 64 years ago, 1960.
 It's a live industry.
 It's still the same street.
 And that's where you can go high on one side, on the 93 side, but you gotta lower our taxes.
 If you go up 10, 15, 20 stories, you put your own off rent on 93.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10078.973s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  And all of these comments will be shared with the board for us to review.
 just to kind of confirm with the public.
 I see another member of the public who's raised their hand.
 James Sampson, you're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10102.073s">[Jim Sampson]</a>:  Yes, can you hear me?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10103.994s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yes, I can.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10104.774s">[Jim Sampson]</a>:  It's James Sampson.
 I'm 14 right here, placed in Medford.
 And I wanted to just tell people that I'm getting old now.
 I've lived in Medford all my life.
 I've worked in Medford all my life.
 And I definitely,
 think that Medved is losing some of the charm that I grew up with.
 It's becoming like Maldon.
 If you look at Maldon Center, Maldon Center is terrible compared to when I was a kid.
 And I just wanted people to know that I definitely am opposed to almost any change, but I definitely, living on this little dead-end street, it's tough to get off my street.
 Especially, the way it's timed, like the cars come from my left and then
 There's nothing on the right and then by the time of the one side clears up the other side goes up and the people are very very disrespectful people won't slow down let you get out and you know, I definitely worry about just the
 the electricity.
 I know in my house here we have had electric issues because of the way the route the electricity is run in my street and and just
 In general, I just want to say I love Medford, I've always been here, and I always will, and my grandchildren are now here, and hopefully they're going to stay in Medford.
 So please consider this very, very carefully.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10240.813s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, James.
 And I appreciate your affection for Medford.
 I share that affection.
 And I hope your grandchildren and their grandchildren can have a place in Medford, because it is such a great place to be.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10252.601s">[Jim Sampson]</a>:  It is.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10253.422s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10254.262s">[Jim Sampson]</a>:  Thank you.
 And I did.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10258.265s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Oh, I'm so sorry.
 We do have the two minute public comment limit, but I do encourage you to email if you have additional feedback.
 But I did really appreciate your comment.
 Thank you so much for sharing.
 I don't see any other hands.
 So let's see.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10283.398s">[Patricia Doherty]</a>:  Oh, I see a hand.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10284.278s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  Do you want the consultants to respond to any of this?
 Yes, I do.
 Also a presentation on the green score that we have this evening?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10294.108s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Yes, I do.
 I do want.
 to hear some responses from the consultant.
 I did see another member of the public raise their hand.
 Sometimes I take a minute to think.
 It's this new thing I'm trying.
 OK.
 So we're going to go to the next member of the public, Lisa Serio.
 You're going to get a request to unmute.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10345.334s">[Lisa Serio]</a>:  Can you hear me?
 Yes.
 Hi lisa.
 Oh, I did this because I wanted I I kind of like tried to help paulette through this to see if she could maybe get this but okay, I I'll do it with her when I see her phone because I I Couldn't even find how to raise my hand for a second and then I found it under reactions But anyway, um, I wanted to say thank um, my name is lisa and I live at 18 paul road in medford, which is not on the
 Salem street area, but nonetheless, um, it's in the saint francis area Um, I want to say thank you emily and thank you paula for your presentation um, but I just wanted to also say that um Yeah, we've i've lived in medford my whole life and um
 It is always been convenient.
 Salem Street has always been convenient for me.
 If I need a hardware store, if I need food, if I need a drugstore, everything's there.
 You had a citizen say that he wants it to continue to be that way.
 It's always been that way.
 When you go to Haynes Square, you always can find everything that you need.
 So I just want, you know, to assure him that this has always been the way it's been in Haynes Square.
 It's also even been a little bit more attractive because the square, Medford Square, Salem Street leads right into Medford Square, and Medford Square was always
 vital part of the city, which has now become like a dead zone, which I don't understand why nobody's really thinking about that area more than all the other areas, because Medford used to have a supermarket, and we just used to have so many great, you know, department stores, Woolworths, Grant's, Baker's, Shoes, everything.
 We had everything down the square, and now there's nothing down the square.
 So, I mean, it's great that you're thinking about Salem Street, and I agree it's not a corridor, it's a neighborhood,
 But the square to me is really where, you know, like where we have to kind of like be thinking and trying to figure out how to revitalize that.
 But anyway, that's all.
 I just wanted to make sure I could get through to you and, you know, just to see if I could get through.
 But I do want to thank you because I thought the graphics were great.
 I kind of understood what's happening.
 I don't know if I agree with it, but at least I understood it.
 So that's it.
 I just wanted to thank you.
 And that's my comment.
 OK.
 Thanks.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10491.383s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  Thank you, Lisa.
 I agree.
 I thought the graphics were great.
 And I appreciate your insight about specific points in the neighborhood that might need a little extra special attention.
 The feedback is hard.
 Thank you so much for speaking.
 And if you are able to help Paulette deliver her comment, we'd love to hear it, whether it's through email or some other means.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10518.71s">[Lisa Serio]</a>:  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, normally I do these things in Medford, but I'm in Arizona doing this.
 It's incredible.
 Thank you for joining us.
 I'm amazing that I'm in MedFed, but not in MedFed.
 Anyway, that's it.
 Thanks.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10533.961s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  That is one of the benefits of doing these virtually.
 It makes it a little bit more accessible for people who may not be able to join in person.
 But we do have to put up with a couple of challenges.
 OK.
 So.
 I would like to flip this back to Emily and Paola.
 The public has provided a lot of feedback, super rich, super valuable.
 But I want to open it up just to hear back any concerns.
 I have, I think about 10 pages of notes.
 So there's a lot of material to cover, and we'll at least use this as a starting point.
 So Emily and Paola, if you're able to address.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=10588.105s">[Emily Innes]</a>: 是的，谢谢主席女士。
 我也想回应你关于倾听公众意见的评论。
 这非常有帮助。
 我非常感谢今天抽出时间来到这里向我们提供反馈的所有人，无论您的反馈是批评、肯定还是索取信息，这都非常重要。
 我们非常感谢有机会收到您的来信。
 所以，非常感谢大家。
 我想谈几件事。
 一是我已经习惯听这个人谈论伦敦办事处了。
 伦敦有一家与我们同名的公司。
 使用姓氏的一个问题是，世界各地都有可能有相同的姓氏，对吗？
 我们与这家伦敦公司没有附属关系。
 我们是一家总部位于马萨诸塞州的公司。
 我们只有一间办公室。
 我们在纽伯里波特，所以我们相对本地化，但我只是想消除这种误解。
 我向伦敦公司道歉，但这不是我们。
 更严肃地说，我想解决一些问题。
 首先，在
 停车建议。
 确实有一些，我们理解停车方面的挫败感。
 我们听到了。
 我想澄清一下，我想有一两个人说了一些关于不需要停车的事情。
 我们没有改变停车要求。
 事实上，它们位于用法表中的用法旁边。
 是每次使用所需的停车位数量。
 这实际上已写入该城市的分区条例中。
 我们尚未对这些停车要求进行任何更改。
 有人提到每个单位的停车位要求为 0.8 个停车位。
 这是一个现有的
 保障性住房要求，促进保障性住房。
 这不是我们正在做出的改变。
 我们只是实施它，因为它存在于停车要求中。
 所以只是为了澄清这一点。
 我们听到很多人担心这个高度与现有住宅对太阳能断电的担忧有多接近。
 我还从其他社区听到了切断空气、切断太阳能、减少创造阴影的想法。
 我们还听说这些追溯措施可能不起作用。
 这是分区中常见的现象，但这并不意味着我们不应该重新检查它。
 所以我认为，我们不想试图回答这些问题，而是想回去与城市规划团队交谈，再看看其中的一些规定，然后再次与你们交谈。
 这就是为什么我们很高兴收到公众意见，以了解如何最好地回应一些担忧。
 我们需要做一些改变吗？
 我们当然可以看看。
 我听到的另一件类似的事情是，我们应该再次审视它，那就是对激励分区的担忧。
 也许其中一些事情太容易了。
 根据记录，一张长凳并不能构成一个故事或半个故事，尽管我可以看到如果没有特定的面积，有些人可能会这么想。
 所以我们当然可以看看。
 我们看了，我知道有人提到了喷泉，我们研究了喷泉的想法，因为它值得一些空间，因为它不仅仅是提供喷泉，而且还包括开发商或业主将支付的持续水费、维护费用，
 喷泉需要在冬天排水并进行维修和恢复，因此实际上比乍看起来的成本要高，但这一切都表明我们很乐意审查激励分区，并通过与
 今天听取议会的意见或与城市规划团队合作。
 在提及流量之前，我只是浏览一下我的 10 页笔记，看看是否还有其他具体内容。
 其中一名团队成员位于塞勒姆街，因此我们面临一些相同的问题。
 让我们来看看。
 关于生活质量还有很多其他的事情。
 我的意思是，我们收到了一些担心在学校使用的人的意见。
 我们当然可以根据我们今天听到的情况再看一下使用表，看看是否还有其他需要修改的地方。
 但鼓励学校商业的原因之一是，如果家长陪孩子上学，因为这是一所小学，
 我们希望继续促进社区的步行便利性。
 在那里做生意的想法是这样父母可以在回家的路上跑腿。
 所以也许业务合并不正确，但这是一个理由
 这个领域已经有一些公司，这就是将它们分组到那里的原因。
 人行道，我想我听到有人担心，通过拓宽人行道，我们会缩小街道。
 现在，只是为了澄清这一点，也许我们可以制作另一个图表来强调这一点。
 但想法是
 如果人行道有 8 英尺宽，他们将不得不在私人财产上再增加 4 英尺，作为开发的一部分，使人行道宽 12 英尺。
 我们正在寻找适合所有用户的宽度，人们可以并肩交谈、行走，有人推着婴儿车。
 也许对于正在与朋友交谈的人、坐在轮椅上的人来说，这样就有可能有足够宽的人行道来进行所有这些活动，也许对于一些企业来说，在夏天有一个小型的户外用餐区。
 但这就是宽度的来源。
 最后，我想谈谈交通、基础设施和对公共服务的影响。
 我听到你声音响亮而清晰。
 这是我们合作的社区始终关注的问题。
 我想艾丽西亚和一位之前和他谈过话的导演谈过。
 通常，交通研究不是在分区中进行的，交通研究是在有具体的开发提案时实施的，他们可以带着提案来到城市，当时需要进行交通研究。
 所以不，我们不是交通工程师。
 我们是计划者。
 我们是城市设计师。
 我们不会在此过程中进行流量研究，但我们听到了您的担忧。
 我们将继续与
 对于我们的客户和城市的这些担忧，我们表示赞赏。
 我认为这是成功的。
 高级问题类型。
 我注意到保拉正在做笔记。
 我认为市政府官员正在做笔记。
 因此，我们将回顾我们认为尚未涵盖的所有内容，并且我们将很乐意讨论向人们提供这些信息的方法。
 艾丽西亚（Alicia），我不知道您是否还有什么想要解决的问题，或者保拉（Paola），您是否还有其他想要补充的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11063.328s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, Alicia, Paula, si ou gen anyen pou ajoute.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11068.533s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Wi, mwen ta renmen ajoute ke sa yo se trè bon kesyon.
 Nou tout la, Carlos, Dave, Maria Elena, Zachary, Cheryl, Klein, Julissa, Doreen, Melanie.
 Mwen pa pral li yo tout.
 Mwen gen tout kòmantè ou yo.
 Mwen konprann enkyetid ou yo, ou se yon pwopriyetè kay.
 Sanble nou chanje anpil.
 Mwen jis vle klarifye yon bagay.
 Nou nan menm wotè ak ou eksepte pou bonis zòn nan.
 Patisyon ankourajman se jis
 Lot ki anfas Salem Street.
 Se konsa, si ou pa fè fas a Salem Street, ou ka gen jiska twa nan MX1 ak kat nan MX2.
 Kidonk, mwen vle fè de bagay sa yo trè klè.
 Pa gen okenn bagay tankou brasri yo gen dwa nan MX1 ak MX2.
 Pa gen okenn laboratwa oswa rechèch ki pèmèt.
 Natirèlman, marigwana pa pèmèt.
 Mwen pa sonje winery la, men nou ka gade nan li.
 Gen lòt òdonans ki pa nan zòn nan ki di si ou toupre yon lekòl, ou pa gen dwa gen yon etablisman marigwana akote li nan yon distans sèten nan lekòl la.
 Se konsa, gen lòt bagay ki evidamman pwoteje sekirite piblik ak sekirite timoun yo.
 Mwen jis vle asire w ke nou konprann ke lè nou pale sou komèsyal, anpil bagay ka rive kounye a depandan de sitiyasyon zòn ou an kounye a, epi sa a se yon otèl 15 etaj, kidonk gen kèk bagay ke nou bezwen chanje, oswa mwen panse mwen ta rekòmande pou chanje, paske se pa sa a.
 Sa a se pa sa ou genyen kounye a.
 Li pa gen okenn efè pwoteksyon.
 Gen anpil trafik.
 Sa pwal definitivman ogmante trafik.
 Apatman 2 sitiye sou lòt bò a nan Fellsway e li gen 15 ak 6 etaj, tou de nan yo se rezidansyèl yo.
 Donk Commercial Building 1 ak Apatman 2 yo gen sis etaj e nou pa pral fè sa.
 Nou ap kreye kat plis patisyon ankourajman.
 Se konsa, bagay sa yo trè sèten.
 Mwen tande kèk bèl lide nan zòn motivational.
 Mwen panse ke nou bezwen gen kèk lide sou distans oswa
 Nan fason sa a nou pa gen yon sous limyè chak 100 mèt.
 Mwen panse ke se yon bon kesyon ke nou bezwen adrese e nou ta renmen gade nan li.
 Nou vle devlopè yo oblije bay kominote a lè yo jwenn yon sèten dansite.
 Natirèlman, kominote a toujou konsantre nou.
 Mwen vle pataje yon kat ke nou pral diskite.
 Nou ap gade yon anpil nan kominote diferan.
 Li pa jis Salem Street.
 Nou te ale nan Avenida Mística.
 Kounye a nou dirije nan direksyon zòn rezidansyèl yo.
 Nou ap konstwi lòt koridò tankou Boston Avenue.
 Nou pral gade rejyon Wellington kòm yon chanjman.
 Se poutèt sa mwen vle prezante plan 2025 nou an.
 Nou pral wè tout diferan tèm yo jiska 30 jen.
 Nou pral analize tou non-konfòmite ak fason pou rezoud yo epi akselere sèten pwosesis.
 Se poutèt sa, mwen ankouraje nenpòt moun ki enterese patisipe nan reyinyon komite ak planifikasyon paske nou pral diskite sou anpil pwoblèm konsènan zòn ou an.
 Nou renmen kòmantè sa yo.
 Ki lòt bagay mwen genyen isit la?
 padon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11298.995s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Si ou pa deranje mwen entèwonp, nou bliye mansyone West Medford Square ak Medford Square.
 Nou tou pare pou sa.
 Se konsa, travay nou an se reyèlman gade nan tout vil la an repons a opinyon ak rekòmandasyon nan plan konplè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11317.259s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Wi, mèsi.
 Sa se yon lòt bagay.
 Kounye a, pafwa li santi ke nou ap fè opoze a sa nou ap eseye fè ak katye melanje sa a ki pa sèlman k ap pase sou Salem Street ak Mystic, men tou sou Square la.
 Nou pral mete kèk nœuds nan zòn rezidansyèl yo.
 Se konsa, nou te kreye sa a
 Zòn kote ou bezwen bezwen debaz yo, fè makèt, kafe, boulanjri,
 Sa a se nesesè yo fè li pi fasil yo pase.
 Se konsa, pa gen yon sèl wòch nan vil nou an, rès yo se tout bilding rezidansyèl yo.
 Nou eseye fè konbinezon sa a pi fasil pou pase epi nou bezwen mwens machin.
 Alor sa ki nou pe sey fer dan sa kalite devlopman se deservi lakominote pour ki dimoun dan kominote i kapab marse kot sa bann magazen e napa bokou trafik.
 Sa yo se kèk nan repons mwen ta renmen bay.
 Nou osi koz avek Departman Travo Piblik.
 Nou te di yo ke yo te desine yon nouvo layout lari.
 Yo konprann pwoblèm yo ap fè fas a lari yo, men li pa gen anyen fè ak dekoupaj an zòn.
 Sa a travay nan avantaj ou lè li rive konsepsyon ou.
 Men, nou te pale ak yo pou wè si yo gen nenpòt kesyon.
 Mwen panse ke se li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11406.31s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, mwen tande kòmantè yo sou enpak ekonomik la tou.
 Te gen yon kesyon sou taks ak enpak sou konpayi an.
 Mwen ta renmen konnen plis sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11421.062s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Wi, padon, Alicia, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11426.324s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mwen vle di, petèt kèk nan kòmantè mwen ta fè ta tonbe nan ranje sa a.
 Par egzanp, nou annan en Departman Devlopman Ekonomik ki raport dan nou biro.
 Direkter devlopman ekonomik nou la pou ekout apremidi.
 Se poutèt sa apati 2021, nou pral kontinye gen moun ki soti pou rekrite, jwenn nouvo konpayi, epi ankouraje diferan kalite konpayi antre.
 Mwen pa kwè ke li ap pale de... bon, kite m 'di nou, yo ap travay sou li.
 Gen kèk bagay enteresan k ap pase byento, espesyalman nan Medford Square.
 Nan sans sa a, nou travay anpil tou ak chanm komès.
 Se poutèt sa Chanm Komès la te fè yon Business Coffee semèn pase a pou diskite sou zòn Salem Street.
 Yo te voye l bay manm chanm yo, men direktè egzekitif chanm lan te di m li te ale pòt-an-pòt, li voye depliyan nan chak biznis nan Haynes Square epi li t ap pale ak pwopriyetè biznis yo.
 Mwen te eseye konvenk yo pou yo vin nan reyinyon kote nou ta pral diskite sou zòn Haynes Square la.
 Mwen pa kwè nenpòt moun ki ale nan evènman Chanm Komès la se aktyèlman soti nan Haines Square.
 Sa te fristre l pandan l t ap pale ak moun k ap fè biznis atravè Haynes Square.
 Mwen menm mwen te mache ak monte bisiklèt nan Salem Street, epi nan pwosesis la mwen te gen yon anpil nan konvèsasyon ak kèk nan pwopriyetè pwopriyete yo ak pwopriyetè biznis nan Haines Square sou li.
 Espesyalman moun ki posede yon bilding epi ki vle posede apatman andeyò biznis yo, men yo te deja refize fè sa pa Komisyon Apèl Zonaj la.
 Sa ap pèmèt yo fè sa.
 Nou gen yon bilding diferan kote yo gen yon ti apatman anlè bilding biznis yo, ak restoran sa a aktyèlman lisansye; ou ka te wè Fiore Italia elaji apatman an pi wo a pwopriyete yo.
 Se konsa, nou konnen pwopriyetè biznis ki egziste deja yo enterese.
 Gen kèk kòmantè ki di ke nou gen anpil devlopè epi nou sèlman reponn devlopè epi nou gen lisans Demo.
 Pèsonèlman, mwen dwe siyen chak pèmi manifestasyon nan vil la, epi mwen pa te wè okenn nan Salem Street nan sis mwa ki sot pase yo.
 Mwen te pale ak yon pwomotè
 Ki moun ki enterese nan yon pwopriyete ki te parèt devan vil la.
 Te gen anpil diskisyon sou pwoblèm nan, men pwopriyetè pwopriyete a nan 360 Salem Street toujou parèt enterese nan mouvman an.
 Dènye pwomotè ki enterese nan pwopriyete li a vle bati yon etaj komèsyal ak de etaj rezidansyèl anwo a, yon bagay aktyèl dekoupaj an zòn pa pèmèt, men li panse li ta anfòm isit la.
 ak Park Street, kwen Park Street ak Salem Street,
 Twou sa, eskize.
 Se sa.
 Yo gen tout pèmi yo bezwen pou konstwi bilding nan e yo genyen yo pou plis pase sèt mwa.
 Yo te di m 'kounye a li tounen sou mache a.
 Gen anpil bagay nou ka fè.
 Nou pèmèt yon moun bati bilding sa a.
 Si yo pa konstwi, nou pa ka fòse yo bati.
 Men, mwen pa konnen sou lòt devlopman.
 Mwen ta di nou fòtman ankouraje devlopè yo vin pale.
 Pale avèk nou sou sa ki pèmèt, sa ki ka pèmèt, ak ki jan yo travay ak vil la.
 Donk, si yon lòt moun nan apèl sa a di, "Men, mwen vle kòmanse yon biznis," tanpri kontakte biwo nou an.
 Ekip devlopman ekonomik nou an vle ede w.
 Oswa ou konnen yon devlopè men yo pa pale, yo ta dwe pale ak nou, tanpri.
 Se konsa, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11655.341s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sa a se yon lide itil, Alicia.
 Epi li sanble ke anpil moun te pataje li
 Tankou anekdot pèsonèl oswa enfòmasyon ke yo tande, mwen ta di, ou konnen, pi bon fason pou fè fas ak sa se pataje enfòmasyon yo ak vil la paske yo ka konfime li.
 Li itil pou nou kòm yon konsèy pou konprann detay yo pou nou ka jwenn plis kontèks.
 Mwen vle di, Medford se gwo.
 Nou pa ka tout kote an menm tan.
 Mwen patronize plizyè magazen sou Salem Street.
 Mwen jwenn kenbe nan kriz Salem de tan zan tan.
 Chofè Massachusetts yo pa gen pitye.
 Se konsa, mwen santi doulè sa a.
 Men wi, li itil pou gen enfòmasyon otank posib.
 Lè w patisipe nan pwosesis sa a, nou tout, kounye a ak nan lavni, ap vrèman fè yon sèvis pou tèt ou ak lòt moun nan Medford.
 Mwen te wè yon men leve.
 Nou toujou nan peryòd kòmantè piblik la.
 Mwen jis vle klarifye ke nou ka fèmen peryòd kòmantè piblik aswè a, men sa pa vle di nou pral fèmen li pou tout odyans lan.
 Mwen ta renmen fè sijesyon mwen yo tande, men preferans mwen se kontinye diskisyon an epi kontinye odyans lan.
 Gen anpil travay ki gen pou fè pou jwenn opinyon sa yo soti nan piblik la ak Deputy yo.
 Gen anpil travay toujou pou mwen, Emily ak Paula, ak Alicia ak Danielle.
 Se konsa, jis bay moun yon aperçu, sa a se pa fen nan tande nan men ou menm ak nou ak resevwa enfòmasyon.
 Apre sa, mwen vle pale sou men mwen te leve, ki se zòn nan vil la.
 Tanpri bay non w ak adrès ou pou w enskri.
 Yo pral mande w pou dekole epi Alice pral kòmanse yon revèy.
 M'ap voye demann sa a ankò pou'm repare.
 Sa a se eskli moun.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11808.57s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, bonjou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11809.471s">[Jean Nuzzo]</a>: Bonjou, Madam Prezidan.
 Dezole m'ap pale ankò.
 Mwen se Jean Nuzzo, ki soti nan 35 Parrish Street.
 Padon, nou te eseye... tann, kite m 'koute, mwen pa t' tande repons lan nan kesyon an ki gen rapò ak 31 ak poukisa yo se zòn kòm zòn multi-itilize ak ankourajman ak pasèl mwen an pa.
 Mwen vle repons sa a.
 Sa a se pa yon nouvo deklarasyon.
 Li jis montre konsiltan zòn sa a ak ekip sa a pa reponn kesyon mwen yo.
 Yo te ale pi lwen pase rès la, nan moso tè ki pi piti pase pa m nan, yo te ba li yon zòn enklizyon, epi yo te kite l la.
 Si ou pa gen pwoblèm, mwen ta renmen konnen ki kritè yo pou fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11853.532s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen tande li.
 Mwen ekri nòt la.
 Petèt pou yon ti kras plis kontèks, paske mwen sèten nou pa reponn tout kesyon yo.
 Pa gen anyen nou ka fè.
 Gen anpil kontni rich k ap tann nou isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11869.295s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Paske moun ka gen pwoblèm menm jan an.
 Lè nou gen reyinyon vil nou yo, youn nan bagay nou di moun, e mwen reyalize ke nou pa t 'di li aswè a, se ke nou gade nan sa ki la deyò ak sa ki sanble gen sans pou nou.
 Men, si gen yon pwopriyetè ki gen yon lot ki adjasan ak lo sa a epi li santi ke tè ou a pa zone kòrèkteman, ou gen plis pase akeyi pou voye nou adrès ou epi nou ka wè si li ta dwe enkli paske pwopriyetè a vle li.
 Sa a se tout bon efikas.
 Se konsa, mwen di sa a pa sèlman pou oratè sa a, men pou nenpòt moun ki vle pake espesifik ou.
 Sa a trè itil pou nou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11920.055s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: M ap koute direksyon.
 Jean, map revele w talè, jis pou m konfime adrès la.
 Se konsa, nou te asire w ke nou te trè klè sou sa.
 Mwen ankouraje nenpòt moun ki gen menm enkyetid pou kontakte vil la.
 Nou pral soti la.
 Wow, mwen aksidantèlman muet ou.
 Donk, Jean, adrès sa a se 31 Parrish Street, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11942.795s">[Jean Nuzzo]</a>: Paris Lake, Frans, yo gen 31 an e mwen gen 35 an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11946.418s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Oke ok, donk mwen pa jwenn li.
 Briyan.
 Trè enpresyonan, mèsi anpil.
 Mwen vrèman apresye ou defann tèt ou.
 Mèsi anpil pou pasyans ou aswè a.
 Li son tankou ta ka gen yon chemen pou pi devan pou ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11969.282s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>: Pa gen okenn ankourajman pou zonaj lè yo pa fè fas a Salem Street.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon MX paske li deja yon bilding rezidansyèl plizyè etaj.
 Se poutèt sa li se yon MX1.
 Li evidan nou ka gade nan ajoute lòt atachman, jan Alicia te di.
 Pwoblèm nan sèlman se pa gen okenn ankourajman pou sa yo.
 Ankourajman aplike sèlman nan anpil bagay ki anfas Salem Street.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=11999.199s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Lè sa a, espesyalman mande sou pwopriyete a, jan li vle di, èske li diskalifye kounye a?
 Mwen bezwen... Oke, ann tounen sou sa.
 Si w pa konfòme w, ka pa gen okenn rezon pou w chanje zòn nan sou teren an patikilye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12027.699s">[Emily Innes]</a>: Nou te fè plizyè tès ki pa konfòme.
 Nou ka tounen al gade kat jeyografik la epi wè ki jan bagay yo ap mache.
 Se poutèt sa gen yon adrès trè itil.
 Mèsi anpil paske w mete yo disponib pou nou.
 Mwen pa janm tande ou mansyone yon adrès anvan.
 Mèsi ankò pou konvoke reyinyon sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12047.8s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Li pa kritik, men ou pral wè kèk nòt sou wout la.
 Donk, Ali, mwen wè ou leve men ou.
 Mwen konnen ou santi w yon ti kras anba move tan aswè a.
 Èske sa ou te avèti nou sou sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12067.195s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Anvan mwen fini, mwen pral fè yon mosyon pou vote pou kontinye li nan yon sèten dat.
 Mwen panse ke nou te resevwa vrèman bon fidbak, ak pwochen etap la evidan, omwen pou mwen, se te travay di.
 Mwen ta renmen deplase sa mosyon sof si yon moun gen nenpòt lòt kòmantè.
 Mwen wè men Pyè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12089.608s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Kidonk, mwen devine nan yon pwendvi pwosedi, poukisa pa aswè a mwen bezwen fèmen peryòd kòmantè piblik la, dwa?
 Non, Danielle tap souke tèt li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12100.956s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Madam Prezidan, non, ou pa bezwen fè sa.
 Briyan.
 Ou ka fèmen kòmantè piblik aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12111.596s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mwen konfonn kounye a.
 Toutotan gen emosyon, ou ka di: Nou p ap aksepte plis kòmantè piblik aswè a.
 Oke, se li.
 Pa aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12123.487s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Se konsa, yo te vote pou li kòm seriz la sou tèt diskresyon an fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12129.653s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen devine mwen pa konnen ki jan yo sèvi ak pouvwa mwen.
 Men mwen apresye pasyans tout moun.
 Sa a se dezyèm reyinyon mwen te òganize.
 Donk nou tout ap aprann ansanm e mwen vrèman apresye pasyans tout moun.
 Se konsa, kounye a, ah, Adan.
 Nan moman sa a, n ap fèmen kòmantè piblik aswè a.
 Sa a pral mennen ou nan deliberasyon konsèy la.
 Ali, mwen tande ou deplase.
 Èske ou vle fè sa ankò pou asire w ke nou ap fè kòrèk lòd operasyon yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12167.337s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: sètènman.
 Mwen ta renmen sijere ke nou kontinye fè sa.
 Nan ka sa a, èske nou vle fè fas ak dat espesifik oswa jis dat jeneral?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12177.641s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Fè sa nan yon dat espesifik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12179.397s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Oke, se sa mwen te panse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12180.679s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Wi, panse mwen byen vit diferan de atitid la sou tab la dine, sa a se enkontournabl epi ou pa pral amize kòmantè adisyonèl.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle rekonèt ke ou ta ka vle tande nan men lòt manm konsèy anvan ou vote.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12196.418s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen vle di, mwen tout pou kontinye.
 Mwen panse ke nou toujou gen anpil travay pou fè.
 Annie, mwen wè ou pa silans, ou souke tèt ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12203.84s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Wi, mwen totalman sipòte li.
 Sa a se jis kòmansman konvèsasyon an, kidonk mwen definitivman dakò ke nou ta dwe deplase nan yon dat espesifik epi kontinye konvèsasyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12218.805s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Peter, èske ou gen nenpòt lide ou ta renmen oswa ou ta renmen ofri?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12224.51s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Non, sa m ap di a se, baze sou sa mwen tande nan kòmantè piblik yo ak nan men Emily ak Paola nan Menace Associates, li son tankou yo vle aplike kèk bagay anvan nou pran yon desizyon final, anvan nou pran nenpòt desizyon sou sa a.
 Me mon anvi osi fer en klarifikasyon administratif.
 Lè odyans piblik yo te kòmanse, se te pou zòn Salem Street ak Green Score, ke nou poko tande pale de.
 Pou rezon administratif, èske nou bezwen tande nòt vèt pou yon distri dekoupaj an zòn paske li fè pati menm pwojè a?
 Oswa èske nou ka vote pou ale pi devan ak Salem Street epi answit koute zòn vèt?
 Oswa èske nou bezwen? Èske de bagay sa yo gen rapò?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12276.392s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, mwen tande sa w ap di a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12277.453s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Sa a se reyèlman yon pwoblèm administratif, dezole.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12281.536s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen vle di, sa se yon pati vrèman enteresan nan travay sa a, men li la tou reyèlman enpòtan.
 Nou dwe fè bagay sa yo bon fason toujou pou moun konnen sa yo ap fè.
 Danielle, mwen wè men ou.
 Ou gen yon repons pou sa?
 Oubyen èske ou vle mwen pase nan youn?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12298.858s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Wi, mwen ka ede w ak pwoblèm pwogram yo.
 Fondamantalman, de dokiman yo te voye deyò komite a.
 Men, sa a se yon revizyon etap-pa-etap nan dekoupaj an zòn, epi nou pral kraze l 'an ti moso ki menm gwosè ak.
 Se konsa, ou louvri li.
 Wi.
 Mwen vle di, ou kapab.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12318.431s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen enkli kontni Zòn Vèt la kòm yon pati nan odyans piblik la.
 Se konsa, mwen devine teknikman nou ka fèmen aswè a.
 Mwen jis vle asire w ke li sanble gwo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12330.717s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Wi, ale pi devan epi fè odyans piblik.
 Nou pa t 'fè sa.
 Wi, mwen pa panse sa se yon pwoblèm.
 Kòm pou dat, pwochen an se 5 fevriye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12345.754s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Donk, Danielle, sa w ap di a se, petèt nou pral rete nan zòn vèt la aswè a epi answit kòm yon pati nan ekstansyon an, nou pral vin pi pre 10, ou konnen, pèdi 60 sou 108 patisipan yo.
 Mwen vle asire w ke sa a se yon bagay ou konnen nou genyen.
 Oke, kat kat, wi, mas kritik, sipò konplè ak patisipasyon konplè, kidonk mwen renmen apwòch sa a. Mwen ta enterese tande si yon moun nan tablo a gen nenpòt objeksyon. Mwen pa panse sa, mwen vle di, mwen panse li nan oke. Mwen vle di, jan mwen te di a, mwen panse ke nan tout sa ki te tande nan men piblik la ak nan men Ellie ak Paula, gen anpil travay pou fèt sou sa, kidonk mwen ta pito.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12390.971s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Se pou travay la fèt.
 Lè nou panse pwofondman, nou panse pwofondman sou sa moun panse a kòm yon pwodwi fini.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12399.635s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi.
 dakò.
 Ben, Adam, Sabrina, nenpòt panse?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12409.94s">[Ben Lavallee]</a>: Wi.

 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12412.722s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12413.002s">[Ben Lavallee]</a>: Briyan.
 padon.
 Mwen toujou nan transpò.
 Hey,
 Yon seri kòmantè piblik trè, trè remakab, trè reflechi ak bon jan, e mwen jis vle di ou mèsi. Mwen tou ap viv tou pre Plaza a, ak koridò Salem Street la se vwazen mwen nan anpil fason, timoun Roberts yo, tout bagay la, kidonk mwen vrèman rekonesan.
 Tout sa ki te di aswè a, ak kèk nan pwen kle yo pou mwen, mwen pral kenbe li kout.
 Kòm yon pati nan pwosesis la, fè respè pou rezidan yo ak kontribyab, eksplike poukisa, epi eseye dekri benefis potansyèl yo an detay.
 Mwen panse ke konpayi konsiltasyon an te fè sa an pati aswè a, kidonk mwen apresye sa e mwen espere ke nou tande plis sou sa.
 Mwen tande enkyetid yo sou trafik, kòmantè yo sou Roberts kòm yon pati prensipal nan tout plan rezonaj la, sekirite piblik ak ekipman, e sa ki pi enpòtan, mwen byen kontan nou abòde pwoblèm sa a.
 Emily, mwen apresye ou adrese pwoblèm sa a.
 Ou dwe okouran de pwoblèm espesifik pake, mwen pral ajoute yon lòt plugin, si ou gen pwoblèm espesifik pake tanpri fè yo konnen, kontakte vil la epi diskite.
 Se san mank plis dyalòg nesesè.
 Mwen favorize modifye fil la tout antye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12503.66s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi Ben.
 Mwen te resevwa koupon pou apwobasyon Adan an.
 Pafè, Sabrina.
 Legal.
 Se konsa, nan pwen sa a, mwen pral konkli peryòd kòmantè piblik aswè a.
 Nou pral chèche yon mosyon pou kontinye pwoblèm zòn ak pwoblèm zòn vèt jiska yon sèten dat, pwobableman 5 fevriye.
 Mwen te konnen Tufts te ranvwaye lannwit sa a.
 Èske nou gen nenpòt lòt plan devan City Council nan lannwit sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12549.296s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Non, nou gen yon bagay nan zòn sa a nan chemen maryaj la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12555.76s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Genyen prezidan an, atravè prezidans la, e wi, gen sibdivizyon ki toujou bezwen vote sou yo, men sa ta dwe trè rapid.
 Se fondamantalman lis enjenyè vil la pou fè.
 Plan yo chanje ak Tufts te yon kat sovaj.
 Se tout sa nou genyen e mwen panse yo se sèl atik ki sou ajanda a.
 Mwen dwe fè remake ke 19 la se pwochen an, dezyèm lan, oswa ou pa, premye a ak twazyèm lan, li nan twazyèm lan, sa a se semèn fèt la nan mwa fevriye, epi mwen, mwen ta pwobableman rekòmande pa divize semèn nan jou ferye nan zòn.
 Mwen ta kite men mwen te rele pandan m te nan vakans.
 Mwen pral nan Vermont.
 Mwen pa panse li ta bon pou rezidan yo.
 Mwen dakò.
 Moun pral soti nan vil la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12609.157s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Se poutèt sa, li pa pral dire jiska dat sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12612.159s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Se konsa, e si nou kòmanse ak nimewo senk?
 Paske nou toujou genyen zòn vèt la.
 Nòt vèt.
 Pwen vèt, padon.
 Sèvo mwen fèmen apre dis è, kidonk nou ta pi bon kontinye.
 Men, nou gen nòt vèt la, ak Lè sa a, nou ka wè ki jan nou reponn a kòmantè piblik sa yo epi ale soti nan la.
 Sa mwen tande ankò e ankò, ak sa mwen konplètman dakò, se, ou konnen, ann pa prese.
 Mwen pa panse ke nou ta dwe sispann, men mwen panse ke nou ta dwe asire w ke nou avanse pou pi devan reflechi ak entansyonèlman.
 Mwen rekonesan anpil pou travay Emily ak Paula ak Danielle ak Alicia fè.
 Fè li deplase nan bon direksyon an.
 Konbine tout fòs nou yo, nou reyalize objektif sa a.
 Mon demann ankor en mosyon pou prosedir.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12667.871s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Mon ava fer en mosyon pou kontinyen diskisyon lo Salem Corridor e Green Space le 5 Fevriye.</p>

 Wi, mèsi anpil pou ekspètiz ou nan pataje istwa pèsonèl ou, sa vrèman vle di anpil.
 Ou konnen, nou se vwazen ou tou, e sa ede nou pwolonje rive nan, ou konnen, sa k ap pase deyò nan ti wonn nou an.
