    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=0.271s">So</a>  good evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1.953s">My</a>  name is Emily Henneman. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3.395s">I</a>  am chair of the Medford Community Development Board, and I'm calling the meeting to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=8.261s">Let's</a>  begin with some obligatory procedural matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=12.834s">This</a>  hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=18.038s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=31.428s">A</a>  reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting on progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=43.297s">If</a>  despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=52.544s">And</a>  a reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=61.513s">I</a>  would also like everyone to know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=71.398s">Clicking</a>  on current CD board filings and Danielle or a member of the staff will drop that link in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=80.723s">We</a>  are going to start with roll call attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=85.465s">Ari</a>  Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=87.666s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=88.907s">Hey,</a>  Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=90.368s">Sabrina</a>  Alpino. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=93.845s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=94.986s">Hey,</a>  Sabrina. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=96.247s">Adam</a>  Behrens.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=115.58s">Good</a>  to have you as vice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=117.021s">And</a>  myself, Chair Emily Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=119.863s">Danielle,</a>  can you please introduce any staff from the call?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=127.055s">Yes,</a>  myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=131.736s">We</a>  also have Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of PDS. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=135.557s">I</a>  think we had Sal DiStefano, the Director of Economic Development, if he's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=141.218s">Yeah,</a>  I see Sal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=143.379s">We</a>  have Brenda Pike, who is the Climate Planner in our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=146.779s">Welcome,</a>  Brenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=150.521s">one</a>  of our student interns, Josh Needleman, who will be taking minutes tonight.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=157.803s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=158.483s">Important</a>  job, Josh. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=163.965s">Thumbs</a>  up for minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=165.385s">I</a>  used to do that when I staffed a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=167.326s">So</a>  it's an important job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=171.267s">So</a>  our first item on the agenda tonight is a new public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=177.226s">We've</a>  had continuances for previous public hearings, but this is a new one, so I'm going to read the public hearing notice for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=184.976s">This</a>  is a rather long one, so I just wanted to give people a preview that you're going to hear my voice for a couple minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=194.97s">So</a>  the public hearing notice for the record is that the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on January 22nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=208.085s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=217.107s">Amend</a>  section 94-2.1, which is division into districts, to add the Salem Street Quarter District. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=226.969s">Amend</a>  section 94-6.0, which refers to general regulations, to insert a new subsection to create the new green score zoning regulation and to state the applicability, standards, and calculation methodology therein. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=245.038s">Amend</a>  Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, specifically Table A, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District into the existing table and to designated the uses permitted therein. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=260.503s">Amend</a>  Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, specifically Table B, by incorporating the Salem Street Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=275.427s">Amend</a>  section 94-12, which is definitions, to amend and add various definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=283.79s">Amend</a>  section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Salem Street Corridor District. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=293.145s">Amending</a>  the zoning map to create a new Salem Street Corridor District and to change the zoning district designation of various properties to place them within said district, as shown on a map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning, dated December 8th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=312.15s">Amend</a>  section 94-11.7, which is site plan review, to incorporate the green score regulation by adding submission requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=322.988s">for</a>  the site plan review and modifications and establish a waiver process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=329.154s">We</a>  also include Zoom link meeting details in this notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=334.219s">This</a>  is the Zoom meeting that you are all in presently and also posted this on the city website calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=341.545s">I</a>  would also like to let everyone know that a subsequent public hearing on this same matter will be held by the Medford City Council on February 11th, 2025 at 7 p.m., excuse me, in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, which is 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=364.241s">So</a>  two different ways to be involved with that hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=367.783s">A</a>  link to the public hearing will be posted no later than November 29th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=371.166s">I'd</a>  like to start this off by asking staff if they have any introductory comments, and then we will be viewing a presentation from Emily Innes of Innes & Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=389.88s">There's</a>  going to be two aspects to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=395.323s">So</a>  for people that were very patient with the list of different changes that we're reviewing and providing recommendations on tonight, there's kind of two different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=408.732s">There's</a>  the green score zoning, and then there's zoning itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=412.394s">So</a>  we're going to hear first about zoning, and then we're going to hear about green score zoning regulation, just to kind of set the stage for everyone and manage expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=427.696s">So</a>  Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and her team?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=440.592s">Madam</a>  Chair, I do believe that NS Associates has a pretty solid introduction explaining a lot of the background, the timing, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=450.076s">But</a>  I did want to share for the public, this is not one of our normally scheduled weeks for the Community Development Board meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=457.8s">However,</a>  we were aware that we had a number, a large number of public hearings that we needed to <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=464.523s">here,</a>  and we wanted to give the zoning its due time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=469.344s">Last</a>  time we took up zoning after several public hearings, it was much too late and too difficult to process all that information late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=478.847s">So</a>  we thought this deserved its own separate hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=482.468s">For</a>  those who are not aware, the city board meeting actually went until midnight last week, and we could never have taken this up after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=491.19s">which</a>  is why we're hearing this on a separate week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=493.791s">And</a>  we continue to have a pretty heavy caseload, even though we're meeting twice a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=499.414s">So</a>  with that, I'm actually going to pass this off to Emily Innis and Paula Ramos-Martinez, too, because they will put this into the context of the comprehensive plan, which is something that Emily actually worked on with us for several years, as the board is aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=517.542s">I</a>  think that's sufficient.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=522.088s">Thank</a>  you, Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=525.05s">With</a>  your permission, Madam Chair, for the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=530.092s">I'm</a>  joined by my colleague Paula Ramos Martinez. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=533.754s">We</a>  are together going to give you a presentation starting with Paula first to go over the background to the zoning change for the Salem Street corridor, what we're doing, why we're doing it, information about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=548.841s">I</a>  will then join you for the details of the zoning, so I can show you from the summary information where to find that within the language of the zoning itself, particularly important for many people on this call who may not deal with zoning on a regular basis, who just want to give them a guide to where to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=565.809s">Then</a>  at the appropriate moment, Hala will be back to you to explain the green score, again, what it is, why it is, and what the implications are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=574.192s">So</a>  that is our plan for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=576.973s">I</a>  will just reiterate with what Alicia said I know Paola will talk to it as well but just said the this zoning process or rezoning process that we're in now was a recommendation of the comprehensive plan so we are essentially in the implementation stage of that recommendation by bringing forward the details that were envisioned in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=600.385s">With</a>  that, and with your permission, I'm going to turn this over to Paola, who will share her screen and take us through the first part of the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=607.71s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=608.17s">Thank</a>  you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=608.831s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=611.873s">This</a>  is Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=614.814s">Madam,</a>  if I may, I'm going to share my screen and start with the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=625.201s">We</a>  can see your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=630.535s">We're</a>  looking at a meeting reminder, which no matter how many times you dismiss, they always pop back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=638.201s">All</a>  right, now we got a presentation.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=639.943s">OK,</a>  it's going a bit slow then.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=642.084s">And</a>  we are looking at your presenter view. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=647.969s">Now</a>  it's just the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=650.131s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=655.075s">So</a>  I wanted to say, it was already said before, but we have <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=659.563s">two</a>  main things that we want to present today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=661.744s">One</a>  is going to be about Salem Street Corridor District and that is going to take the first part of this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=670.41s">We</a>  will take questions and later on we will come back with the presentation and do the second part which is the green square. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=681.017s">So</a>  in the agenda for Salem Street what I have is we're going to talk about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=686.721s">So</a>  what has <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=688.593s">what</a>  we did before and that made us come here at this meeting today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=694.555s">So</a>  what was the process before that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=697.837s">What</a>  are the opportunities for public comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=702.439s">Not</a>  for this one alone, but because we're going to come back <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=707.146s">We</a>  are reviewing zoning, so we are going to do a lot of topics, very different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=713.509s">I</a>  want to give to everyone what is the process when we take a new draft, what are the different <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=724.939s">phases</a>  that has to go through and when in those phases you could give comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=732.384s">Then</a>  I'm going to do introduction of why this, why Salem, where does that come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=739.449s">We're</a>  going to go into your current zoning, what is there now, and then we're going to show the proposed zoning map. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=749.543s">The</a>  last two topics I'm going to give to Emily, and she's going to go through the draft, so the language, and she's going to talk first about the general changes that are being done to the Medford zoning ordinance, and then the new district that we are adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=767.213s">And</a>  after that, we will do the Q&A. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=770.374s">I</a>  must say that I'm very happy that there is so many people here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=775.48s">So</a>  what was the timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=779.403s">When</a>  did this started? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=781.485s">And</a>  what were the meetings that we had until today? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=785.828s">So</a>  we did a workshop in July 24th, where we showed a lot of analysis that were done at a citywide level, and also for Mystic Avenue and Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=797.357s">And</a>  this analysis were very varied, but were showing us dimensions, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=803.782s">of</a>  the lots, the existing zoning, non-conformities, transit, a lot of different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=814.549s">And</a>  all those topics were citywide, but also Mystic and Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=819.592s">So</a>  this helped us to get started with the analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=823.874s">And</a>  then in the August 14th, we brought the first proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=827.416s">We</a>  started with Mystic Avenue and Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=831.817s">In</a>  December 3rd, we did Mystic Avenue first. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=835.078s">That's</a>  why you see a big gap between August and December. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=838.319s">And</a>  then when we finished Mystic, we started with Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=841.921s">We</a>  presented the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=844.742s">And</a>  then in December 11, we presented the final with the comments and different little tweaks that we did to the first draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=859.842s">In</a>  December 11th, the Planning, Permitting and Committee meeting, I referred and approved to refer this draft to the CDB and this is why we're here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=873.272s">So</a>  what is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=875.593s">So</a>  what we're going to do, and this is going to be with every topic that we are going to bring forward for the rezoning, we're going to first in city council, and this is in the planning committee meetings, we're going to bring a new topic, we're going to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=892.361s">And</a>  here we're going to listen from the councillors, from the city staff, and from the public, any comment that they may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=901.605s">So</a>  we will come back another time to a planning committee meeting, and we will present the draft with the alterations that were needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=911.188s">If</a>  everything goes well, then the city council can refer to the city board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=918.13s">Here</a>  again, we will hear from the public, from the board, and the board will vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=927.368s">the</a>  topic and it can be referred again to the City Council and the City Council can give the final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=934.231s">So</a>  this is a process and in every of these phases and stages the public has an opportunity to comment on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=943.534s">We</a>  are telling you this because we are going to continue looking at different topics and this list is going to be updated every time that we present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=953.938s">So</a>  in gray, you're going to see different dates and topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=961.202s">The</a>  gray says represented meetings that were already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=965.964s">The</a>  red are the meetings that we're doing today, and that's Salem Street and Green Score topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=971.166s">And</a>  the blue are the ones that will come in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=975.608s">So</a>  this is going to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=977.549s">So</a>  we have the final dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=979.65s">And</a>  every time that we present, we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=983.242s">let</a>  you know which are the new topics that we are working on and at what stage they are so that you can write it down and join any meeting that you would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=994.408s">So</a>  where does it come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=996.088s">Why</a>  we're doing this or why we're doing Salem Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=999.11s">Where</a>  does it come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1000.751s">So</a>  in 2023, January, it was published the Medfair Comprehensive Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1009.978s">In</a>  here, it was the work that was done by the city consultants, and there was a lot of public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1018.087s">It</a>  was a two-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1021.27s">In</a>  here, you can see and that are identified all the problems, opportunities that Medford has. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1031.795s">So</a>  for example, we see here, so at the end of this book, and I recommend anyone that is interested in, we are basing a rezoning on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1040.821s">So</a>  all the principles values are taken from this comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1047.025s">And</a>  at the end, it has a <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1050.089s">very</a>  long list of strategies that are organized by topics and one for example the VP which is vibrant places 1.1.2 refers to rezone to allow mixed use in village centers as a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1068.886s">So</a>  what you can see on the right is the vision map that comes out of this comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1074.948s">In</a>  this vision map you can see the corridors, so in here they were identified the corridors, squares and centres, transformational focus areas, green corridors, institutional anchors and different densities in the residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1094.053s">So</a>  what we are looking now is first we started with corridors, we started with Mystic Avenue, we're working now with Salem, later on we will look into the squares, we are looking now into neighborhood residential, so the low scale of the residential, and we will continue to look into every topic that was identified in this comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1120.447s">So</a>  we are going to look now at Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1124.757s">what</a>  is your current zoning and what does your current zoning allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1129.739s">So</a>  in zoning, whenever we're going to rezone or rewrite a part, a district, what we have to do is to look what is existing, what is your current zoning, what are the future trends, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1147.827s">If</a>  there is a comprehensive plan, for example, like we do have in Medford, what are those values and goals that the city has? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1155.433s">And</a>  implement that in our proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1161.037s">So</a>  what do you have in your current zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1164.48s">It's</a>  not exactly, especially in Salem Street, it's not exactly what you do have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1171.492s">So</a>  what we're going to look into is Salem Street, you have three different districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1177.697s">You</a>  have apartment one district, and that is the majority of Salem Street is in that district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1185.603s">Then</a>  you have commercial one at the end in the corner with Salem Street and Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1191.107s">And</a>  then in the other side of Fellsway, you have apartment two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1196.478s">So</a>  what does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1198.219s">So</a>  we have here the dimension standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1202.683s">We</a>  have it in a different way than your table because the table is a bit of difficult to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1207.967s">So</a>  we have it by district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1209.948s">And</a>  so your dimension standards in apartment one <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1215.789s">your</a>  maximum height is three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1220.733s">Then</a>  it can be four if it's assisted living. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1223.715s">But</a>  let's say that your multi-dwelling is up to three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1229.34s">Your</a>  C1 is up to six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1232.782s">These</a>  are all heights by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1236.74s">In</a>  the case that in C1, somebody wants to do a hotel, by right, you can do 15, 1.5 stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1247.067s">In</a>  apartment 2, we have something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1249.829s">We</a>  have 6 by right and 15 for any other permissible permitted structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1256.974s">So,</a>  this is what you have now in your current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1262.358s">So</a>  if we see it a bit more like in a diagram illustration, what does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1266.119s">Apartment</a>  one, that is this salmon pink that you have in Salem Street, in the majority of the Salem Street, you have, for example, single family maximum is 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1278.902s">If</a>  you have, oh, sorry, there is a typo here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1281.843s">If</a>  you have multiple dwelling, it's three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1287.864s">Oh,</a>  sorry, yeah, I know what it is, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1290.95s">you</a>  have single family detached, that's 2.5, single family attached, that is your typical house, sorry, and that is three stories high, and then you have multiple dwelling that is three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1303.645s">What</a>  happens in apartment one is that <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1308.555s">commercial</a>  use is not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1310.996s">So</a>  you have all the commercial buildings that are from 93 until commercial one are uses that are not allowed in your current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1323.538s">Now,</a>  if we go to commercial one, commercial use, yes, it is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1328.519s">You</a>  can have multiple dwelling up to six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1332.28s">This</a>  is what is allowed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1334.896s">And</a>  you can have a hotel that is 15 stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1340.258s">With</a>  apartment is very similar, but instead of a hotel, what you have is any other principle structure that is allowed in apartment too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1348.02s">And</a>  the dwelling, multiple dwelling, it's also six stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1354.602s">So</a>  in our proposal, we don't think that those highs <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1363.87s">And</a>  those uses really reflect what you do have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1368.872s">Because</a>  you do have a lot of commercial that we do think it's important to keep and to make it conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1378.835s">You</a>  do have, sorry, you don't have the area to really let 15 stories high, not a hotel or any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1392.158s">So</a>  we made a different proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1396.221s">We</a>  want also to have mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1398.543s">So</a>  what we did is to create different sub-districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1402.986s">We</a>  wanted to create a lot of diversity as it is already now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1406.669s">We</a>  wanted to look really into what you have and what really works. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1412.193s">And</a>  the proposal comes from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1414.975s">So</a>  we have two mixed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1417.577s">Mixed</a>  use one, that's the blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1419.318s">Mixed</a>  use two, that is the reddish. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1422.19s">Then</a>  we have commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1423.513s">Commercial</a>  is just one little parcel in here and I will explain why. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1427.662s">This</a>  is the dark red. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1429.64s">And</a>  then the rest is the yellow multi-unit residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1434.382s">So</a>  I'm going to start for the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1437.364s">Whenever</a>  we saw that the lot was entire, the whole block was entire, already existing, all residential, we kept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1446.108s">We</a>  think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1449.149s">This</a>  corridor, it has commercial, but it also has residential and <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1456.765s">this</a>  is not a citywide corridor, this is not Mystic Avenue, this is a corridor that should serve the neighborhoods that are around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1465.172s">So</a>  we do like the idea of the neighborhood coming in this corridor, so to have a mix of only residential, of mixed use, and a little bit of higher density mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1480.123s">So</a>  mixed use one, it's whenever we have that mix of <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1485.513s">You</a>  have residential, but you also have commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1489.316s">So</a>  we kept it as a mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1492.298s">Why</a>  the difference between- Paula, one quick note.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1495.701s">Your</a>  audio is going in and out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1498.844s">I'm</a>  wondering if it's a bandwidth issue, which can sometimes be solved by turning off your own video. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1509.398s">Maybe</a>  just double check that any programs that are competing for bandwidth have been closed out as appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1520.312s">Okay,</a>  I closed the video, so I hope that it's going better. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1524.353s">Yes,</a>  I think it's a little bit better.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1526.594s">Yeah,</a>  I would encourage members of the community to message Alicia or Danielle if you... Sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1532.876s">No,</a>  no apology needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1533.936s">You</a>  know, we're all doing our best in this virtual world. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1536.957s">So</a>  we'll try this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1537.837s">If</a>  we need to revisit, we'll go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1540.398s">Okay,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1543.939s">So</a>  what is the difference between MixUse 1 and MixUse 2? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1547.24s">So</a>  MixUse 2 was... <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1551.114s">It's</a>  those areas that are connecting to a major service or to, like, for example, we have parks, we have other main streets like Washington streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1565.834s">Streets</a>  that are connecting with these bigger activators, as for example, Park Street, where we have a school and we have the Hickey Park, or for example, on the really east that we have the Morrison Park, we have Spring Street that is also has some commercial areas and commercial nodes in there that has a higher, let's say, pedestrian, fluent pedestrian movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1595.58s">We</a>  wanted to give it a different, let's say, a different density towards these areas so that we could have more commercial ground floor and make it more pedestrian and that, let's say, that these are like activity stepping stones along these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1616.289s">So,</a>  if I go... <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1623.283s">continue.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1624.124s">Yes,</a>  so what are these districts and what are the dimensions standards that we are applying? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1631.748s">So,</a>  for example, the multi-unit residential, the minimum lot area is 3000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1637.631s">We</a>  took this number because of what is existing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1641.293s">We</a>  have a lot of non-conforming because the minimum lot area is from 5000 and 6000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1649.938s">So</a>  there are a lot of non-conforming lots and we wanted to reduce those non-conforming lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1656.869s">And</a>  so the minimum lot area gets to be reduced to 3,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1661.316s">The</a>  maximum height is three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1666.435s">mix</a>  use one, minimum lot area is also 3000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1670.599s">And</a>  I'm going to explain what is this difference between base height and maximum height. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1676.785s">So</a>  the base height, it's the height that you have by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1681.83s">And</a>  in this case, for the mix use one is three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1686.014s">So</a>  by right three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1687.716s">Now,</a>  if <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1689.7s">And</a>  here comes the incentive zoning that we will explain, and Emily will go through more in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1696.302s">Incentive</a>  zoning is when we let a developer increase their density if the developer gives something back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1707.986s">And</a>  this giving something back to the community is something that is established. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1712.688s">So</a>  it has to go through a menu of options and <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1717.412s">with</a>  standards and so if they think that is reasonable like for example increasing affordability or creating a pocket park for the neighborhood then we let them increase in mixed-use one a maximum of plus one story. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1738.036s">So</a>  with incentive zoning mixed-use one could go to four stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1743.698s">Now</a>  in mixed-use two <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1745.533s">The</a>  minimum lot area is 3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1747.934s">Maximum</a>  height, and this is by right, is four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1753.095s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1754.175s">Now,</a>  with incentive zoning, so if the developer gives something back to the community, they can increase by two stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1762.697s">So</a>  maximum height with incentive zoning is six. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1769.019s">And</a>  then the commercial, which in this case we have a very small <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1774.868s">a</a>  very small lot there, is minimum lot area 10,000 square feet, maximum height three stories, plus three of incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1783.494s">So</a>  it will be the same as Mixis 2 at the end, but it has three of incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1790.578s">So</a>  by right is three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1794.461s">We</a>  will talk more and Emily will go more through these dimensionless standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1801.928s">We</a>  are going to go through the map and in this map, we're going to see what is there right now and what is not permitted by your current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1811.355s">So,</a>  any kind of commercial area that we have from the 93 towards Fellsway, in this area, for example, this is not permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1825.426s">As</a>  well, the one that we see on the lower part, it's not permitted at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1832.026s">um</a>  and then the three stories high multi-family this would be this it is permitted so when you say not permitted it doesn't mean that if this if these amendments were to pass like we would we would evict these businesses it means they're they're welcome and encouraged to continue to operate um as they see fit just to know</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1860.903s">Sorry,</a>  because maybe it's a bit confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1864.646s">What</a>  we're doing is that they will be permitted with our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1869.05s">So</a>  with our proposal, they are permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1874.254s">And</a>  this is that right now, they are non-conforming by use.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1880.539s">But</a>  they can still continue to operate regardless.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1883.321s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1883.982s">It's</a>  just that if they want to increase their height by the current zoning, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1890.415s">They</a>  have to go through a lot of bureaucracy by to they're not required.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.236s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1895.536s">So,</a>  because the commercial use is not permitted in apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1899.717s">These</a>  are not these are non conforming that will change with our new proposal because they would be in the mixed district and commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1908.66s">It</a>  is permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1909.52s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1912.521s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1914.362s">So</a>  the same would happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1915.602s">Every</a>  time that we see a commercial in your current zoning is not permitted, that would change in the new zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1925.884s">Gas</a>  station, for example, you do have some along Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1930.865s">These</a>  won't be permitted in the new zoning as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1934.086s">So</a>  they continue to be non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1939.203s">As</a>  well, when we go, we continue another gas station and another gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1944.606s">They</a>  are very close, three of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1947.167s">So</a>  these are non-permitted, non-conforming, and they will continue to be non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1952.189s">Then</a>  this commercial is non-conforming now, but it will be conforming with the new proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1959.913s">These</a>  are the residential lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1964.055s">They</a>  are permitted now, and they continue to be conforming in the new proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1971.093s">We</a>  continue here, more residential, these are permitted now and they will continue to be permitted in the new proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1979.2s">And</a>  these are commercial that right now in your current zoning is not permitted, it will be permitted and conforming in the new proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1989.649s">This</a>  is the commercial one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=1992.759s">So</a>  all of them are permitted now and they continue to be permitted in the new zoning and this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2000.726s">So</a>  now I will explain this really red area that we have a lot that we have as commercial is mainly so that we think this gas station makes sense to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2011.736s">It's</a>  near Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2013.718s">It's</a>  out of traffic from Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2016.921s">So</a>  we prefer that <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2019.463s">that</a>  we can keep and that we would like to continue, so this is conforming in the new proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2031.253s">So</a>  we also wanted to add this definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2035.416s">This</a>  is a business incubator because we think that this is a new definition that would attract certain types of business into this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2047.583s">They</a>  can be very small, so not big scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2051.465s">So</a>  I'm just going to read the definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2053.527s">Business</a>  incubator is an organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2061.011s">and</a>  create an achievable plan to make that product or service to market. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2066.516s">In</a>  addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as the shared office space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2077.364s">An</a>  incubator program can last for several months to a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2082.268s">We</a>  think also that this can create a lot of activation and a lot of community in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2093.696s">And</a>  because we understand that people might be worried about having these mixed-use 1 and 2 next to their residential or single-family house, what we have come with is <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2109.386s">a</a>  neighborhood compatibility, and this is that when MX1 or 2 on commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subjected to this context standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2122.096s">And</a>  that means that their side and rear setbacks are going to be from zero <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2127.139s">to</a>  10 so they have to allow that setback so we have a little bit more of a space between the two buildings and then the height it's going to be increasing and following a 45 degree angle from the three <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2147.093s">stories</a>  minimum up to the six in case they go for the incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2153.535s">So</a>  we want to really have this transition between mixed use one, two and commercial towards the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2160.998s">So</a>  that's why we implement this as a development standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2169.237s">What</a>  we also want to let very clear is that as we see this area is a pedestrian oriented area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2177.868s">We</a>  want this to be as active and for people in the center of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2185.558s">So,</a>  we also have in these standards, like, for example, that the parking has to be on the rear side of the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2194.402s">So,</a>  what we have facing the street is the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2198.444s">We</a>  have an active ground floor so that a lot of eyes are on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2202.666s">It</a>  feels safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2203.527s">It</a>  feels active. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2204.888s">We</a>  also, any new development has to provide 12 feet <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2210.05s">fit</a>  for the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2212.771s">So</a>  the sidewalks right now are very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2215.312s">We</a>  had this analysis in the very beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2219.013s">We</a>  don't think that is enough for new buildings to come here and to have this active and pedestrian activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2227.115s">So</a>  to make it more safe we ask that any new building has to give that minimum <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2233.837s">space</a>  for the sidewalk of at least 12 feet, and then it has to have a minimum setback of three, if I'm not mistaken, so that we wanted really to make it as pedestrian as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2248.447s">So</a>  I'm going to give now the... I'm going to stop now the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2253.13s">I'm</a>  going to pass it to Emily, and she will guide us through the ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2261.54s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2262.22s">I</a>  will just share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2264.641s">Just</a>  one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2266.801s">Now,</a>  Paola has shown you the colorful images designed to explain the more technical aspects of what you're unfortunately about to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2278.344s">Zoning</a>  can be kind of dry when you're not familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2283.725s">But</a>  I do want to show you where in the zoning ordinance to look for the things that Paola just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2291.507s">Also,</a>  I believe the city board members received a staff memo on proposed changes that came out of the city council meeting and a couple of other implications from those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2304.259s">I've</a>  already put them in here, I've highlighted them, so I'm going to show them to you as we go along and then Paola will show them to you again later when we go back to the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2313.647s">So,</a>  the first thing is the division into districts, which we talked about already. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2317.749s">When</a>  you establish a new zoning district, you have to put that into a certain part of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2327.114s">I</a>  should say, I think most of the people on the call are probably familiar with this, but just for those who have not looked at zoning changes before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2336.738s">Zoning</a>  changes are not development projects, they set the stage, they give permission for things to happen, they give options for things to happen, but they don't require that things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2347.868s">And</a>  I think that goes to what we were talking about earlier with the uses that are <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2353.213s">non-conforming</a>  under the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2356.274s">We</a>  had a couple of different goals as we approached this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2359.895s">One,</a>  obviously, was, as Paola said, to make sure that we were following the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, implementing that after that long public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2370.337s">But</a>  the other thing was, as we were looking at what was on the ground now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2375.679s">hearing</a>  maybe what people valued about their neighborhoods and understanding that many things, and this is true of almost every community in Massachusetts, many things that are physically present now are actually not allowed in the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2390.608s">And</a>  that's because many of our communities developed before zoning came into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2396.731s">Some</a>  communities <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2397.992s">didn't</a>  start putting zoning in place until the 60s, some were a little bit earlier, but most of our New England cities and towns are actually older than zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2409.517s">So,</a>  as we looked at this, just to clarify that we're also looking at giving permissions for things that were already there, making it easier for people to invest in their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2421.583s">because</a>  we were reducing the requirement for them to go and get a variance because their properties were non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2428.104s">So</a>  part of this is what we call right-sizing the zoning to what's already there, and I'll call out some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2434.326s">So</a>  unfortunately I'm going to scroll through and make you a little bit dizzy as we look at this, but the next key thing to note is the table of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2442.547s">Now</a>  for those of you who may have been <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2445.869s">Watching</a>  the changes when we did the Mystic Avenue corridor, you're going to recognize some of the terminology, the MX1, the MX2, and the commercial districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2456.034s">Those</a>  district types are also present in Mystic Avenue, but we are tailoring them to be appropriate for Salem Street, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2465.54s">Because</a>  Mystic Avenue is a very different entity, a very different feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2469.462s">a</a>  very different purpose than Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2471.883s">So</a>  the first thing we did was to add this MR, this multi-family residential district, which Paola explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2478.746s">So</a>  that's new, that is not found in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2482.467s">And</a>  that was to allow for housing that was variations or varieties of housing types that was more suited to a neighborhood corridor, a neighborhood area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2495.299s">And</a>  then the second thing, so you'll see that, you'll see the yellows, that's the MR coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2501.585s">It</a>  allows and disallows or allows by special permit, depending on the use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2507.471s">The</a>  other thing you'll see is from time to time, you'll see a blue coming in under MX1, MX2, or commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2515.5s">You</a>  can see it here, for example, for co-living. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2518.062s">That's</a>  when we're making a change from what's in Mystic Avenue, where we're specifically tailoring those district types to be appropriate for the Salem Street corridor, and I'm going to call out a couple of them as we scroll through. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2531.627s">So,</a>  if you are interested, Paula gave an overview of what is and is not allowed in the different districts, but if you're interested in the specifics <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2540.831s">of</a>  what is and is not allowed, then you should go to this proposed table of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2545.654s">And</a>  I believe that all of these are online now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2549.516s">We</a>  will update it again, as we do after every meeting with the city board, we'll provide the new version. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2555.419s">So</a>  you can see here, for example, adult use, there's a no in the commercial, you see that blue, that's because adult use is allowed in Mystic Avenue in the commercial sub-district, it's the only place in the city that it's allowed, so it is not allowed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2570.847s">You</a>  will see also that we are proposing changes and Paula will go over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2575.669s">We're</a>  proposing changes to some of the medical office definitions we introduced this past spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2583.613s">Earlier</a>  in the process, we are refining them to be more specific with both and consistent with both state and federal law and also with the needs of the overall city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2594.518s">And</a>  then the permissions, and I'll show you the definitions in a minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2599.72s">are</a>  very much tailored to Salem Street and neighborhood needs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2603.961s">So</a>  I'll show you the definitions that go along with these, but just note that that's also a difference with the corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2611.923s">The</a>  other big one is that and where there's a major change is that in the Mystic Avenue District, the adult use marijuana uses are allowed, the various options that are not allowed in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2626.507s">So</a>  you can see those called out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2628.229s">And</a>  then motor vehicle related uses, as Paola mentioned, were not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2635.054s">They're</a>  allowed in the commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2636.796s">The</a>  light service station is allowed by special permit by the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2640.358s">The</a>  other ones are not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2643.956s">And</a>  then certain industrial uses, manufacturing, research and testing, things that are appropriate for Mystic Avenue are not appropriate for Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2654.139s">So</a>  we have removed those. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2656.059s">And</a>  there's a couple of tweaks in the parking that you see that are not major. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2659.44s">Here's</a>  some other of those light industrial uses that are not allowed in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2665.521s">And</a>  that is a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2668.002s">And</a>  then we are done with the table of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2670.966s">So</a>  our next step is the table of dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2675.352s">And</a>  so these are the changes that we've made to these. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2679.557s">So</a>  again, multifamily MR district is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2682.741s">You</a>  see the yellow coming in indicating that's a new <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2688.287s">district</a>  in this area, so all of these are very different from Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2692.951s">And</a>  then the blue, again, tailoring these district types, the mixed-use 1, the mixed-use 2, and the commercial for Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2700.536s">So,</a>  Paola went over the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2703.038s">This</a>  was based on our evaluation, our analysis of the lot area in this <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2710.164s">neighborhood,</a>  the heights have been reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2712.686s">Anybody</a>  who saw the Mix 1, Mix 2 on Mystic Avenue, that's not applying here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2718.593s">We</a>  have reduced the heights as Paola suggested or described. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2723.159s">We</a>  have a base height that's allowed as a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2726.222s">that</a>  may have a maximum height, and these are for buildings up front on Salem Street, and they require that incentive zoning, which I'm going to show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2735.568s">We</a>  have the step back in here that protects Salem Street from having the buildings sort of go straight up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2743.812s">There's</a>  a little bit of a setback there to make them more human scaled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2748.839s">Here's</a>  the business incubator coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2751.62s">Here</a>  are the new definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood medical office, and medical office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2757.221s">You'll</a>  note the difference between neighborhood medical office and medical office is that a neighborhood medical office is limited by size. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2765.782s">So</a>  it shall not exceed 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and is limited by the number of employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2772.083s">It</a>  cannot have more than five employees.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2776.204s">It's</a>  also where the adjacency, the commercial next to residential uses is, this table up here.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2786.967s">Oh,</a>  it's further down, the adjacencies in the standards actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2791.669s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2792.529s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2792.909s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2793.249s">Thank</a>  you for calling that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2794.53s">I'm</a>  going to actually swing down that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2797.691s">It's</a>  coming up in about three sections, but thank you for asking that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2802.972s">So</a>  we have, this is the Salem Street now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2805.913s">So</a>  all of those sections that I just mentioned actually modified other parts of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2811.994s">Now</a>  we're getting into part of the zoning ordinance that establishes the Salem Street Corridor District. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2818.616s">It</a>  has a purpose to it, which is the wider variety of uses and building types to support jobs, economic development near established residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2828.578s">Paola</a>  mentioned that we were looking for neighborhood goods and services, neighborhood economic activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2834.78s">So</a>  the idea is this provides options for living within walking distance of jobs, goods and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2840.201s">We</a>  want mixed use, multifamily and commercial uses as a density appropriate to the walkable urban corridor, that's Salem Street itself, understanding that that's serving that wider neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2851.084s">And</a>  that we're establishing design standards to buffer the neighborhoods from a higher intensity of uses and we want this nice identity that's appropriate for Salem Street that reinforces what's there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2864.97s">The</a>  applicability creates the sub-districts that we just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2870.074s">And</a>  then this is that question that you asked Madam Chair, dimensional requirements and waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2875.799s">That's</a>  where we start to refine the dimensional requirements to allow for the setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2882.665s">the</a>  step-downs, so we have to, this is this first one, the front setback is the one that Pella mentioned where the facade has to be set back to create those wider sidewalks to make it more walkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2896.011s">The</a>  side and rear setbacks are required next to an existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2902.835s">We</a>  have to have a landscape buffer or a fence with a landscape buffer on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2909.098s">Here</a>  are the height step back requirements, which is that neighborhood context and requires the massing of the building to be reduced closer to a building in any of the residential only districts and that's to allow for light, air, it keeps the existing residential buildings from being dwarfed by new buildings because they have to reduce that massing, reduce that height. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2931.757s">We</a>  require the ground floor active frontage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2934.938s">We</a>  require some additional transitions to residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2940.941s">We</a>  have setbacks for infill lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2943.182s">So</a>  again, these are allows the infill building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2947.904s">An</a>  infill building is a new building on a vacant lot, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2952.425s">And</a>  it allows the infill building to match what's on the other side of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2956.087s">So</a>  we keep the consistency with the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2960.268s">We</a>  have height waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2961.829s">These</a>  are consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2962.909s">This</a>  is the step back waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2964.47s">So</a>  given that diagram, you can see that if you have a step back from Salem Street, and you have a step back from the residential neighborhood, and you might have a step back from another residential, at some point, you can't build a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2978.514s">And</a>  so the waiver allows the Community Development Board to reduce the dimensional requirements of any of the step backs <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2987.077s">but</a>  it requires that priority is given to keeping the step backs that reduce the massing next to residential buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=2994.405s">So</a>  in other words, you could reduce maybe the step back on Salem Street, but not the step back next to one of those three-story existing residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3003.054s">We</a>  want to put criteria around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3005.577s">Interested</a>  in hearing people's opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3008.799s">The</a>  next piece is the development incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3011.62s">Paola</a>  mentioned this, and I want to stress that this is a menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3016.181s">I</a>  think we heard some questions that people thought that maybe they were all stacked on top of each other, so somebody could do them all and get additional height. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3026.024s">We</a>  added language that's in the pink here that says it only goes up to the maximum height that's in that table of dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3034.707s">There</a>  are a lot of options for achieving that community benefit, but if you're only allowed to have one extra story, you only get to choose one of those options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3043.373s">You</a>  can't say, I'm giving you two options, I should get two stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3046.855s">You</a>  are limited to that one extra story. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3049.576s">Obviously,</a>  the maximum that we have is <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3052.358s">three</a>  incentive floors on top of a three-story building to get to six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3056.959s">So</a>  that is your limitation in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3060.68s">It's</a>  a six-story building, so it's either four and two or three and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3065.961s">But</a>  none of these have changed except for the public parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3071.823s">We</a>  had heard comments <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3074.143s">throughout</a>  the process that Salem Street, that area could use some additional parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3078.946s">And</a>  so we've added public parking as a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3082.288s">However,</a>  you'll see for the shared community, solar and public parking, these are topics we're still working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3089.452s">So</a>  we have not set the requirement for the benefit yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3093.714s">We're</a>  putting these in here to let people know that these are potential options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3098.717s">And</a>  we're going to confirm what the requirement would be for the benefit at a later date in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3105.6s">And</a>  then the design guidelines and applicability of the development standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3109.902s">I</a>  do not, the sidewalk width is the only thing that changed from the other ones that we had developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3118.026s">I'm</a>  just skimming down to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3120.027s">Yes,</a>  that was the only change. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3123.508s">Development</a>  standards and design guidelines are used in the site plan approval and the special permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3130.994s">They</a>  are criteria to measure the developer's proposal and require that they meet certain standards or address certain guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3142.603s">For</a>  anybody who had seen the earlier process, except for that sidewalk width, they should be familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3148.027s">And</a>  with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen and turn it back to Paola just so she can give us a summary of the changes from the original document that we sent you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3156.636s">And</a>  then we're happy to answer any questions from the board and from the public as appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3162.102s">Paola?</a> </p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3166.046s">Madam</a>  Chair, if I may, I'm going to share again the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3185.691s">You</a>  see my screen now?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3187.979s">Yep,</a>  we're viewing the slide with city recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3193.108s">So</a>  we have five recommendations from the draft, the latest version. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3200.192s">And</a>  so the first one is, as Emily explained, is to clarify that intent in the introduction of the development incentive bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3208.756s">So</a>  in the section of the development incentives, we want to add so that it's clear that it's up to the maximum height under the section. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3219.709s">of</a>  the table of the mentioned requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3222.15s">So</a>  the total paragraph will read in as follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3226.792s">In</a>  exchange for incorporating certain provisions that further the city's goal for affordability, economic development, environmental sustainability, climate and climate resiliency, applicants may receive development incentive bonuses that allow for certain development permissions beyond what is allowed as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3245.158s">up</a>  to the maximum height under section 94-4.1 table of dimension requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3252.46s">These</a>  permissions include one or more additional stories up to the maximum numbers of stories allowed in each sub-district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3260.302s">Additional</a>  stories must comply with any setback, stepback, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3266.923s">sorry,</a>  there is a repetition, or other dimensional requirements and the development and design standards in 94-9.x.6 development standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3279.006s">So,</a>  this is the first one, just to clarify, that is up to the maximum height under the section 94-4.1 that is in the table of dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3291.667s">The</a>  second is about some definitions that we wanted to modify. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3296.869s">So</a>  we want to delete the definitions for clinic, hospital, and medical office that we had in the previous with Mystic Avenue district and replacing them with the following definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3310.953s">So</a>  clinic is a clinic as defined in general law point C.111. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3319.236s">section</a>  52 hospital a hospital as defined in general law c.111 section 52 neighborhood medical office office of a physician dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital as defined in section 94.12.0 definitions the office area shall not exceed 1500 square feet of gross floor area and shall have no more than five employees <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3348.269s">Medical</a>  office, office of a physician, dentist or other medical practitioner not located in a clinic or hospital is defined in section 94.12.0 definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3355.28s">The</a>  office area is greater than 1500 square feet and has more than 5 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3366.53s">So</a>  with that, the third is update the section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, to reflect the proposed definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3376.595s">So</a>  we have text to be removed, is crossed out, and the text to be added is in bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3381.958s">So</a>  we have them at the end of the table, we include that neighborhood medical office, which is not allowed in multifamily district, but it is allowed in mixed use 1, 2, and commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3394.821s">And</a>  then the medical office is not allowed in multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3401.783s">And</a>  then we have mixed use 1, 2, and commercial as a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3407.624s">And</a>  then the clinic is not allowed in any of the districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3412.81s">The</a>  fourth is to add to the section 94-9.x.3 dimensional requirements and waivers the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3422.116s">So,</a>  we add two of those requirements, one requirement, one waiver, which is the height step back requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3432.163s">And</a>  this is the text for the diagram that you saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3437.747s">of</a>  the context. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3439.008s">So</a>  for any lot within the MX1, MX2 or commercial district that abuts MRGR or apartment 1 district, a height setback is required along the lot line abutting the residential district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3453.497s">The</a>  height setback is calculated by a 45 degree angle beginning at the third floor and extending to the highest floor of the building in the MX1, MX2 or commercial district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3464.704s">The</a>  fourth, fifth and sixth floor shall not break the plane of that 45 degree angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3471.306s">And</a>  then we have that a step waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3473.147s">If</a>  a building is subject to a front step back and rear or side step back, the community development board may waive the strict dimensional requirement of any of the step backs provided that priority is given to retaining the step back, step backs that reduce the massing next to the residential buildings of five or fewer units. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3494.721s">And</a>  last is the update to section 94-3.2, table of use regulations, table A, to remove marijuana as an allowed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3504.483s">Text</a>  to be removed is crossed out, text to be added is in bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3508.264s">So</a>  what we do is just changing for the MX1 and MX2, the adult marijuana establishment, the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, retail, and independent laboratory, instead of CDB, so a special permit, we change them to no. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3525.289s">not</a>  permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3526.61s">And</a>  those are the changes that we propose and the city recommends. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3538.781s">So</a>  now we will give the Q&A. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3542.645s">We</a>  finished our presentation and we hope for any comments we will be answering them Emily, myself or city staff.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3554.395s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3554.795s">Thank</a>  you, Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3555.736s">Thank</a>  you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3556.397s">I</a>  really appreciate the thorough presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3558.499s">I'm</a>  going to open it up to the Community Development Board for comments or questions from our group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3569.871s">Following</a>  that, we will open the public comment period, just to give a preview of what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3577.877s">We</a>  have Annie, Peter, Sabrina, Ari, Adam, Ben, myself online from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3589.842s">I'll</a>  just start with my first takeaway, which is really the alignment with the existing setup of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3601.631s">I</a>  think that that presents a lot of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3603.793s">As</a>  I asked Paola, these non-conforming uses, do they, does that mean that they get kicked out or something bad happens to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3619.148s">It</a>  almost means that they have more opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3622.911s">So</a>  if they wanted to do something with their site or do something different commercially, they are now allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3631.477s">So</a>  I really like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3633.799s">I</a>  think it's very considerate of the connections between commercial and residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3639.564s">I'd</a>  like your thoughts around step back, especially the connection between higher density <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3650.808s">the</a>  housing, and it has some strangely specific questions about this neighborhood medical use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3660.451s">But</a>  I can save that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3662.252s">It</a>  was really just why five employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3665.093s">I</a>  mean, that feels almost like an arbitrary number, and it feels weird to be regulating the count of employees, as well as questions around <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3680.615s">I</a>  think there was a comment that we don't allow neighborhood medical office and multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3686.558s">And</a>  my first thought was there's people that operate their medical practice out of the first floor of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3693.722s">I</a>  don't think that that's common enough to make a big issue of it, but I did just want to recognize that just in case that's a scenario that you all evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3708.305s">So</a>  yeah, those are some of my initial thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3712.127s">But</a>  maybe we can do like a round with the board, and then Paula and Emily, if you want to respond, because we might have some of the same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3719.55s">I</a>  see Ari, they have their hand up.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3723.992s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Innes Associates for the very detailed presentation and proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3730.312s">Um,</a>  I live just on the other side of the rotary towards Medford square, so I'm very familiar with this corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3736.939s">And</a>  1 of the things that I appreciate about it as a resident is that mixture of residential commercial businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3745.146s">I</a>  can walk down the street and get a sandwich during my lunch break. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3749.088s">And</a>  I think that one of the great ironies of the greater Boston area is that many of the structures that we most value and people most like, the townhouses, the triple deckers, are disallowed by our zoning, and we can't build more of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3763.474s">So</a>  I think it's very smart that we're aligning it to accurately describe what we have and allow for more development like what we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3772.378s">evidence</a>  through living that this is what is working for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3777.281s">I</a>  don't have any particularly detailed questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3780.822s">I'm</a>  looking forward to hearing community feedback, but I think in general the approach here of allowing commercial and mixed zoning makes a lot of sense for this area.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3799.392s">Adam,</a>  I see a hand.</p>

    <p>[Adam Behrens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3801.249s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to chime in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3803.731s">It</a>  was super helpful, especially in context with the Mystic Avenue zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3811.197s">I</a>  think when I first saw the proposals, my immediate reaction was like, oh Jesus, are we creating Mystic Avenue here? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3821.325s">It</a>  was really helpful to see the consideration specific for this corridor that even though it might be called the same abbreviation, it's actually not permitting the exact same thing for Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3838.911s">I</a>  just wanted to voice that where coming in, I was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3848.254s">We're</a>  really trying to up zone this and so it was helpful to get the context of kind of a primary consideration of like, okay, let's, let's match to as much as we can to what's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3859.965s">And</a>  then, um, um, you know, try to like ease ease into a little bit more density, but not do it in such a jarring way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3869.675s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3875.364s">Then</a>  Sabrina, Peter, any thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3879.267s">Or</a>  Ari, any response to Adam's comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3882.749s">I</a>  think you hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3885.511s">We</a>  can use the same letters in the table, but we're clarifying that this is specifically for Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3896.018s">And</a>  I think that's some nuance that DePaula and Emily, your slides did a good job at differentiating.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3907.463s">I'm</a>  just going to say that I do appreciate the clarification on the height, because I know that's something that was confusing to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3914.125s">And</a>  to understand that it is a hard maximum of six stories anywhere on the corridor, because I think that is something that I had heard concerns about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3925.749s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that that is the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3928.89s">Agreed.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3932.73s">So</a>  I'm going to do a quick break because we're humans. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3938.012s">Give</a>  Emily and Paula a little bit of time just to pull together some thoughts and responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3943.474s">But</a>  let's all meet back here in, let's say, five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3949.645s">grab</a>  a water, bio break. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3952.006s">And</a>  I do see a hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3953.647s">We</a>  will be moving into the public comment period after we hear back from Emily and Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3958.73s">Feel</a>  free to raise your hand and we will get to you once we enter that portion of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3964.073s">Really</a>  excited to hear from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3965.414s">We've</a>  got a great crowd, so should be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3969.236s">But</a>  yep, we will be back in about five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3974.471s">Normally,</a>  I actually had a comment before, like from the staff before you go to public.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3980.233s">Yeah,</a>  so I gave Emily a heads up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3982.093s">She's</a>  going to defer to you and then we're going to hand it back to Emily and Paola for any responses to the board comments and then go into public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3992.616s">So,</a>  Alicia, if you would like to provide some of that insight.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3996.942s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=3998.283s">So</a>  I did just want to reiterate that we had reviewed and met with the consultants since what originally was went to the CD board in your packet is exactly what went to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4011.376s">And</a>  so that is what the city council has to vote on, but they can be voting with amendments and they would vote on amendments that you recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4020.166s">And</a>  so what is this recommendations from the staff are amendments that have come up since it went to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4032.815s">But</a>  there was one that we had discussed and I think maybe there was a little miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4039.34s">And</a>  so I just wanted to mention it, not in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4042.763s">So</a>  with the small medical office, the neighborhood medical, one of our thoughts was that <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4049.928s">we</a>  should be looking at limiting the hours from 8 a.m to 7 p.m because we don't want off medical offices and stuff we don't want people in people's neighborhoods next to people's homes coming and going at very early hours or very late hours so like you wouldn't want an urgent care open till midnight next to somebody's house or you wouldn't want them that kind of stuff going on and so that was one of the recommendations was to have <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4078.418s">and</a>  hours of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4080.52s">And</a>  that's also something in a big picture way that we want to be looking at in our zoning across the board is what are the hours of operations and how are they allowed in zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4092.469s">There</a>  is a paragraph in zoning that currently limits hours of operations, but it doesn't apply to medical offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4102.337s">And</a>  it might be different if it was in a strip mall than it is if it was next to someone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4107.905s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4109.766s">Yeah,</a>  thinking about the implementation, the actual use, and the day-to-day clientele. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4115.37s">That's</a>  a good lens to apply to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4118.872s">Thank</a>  you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4120.693s">Emily</a>  and Paula?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4122.928s">I'm</a>  happy to respond 1st to that and then to the comments from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4128.754s">We</a>  agree on hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4131.376s">It</a>  was, as I said, as Alicia said, it was a miscommunication that was left off our text. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4137.082s">So</a>  we're just pulling the correct sentence and we'll have it for you by the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4142.667s">or</a>  at the appropriate point to discuss it, but we agree that that's an important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4148.511s">I</a>  think you had asked why the difference and again, it goes back to tailoring uses for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4156.197s">It</a>  is quite common to think about the impact of different uses on a neighborhood in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4165.143s">the</a>  scale of a business or use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4167.945s">And</a>  one of the issues we had heard coming from the community was something like this, like a business that had clients coming to it, the impact of traffic on it, given that Salem Street is not only a corridor in the sense that it leads from one place to another, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4187.898s">That's</a>  how the comprehensive plan was defining corridors, is that they were important streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4193.361s">that</a>  took people from one part of Medford to another part of Medford, but it's also a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4197.962s">And</a>  so we wanted to think about the scale of certain businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4201.683s">This</a>  is one that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4204.764s">The</a>  size, the number of employees, the hours of operations are all methods of limiting that scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4212.346s">So</a>  we've got a smaller scale, which could be as a right with special site plan review rather, we have a larger scale that could be a special permit and let's just have a higher <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4224.649s">higher</a>  level of review before it comes into an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4230.671s">And</a>  I do want to stress, I was delighted to hear the city board members picking up on this idea of tailoring Salem Street to match what's there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4241.315s">I</a>  do want to reinforce that zoning presents options. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4245.397s">It</a>  doesn't require somebody to change their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4249.338s">So,</a>  a business that's non-conforming now that would have to go through a variance process to invest in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4255.401s">A</a>  homeowner maybe whose current house is on a lot that doesn't meet the minimum lot requirements would also be non-conforming for certain things, might have to go for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4269.868s">Part</a>  of our goal was to reduce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4271.749s">It</a>  doesn't mean the business has to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4274.15s">doesn't</a>  mean the homeowner has to do anything, but if they choose to, the pathway is a little bit more clear for them now if the zoning is passed than it would have been otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4285.539s">Zoning</a>  changes are about creating those opportunities, and in this case, with the addition of development standards, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4293.205s">the</a>  ability to do design guidelines, it is also about putting appropriate community controls on some of those uses, some of those potential buildings that could come in if people make certain decisions with their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4305.916s">But</a>  I just wanted to reinforce that we were trying very hard to respect what Salem Street was while giving the people who live, work, own businesses there now opportunities for the future.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4322.169s">Also,</a>  one thing as well, we do allow home occupation in multi-residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4331.852s">So</a>  if they have a small business and they want one doctor or something practicing from their home, that is possible in the residential because home occupation in the table of uses, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4349.544s">is</a>  permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4350.304s">I</a>  just wanted to flag that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4359.706s">And</a>  with that, we're happy to listen to comments from the public as well.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4365.808s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4367.448s">OK,</a>  so I see some hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4375.49s">Let</a>  me pull my notes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4382.183s">So</a>  I will now open, or just real quick, do any other board members have any follow-up questions to what Emily or Paolo said? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4390.57s">No,</a>  okay, and feel free to just throw your hands up or unmute yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4397.095s">Strong</a>  no from Annie, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4401.232s">So</a>  I will now open the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4404.796s">Those</a>  who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4411.782s">You</a>  can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4416.567s">Before</a>  providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4420.991s">Reminder</a>  to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members outside of technical difficulties to city staff, as it's not part of public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4435.679s">However,</a>  if a participant is having audio or other technical issues, message Danielle, message Alicia, and they'll make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4444.727s">You</a>  enter the queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4447.971s">We</a>  are limiting speaking to two minutes per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4453.277s">Part</a>  of the reason we do this is, you know, especially for topics like this, we have a lot of people that we want to hear from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4459.084s">We</a>  want to make sure everybody is heard in an equitable manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4463.889s">The</a>  two-minute limit has worked previously for meetings, so we're going to be using that for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4470.012s">If</a>  you have more to add, or you want to respond to others' comments, I encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4479.357s">All</a>  of those comments get shared with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4482.278s">We</a>  review them before every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4484.959s">So,</a>  you know, those, they don't just go into a black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4487.781s">So</a>  I want to encourage people to also use that email address as well as, you know, speaking up this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4493.005s">And</a>  this is such a great opportunity to hear directly from the public, because what we at the community development board are tasked with is making recommendations to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4505.315s">So,</a>  you know, we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4507.11s">you</a>  know, be a little creative and, you know, pass this back to the city council based on the amendments that we propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4516.555s">So</a>  excited to hear what everybody has to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4518.957s">Alicia</a>  is going to help me manage the public comment queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4524.42s">I</a>  think I can manage it okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4528.382s">But</a>  Alicia, do you have any overview for the written comments that have been received? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4536.487s">Or</a>  Danielle?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4538.688s">I</a>  didn't prepare a summary today to share that out.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4543.792s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4545.173s">We've</a>  been reading them as they've been coming in.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4547.494s">Actually,</a>  I might share that there are ones that were sent directly to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4552.038s">I</a>  found that there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4555.58s">So</a>  I have been trying on a case-by-case basis to reply to residents with sort of more information about what was in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4566.428s">partially</a>  because a lot of the concerns were around things that were either not correct or were being changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4574.671s">I</a>  don't want to reiterate a lot of that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4576.412s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4577.392s">But</a>  yeah, the public comment period is a time to provide your feedback, but also ask clarifying questions if there's something that doesn't really click or doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4588.176s">So</a>  encourage everybody to ask questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4590.357s">And</a>  thank you, Alisa, for providing <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4593.899s">more</a>  updated feedback to the public that sent in questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4598.421s">So</a>  I just want to make sure I'm keeping track of everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4605.486s">So</a>  the first public commenter that I see is Carlos Cabreras. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4613.251s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4616.253s">Please</a>  state your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4617.794s">Alicia</a>  will start a timer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4623.846s">Hi,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4625.746s">Yeah,</a>  my name is Carlos Cabrejas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4627.467s">I</a>  live at 224 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4630.768s">So</a>  thank you for taking the time for this presentation, especially Paul, that was very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4637.009s">So</a>  my question is, what is the plan to alleviate the already busy corridor that Salem Street is, you know, bringing all of these <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4647.816s">you</a>  know, development, houses, businesses, traffic is only going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4652.178s">What</a>  is the plan to make these, to mitigate the, yeah, what I said already, bad traffic that we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4658.822s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4663.244s">Thank</a>  you, Carlos. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4664.224s">Appreciate</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4668.46s">And</a>  for anybody that hasn't done these before, we typically hear all of the public comment, and then we'll pass it back to Emily and Paola to provide a little bit more insight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4680.731s">And</a>  then we as a board will deliberate and go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4685.375s">The</a>  next public commenter that I see is Dave McKenna. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4690.52s">Dave,</a>  you're going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4694.418s">Sorry,</a>  Marielena, I might've accidentally clicked your name, but we're gonna start with Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4702.742s">Where</a>  did Dave go? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4709.666s">We</a>  might've lost Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4717.51s">Let</a>  me look at the attendee list.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4722.02s">I</a>  just sent him an unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4723.601s">Um,</a>  there we go.</p>

    <p>[David McKenna]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4726.562s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4727.963s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4731.644s">I</a>  am generally supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4736.306s">Oh,</a>  David McKenna to vine street, just a half a block from Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4742.029s">Generally</a>  supportive of the new development because it will increase our tax base, which I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4747.692s">So</a>  we can improve city services for all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4751.754s">Um,</a>  and also, uh, really supportive because this will provide just more housing and we are in a housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4759.136s">Um,</a>  multifamily housing, condos and apartments are more affordable than single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4763.677s">So,</a>  um, for people looking to downsize or for, um, we'll just have more housing options and I'm excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4773.779s">Um,</a>  on the incentives, uh, I think it's great that by right, it's just three to four stories, which is what's currently existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4781.004s">And</a>  then if there's an extra community benefit, then the developer could go beyond the three to four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4788.591s">The</a>  affordable housing community benefit seems really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4793.916s">But</a>  my favorite one is the pocket parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4796.939s">And</a>  I had a question about this because we could really use more green space along Salem, and developers are incentivized to provide a public pocket park. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4807.315s">If</a>  they were to provide maybe the equivalent of two pocket parks or just more larger green space, would they get an additional incentive for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4815.376s">Can</a>  they use that incentive maybe twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4819.117s">And</a>  the seating, the extra bonus for seating in the park or the fountain, to me, does not really, it's not that valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4827.378s">It's</a>  the green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4829.059s">A</a>  park should have seating in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4830.419s">So</a>  I think that should just be a requirement of the incentive for the pocket park. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4834.52s">I</a>  don't really care about the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4838.392s">So</a>  any way to increase the amount of green space would be really beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4844.555s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4846.255s">Thank</a>  you, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4850.617s">And</a>  as we hear questions, we got a really solid recommendation from city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4856.439s">As</a>  we hear questions that come up again and again, we may pause to address those throughout this public comment period just to make sure that, you know, we're all kind of working on this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4870.789s">or</a>  to offer clarifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4874.851s">Marie-Elena,</a>  you're going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4877.652s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4880.373s">Hi,</a>  Marie-Elena Tetchi Bariola, 62 Sheridan Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4884.955s">I</a>  will try to keep it brief because I feel like I have a lot of questions, but I'll keep it to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4888.996s">One,</a>  thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4891.063s">It's</a>  very detailed, but my brain also doesn't work this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4894.405s">So</a>  like, it's a lot to process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4895.905s">And</a>  I think that's probably true for a lot of people, you know, mix one, mix two, I get really kind of becoming that zoning stuff kind of just like jumbles in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4906.112s">So</a>  some additional visuals might be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4908.895s">Some</a>  of the slides were helpful, but it would have been really helpful to say, this is what's here now, and this is what we're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4915.283s">Because</a>  I think she mentioned it, but I was having a hard time keeping track of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4919.087s">So</a>  that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4919.908s">But</a>  question wise, I think maybe what a lot of people, or at least myself anyway, is concerned about is, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4926.155s">Is</a>  the definition of the differentiation between medical offices, clinic, medical facility, like on the heels of a methadone clinic being proposed in the area, it seems like, OK, so now they're changing the definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4940.985s">So</a>  I've been trying to figure out where are the original definitions to compare it to what the new amended ones are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4948.15s">So</a>  that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4949.131s">But</a>  also, I think it might have been you, actually, that said, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4953.576s">You</a>  you're not you don't think that like like why should we limit the number of employees in a medical office? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4958.498s">I</a>  actually totally disagree with that I think that we should like I think because then what we're coming up against is Maybe an urgent care or something and you know We just came out of we're in a post-covid world where there were lines in urgent cares like outside And I don't want that in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4973.743s">I</a>  don't want you know, whether this happens again or not like that's <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4978.165s">you</a>  know, you have people like lining the street to get a COVID test, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4981.828s">Or,</a>  you know, anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4983.509s">And</a>  even if they open at eight o'clock, people line up at seven, 730. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4985.791s">So</a>  I think that that is a concern, because when you don't limit the number of medical employees, you end up with offices like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4993.556s">And,</a>  you know, where it says just a physician, well, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4996.338s">Could</a>  they actually put them at the clinic if they <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=4999.18s">filed</a>  it under something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5000.461s">I</a>  think that's a major concern and there's my two seconds left. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5004.105s">The</a>  other concern is like for all these increased housing, what do we do with these students? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5008.489s">These</a>  schools are so overcrowded right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5010.51s">Like</a>  if there are all these kids, what do we do with that?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5014.554s">Those</a>  are all really great questions and really great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5016.996s">I</a>  appreciate your insight around the neighborhood medical office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5026.108s">The</a>  next public commenter that I see is Zachary Chertok. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5034.715s">You</a>  should be getting a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5036.857s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5039.861s">Zachary</a>  Chertok at 5 Allmont, right at the corner of Allmont and Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5044.264s">I</a>  have a list of questions, but the technical ones I'll email. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5046.605s">I'm</a>  not going to worry about that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5047.786s">I</a>  also apologize that my lighting makes me look like I'm going to say a soliloquy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5053.749s">And</a>  Danielle, I also apologize for speaking through the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5057.151s">I</a>  forgot about the discernment in public records. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5059.032s">So</a>  thank you for pointing that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5061.734s">The</a>  two questions that I think could be generally answered here, one is, and this might have been stated, so it's more a point of clarification, is <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5069.695s">When</a>  buildings that are nonconforming seek to change the exterior of their building, when I've consulted and are advised on projects in other cities around this, including Boston and Providence around economic development, those buildings would require to go through a variance for continued approval and expansion of the building and its current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5090.195s">Will</a>  that be part of the variance process, or in terms of your efforts to streamline the language and verbiage around your variance requirements, is that expected to be relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5102.146s">The</a>  second one is for the IZ extensions to scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5105.868s">Can</a>  the menu of options that are going to be provided for those IZs be published a little bit more clear and front and center? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5113.793s">And</a>  can we be given notification around when it's solidified and what those are, as well as what the proximity to any proposed construction would be, what the requirements in terms of distance from them are? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5125.341s">I've</a>  worked in places where you can offer a park to the city in exchange for an exemption versus it having to be feet from the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5132.845s">So</a>  distance designations would be preferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5136.406s">And</a>  then I'll echo the transportation concerns, especially since three boundary points around the zone are controlled by state agencies with land owned not by the city, including the I-93 Rotary, the Fellsway West, and the intersection at the Fellsway West and Salem Street, with a traffic signal that has been horribly unmistimed with the Fellsway East signal for some time, been trying to reach DCR for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5161.552s">um</a>  and um and you know it just needs there needs to be a stronger partnership for that and it's sorry i know i'm over but that's not just a quarter it's a designated trucking route a state route overlay for route 60 as well okay this is all really helpful insight and it sounds like you have some really solid experience so thank you for sharing that with with us this evening</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5189.835s">I</a>  see Patricia as the next public commenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5192.939s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5202.29s">And</a>  please state your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5315.928s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5316.688s">And</a>  I hear your concerns about the notice and the way it's been communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5321.37s">So</a>  maybe that's something we can dig into a little bit just to find out more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5325.532s">But</a>  thank you so much, Patricia. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5326.913s">I</a>  really appreciate you commenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5332.516s">Our</a>  next public commenter is Jane. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5334.677s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute, Jane Marcus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5341.008s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jane Marcus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5342.849s">Hi,</a>  my name is Jane Marcus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5346.792s">I'm</a>  65 Tainter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5348.933s">I</a>  live around the corner from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5353.136s">And</a>  from my perspective, this plan is about a corridor, but it really should be about the Roberts Elementary School neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5363.603s">We</a>  have the epicenter of the proposed density directly abutting the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5371.03s">And</a>  there are so many of these businesses that I find inappropriate to put next to an elementary school with first graders and second graders walking to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5381.44s">We</a>  don't want them walking by methadone clinics where there are addicts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5385.844s">We</a>  don't want them walking past a brewery. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5388.486s">We</a>  don't want them walking past a winery. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5391.408s">I'm</a>  super glad to see all the marijuana businesses have been removed from the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5396.431s">Thank</a>  you very much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5397.932s">I</a>  was worried about that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5400.214s">I</a>  also feel that there's an opportunity here with some of these zoning decisions to have mental health, rehab, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5409.64s">halfway</a>  houses, homeless shelters and churches, other things that are wonderful for the community, but not next to a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5420.063s">I</a>  don't want school children to be worried on their way to school about an addict or a drunk that they're going to encounter on the way to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5429.345s">I</a>  want the kids to walk to school with joy and with the promise of learning something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5435.707s">And</a>  I feel if we have educational facilities that are likely to be halfway houses or something else, those are not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5445.374s">Private</a>  clubs that serve alcohol, not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5449.597s">Any</a>  kind of facility which is going to have temporary visitors, such as a hotel, <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5457.242s">may</a>  have sex offenders who are in the hotel for weeks or months under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5463.726s">And</a>  we won't even know that there are sex offenders watching our children to see who the lonely and the vulnerable ones on the playground might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5472.472s">So</a>  I ask the board, please consider this from the viewpoint that this is next to an elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5480.217s">And</a>  I will really thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5482.671s">Yeah,</a>  I hear your concerns about the uses that are proximate to the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5487.234s">So</a>  maybe that's something we can dig a little bit deeper and share more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5492.238s">Thank</a>  you, Jane. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5492.818s">I</a>  appreciate your questions and your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5498.883s">The</a>  next public commenter that I see is Cheryl R.

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5659.703s">Thank</a>  you, Cheryl. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5660.683s">I</a>  really appreciate your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5663.544s">There's</a>  a lot there between the traffic, you have some feedback, like, you know, are the many options really commensurate with what's being delivered? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5674.668s">Some</a>  questions about the uses, and then I'm curious about this mechanical percentage, so maybe we can address that at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5684.992s">But</a>  thank you so much, Cheryl. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5686.312s">I</a>  really appreciate your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5690.599s">The</a>  next public commenter I see is Klein170172. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5697.362s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute shortly, and please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5701.504s">And</a>  if there's two people with you and you would both like a two-minute comment period, we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5709.828s">But</a>  if you just want to be combined, that's also acceptable.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6033.335s">Thank</a>  you, Doreen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6035.597s">Yeah,</a>  I think, you know, hours for other uses may be something that we can provide some recommendations around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6043.244s">All</a>  right, Julissa, I am going to send you another request to unmute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6057.619s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6057.88s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6058.381s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6059.545s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6059.846s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6060.649s">Thank</a>  you so much for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6061.812s">There</a>  was a little troubleshooting there.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6063.542s">Thank</a>  you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6064.322s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6065.183s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6066.704s">For</a>  the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6067.644s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6068.484s">My</a>  name is Julissa Almendarez. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6070.645s">I</a>  live with my mother, Maria Rodriguez, at 174 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6075.768s">My</a>  friend Jeff is also here, who's been overhearing, you know, the whole presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6081.07s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6082.171s">I</a>  guess the question we have, and I'll have my friend Jeff speak, you can explain a little bit better, is this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6090.559s">Hi</a>  folks, just a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6093.82s">We're</a>  at 174 Park Street, we're currently zoned apartment one, and it's changing to mixed two, commercial mixed two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6100.461s">We're</a>  a house behind a house, so we're kind of the second tier behind the frontage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6106.303s">And</a>  my question is, for the homeowners here, will they now become nonconforming? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6112.184s">Right</a>  now it's a single family detached home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6115.485s">And</a>  so if it changes to mix two, commercial mix two, are they limited in their ability to sell to another residential use down the road?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6131.988s">We</a>  can answer that question later, but you have about a minute left if you have any other comments, feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6137.569s">I</a>  think that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6139.11s">I</a>  used to live in our unit, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6142.168s">As</a>  far as, I feel like the other, you know, the other public members have pretty much addressed kind of like similar concerns like traffic, you know, what kind of businesses, you know, are being allowed if they're like appropriate, because we do live next to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6160.26s">And</a>  then yeah, as far as like, you know, what the building heights are, you know, considering <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6168.045s">you</a>  know, what we have around here with these homes, if we have like a, you know, a big eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6175.233s">But</a>  I think everybody else has pretty much explained it a little bit better than, you know, than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6180.098s">So</a>  it's pretty much in the same plane as everybody else.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6183.763s">Well,</a>  I think you did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6185.284s">And</a>  thank you so much, Julissa and Jeff, for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6188.007s">I</a>  really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6188.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6188.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6192.842s">Our</a>  next public commenter is Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6196.144s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6205.309s">Hi,</a>  this is Melanie Tringali calling from 116 Forest Street, but I do own a property at 178 Park Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6214.094s">Just</a>  a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6217.997s">I</a>  don't think there was a traffic study done at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6221.014s">Um,</a>  I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6228.522s">Properties</a>  apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6232.386s">Um,</a>  I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6238.312s">How</a>  does this impact our water our sewer? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6241.89s">And</a>  our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6247.613s">I</a>  know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6252.335s">I'm</a>  very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6258.717s">I</a>  don't understand why that was even considered to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6264.78s">commercial</a>  zoning at up to six stories next to a public school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6270.486s">If</a>  you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6277.033s">And</a>  if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6285.382s">I'm</a>  trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6292.167s">The</a>  only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6305.157s">But</a>  I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6312.292s">reality,</a>  there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6317.418s">If</a>  they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6330.084s">Availability</a>  to make more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6331.626s">A</a>  lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6335.889s">So</a>  that's all I have.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6337.551s">That's</a>  a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6339.452s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, not not every business owns their space.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">I</a>  don't think a lot of them do.</p>
