    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7305.257s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7306.837s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7308.278s">Welcome</a>  to our second school committee meeting of the academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7312.02s">We</a>  have seen so much social and emotional learning from our students inside and outside of the classroom compared to when we last met. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7320.206s">I'm</a>  very excited to share the latest news involving our Medford school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7325.87s">Last</a>  week wrapped up our school curriculum nights, which were held over a two week period. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7330.653s">The</a>  turnout from the community was simply fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7334.736s">I</a>  spoke with principals and teachers from different grade levels who raved about the attendance and engagement from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7341.881s">Dr.</a>  Galussi and I were at the high school's curriculum night last Thursday, and the hallways felt just as busy as passing time does during a normal day at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7353.251s">Even</a>  if you were not able to attend your child's curriculum night, I want to thank all parents and caregivers for being so dedicated to your child's learning journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7362.617s">Please</a>  continue to engage with your child, teachers, and administrators to best support that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7370.642s">Last</a>  week also was our Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee meeting that we met for the first time this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7380.287s">We</a>  submitted all required paperwork for the first phase of the MSBA process earlier this summer, and Wednesday's meeting served as a great check-in as we await to hear from the MSBA on potential next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7393.499s">Thank</a>  you to our MCHSC committee chair, Member Graham, and all of our other committee members for their unwavering commitment to creating a new high school for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7406.013s">I</a>  also wanna provide an update to the community regarding bus transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7412.21s">last</a>  meeting we spoke about the need to improve our bus transportation for our medford students and families myself and the rest of the administrative staff continue to work to find solutions to our challenges chief among them overcrowding and the lack of busing for uh two specific after-school programs we spoke with eastern bus company owner chuck winnitzer again this week <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7438.678s">last</a>  week on friday this time in person and he he reassured his commitment to medford public schools he did let us know that if there is an available driver on a given day by 2 pm that that driver will be dedicated to medford to assist in the after-school bus programming <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7458.115s">Shortfalls</a>  in bus transportation are not a challenge unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7462.797s">However,</a>  we continue to create solutions that best meet the needs of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7468.08s">For</a>  example, at the Brooks Elementary School, students in Sigma after school program <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7474.483s">have</a>  individuals that are volunteering their time to monitor our students while they wait for the bus to bring them to their respective programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7483.471s">While</a>  this is understandably a short-term solution, we want to thank all of those involved, including RSK for sending Mr. Jesse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7494.441s">We</a>  thank everyone for their patience and their flexibility while we work through our transportation challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7501.235s">I'd</a>  like to reiterate that Medford is currently not being charged by Eastern Bus for the buses we are not using. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7508.101s">So</a>  it is in the best interest for Eastern Bus to help solve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7512.725s">Throughout</a>  the last few weeks, we have also explored alternative transportation options, including vans, coach buses, and other school bus companies to solve this ongoing challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7528.655s">I</a>  also just want us to pivot quickly because now we are talking about the beginning of fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7533.598s">I</a>  want to provide an update from our school health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7538.547s">which</a>  is working with the community in trying to keep all of us healthy during this upcoming flu season. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7545.453s">So</a>  MPS Health Services is collaborating with Smiles by Rosie to provide in-school flu vaccination clinics for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7555.462s">Consent</a>  forms will be sent home with elementary students and parents of secondary students can expect further communication in the very near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7565.932s">The</a>  School Health Department and the City of Medford Board of Health are also hosting a health services fair this Saturday from 10 to 1 at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7578.2s">Stop</a>  by to learn important topics such as behavioral and mental health, health insurance, fitness tips, nutrition, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7587.727s">Attendees</a>  can also register for a free flu vaccine clinic that will be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7595.461s">I</a>  also wanna share some news from our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7598.883s">Our</a>  vocational school is ramping up their service to the community as we have settled into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7605.106s">Earlier</a>  this month, the Mustang Mall opened for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7609.669s">Operated</a>  by our business technology and marketing vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7615.012s">who</a>  run the Mustang Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7617.035s">This</a>  gives members of the community an opportunity to come up, come into the store and stock up on your Mustang apparel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7625.245s">Or</a>  you can also shop online. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7628.393s">We</a>  also want to share that our wonderful Bistro 489 opened their doors today to the community and our wonderful culinary arts students will be serving delicious breakfast and lunch food options. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7642.984s">So</a>  please come by and support our students in Bistro 489. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7649.108s">I'd</a>  like to transition quickly to the greater Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7652.669s">This</a>  weekend will be one to remember with so many terrific events happening for those of all ages. <a

schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7682.621s">There</a>  are also additional races throughout Friday night and Saturday morning. <a

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7874.748s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7877.208s">Next,</a>  we have a recommendation to approve budget transfer for city year work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7882.05s">Mr.</a>  Gerald McHugh, come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7887.332s">Mr.</a>  McHugh is a former finance director and now a budget specialist, right?</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7901.937s">Before</a>  we have a transfer of this budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7907.125s">at</a>  a previous school committee at the end of the summer, you briefed on this opportunity that came late in the year or just ahead of school opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7920.77s">So</a>  it wasn't part of the budget that was passed in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7925.652s">We</a>  do have a... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7931.732s">$500,000</a>  contingency line that's titled undistributed salaries in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7937.895s">And</a>  that's been a feature of the budget, at least in FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7946.88s">The</a>  cost to run this program in both schools is $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7950.882s">Part</a>  of the services we'll receive is to support the afterschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7960.826s">So</a>  I allocated the expense 65% in the school budget and 35% in the before and afterschool revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7973.723s">So</a>  in order to make sure we also comply with reporting requirements, it's important to have these expenses reflected in the schools that are receiving the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7988.012s">That's</a>  how the state wants us to report school-based spending by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7993.676s">So</a>  we've set up three new accounts in the admin system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7999.219s">uh</a>  one for the missatuck and then uh we're splitting the expense um at the mcglynn between the the middle and the elementary uh so once those uh currently the con in order to um proceed with getting the contract finalized <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8019.406s">we</a>  issued a purchase order, which is 100% charged to the before and after school program until we could get these accounts set up and funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8031.008s">And</a>  once that happens, with your approval, then we can adjust the purchase order to reflect these expenses.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8047.012s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8048.53s">And</a>  then member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8049.771s">I</a>  was just going to make a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8051.112s">Approval</a>  by member Graham, member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Fee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8104.77s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8105.67s">I'm</a>  here to give an update and share some plans for this $10,000 donation that we got, as you stated, from the Cummings Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8115.995s">We</a>  used these funds in the spring to create mini grants, and the donation was intended to be arts-based enrichment <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8126.68s">that</a>  works to promote positivity and social change within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8131.484s">So</a>  all the mini grants reflected that theme. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8134.626s">At</a>  the high school level, we had the ceramics club working on quote tiles that are hung in the halls of MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8143.093s">At</a>  the middle school level, at one of our art events, we had suminagashi art, a post for students and families to interact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8159.005s">This</a>  one I'm really excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8161.11s">Outside</a>  the EL office at Medford High, we created a look and find board that was designed by students in my design class. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8170.348s">And</a>  it's a large board that just has, sorry, a bunch of imagery and then little papers that say, can you find sort of like a where's Waldo, but it's a great interactive way for our non-English speaking newest students and little brothers and sisters when they're in the waiting room to feel welcome and make that visit a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8192.613s">pleasant</a>  and a little less nerve-wracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8194.814s">So</a>  that artwork's getting framed now, so we're really excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8199.395s">And</a>  then our other big project was the Kindness Campaign, where we had students design posters and stickers, and we had them printed, and you can see them hung up here at City Hall, at Colleen's, at Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8211.399s">They're</a>  at every elementary school and middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8215.256s">So</a>  those are some of the events, the projects that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8219.784s">Sorry,</a>  one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8220.506s">At</a>  the Andrews, we did a specific art display celebrating women artists of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8227.97s">And</a>  so those are some of the mini grants that we operated last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8232.114s">Starting</a>  in October, we're opening that up again to hopefully have new and different art-based grants across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8239.82s">And</a>  I hope to be back in the spring to share those updates with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8243.964s">The</a>  other big project that we did with some of these funds were our first ever summer arts workshops that were offered at all three levels, K through 12, where students worked on art that was <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8256.601s">based</a>  on social issues that were important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8260.142s">And</a>  then the littlest kids in our K through three program worked for the week exploring of how to sort of share the theme of kindness through their art. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8272.124s">We</a>  had a waiting list this year at both the elementary and the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8277.225s">And</a>  so this is another initiative we hope to expand next summer with maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8282.194s">getting</a>  more teachers so that we could offer maybe two classes at each elementary and middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8288.977s">So</a>  that's an update on what we've done and where we hope to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8292.258s">And</a>  we're really excited about this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8298.261s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8299.201s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8299.661s">V.</a>  No questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8302.782s">Thank</a>  you so much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8304.443s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8305.043s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8305.763s">Did</a>  we already motion to approve the Cummings grant or did we already approve that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8312.631s">Oh,</a>  so we recommend you to motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8315.513s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Werner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8553.882s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8554.262s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8555.751s">I</a>  know you're familiar with City Year, but just as a quick refresher, City Year partners with schools to ensure student success. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8563.096s">We</a>  recruit diverse young AmeriCorps members ages 18 to 25 to serve full time as tutors and mentors and to provide whole school support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8572.422s">So</a>  our core members are all day from the beginning of the day to the end of the day, serving about a 10 hour day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8578.226s">And</a>  some of the ways we support schools is through academic tutoring, social emotional support for students, attendance support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8584.551s">attendance</a>  support for schools, after-school support, which we'll talk a little bit more about, and certainly that full-time support, adding capacity to classrooms where we partner with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8594.638s">So</a>  we'll talk a little bit more about where our Corps members are partnered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8598.441s">You</a>  can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8601.743s">Again,</a>  our AmeriCorps members are diverse, passionate, skilled 18 to 24-year-olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8606.787s">They're</a>  committed to serving for full-time all year to get to their 1,700 hours of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8612.791s">As</a>  I mentioned, it is <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8614.381s">full-time</a>  day in schools every day here that here's the fun part so here's Medford City your teams you can see the team at the McGlynn the team at the Mesa Tech pictured here they look happy and excited this is right about when they're about to start serving in your in your schools <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8632.628s">On</a>  the next slide, you'll see how we placed our core members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8636.229s">So</a>  at the McGlynn, there's a team of six that includes a team leader, which basically means it's a returning AmeriCorps member that brings that added experience and leadership in addition to the leadership that Kayla, I mean, Alyssa provides as the impact manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8651.773s">And</a>  at the McGlynn, they're serving in one core member per grade, three through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8655.993s">And</a>  at the Missatuck, the team of five, including a team leader, is supporting three through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8660.955s">Each</a>  is assigned to a partner teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8666.025s">Before</a>  our AmeriCorps members stepped foot in the school district, they started with us in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8671.487s">So</a>  they participated in a very intensive four-week summer training. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8675.349s">You</a>  can see here some of the topics covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8677.63s">So</a>  really strong emphasis on building relationships with students and teachers, instructional strategies, understanding student development to provide that mentorship support, and then also some of the, obviously, the technical things they need to know around like mandated reporting and CPR certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8694.313s">And</a>  then throughout the year, for two Fridays every month, our core members are also getting a lot of professional development to make sure that they're adequately prepared to support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8707.766s">Here</a>  you can see a snapshot of the teacher and school onboarding process that we participated in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8715.029s">four-step</a>  process, starting with our leadership and school leadership to talk about school goals, what we know are our conditions to ensure success and impact for students, presenting to all staff at PD in August 26 to align with them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8733.707s">And</a>  then core members, once they were finished with their training, they came to schools and <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8738.875s">to</a>  acclimate themselves first participated in shadowing rotations to fill out classrooms and for teachers to fill out the core members before collecting their feedback and then determining with the principals how exactly they were going to be placed based on <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8753.106s">that</a>  two-week trial period. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8755.386s">Core</a>  members have been placed for maybe one or two weeks at this point and are just now in the stages of getting to know their classroom teachers, doing those one-on-one conversations to set some goals and establish the expectations for the core member role in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8774.03s">In</a>  terms of after-school support, you can see here that our AmeriCorps members <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8779.465s">Both</a>  campuses are supporting after-school programming every week, so our core members are serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8787.349s">If</a>  our core members are part of the elementary school community during the day, they stay for after-school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8792.112s">Same</a>  for middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8793.57s">So</a>  whether it's the enrichment clubs in the afterschool for the middle school or the regularly scheduled afterschool programming in elementary school, they're staying to provide that extra capacity and extra support to the existing programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8807.518s">At</a>  the Missatuck, they will also be adding a homework club in October serving, I understand to be approximately 15 students who have been identified as really benefiting as students who could benefit from that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8820.164s">Again,</a>  in addition to supporting at bringing additional capacity to enhance the programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8827.09s">I</a>  know there's also the opportunity to work with school leaders on how this can evolve for perhaps the second half of the year and add additional capacity beyond what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8838.359s">The</a>  priority now is to integrate into the existing programming and enhance the quality and then hopefully expanding more in the second half of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8849.758s">to</a>  address additional afterschool needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8854.474s">Here</a>  you can just see our, you know, this is meant to exemplify our commitment to ongoing quality and model of fidelity and making sure that we stay on the same page to ensure student impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8865.958s">So</a>  regular times, you know, obviously regular times for school administration and city year leadership to meet our core members are regularly meeting with their teachers, they'll be starting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8877.982s">Now</a>  that they have those placements to plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8880.778s">For</a>  students in October, you can see that our core members will begin what we call focusless support, which is where they really begin that more targeted support with students who have been identified based on what the data tells us in terms of their English language arts and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8896.047s">No,</a>  you're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8897.869s">And</a>  getting that two or three times a week, really targeted support in English language arts, math, attendance, and the social emotional mentorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8907.969s">Here,</a>  this was just to add some fun to some of the fun things that we've done beyond what we've already presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8914.535s">You</a>  may have heard that in September, City Year was featured as a partner for the New England Revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8919.619s">And</a>  we had the opportunity to bring students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8921.6s">And</a>  we're really thrilled with the level of enthusiasm and engagement of the families and students who came and walked out on the field with the players and stayed for the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8931.468s">So</a>  that was a really fun night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8933.61s">And</a>  then some other on the next slide, you can just highlights a couple of the other <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8937.681s">whole</a>  school supports that we've been able to provide with curriculum nights, ice cream social, just bringing again that additional capacity to create a welcoming and vibrant culture for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8952.738s">Well,</a>  I'm excited to pass it over to our Principal Tucci before taking any questions that you might have.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8962.796s">Okay,</a>  good evening and welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8965.078s">Happy</a>  new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8966.439s">I'm</a>  happy to kind of provide a little bit of information about how I've been really excited and enthused to work with City Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8973.325s">From</a>  my perspective, at the start of every single school day, you might see me at the front door greeting all students on a typical basis, interacting with students, asking about how their night went, how their sports game went, giving them a high five. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8984.355s">And</a>  I also try to strive to make sure that all my teachers are having positive interactions with all of our students before the time they walk in the building and by the time they get to homeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8993.318s">That's</a>  my goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8993.999s">And</a>  I always tell teachers I want to see a regular student have at least two positive interactions with their teachers before they even step foot in homeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9001.081s">Well,</a>  I can say that City Year really helps us kind of accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9004.403s">You</a>  know, that's just an example of the life, the energy, the awesome excitement and engagement that they've been able to provide to our school community because I really see it right from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9013.527s">i</a>  think that's really important to help our students feel like they belong and i see city year as being an important partner and helping us kind of achieve one of our core values here in the metro public schools <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9024.413s">Thus</a>  far this year, it's been great to see City Year be in our classes, being tutors, pushing into classrooms and helping provide that targeted support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9033.658s">I</a>  know that we've surveyed our faculty members and been able to solicit their feedback of where the highest priority areas they could use a City Year core member in their class. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9043.763s">So</a>  I've sat down just in the past few days with Alyssa David and we hard scheduled out every single city or core member so that we're using them very effectively in very targeted type of ways to be able to maximize the level of support that we can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9057.212s">So</a>  this will be an ongoing conversation that will be data informed and we really hope that we'll continue this awesome work and partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9064.857s">I'm</a>  also excited with the role of our clubs and activities at the middle school level just this week to be able to have our city or core members be a part of the life <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9075.003s">awesome</a>  energy and engagement of our clubs and activities at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9078.484s">And</a>  hopefully they can help us take it a step further with this wonderful partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9082.185s">So</a>  I'll just also mention they're part of our team at the McGlynn Middle School, just like they would be at other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9088.206s">They're</a>  part of our staff professional development, our faculty meetings, and true partners and what we can offer our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9094.448s">So</a>  I just want to say that it's been a great few weeks in working with core members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9098.089s">They've</a>  made a great first impression with our students and myself as the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9101.43s">And</a>  I look forward to expanding this partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9103.47s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions you might have.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9107.392s">I</a>  want to thank City Year and all of the members that aren't here today for what you're doing thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9114.775s">But</a>  Principal Tucci, I wanted to just ask you to piggyback specifically on one of our conversations about future educators and how you are mentoring and how you see that work potentially.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9131.098s">absolutely</a>  so i know a lot of our core members some of them are really interested in potentially jumping into the field of education and this is uh important for the medford public schools to be on the the cutting edge to be able to capture the best and brightest educators that have a lot of energy and excitement and if we're able to work with our city or core member partners to be able to develop them and nurture them and <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9152.919s">hopefully</a>  put them under our wing to be able to help to turn them into maybe future educators and become mustangs themselves so i think that i'm excited i've already had a few different conversations with core members in just a few weeks about that very topic and how we can continue to support them in their growth as professionals and hopefully bring them on in and bring them into the mexico schools thank you so much for the update and welcome to our classrooms thank you for joining us a member or so oh somebody's online</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9188.052s">Jess,</a>  name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9191.215s">Jessica</a>  Healy, Full Lock Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9194.117s">I</a>  just want to know, are we going to be notified, like if our child's working with someone from city who went on one, will we be notified of that?</p>

    <p>[Roberts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9209.667s">Yeah,</a>  we will, thank you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9211.328s">We</a>  will work with school leaders so that families are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9215.109s">Our</a>  AmeriCorps members are typically working in the classroom alongside the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9219.39s">So</a>  they'll be working sometimes whole class, sometimes small groups, sometimes individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9223.872s">So</a>  I think likely families of those students who are being served by an AmeriCorps member will likely receive notice, but we'll work with the school leaders on that.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9233.656s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9234.096s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9236.076s">Great,</a>  thank you so much for presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9239.753s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9240.574s">Best</a>  of luck to the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9244.82s">We</a>  have a recommendation to approve new senior parking fee of $150. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9248.265s">Dr.</a>  Peter J.

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9259.206s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9261.027s">Thank</a>  you for formally hearing this proposal and went back with school leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9266.609s">There</a>  are some students in the audience present in the class who may also want to speak on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9273.012s">It</a>  is, I will say it is mislisted as a senior only parking fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9277.214s">This</a>  would be a parking fee at $75 to park that would benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9282.096s">It</a>  would go straight to student hardships. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9285.798s">Student</a>  events and the $75 for seniors in addition would be to paint and decorate their personal parking space as many high schools do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9298.309s">If</a>  they so chose just to drive the car and not park, it would be the $75. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9303.654s">if</a>  they so chose to paint and decorate their parking space, which really adds a lot of color and a lot of fun to school parking lots that I've seen it in, it would be $150. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9316.064s">So</a>  that would also go directly toward the senior class. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9320.969s">That</a>  part of this would go directly towards the senior class. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9324.972s">as</a>  a fundraiser to help offset things like their prom costs, to offer students, again, seniors hardship waivers and things along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9335.98s">I</a>  do have members of the senior class too to speak on it if the committee would so like to entertain any questions, but happy to answer any as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9346.992s">so</a>  dr just so thank you so much for listening to the school committee um two weeks ago and taking some of our ideas um back and and working this out so just so we have it straight 75 for any parking spot but any senior could also pay an additional 75 to paint their spot so we'll have ground art yes yes okay students would you like to come up</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9371.132s">Actually,</a>  just real quick, just so everyone knows, in looking at parking fees for area schools, they range between $40 and $150, just so that everyone is aware.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9382.06s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, before you step away, though, are there schools where there's no charge?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9388.384s">In</a>  all honesty, not that I saw, but I do also know that there are some schools that don't allow parking, such as Somerville High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9398.812s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9401.314s">I'm</a>  going to name and address for the record, and welcome.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9404.317s">JAMES</a>  CASEY, 835 Pelzoy West.</p>

    <p>[Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9407.06s">GIARUSO,</a>  132 Grand Ave.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9409.402s">So</a>  I'm senior class president.</p>

    <p>[Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9411.244s">And</a>  I'm senior class vice president.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9413.632s">And</a>  so just to restate what was just said, the original $75 is just to park in general for any grade level, anyone who parks at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9422.934s">And</a>  that will go towards hardships and like bus passes, events, field trips, as well as student activities like the pep rally and other community events. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9432.816s">And</a>  then where I come in for the seniors, the additional 75 is to paint your spot for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9439.137s">And</a>  that'll be your spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9441.173s">And</a>  those funds will be used for class activities, such as prom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9447.197s">We</a>  hope to get senior t-shirts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9448.578s">And</a>  this will just be like a fundraiser for our class.</p>

    <p>[Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9455.884s">It's</a>  just a fun activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9459.166s">I</a>  know a lot of other seniors have requested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9461.828s">So</a>  by popular demand, we want to just see if we can get this approved.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9467.692s">Yeah,</a>  we started. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9469.159s">had</a>  our first meeting about it in the spring like to try and we had a meeting with principal gabral and miss fritas haley they were really on board with it and as i said other public schools charge for it we found as low as 40 some schools up to 300 to park for the year so we found kind of a good medium at 75 and i think the most common concern was like we understand that paying for parking may come as a hardship to some students <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9494.683s">and</a>  the school's willing and prepared to support students and ensure that every student who drives is able to acquire their own spot and be able to assist students that need it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9505.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9506.128s">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9506.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9508.069s">I</a>  think you could even maybe have some donations from community members that want to paint too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9516.513s">Member</a>  Olapade?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9522.134s">uh</a>  so thank you mayor and thank you for doing this i have two questions you mentioned briefly that for other grade levels i'm assuming this is just for seniors not for juniors and below okay but juniors and below can have a spot and do we have what we need spots wise or is this a lottery system to determine who gets a spot i've been told that we have the amount of spots okay</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9549.733s">so</a>  as with most schools as the year goes on um spots become significantly more of a premium so i think we're going to have to do as we look at the first year is first make sure seniors have spaces juniors sophomores and then perhaps a lottery there are there are there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9570.365s">I</a>  think that as long as some students would be willing to park in the skate park area, we have enough spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9576.25s">However,</a>  that might be a further walk for some students who drive to school to get into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9582.674s">But</a>  the reality is we do have enough spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9585.717s">It's</a>  just those prime spaces in the front of the building and on the side of the building tend to fill up as more students get their permits and then their licenses.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9595.677s">And</a>  then my second question is, is that when it comes to cleanup costs at the end of the year, what does that look like?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9602.6s">So</a>  the spots are simply painted over for the next year by the next group of students that would come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9609.902s">And</a>  if a space is not painted, then that senior from the class of 2025 will have a legacy until it is painted over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9619.666s">all</a>  right it's in in all in all fairness in all honesty it's definitely something that i think that we should entertain but as we bring on a brand new high school brand new parking lots um we should see how it goes see what maybe rules regulations need to be put in effect but you know i don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9637.927s">to</a>  quell anyone's artistic parking space integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9641.808s">But</a>  I think when you're looking at what the work of the high school is going to be, we wanna make sure that it's well presented.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9648.07s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9649.61s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9651.531s">Us,</a>  every student who parts of the school like having assigned spot will also allow staff to like actually see it and know everyone who's parking at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9661.794s">Like</a>  there was an incident last week, a freshman drove BMW to school unlicensed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9667.54s">but</a>  no one would know because they don't know whose it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9671.261s">Well,</a>  now everyone knows, but it's like just another thing they can see if someone's leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9678.123s">They</a>  can see exactly who is parking where.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9681.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9682.464s">Member</a>  Weinfeld?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9683.445s">I</a>  sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9689.886s">Either</a>  do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9697.117s">protocol</a>  in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9707.383s">I</a>  trust our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9708.764s">I</a>  think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9713.627s">I'll</a>  work with Principal Cabral and <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9717.628s">Associate</a>  Principal Freitas-Haley to make sure that whatever students are painting at least gets submitted for approval prior to conceptual drawing, something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9728.593s">Sound</a>  fair? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9729.374s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9735.177s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not a fan of censorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9737.278s">I</a>  just wanted, things can happen.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9740.359s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9742.08s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Branley.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9745.598s">Um,</a>  I would recommend that whatever community standards are developed that first of all, they're written down and then they're passed by our attorney because, um, students do have a first amendment rights, although it's slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9758.223s">Um,</a>  and it can't just be a matter of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9761.924s">You</a>  don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9762.684s">The</a>  principal doesn't like it because that does a pass muster with we are the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9768.783s">the</a>  teachers of the government, we are all the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9771.665s">And</a>  so that is, most people are confused on what the first amendment means, but the government interfering with what can and can't be said well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9782.984s">having</a>  varied rules about what can be said based on what the content is is not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9789.988s">So,</a>  you know, somebody wants to do a rainbow flag here, that's probably fine, but then you go to certain places in this country and the same rainbow flag might get you, you know, expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9802.476s">So</a>  it's an example of the need to be very careful here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9810.44s">some</a>  things are offensive to some people and they're not to others. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9813.882s">And</a>  it is not going to be up to the school to decide what's offensive and what's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9818.623s">So</a>  I think that's a danger here I think that is deeply concerning for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9826.301s">and</a>  uh i don't know that we have thought that part out it can't just be that the principal doesn't like it or you take a vote of administrators that those those are not options so having clear explicit guidelines ahead of time not afterwards ahead of time where you can say here are the guidelines <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9850.723s">And</a>  from the guidelines, any rational person could say that's in or out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9856.566s">That's</a>  how you avoid a First Amendment case here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9859.568s">So</a>  I'm going to guess that other schools that have the painting thing have already been through this, probably didn't get it done beforehand and then had to deal with the consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9871.314s">But</a>  we really should find out what other districts are using for guidelines, the exact language and see if... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9878.171s">we</a>  like any of that, because that does worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9882.316s">It'll</a>  just eat up huge amounts of resources and time and lawsuits, God forbid, but lawsuits cost a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9891.167s">So</a>  I'm very worried about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9893.87s">I'm</a>  also... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9897.113s">I'm</a>  concerned about, I'm not concerned about the $75 to paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9900.995s">I'm</a>  concerned about the $75 to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9904.637s">And</a>  I know that it was mentioned that we would set some money aside to help kids that couldn't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9911.28s">But</a>  as some of you have heard many times, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9915.515s">Okay,</a>  not all, there's a lot of new members here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9917.476s">So</a>  most of you haven't heard a lot of the things I've had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9920.397s">But</a>  by the time you're in high school, if you don't have the resources, you're not asking for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9927.259s">That's</a>  not how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9929.1s">When</a>  you spent your childhood being aware that you don't have the resources, you've learned to just stop asking because that's not for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9937.142s">That's</a>  for the kids with the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9939.003s">So</a>  I'm opposed to charging $75 to park, $75 to paint, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9948.004s">I'm</a>  still open to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9950.106s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9952.167s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9952.908s">Member</a>  Branley? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9955.19s">I</a>  just want to piggyback what Member Ruseau said about making sure that we have guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9960.834s">I</a>  believe my favorite word here is being proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9963.977s">So</a>  we can just be proactive to protect you guys, to protect us, obviously, as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9969.521s">And</a>  then I'm just also curious with the paying, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9975.959s">Obviously,</a>  if you're not paying, you can still park at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9980.78s">You're</a>  not parking at school at all if you don't pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9984.782s">Correct,</a>  okay, so that's obviously gonna be told to everybody that's parking is gonna understand that if you don't pay the $75, you can't park at school.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10010.834s">high</a>  school leadership is really looking for a way to be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10048.707s">that</a>  piece of this moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10050.308s">So</a>  in theory, the $75 RPP approved by this body could move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10056.893s">And</a>  then the second piece could be for the seniors as we wait two or three weeks to develop and vet properly those community standards that are respectful of the First Amendment within the realm of the schoolhouse, to use the Supreme Court's words. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10071.684s">We</a>  would make sure that those are well vetted as well and well published.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10077.076s">And</a>  so then just my other question is, would this be something that's done after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10082.965s">When</a>  would we be painting if that was the case? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10085.389s">Do</a>  you have any ideas, Mr. Casey?</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10088.459s">we</a>  were hoping a weekend, maybe Saturday and Sunday, because some people like, you know, have to do like a base coat, let it dry, get something on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10096.683s">It</a>  could take a significant amount of hours, but then we'll try and find days, because like a lot of sports schedules have school activities that it may not work with, but.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10106.187s">And</a>  obviously the school is being used during that time too, for activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10116.252s">Okay,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10118.629s">Do</a>  we have to motion on the floor to make this two separate votes, 175 for the spot and then 175 for the painting? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10125.951s">If</a>  somebody wants to sever, otherwise we can move approval of the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10129.792s">I'd</a>  like to sever it so that we can have motion to sever the $75 for the spot and then $75 for the painting, if that's possible.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10138.375s">Okay,</a>  motion to sever the 150 into two by Member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10144.937s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10146.658s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10147.537s">Member</a>  Graham, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10150.718s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10151.438s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor for the $75?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10153.759s">I</a>  have a question about the $75 to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10156.16s">Is</a>  that just during school hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10157.88s">Because</a>  I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10178.624s">I</a>  think it would be to park at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10181.445s">However,</a>  I don't know how we would be able to monitor after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10187.348s">That</a>  would be the challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10189.55s">But</a>  our after-hours parking usually isn't a problem with the exception of the other night, enormously successful for killing the night with a bicycle where we needed a parking deck.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10200.995s">And</a>  maybe this will encourage more carpooling too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10203.276s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.118s">Anything</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.578s">I</a>  just want to say that I... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10209.372s">Yes,</a>  I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10223.575s">I</a>  think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10231.957s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10233.857s">I</a>  just want to point out that this committee, several years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10239.848s">made</a>  a resolution to make those bus passes free and that the decision to start charging for those again was not brought before this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10249.795s">So</a>  as far as I'm concerned, there's a policy compliance issue there because we were very clear that we did not want to charge kids for those bus passes to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10261.523s">I</a>  am hopeful that if the overrides are successful, we can immediately institute a change there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10267.321s">I</a>  acknowledge that the program as it was originally envisioned may need to change, but if we're talking about transit in compliance with our policy being charged, I'm just overall not in favor of that in any regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10285.136s">But</a>  I do wanna point out for everybody who is new, we did this, we said it, we voted on it and it like reappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10292.662s">And</a>  that was not a decision by this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10296.738s">we</a>  need to get back to addressing that just as soon as there's more than no money in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10303.961s">The</a>  other thing I would like to put on the table for the administration to consider is that we should know who is parking in our school and whether we charge for it or not, every person parking in our parking lot, including staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10323.228s">should</a>  have to have a parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10325.01s">They</a>  should have to be registered with the school with a license plate and a car that they're going to be driving to school without exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10333.221s">And</a>  then obviously you deal with visitors sort of separately and there's visitor parking now that's very well signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10339.59s">So...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10340.671s">that</a>  should be happening i'm surprised it's not frankly because we have no way of knowing which of those cars are there um in a in a way that is consistent with what we're trying to do in the building so that is maybe a separate issue i would like to hear a report on at some point in time but um it doesn't that that parking permit does not have to come with the fee necessarily um depending on how this vote goes tonight but i i would be absolutely in favor of making sure that we understand <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10369.377s">who</a>  is driving cars onto the campus.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10435.361s">I</a>  think there's another relevant to the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10441.986s">But</a>  having funds available for student activities is <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10448.524s">is</a>  a budgetary issue that, you know, right now it's everybody just raise all the money you can, any which way you can, rather than just providing you a reasonable amount of student activity money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10459.271s">And</a>  I think that that's an issue we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10464.515s">Hopefully,</a>  if the overrides pass, we can put a small amount of money, small budget-wise, not necessarily small if you're a student and you want to use student activity money, but money directly into that rather than just relying exclusively on, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10481.006s">using</a>  all your free time to raise money, which I mean, all of us were teenagers once, some of us very recently, and you probably could do something else with your time other than raising money for your favorite clubs, like doing the activities in the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10497.721s">So</a>  I hope we can get to that point where we're not expecting that of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10503.005s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10790.737s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10791.777s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10792.198s">So</a>  my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10800.803s">These</a>  are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10806.927s">I</a>  do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10812.29s">I'm</a>  happy to do that now or give an overview of <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10818.455s">of</a>  what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10826.16s">I'm</a>  happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10834.806s">This</a>  is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10845.173s">It</a>  expands the definition of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10847.202s">reduces</a>  anxiety, and increases equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10850.645s">Question</a>  seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10855.029s">To</a>  replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10867.821s">So</a>  that's valid question seven, along with the... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10872.385s">The</a>  Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10882.911s">Some</a>  of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10893.097s">And</a>  then question eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10894.935s">I</a>  think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10901.258s">We</a>  heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10908.861s">Many</a>  people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10915.243s">And</a>  so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10921.471s">starting</a>  an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10928.253s">And</a>  that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10931.794s">And</a>  so we need to expand what we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10934.435s">We</a>  probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10940.217s">We</a>  are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10946.218s">But</a>  if we're gonna ask people to, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10949.496s">to</a>  spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10952.197s">We</a>  found out how low many of our stipends are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10956.379s">We</a>  have been hearing for years about competition with other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10961.14s">And</a>  so that is question eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10965.042s">And</a>  then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10969.803s">We</a>  are still committed as a body to working to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10974.798s">our</a>  students and educators have what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10977.761s">So</a>  I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10987.592s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10989.855s">Member</a>  Branley?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10992.044s">So</a>  I just have a question on number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10994.646s">If</a>  we eliminate the MCAS as the standard, then what are we using as a requirement for competency to graduate? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11001.13s">So</a>  it moves to the district to define student competencies.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11005.473s">So</a>  what's our definition?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11007.415s">So</a>  the school committee does have graduation requirements outlined in the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11012.598s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11013.619s">Yeah,</a>  it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11023.391s">I</a>  also, you know, I was talking to a friend who lives in Cambridge about this question, and it was interesting because she's a highly engaged voter, an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11035.274s">She</a>  had read the actual state packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11038.635s">There's</a>  a little booklet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11041.956s">The</a>  booklet that comes out and explains it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11044.257s">And</a>  she had read it, and her impression was that it removed the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11049.298s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11050.529s">I</a>  haven't received mine yet, so I haven't read it yet, so I don't know what the language is exactly, but I think it's such an important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11056.055s">We,</a>  first of all, in Massachusetts, cannot end. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11060.199s">If</a>  it's not MCAS, it has to be something else, because the federal government requires that we do this testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11066.386s">The</a>  federal government does not require that it be a graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11072.904s">we</a>  could not, the state could not end MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11076.546s">I</a>  mean, if they did, they just have to institute something new and give it a new name that would be MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11083.329s">So</a>  I think anybody who's afraid that we're going to stop being able to compare Medford to other districts, if that's something you want to do and you want this one test, you'll still be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11095.795s">But</a>  it does mean, and you know, it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11099.537s">it's</a>  talked about as it's not a common thing but it does happen where students are excellent students they are engaged they get great grades but they are for whatever reason just incapable of passing this test they cannot get a diploma in this state which is insanity teachers assess their students all the time and if the <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11125.168s">professionals</a>  with masters and PhDs think that this student is, is competent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11130.794s">I</a>  don't know why that isn't good enough, rather than a test that was written by, frankly, not educators in, you know, some offices somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11141.305s">And</a>  why did Desi move? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11144.468s">I</a>  don't know where, I don't know where they moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11147.796s">that</a>  they're the wrong people to determine that this person is ready for graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11152.185s">And</a>  before that, before we had the MCAS requirements for graduation, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11156.772s">we</a>  were still at the top, Massachusetts as a whole, was still at the top for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11161.553s">It's</a>  not like the MCAS made us number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11164.253s">We</a>  were number one before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11166.294s">So</a>  I think the harm that the stress, the pressure, the teach to the test, all that other stuff, it's just negatively impacting education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11178.876s">That's</a>  not exactly news. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11180.896s">And</a>  I'm very supportive of getting rid of the MCAS requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11184.717s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11186.65s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau, Member Intapa.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11190.121s">I</a>  sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11192.562s">I</a>  also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11196.543s">I</a>  used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11213.808s">I've</a>  also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11219.844s">due</a>  to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11221.886s">It's</a>  a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11229.391s">So</a>  I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11240.4s">So</a>  I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11244.443s">So</a>  yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11248.966s">if</a>  we get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11250.307s">We're</a>  just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11257.43s">So</a>  for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11260.651s">So</a>  yeah, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11503.051s">I</a>  actually submitted two policies and the other one got dropped by accident because somebody thought it was the same policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11511.976s">So</a>  on the next agenda, there will be a different one, which is around use by students and staff.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.244s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.704s">So</a>  on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11524.445s">And</a>  I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11527.886s">But</a>  that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11539.569s">So</a>  it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11542.209s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11543.71s">So</a>  the amendment is to add to the listing of the products <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11551.103s">to</a>  include, what is it?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11552.743s">Nicotine</a>  pouches. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11555.764s">And</a>  I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11559.366s">I</a>  don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11566.448s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vincent just mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11567.929s">What</a>  about people that are prescribed? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11569.65s">And</a>  that's gum or patches. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11571.51s">Patches,</a>  so.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11572.431s">I</a>  think we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11573.571s">Not</a>  patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11577.313s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11579.329s">people</a>  are putting in their bottles.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11581.63s">Okay,</a>  I have our assistant super chair saying yes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11587.493s">So</a>  are we excluding that from the policy if people are prescribed and they're trying to quit?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11592.936s">They</a>  wouldn't be prescribed a pouch.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11594.537s">The</a>  pouches are included in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11596.098s">That</a>  is a recreational activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11599.439s">But</a>  we're excluding anything that is prescribed by a doctor for those trying to quit, like patches and gum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11606.843s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11609.571s">Okay,</a>  motion on the floor for approval as amended by Member Ruseau, seconded by

is the vote that was taken in June for consolidation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11709.168s">And</a>  at that time, the school committee wanted to make sure before we made any changes or consolidation, we came to you with language. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11715.934s">And</a>  this is something... <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11718.935s">Member</a>  Graham helped me with as well, but drafted this up with her edits to try to move this forward, especially where if we do have an override that passes, some of that funding will be going to much-needed preventative maintenance, and it's going to take months to obtain those contracts and do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11737.323s">And</a>  the MSBA project is also
