[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, everyone.

40
02:01:48,278 --> 02:01:51,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome to our second school committee meeting of the academic year.

41
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:59,586
[SPEAKER_18]: We have seen so much social and emotional learning from our students inside and outside of the classroom compared to when we last met.

42
02:02:00,206 --> 02:02:04,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very excited to share the latest news involving our Medford school community.

43
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:10,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week wrapped up our school curriculum nights, which were held over a two week period.

44
02:02:10,653 --> 02:02:13,355
[SPEAKER_18]: The turnout from the community was simply fantastic.

45
02:02:14,736 --> 02:02:21,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I spoke with principals and teachers from different grade levels who raved about the attendance and engagement from parents.

46
02:02:21,881 --> 02:02:31,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Galussi and I were at the high school's curriculum night last Thursday, and the hallways felt just as busy as passing time does during a normal day at the high school.

47
02:02:33,251 --> 02:02:41,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you were not able to attend your child's curriculum night, I want to thank all parents and caregivers for being so dedicated to your child's learning journey.

48
02:02:42,617 --> 02:02:49,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Please continue to engage with your child, teachers, and administrators to best support that path.

49
02:02:50,642 --> 02:02:58,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week also was our Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee meeting that we met for the first time this school year.

50
02:03:00,287 --> 02:03:12,738
[SPEAKER_18]: We submitted all required paperwork for the first phase of the MSBA process earlier this summer, and Wednesday's meeting served as a great check-in as we await to hear from the MSBA on potential next steps.

51
02:03:13,499 --> 02:03:24,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to our MCHSC committee chair, Member Graham, and all of our other committee members for their unwavering commitment to creating a new high school for our students.

52
02:03:26,013 --> 02:03:30,854
[SPEAKER_18]: I also wanna provide an update to the community regarding bus transportation.

53
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:57,163
[SPEAKER_18]: last meeting we spoke about the need to improve our bus transportation for our medford students and families myself and the rest of the administrative staff continue to work to find solutions to our challenges chief among them overcrowding and the lack of busing for uh two specific after-school programs we spoke with eastern bus company owner chuck winnitzer again this week

54
02:03:58,678 --> 02:04:16,444
[SPEAKER_18]: last week on friday this time in person and he he reassured his commitment to medford public schools he did let us know that if there is an available driver on a given day by 2 pm that that driver will be dedicated to medford to assist in the after-school bus programming

55
02:04:18,115 --> 02:04:22,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Shortfalls in bus transportation are not a challenge unique to Medford.

56
02:04:22,797 --> 02:04:27,240
[SPEAKER_18]: However, we continue to create solutions that best meet the needs of our community.

57
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:33,443
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, at the Brooks Elementary School, students in Sigma after school program

58
02:04:34,483 --> 02:04:42,851
[SPEAKER_18]: have individuals that are volunteering their time to monitor our students while they wait for the bus to bring them to their respective programs.

59
02:04:43,471 --> 02:04:53,040
[SPEAKER_18]: While this is understandably a short-term solution, we want to thank all of those involved, including RSK for sending Mr. Jesse.

60
02:04:54,441 --> 02:05:00,106
[SPEAKER_18]: We thank everyone for their patience and their flexibility while we work through our transportation challenges.

61
02:05:01,235 --> 02:05:07,480
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to reiterate that Medford is currently not being charged by Eastern Bus for the buses we are not using.

62
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:11,824
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is in the best interest for Eastern Bus to help solve this problem.

63
02:05:12,725 --> 02:05:24,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Throughout the last few weeks, we have also explored alternative transportation options, including vans, coach buses, and other school bus companies to solve this ongoing challenge.

64
02:05:28,655 --> 02:05:33,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I also just want us to pivot quickly because now we are talking about the beginning of fall.

65
02:05:33,598 --> 02:05:37,141
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to provide an update from our school health department.

66
02:05:38,547 --> 02:05:44,172
[SPEAKER_18]: which is working with the community in trying to keep all of us healthy during this upcoming flu season.

67
02:05:45,453 --> 02:05:54,642
[SPEAKER_18]: So MPS Health Services is collaborating with Smiles by Rosie to provide in-school flu vaccination clinics for students.

68
02:05:55,462 --> 02:06:04,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Consent forms will be sent home with elementary students and parents of secondary students can expect further communication in the very near future.

69
02:06:05,932 --> 02:06:17,260
[SPEAKER_18]: The School Health Department and the City of Medford Board of Health are also hosting a health services fair this Saturday from 10 to 1 at the Andrews Middle School.

72
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:38,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I also wanna share some news from our vocational school.

73
02:06:38,883 --> 02:06:44,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Our vocational school is ramping up their service to the community as we have settled into the year.

74
02:06:45,106 --> 02:06:48,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Earlier this month, the Mustang Mall opened for business.

75
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:53,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Operated by our business technology and marketing vocational students.

76
02:06:55,012 --> 02:06:56,554
[SPEAKER_18]: who run the Mustang Mall.

77
02:06:57,035 --> 02:07:04,324
[SPEAKER_18]: This gives members of the community an opportunity to come up, come into the store and stock up on your Mustang apparel.

78
02:07:05,245 --> 02:07:06,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can also shop online.

79
02:07:08,393 --> 02:07:22,944
[SPEAKER_18]: We also want to share that our wonderful Bistro 489 opened their doors today to the community and our wonderful culinary arts students will be serving delicious breakfast and lunch food options.

80
02:07:22,984 --> 02:07:27,107

113
02:11:17,208 --> 02:11:20,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, we have a recommendation to approve budget transfer for city year work.

114
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:24,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Gerald McHugh, come on up.

115
02:11:27,332 --> 02:11:32,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. McHugh is a former finance director and now a budget specialist, right?

116
02:11:41,937 --> 02:11:45,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we have a transfer of this budget,

117
02:11:47,125 --> 02:11:59,450
[SPEAKER_12]: at a previous school committee at the end of the summer, you briefed on this opportunity that came late in the year or just ahead of school opening.

118
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:05,632
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wasn't part of the budget that was passed in June.

119
02:12:05,652 --> 02:12:06,953
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have a...

120
02:12:11,732 --> 02:12:17,755
[SPEAKER_12]: $500,000 contingency line that's titled undistributed salaries in the budget.

121
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:22,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's been a feature of the budget, at least in FY24.

122
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:30,622
[SPEAKER_12]: The cost to run this program in both schools is $200,000.

123
02:12:30,882 --> 02:12:40,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of the services we'll receive is to support the afterschool program.

124
02:12:40,826 --> 02:12:49,189
[SPEAKER_12]: So I allocated the expense 65% in the school budget and 35% in the before and afterschool revolving fund.

125
02:12:53,723 --> 02:13:07,272
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to make sure we also comply with reporting requirements, it's important to have these expenses reflected in the schools that are receiving the services.

126
02:13:08,012 --> 02:13:12,815
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how the state wants us to report school-based spending by school.

127
02:13:13,676 --> 02:13:18,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've set up three new accounts in the admin system.

128
02:13:19,219 --> 02:13:38,142
[SPEAKER_12]: uh one for the missatuck and then uh we're splitting the expense um at the mcglynn between the the middle and the elementary uh so once those uh currently the con in order to um proceed with getting the contract finalized

129
02:13:39,406 --> 02:13:49,568
[SPEAKER_12]: we issued a purchase order, which is 100% charged to the before and after school program until we could get these accounts set up and funded.

130
02:13:51,008 --> 02:14:02,811
[SPEAKER_12]: And once that happens, with your approval, then we can adjust the purchase order to reflect these expenses.

131
02:14:07,012 --> 02:14:07,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Graham.

132
02:14:08,530 --> 02:14:09,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And then member Ruseau.

133
02:14:09,771 --> 02:14:11,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to make a motion to approve.

134
02:14:11,112 --> 02:14:14,995

[SPEAKER_10]: Paper passes.

158
02:14:52,923 --> 02:14:58,966
[SPEAKER_10]: We have recommendation to approve $10,000 donation from the Cummings Foundation Make a Difference Dollars Program.

159
02:14:59,587 --> 02:15:00,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome Ms.

160
02:15:00,387 --> 02:15:01,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne Fee, our Director of Arts.

161
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:05,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody.

162
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:14,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to give an update and share some plans for this $10,000 donation that we got, as you stated, from the Cummings Foundation.

163
02:15:15,995 --> 02:15:25,640
[SPEAKER_01]: We used these funds in the spring to create mini grants, and the donation was intended to be arts-based enrichment

164
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:31,184
[SPEAKER_01]: that works to promote positivity and social change within our community.

165
02:15:31,484 --> 02:15:33,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the mini grants reflected that theme.

166
02:15:34,626 --> 02:15:40,971
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school level, we had the ceramics club working on quote tiles that are hung in the halls of MHS.

167
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:55,042
[SPEAKER_01]: At the middle school level, at one of our art events, we had suminagashi art, a post for students and families to interact with.

168
02:15:59,005 --> 02:16:00,308
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I'm really excited about.

169
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside the EL office at Medford High, we created a look and find board that was designed by students in my design class.

170
02:16:10,348 --> 02:16:31,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a large board that just has, sorry, a bunch of imagery and then little papers that say, can you find sort of like a where's Waldo, but it's a great interactive way for our non-English speaking newest students and little brothers and sisters when they're in the waiting room to feel welcome and make that visit a little bit more.

171
02:16:32,613 --> 02:16:34,514
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasant and a little less nerve-wracking.

172
02:16:34,814 --> 02:16:38,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So that artwork's getting framed now, so we're really excited about that.

173
02:16:39,395 --> 02:16:51,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our other big project was the Kindness Campaign, where we had students design posters and stickers, and we had them printed, and you can see them hung up here at City Hall, at Colleen's, at Medford Public Library.

174
02:16:51,399 --> 02:16:53,920
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at every elementary school and middle school.

175
02:16:55,256 --> 02:16:58,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the events, the projects that we did.

176
02:16:59,784 --> 02:17:00,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, one more.

177
02:17:00,506 --> 02:17:06,717
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Andrews, we did a specific art display celebrating women artists of color.

178
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are some of the mini grants that we operated last spring.

179
02:17:12,114 --> 02:17:19,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting in October, we're opening that up again to hopefully have new and different art-based grants across the district.

180
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:23,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to be back in the spring to share those updates with you.

181
02:17:23,964 --> 02:17:36,094
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big project that we did with some of these funds were our first ever summer arts workshops that were offered at all three levels, K through 12, where students worked on art that was

182
02:17:36,601 --> 02:17:40,062
[SPEAKER_01]: based on social issues that were important to them.

183
02:17:40,142 --> 02:17:51,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the littlest kids in our K through three program worked for the week exploring of how to sort of share the theme of kindness through their art.

184
02:17:52,124 --> 02:17:56,785
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a waiting list this year at both the elementary and the middle school level.

185
02:17:57,225 --> 02:18:01,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is another initiative we hope to expand next summer with maybe

186
02:18:02,194 --> 02:18:08,096
[SPEAKER_01]: getting more teachers so that we could offer maybe two classes at each elementary and middle school level.

187
02:18:08,977 --> 02:18:12,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an update on what we've done and where we hope to be.

188
02:18:12,258 --> 02:18:17,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited about this grant.

189
02:18:18,261 --> 02:18:18,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

190
02:18:19,201 --> 02:18:19,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

191
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:22,502
[SPEAKER_10]: V. No questions.

192
02:18:22,782 --> 02:18:24,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

193
02:18:24,443 --> 02:18:24,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

194
02:18:25,043 --> 02:18:25,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

195
02:18:25,763 --> 02:18:29,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we already motion to approve the Cummings grant or did we already approve that?

196
02:18:32,631 --> 02:18:35,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so we recommend you to motion to approve.

197
02:18:35,513 --> 02:18:36,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to approve on the floor?

198
02:18:36,974 --> 02:18:37,234

[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

231
02:19:16,764 --> 02:19:31,429
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our generous parents in our project transition program has donated anonymously $1,000 to be used towards students programming, vocational opportunities, community trips, things of that nature.

232
02:19:31,549 --> 02:19:40,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are respectfully recommending that the school committee approve this generous and thoughtful donation for the students of project transition.

02:19:40,451 --> 02:19:41,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people who aren't aware,

234
02:19:42,612 --> 02:19:45,714
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our program for our students 18 to 22.

235
02:19:45,754 --> 02:19:57,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's providing them with opportunities to volunteer, get jobs, real life situations.

236
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:03,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they age out at 22, we're hoping that they're able to give back to the community.

237
02:20:03,624 --> 02:20:06,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our students in Project Transition also work at...

02:20:07,586 --> 02:20:35,927

02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:17,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Great.

290
02:22:18,309 --> 02:22:24,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much for the opportunity to present an update on our exciting new partnership with Metroburg Public Schools.

291
02:22:28,197 --> 02:22:28,598
[SPEAKER_23]: Excellent.

292
02:22:30,539 --> 02:22:30,860
[SPEAKER_23]: How do I?

293
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:33,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're going to do it.

294
02:22:33,882 --> 02:22:34,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Great.

295
02:22:34,262 --> 02:22:34,563
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

296
02:22:35,751 --> 02:22:42,896
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you're familiar with City Year, but just as a quick refresher, City Year partners with schools to ensure student success.

297
02:22:43,096 --> 02:22:52,362
[SPEAKER_23]: We recruit diverse young AmeriCorps members ages 18 to 25 to serve full time as tutors and mentors and to provide whole school support.

298
02:22:52,422 --> 02:22:58,186
[SPEAKER_23]: So our core members are all day from the beginning of the day to the end of the day, serving about a 10 hour day.

299
02:22:58,226 --> 02:23:04,070
[SPEAKER_23]: And some of the ways we support schools is through academic tutoring, social emotional support for students, attendance support.

300
02:23:04,551 --> 02:23:14,178
[SPEAKER_23]: attendance support for schools, after-school support, which we'll talk a little bit more about, and certainly that full-time support, adding capacity to classrooms where we partner with teachers.

301
02:23:14,638 --> 02:23:18,421
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll talk a little bit more about where our Corps members are partnered.

302
02:23:18,441 --> 02:23:19,382
[SPEAKER_23]: You can go to the next slide.

303
02:23:21,743 --> 02:23:26,187
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, our AmeriCorps members are diverse, passionate, skilled 18 to 24-year-olds.

304
02:23:26,787 --> 02:23:32,291
[SPEAKER_23]: They're committed to serving for full-time all year to get to their 1,700 hours of service.

305
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:33,572
[SPEAKER_23]: As I mentioned, it is

306
02:23:34,381 --> 02:23:50,935
[SPEAKER_23]: full-time day in schools every day here that here's the fun part so here's Medford City your teams you can see the team at the McGlynn the team at the Mesa Tech pictured here they look happy and excited this is right about when they're about to start serving in your in your schools

307
02:23:52,628 --> 02:23:56,149
[SPEAKER_23]: On the next slide, you'll see how we placed our core members.

308
02:23:56,229 --> 02:24:10,512
[SPEAKER_23]: So at the McGlynn, there's a team of six that includes a team leader, which basically means it's a returning AmeriCorps member that brings that added experience and leadership in addition to the leadership that Kayla, I mean, Alyssa provides as the impact manager.

309
02:24:11,773 --> 02:24:15,513
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the McGlynn, they're serving in one core member per grade, three through eight.

310
02:24:15,993 --> 02:24:20,755
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the Missatuck, the team of five, including a team leader, is supporting three through five.

311
02:24:20,955 --> 02:24:22,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Each is assigned to a partner teacher.

312
02:24:26,025 --> 02:24:31,427
[SPEAKER_23]: Before our AmeriCorps members stepped foot in the school district, they started with us in August.

313
02:24:31,487 --> 02:24:35,329
[SPEAKER_23]: So they participated in a very intensive four-week summer training.

314
02:24:35,349 --> 02:24:37,550
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see here some of the topics covered.

315
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:53,376
[SPEAKER_23]: So really strong emphasis on building relationships with students and teachers, instructional strategies, understanding student development to provide that mentorship support, and then also some of the, obviously, the technical things they need to know around like mandated reporting and CPR certification.

316
02:24:54,313 --> 02:25:04,423
[SPEAKER_23]: And then throughout the year, for two Fridays every month, our core members are also getting a lot of professional development to make sure that they're adequately prepared to support students.

317
02:25:07,766 --> 02:25:12,871
[SPEAKER_23]: Here you can see a snapshot of the teacher and school onboarding process that we participated in.

318
02:25:15,029 --> 02:25:32,706
[SPEAKER_23]: four-step process, starting with our leadership and school leadership to talk about school goals, what we know are our conditions to ensure success and impact for students, presenting to all staff at PD in August 26 to align with them as well.

319
02:25:33,707 --> 02:25:38,131
[SPEAKER_23]: And then core members, once they were finished with their training, they came to schools and

320
02:25:38,875 --> 02:25:52,346
[SPEAKER_23]: to acclimate themselves first participated in shadowing rotations to fill out classrooms and for teachers to fill out the core members before collecting their feedback and then determining with the principals how exactly they were going to be placed based on

321
02:25:53,106 --> 02:25:54,286
[SPEAKER_23]: that two-week trial period.

322
02:25:55,386 --> 02:26:10,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Core members have been placed for maybe one or two weeks at this point and are just now in the stages of getting to know their classroom teachers, doing those one-on-one conversations to set some goals and establish the expectations for the core member role in the classroom.

323
02:26:14,030 --> 02:26:18,491
[SPEAKER_23]: In terms of after-school support, you can see here that our AmeriCorps members

324
02:26:19,465 --> 02:26:27,029
[SPEAKER_23]: Both campuses are supporting after-school programming every week, so our core members are serving.

325
02:26:27,349 --> 02:26:31,751
[SPEAKER_23]: If our core members are part of the elementary school community during the day, they stay for after-school programming.

326
02:26:32,112 --> 02:26:32,932
[SPEAKER_23]: Same for middle school.

327
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:46,377
[SPEAKER_23]: So whether it's the enrichment clubs in the afterschool for the middle school or the regularly scheduled afterschool programming in elementary school, they're staying to provide that extra capacity and extra support to the existing programming.

328
02:26:47,518 --> 02:26:59,224
[SPEAKER_23]: At the Missatuck, they will also be adding a homework club in October serving, I understand to be approximately 15 students who have been identified as really benefiting as students who could benefit from that support.

329
02:27:00,164 --> 02:27:06,169
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, in addition to supporting at bringing additional capacity to enhance the programming.

330
02:27:07,090 --> 02:27:18,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I know there's also the opportunity to work with school leaders on how this can evolve for perhaps the second half of the year and add additional capacity beyond what we're doing now.

331
02:27:18,359 --> 02:27:28,868
[SPEAKER_23]: The priority now is to integrate into the existing programming and enhance the quality and then hopefully expanding more in the second half of the year.

332
02:27:29,758 --> 02:27:31,663
[SPEAKER_23]: to address additional afterschool needs.

333
02:27:34,474 --> 02:27:45,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Here you can just see our, you know, this is meant to exemplify our commitment to ongoing quality and model of fidelity and making sure that we stay on the same page to ensure student impact.

334
02:27:45,958 --> 02:27:56,982
[SPEAKER_23]: So regular times, you know, obviously regular times for school administration and city year leadership to meet our core members are regularly meeting with their teachers, they'll be starting that.

335
02:27:57,982 --> 02:27:59,843
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that they have those placements to plan,

336
02:28:00,778 --> 02:28:13,686
[SPEAKER_23]: For students in October, you can see that our core members will begin what we call focusless support, which is where they really begin that more targeted support with students who have been identified based on what the data tells us in terms of their English language arts and math.

337
02:28:16,047 --> 02:28:16,488
[SPEAKER_23]: No, you're good.

338
02:28:17,869 --> 02:28:26,654
[SPEAKER_23]: And getting that two or three times a week, really targeted support in English language arts, math, attendance, and the social emotional mentorship.

339
02:28:27,969 --> 02:28:34,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Here, this was just to add some fun to some of the fun things that we've done beyond what we've already presented.

340
02:28:34,535 --> 02:28:39,559
[SPEAKER_23]: You may have heard that in September, City Year was featured as a partner for the New England Revolution.

341
02:28:39,619 --> 02:28:41,440
[SPEAKER_23]: And we had the opportunity to bring students.

342
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:51,428
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're really thrilled with the level of enthusiasm and engagement of the families and students who came and walked out on the field with the players and stayed for the game.

343
02:28:51,468 --> 02:28:52,469
[SPEAKER_23]: So that was a really fun night.

344
02:28:53,610 --> 02:28:57,013
[SPEAKER_23]: And then some other on the next slide, you can just highlights a couple of the other

345
02:28:57,681 --> 02:29:12,417
[SPEAKER_23]: whole school supports that we've been able to provide with curriculum nights, ice cream social, just bringing again that additional capacity to create a welcoming and vibrant culture for the school.

346
02:29:12,738 --> 02:29:17,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'm excited to pass it over to our Principal Tucci before taking any questions that you might have.

347
02:29:22,796 --> 02:29:23,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, good evening and welcome.

348
02:29:25,078 --> 02:29:25,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy new school year.

349
02:29:26,439 --> 02:29:32,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to kind of provide a little bit of information about how I've been really excited and enthused to work with City Year.

350
02:29:33,325 --> 02:29:43,895
[SPEAKER_17]: From my perspective, at the start of every single school day, you might see me at the front door greeting all students on a typical basis, interacting with students, asking about how their night went, how their sports game went, giving them a high five.

351
02:29:44,355 --> 02:29:53,078
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also try to strive to make sure that all my teachers are having positive interactions with all of our students before the time they walk in the building and by the time they get to homeroom.

352
02:29:53,318 --> 02:29:53,839
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my goal.

353
02:29:53,999 --> 02:30:00,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And I always tell teachers I want to see a regular student have at least two positive interactions with their teachers before they even step foot in homeroom.

354
02:30:01,081 --> 02:30:04,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can say that City Year really helps us kind of accomplish that.

355
02:30:04,403 --> 02:30:12,906
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's just an example of the life, the energy, the awesome excitement and engagement that they've been able to provide to our school community because I really see it right from the get-go.

356
02:30:13,527 --> 02:30:23,224
[SPEAKER_17]: i think that's really important to help our students feel like they belong and i see city year as being an important partner and helping us kind of achieve one of our core values here in the metro public schools

357
02:30:24,413 --> 02:30:32,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Thus far this year, it's been great to see City Year be in our classes, being tutors, pushing into classrooms and helping provide that targeted support.

358
02:30:33,658 --> 02:30:43,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we've surveyed our faculty members and been able to solicit their feedback of where the highest priority areas they could use a City Year core member in their class.

359
02:30:43,763 --> 02:30:56,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've sat down just in the past few days with Alyssa David and we hard scheduled out every single city or core member so that we're using them very effectively in very targeted type of ways to be able to maximize the level of support that we can provide.

360
02:30:57,212 --> 02:31:03,596
[SPEAKER_17]: So this will be an ongoing conversation that will be data informed and we really hope that we'll continue this awesome work and partnership.

361
02:31:04,857 --> 02:31:13,082
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also excited with the role of our clubs and activities at the middle school level just this week to be able to have our city or core members be a part of the life

362
02:31:15,003 --> 02:31:17,944
[SPEAKER_17]: awesome energy and engagement of our clubs and activities at the middle school level.

363
02:31:18,484 --> 02:31:21,545
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully they can help us take it a step further with this wonderful partnership.

364
02:31:22,185 --> 02:31:27,726
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll just also mention they're part of our team at the McGlynn Middle School, just like they would be at other schools.

365
02:31:28,206 --> 02:31:33,888
[SPEAKER_17]: They're part of our staff professional development, our faculty meetings, and true partners and what we can offer our students.

366
02:31:34,448 --> 02:31:38,049
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to say that it's been a great few weeks in working with core members.

367
02:31:38,089 --> 02:31:41,089
[SPEAKER_17]: They've made a great first impression with our students and myself as the principal.

368
02:31:41,430 --> 02:31:42,970
[SPEAKER_17]: And I look forward to expanding this partnership.

369
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:44,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to take any questions you might have.

370
02:31:47,392 --> 02:31:54,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank City Year and all of the members that aren't here today for what you're doing thus far.

371
02:31:54,775 --> 02:32:10,642
[SPEAKER_18]: But Principal Tucci, I wanted to just ask you to piggyback specifically on one of our conversations about future educators and how you are mentoring and how you see that work potentially.

372
02:32:11,098 --> 02:32:32,519
[SPEAKER_17]: absolutely so i know a lot of our core members some of them are really interested in potentially jumping into the field of education and this is uh important for the medford public schools to be on the the cutting edge to be able to capture the best and brightest educators that have a lot of energy and excitement and if we're able to work with our city or core member partners to be able to develop them and nurture them and

373
02:32:32,919 --> 02:33:02,042
[SPEAKER_17]: hopefully put them under our wing to be able to help to turn them into maybe future educators and become mustangs themselves so i think that i'm excited i've already had a few different conversations with core members in just a few weeks about that very topic and how we can continue to support them in their growth as professionals and hopefully bring them on in and bring them into the mexico schools thank you so much for the update and welcome to our classrooms thank you for joining us a member or so oh somebody's online

374
02:33:08,052 --> 02:33:10,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Jess, name and address of the record, please.

375
02:33:11,215 --> 02:33:12,796
[SPEAKER_22]: Jessica Healy, Full Lock Road.

376
02:33:14,117 --> 02:33:23,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to know, are we going to be notified, like if our child's working with someone from city who went on one, will we be notified of that?

377
02:33:29,667 --> 02:33:31,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we will, thank you for that question.

378
02:33:31,328 --> 02:33:34,529
[SPEAKER_19]: We will work with school leaders so that families are aware.

379
02:33:35,109 --> 02:33:38,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Our AmeriCorps members are typically working in the classroom alongside the teacher.

380
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:43,492
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll be working sometimes whole class, sometimes small groups, sometimes individual.

381
02:33:43,872 --> 02:33:52,035
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think likely families of those students who are being served by an AmeriCorps member will likely receive notice, but we'll work with the school leaders on that.

382
02:33:53,656 --> 02:33:54,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

383
02:33:54,096 --> 02:33:54,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

384
02:33:56,076 --> 02:33:57,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you so much for presenting.

385
02:33:59,753 --> 02:34:00,314
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

386
02:34:00,574 --> 02:34:01,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Best of luck to the year.

387
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:07,724
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a recommendation to approve new senior parking fee of $150.

388
02:34:08,265 --> 02:34:12,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

389
02:34:19,206 --> 02:34:20,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

390
02:34:21,027 --> 02:34:25,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for formally hearing this proposal and went back with school leadership.

391
02:34:26,609 --> 02:34:31,732
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some students in the audience present in the class who may also want to speak on it as well.

392
02:34:33,012 --> 02:34:37,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, I will say it is mislisted as a senior only parking fee.

393
02:34:37,214 --> 02:34:41,916
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be a parking fee at $75 to park that would benefit.

394
02:34:42,096 --> 02:34:44,838
[SPEAKER_14]: It would go straight to student hardships.

395
02:34:45,798 --> 02:34:56,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Student events and the $75 for seniors in addition would be to paint and decorate their personal parking space as many high schools do.

396
02:34:58,309 --> 02:35:01,652
[SPEAKER_14]: If they so chose just to drive the car and not park, it would be the $75.

397
02:35:03,654 --> 02:35:14,083
[SPEAKER_14]: if they so chose to paint and decorate their parking space, which really adds a lot of color and a lot of fun to school parking lots that I've seen it in, it would be $150.

398
02:35:16,064 --> 02:35:20,849
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would also go directly toward the senior class.

399
02:35:20,969 --> 02:35:24,271
[SPEAKER_14]: That part of this would go directly towards the senior class.

400
02:35:24,972 --> 02:35:34,559
[SPEAKER_14]: as a fundraiser to help offset things like their prom costs, to offer students, again, seniors hardship waivers and things along those lines.

401
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:46,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have members of the senior class too to speak on it if the committee would so like to entertain any questions, but happy to answer any as well.

402
02:35:46,992 --> 02:36:09,158
[SPEAKER_10]: so dr just so thank you so much for listening to the school committee um two weeks ago and taking some of our ideas um back and and working this out so just so we have it straight 75 for any parking spot but any senior could also pay an additional 75 to paint their spot so we'll have ground art yes yes okay students would you like to come up

403
02:36:11,132 --> 02:36:21,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, just real quick, just so everyone knows, in looking at parking fees for area schools, they range between $40 and $150, just so that everyone is aware.

404
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:25,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Cushing, before you step away, though, are there schools where there's no charge?

405
02:36:28,384 --> 02:36:36,250
[SPEAKER_14]: In all honesty, not that I saw, but I do also know that there are some schools that don't allow parking, such as Somerville High School.

406
02:36:38,812 --> 02:36:39,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

407
02:36:41,314 --> 02:36:43,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to name and address for the record, and welcome.

408
02:36:44,317 --> 02:36:46,199
[SPEAKER_11]: JAMES CASEY, 835 Pelzoy West.

409
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:48,641
[SPEAKER_20]: GIARUSO, 132 Grand Ave.

410
02:36:49,402 --> 02:36:50,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm senior class president.

411
02:36:51,244 --> 02:36:53,086
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm senior class vice president.

412
02:36:53,632 --> 02:37:02,414
[SPEAKER_11]: And so just to restate what was just said, the original $75 is just to park in general for any grade level, anyone who parks at the school.

413
02:37:02,934 --> 02:37:12,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will go towards hardships and like bus passes, events, field trips, as well as student activities like the pep rally and other community events.

414
02:37:12,816 --> 02:37:19,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And then where I come in for the seniors, the additional 75 is to paint your spot for the year.

415
02:37:19,137 --> 02:37:19,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And that'll be your spot.

416
02:37:21,173 --> 02:37:26,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And those funds will be used for class activities, such as prom.

417
02:37:27,197 --> 02:37:28,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope to get senior t-shirts.

418
02:37:28,578 --> 02:37:30,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And this will just be like a fundraiser for our class.

419
02:37:35,884 --> 02:37:39,146
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a fun activity.

420
02:37:39,166 --> 02:37:41,668
[SPEAKER_20]: I know a lot of other seniors have requested it.

421
02:37:41,828 --> 02:37:47,032
[SPEAKER_20]: So by popular demand, we want to just see if we can get this approved.

422
02:37:47,692 --> 02:37:48,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we started.

423
02:37:49,159 --> 02:38:13,466
[SPEAKER_11]: had our first meeting about it in the spring like to try and we had a meeting with principal gabral and miss fritas haley they were really on board with it and as i said other public schools charge for it we found as low as 40 some schools up to 300 to park for the year so we found kind of a good medium at 75 and i think the most common concern was like we understand that paying for parking may come as a hardship to some students

424
02:38:14,683 --> 02:38:23,347
[SPEAKER_11]: and the school's willing and prepared to support students and ensure that every student who drives is able to acquire their own spot and be able to assist students that need it.

425
02:38:25,188 --> 02:38:26,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

426
02:38:26,128 --> 02:38:26,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds great.

427
02:38:26,749 --> 02:38:27,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

428
02:38:28,069 --> 02:38:33,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you could even maybe have some donations from community members that want to paint too.

429
02:38:36,513 --> 02:38:37,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Olapade?

430
02:38:42,134 --> 02:39:06,208
[SPEAKER_00]: uh so thank you mayor and thank you for doing this i have two questions you mentioned briefly that for other grade levels i'm assuming this is just for seniors not for juniors and below okay but juniors and below can have a spot and do we have what we need spots wise or is this a lottery system to determine who gets a spot i've been told that we have the amount of spots okay

431
02:39:09,733 --> 02:39:29,525
[SPEAKER_14]: so as with most schools as the year goes on um spots become significantly more of a premium so i think we're going to have to do as we look at the first year is first make sure seniors have spaces juniors sophomores and then perhaps a lottery there are there are there is a

432
02:39:30,365 --> 02:39:35,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that as long as some students would be willing to park in the skate park area, we have enough spaces.

433
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:41,894
[SPEAKER_14]: However, that might be a further walk for some students who drive to school to get into the building.

434
02:39:42,674 --> 02:39:45,276
[SPEAKER_14]: But the reality is we do have enough spaces.

435
02:39:45,717 --> 02:39:55,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just those prime spaces in the front of the building and on the side of the building tend to fill up as more students get their permits and then their licenses.

436
02:39:55,677 --> 02:40:01,339
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my second question is, is that when it comes to cleanup costs at the end of the year, what does that look like?

437
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:09,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So the spots are simply painted over for the next year by the next group of students that would come in.

438
02:40:09,902 --> 02:40:18,206
[SPEAKER_14]: And if a space is not painted, then that senior from the class of 2025 will have a legacy until it is painted over.

439
02:40:19,666 --> 02:40:36,941
[SPEAKER_14]: all right it's in in all in all fairness in all honesty it's definitely something that i think that we should entertain but as we bring on a brand new high school brand new parking lots um we should see how it goes see what maybe rules regulations need to be put in effect but you know i don't want to

440
02:40:37,927 --> 02:40:41,408
[SPEAKER_14]: to quell anyone's artistic parking space integrity.

441
02:40:41,808 --> 02:40:47,650
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think when you're looking at what the work of the high school is going to be, we wanna make sure that it's well presented.

442
02:40:48,070 --> 02:40:49,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

443
02:40:49,610 --> 02:40:50,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

444
02:40:51,531 --> 02:41:01,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Us, every student who parts of the school like having assigned spot will also allow staff to like actually see it and know everyone who's parking at the school.

445
02:41:01,794 --> 02:41:06,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there was an incident last week, a freshman drove BMW to school unlicensed.

446
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:11,221
[SPEAKER_11]: but no one would know because they don't know whose it is.

447
02:41:11,261 --> 02:41:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now everyone knows, but it's like just another thing they can see if someone's leaving.

448
02:41:18,123 --> 02:41:20,324
[SPEAKER_11]: They can see exactly who is parking where.

449
02:41:21,864 --> 02:41:22,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

450
02:41:22,464 --> 02:41:23,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Weinfeld?

451
02:41:23,445 --> 02:41:28,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity.

452
02:41:29,886 --> 02:41:34,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Either do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a

453
02:41:37,117 --> 02:41:43,741
[SPEAKER_05]: protocol in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot.

454
02:41:47,383 --> 02:41:48,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I trust our students.

455
02:41:48,764 --> 02:41:52,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.

456
02:41:53,627 --> 02:41:55,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll work with Principal Cabral and

457
02:41:57,628 --> 02:42:07,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Associate Principal Freitas-Haley to make sure that whatever students are painting at least gets submitted for approval prior to conceptual drawing, something along those lines.

458
02:42:08,593 --> 02:42:08,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Sound fair?

459
02:42:09,374 --> 02:42:09,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

460
02:42:15,177 --> 02:42:17,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not a fan of censorship.

461
02:42:17,278 --> 02:42:20,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted, things can happen.

462
02:42:20,359 --> 02:42:20,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

463
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau, then Member Branley.

464
02:42:25,598 --> 02:42:37,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I would recommend that whatever community standards are developed that first of all, they're written down and then they're passed by our attorney because, um, students do have a first amendment rights, although it's slightly different.

465
02:42:38,223 --> 02:42:40,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and it can't just be a matter of.

466
02:42:41,924 --> 02:42:42,644
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't like it.

467
02:42:42,684 --> 02:42:47,786
[SPEAKER_15]: The principal doesn't like it because that does a pass muster with we are the government.

468
02:42:48,783 --> 02:42:51,485
[SPEAKER_15]: the teachers of the government, we are all the government.

469
02:42:51,665 --> 02:43:01,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that is, most people are confused on what the first amendment means, but the government interfering with what can and can't be said well.

470
02:43:02,984 --> 02:43:09,408
[SPEAKER_15]: having varied rules about what can be said based on what the content is is not allowed.

471
02:43:09,988 --> 02:43:21,955
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, somebody wants to do a rainbow flag here, that's probably fine, but then you go to certain places in this country and the same rainbow flag might get you, you know, expelled.

472
02:43:22,476 --> 02:43:28,119
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's an example of the need to be very careful here.

473
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:32,921
[SPEAKER_15]: some things are offensive to some people and they're not to others.

474
02:43:33,882 --> 02:43:37,923
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is not going to be up to the school to decide what's offensive and what's not.

475
02:43:38,623 --> 02:43:44,246
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's a danger here I think that is deeply concerning for me.

476
02:43:46,301 --> 02:44:09,976
[SPEAKER_15]: and uh i don't know that we have thought that part out it can't just be that the principal doesn't like it or you take a vote of administrators that those those are not options so having clear explicit guidelines ahead of time not afterwards ahead of time where you can say here are the guidelines

477
02:44:10,723 --> 02:44:15,926
[SPEAKER_15]: And from the guidelines, any rational person could say that's in or out of bounds.

478
02:44:16,566 --> 02:44:19,448
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how you avoid a First Amendment case here.

479
02:44:19,568 --> 02:44:31,194
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to guess that other schools that have the painting thing have already been through this, probably didn't get it done beforehand and then had to deal with the consequences.

480
02:44:31,314 --> 02:44:37,357
[SPEAKER_15]: But we really should find out what other districts are using for guidelines, the exact language and see if...

481
02:44:38,171 --> 02:44:42,296
[SPEAKER_15]: we like any of that, because that does worry.

482
02:44:42,316 --> 02:44:50,787
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll just eat up huge amounts of resources and time and lawsuits, God forbid, but lawsuits cost a lot of money.

483
02:44:51,167 --> 02:44:53,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm very worried about that.

484
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:54,331
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also...

485
02:44:57,113 --> 02:45:00,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm concerned about, I'm not concerned about the $75 to paint.

486
02:45:00,995 --> 02:45:03,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm concerned about the $75 to park.

487
02:45:04,637 --> 02:45:11,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that it was mentioned that we would set some money aside to help kids that couldn't afford it.

488
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:14,682
[SPEAKER_15]: But as some of you have heard many times,

489
02:45:15,515 --> 02:45:17,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, not all, there's a lot of new members here.

490
02:45:17,476 --> 02:45:19,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So most of you haven't heard a lot of the things I've had to say.

491
02:45:20,397 --> 02:45:26,979
[SPEAKER_15]: But by the time you're in high school, if you don't have the resources, you're not asking for help.

492
02:45:27,259 --> 02:45:28,279
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not how it works.

493
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:36,462
[SPEAKER_15]: When you spent your childhood being aware that you don't have the resources, you've learned to just stop asking because that's not for you.

494
02:45:37,142 --> 02:45:38,703
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for the kids with the resources.

495
02:45:39,003 --> 02:45:41,484
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm opposed to charging $75 to park, $75 to paint,

496
02:45:48,004 --> 02:45:49,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still open to that.

497
02:45:50,106 --> 02:45:50,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

498
02:45:52,167 --> 02:45:52,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

499
02:45:52,908 --> 02:45:53,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Branley?

500
02:45:55,190 --> 02:46:00,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to piggyback what Member Ruseau said about making sure that we have guidelines.

501
02:46:00,834 --> 02:46:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe my favorite word here is being proactive.

502
02:46:03,977 --> 02:46:08,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can just be proactive to protect you guys, to protect us, obviously, as a district.

503
02:46:09,521 --> 02:46:13,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm just also curious with the paying,

504
02:46:15,959 --> 02:46:19,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, if you're not paying, you can still park at school.

505
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:22,901
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not parking at school at all if you don't pay.

506
02:46:24,782 --> 02:46:32,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, okay, so that's obviously gonna be told to everybody that's parking is gonna understand that if you don't pay the $75, you can't park at school.

507
02:46:50,834 --> 02:46:54,670
[SPEAKER_14]: high school leadership is really looking for a way to be able to

508
02:47:28,707 --> 02:47:30,228
[SPEAKER_14]: that piece of this moving forward.

509
02:47:30,308 --> 02:47:36,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So in theory, the $75 RPP approved by this body could move forward.

510
02:47:36,893 --> 02:47:50,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the second piece could be for the seniors as we wait two or three weeks to develop and vet properly those community standards that are respectful of the First Amendment within the realm of the schoolhouse, to use the Supreme Court's words.

511
02:47:51,684 --> 02:47:56,027
[SPEAKER_14]: We would make sure that those are well vetted as well and well published.

512
02:47:57,076 --> 02:48:01,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then just my other question is, would this be something that's done after school?

513
02:48:02,965 --> 02:48:05,369
[SPEAKER_06]: When would we be painting if that was the case?

514
02:48:05,389 --> 02:48:07,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any ideas, Mr. Casey?

515
02:48:08,459 --> 02:48:16,623
[SPEAKER_11]: we were hoping a weekend, maybe Saturday and Sunday, because some people like, you know, have to do like a base coat, let it dry, get something on top.

516
02:48:16,683 --> 02:48:25,987
[SPEAKER_11]: It could take a significant amount of hours, but then we'll try and find days, because like a lot of sports schedules have school activities that it may not work with, but.

517
02:48:26,187 --> 02:48:29,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously the school is being used during that time too, for activities.

518
02:48:36,252 --> 02:48:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

519
02:48:38,629 --> 02:48:44,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have to motion on the floor to make this two separate votes, 175 for the spot and then 175 for the painting?

520
02:48:45,951 --> 02:48:48,752
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody wants to sever, otherwise we can move approval of the whole thing.

521
02:48:49,792 --> 02:48:57,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to sever it so that we can have motion to sever the $75 for the spot and then $75 for the painting, if that's possible.

522
02:48:58,375 --> 02:49:04,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, motion to sever the 150 into two by Member Branley.

523
02:49:04,937 --> 02:49:05,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

524
02:49:06,658 --> 02:49:06,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

525
02:49:07,537 --> 02:49:09,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, all those in favor?

526
02:49:10,718 --> 02:49:11,358
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

527
02:49:11,438 --> 02:49:13,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor for the $75?

528
02:49:13,759 --> 02:49:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about the $75 to park.

529
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:17,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that just during school hours?

530
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:34,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.

531
02:49:38,624 --> 02:49:40,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be to park at any time.

532
02:49:41,445 --> 02:49:47,008
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I don't know how we would be able to monitor after hours.

533
02:49:47,348 --> 02:49:48,609
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the challenge.

534
02:49:49,550 --> 02:49:59,995
[SPEAKER_14]: But our after-hours parking usually isn't a problem with the exception of the other night, enormously successful for killing the night with a bicycle where we needed a parking deck.

535
02:50:00,995 --> 02:50:03,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe this will encourage more carpooling too.

536
02:50:03,276 --> 02:50:05,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

537
02:50:06,118 --> 02:50:06,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

538
02:50:06,578 --> 02:50:07,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say that I...

539
02:50:09,372 --> 02:50:22,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes.

540
02:50:23,575 --> 02:50:30,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.

541
02:50:31,957 --> 02:50:32,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

542
02:50:33,857 --> 02:50:38,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out that this committee, several years ago,

543
02:50:39,848 --> 02:50:49,735
[SPEAKER_03]: made a resolution to make those bus passes free and that the decision to start charging for those again was not brought before this committee.

544
02:50:49,795 --> 02:51:00,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as I'm concerned, there's a policy compliance issue there because we were very clear that we did not want to charge kids for those bus passes to get to school.

545
02:51:01,523 --> 02:51:06,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hopeful that if the overrides are successful, we can immediately institute a change there.

546
02:51:07,321 --> 02:51:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I acknowledge that the program as it was originally envisioned may need to change, but if we're talking about transit in compliance with our policy being charged, I'm just overall not in favor of that in any regard.

547
02:51:25,136 --> 02:51:31,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do wanna point out for everybody who is new, we did this, we said it, we voted on it and it like reappeared.

548
02:51:32,662 --> 02:51:34,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was not a decision by this group.

549
02:51:36,738 --> 02:51:42,400
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to get back to addressing that just as soon as there's more than no money in the budget.

550
02:51:43,961 --> 02:52:02,607
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I would like to put on the table for the administration to consider is that we should know who is parking in our school and whether we charge for it or not, every person parking in our parking lot, including staff,

551
02:52:03,228 --> 02:52:04,870
[SPEAKER_03]: should have to have a parking permit.

552
02:52:05,010 --> 02:52:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have to be registered with the school with a license plate and a car that they're going to be driving to school without exception.

553
02:52:13,221 --> 02:52:18,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously you deal with visitors sort of separately and there's visitor parking now that's very well signed.

554
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

555
02:52:20,671 --> 02:52:48,148
[SPEAKER_03]: that should be happening i'm surprised it's not frankly because we have no way of knowing which of those cars are there um in a in a way that is consistent with what we're trying to do in the building so that is maybe a separate issue i would like to hear a report on at some point in time but um it doesn't that that parking permit does not have to come with the fee necessarily um depending on how this vote goes tonight but i i would be absolutely in favor of making sure that we understand

556
02:52:49,377 --> 02:52:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: who is driving cars onto the campus.

557
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:55,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Graham.

558
02:52:57,181 --> 02:53:01,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval of the 75,000 to park?

559
02:53:02,043 --> 02:53:03,524
[SPEAKER_10]: $75 per car, yes.

560
02:53:04,344 --> 02:53:04,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Per car.

561
02:53:04,864 --> 02:53:05,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion.

562
02:53:05,985 --> 02:53:15,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Member Reinfeld, seconded by... Motion for $75 to park.

563
02:53:17,210 --> 02:53:17,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

564
02:53:24,923 --> 02:53:36,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, is there a motion to charge the seniors $75 for a parking space to put artwork on their spots?

565
02:53:38,348 --> 02:53:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the senior decorate your parking space $75 fee.

566
02:53:43,290 --> 02:53:45,891
[SPEAKER_10]: By member Graham, seconded by?

567
02:53:45,911 --> 02:53:46,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I can second that.

568
02:53:46,812 --> 02:53:47,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Branley.

569
02:53:48,132 --> 02:53:48,912
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

570
02:53:48,932 --> 02:53:49,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

571
02:53:50,193 --> 02:53:50,933
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

572
02:53:51,753 --> 02:53:52,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

573
02:53:52,814 --> 02:53:52,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor?

574
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:54,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

575
02:53:55,361 --> 02:54:01,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's another relevant to the vote.

576
02:54:01,986 --> 02:54:06,149
[SPEAKER_15]: But having funds available for student activities is

577
02:54:08,524 --> 02:54:18,491
[SPEAKER_15]: is a budgetary issue that, you know, right now it's everybody just raise all the money you can, any which way you can, rather than just providing you a reasonable amount of student activity money.

578
02:54:19,271 --> 02:54:24,094
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that's an issue we need to address.

579
02:54:24,515 --> 02:54:38,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, if the overrides pass, we can put a small amount of money, small budget-wise, not necessarily small if you're a student and you want to use student activity money, but money directly into that rather than just relying exclusively on,

580
02:54:41,006 --> 02:54:56,680
[SPEAKER_15]: using all your free time to raise money, which I mean, all of us were teenagers once, some of us very recently, and you probably could do something else with your time other than raising money for your favorite clubs, like doing the activities in the clubs.

581
02:54:57,721 --> 02:55:02,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope we can get to that point where we're not expecting that of students.

582
02:55:03,005 --> 02:55:03,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

583
02:55:04,567 --> 02:55:05,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you members.

584
02:55:05,087 --> 02:55:06,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for being here.

585
02:55:07,785 --> 02:55:08,605
[SPEAKER_10]: have fun painting.

586
02:55:09,986 --> 02:55:11,607
[SPEAKER_10]: We have no presentations of the public.

587
02:55:11,687 --> 02:55:13,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We have continued business.

588
02:55:15,709 --> 02:55:19,110
[SPEAKER_10]: We have resolution 2024-31 offered by Member Ruseau.

589
02:55:20,571 --> 02:55:25,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Second reading of policy AC-non-discrimination including harassment and retaliation.

590
02:55:26,013 --> 02:55:26,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor?

591
02:55:27,314 --> 02:55:27,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

592
02:55:27,954 --> 02:55:29,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to waive the second reading.

593
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:32,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to waive the second reading by Member Ruseau.

594
02:55:32,996 --> 02:55:33,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

595
02:55:33,596 --> 02:55:34,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

596
02:55:34,817 --> 02:55:36,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Intapa?

597
02:55:36,518 --> 02:55:37,158
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

598
02:55:38,234 --> 02:55:38,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Are those a pass?

599
02:55:39,756 --> 02:55:44,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody want to give a quick summary of what the vote were taken before we take our second reading?

600
02:55:44,379 --> 02:55:45,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so tired.

601
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:47,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

602
02:55:47,841 --> 02:55:50,143
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a non-discrimination, including harassment.

603
02:55:50,183 --> 02:55:50,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

604
02:55:50,644 --> 02:55:51,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

605
02:55:51,544 --> 02:56:00,050
[SPEAKER_15]: So this, as I mentioned in our last meeting, is one of many policies I'll be putting forward to deal with the Title IX changes.

606
02:56:00,391 --> 02:56:00,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Title IX?

607
02:56:01,411 --> 02:56:01,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

608
02:56:02,072 --> 02:56:04,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Title IX changes that came from the Department of Education

609
02:56:05,512 --> 02:56:30,101
[SPEAKER_15]: recently and our professional association provided templates well they provided the language um and so this is one of many they they come together and sort of as a set but rather than making us have to pass um 45 pages of policy in one night um they're broken up so i assume everybody can read but it's on harassment and retaliation

610
02:56:32,093 --> 02:56:32,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

611
02:56:32,914 --> 02:56:35,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by members Graham, seconded by?

612
02:56:35,155 --> 02:56:35,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

613
02:56:36,797 --> 02:56:38,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, three-way tie.

614
02:56:38,198 --> 02:56:40,239
[SPEAKER_10]: About purposes, shoot.

615
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:43,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Reinfeld, all those in favor?

616
02:56:43,502 --> 02:56:45,463
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

617
02:56:46,364 --> 02:56:47,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Second reading is passed.

618
02:56:49,878 --> 02:56:53,541
[SPEAKER_10]: New Business 2024-33 offered by Member Reinfeld.

619
02:56:54,221 --> 02:56:58,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Resolution in support of November 2024 ballot questions.

620
02:56:58,224 --> 02:57:01,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the Medford School Committee support the following ballot initiatives.

621
02:57:02,347 --> 02:57:07,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Question two concerning the use of MCAS as a high school graduation requirement.

622
02:57:07,991 --> 02:57:17,838
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford School Committee supports the use of robust assessment and rigorous education standards in public education, but rejects the use of high stakes testing as a gate keeping tool

623
02:57:18,271 --> 02:57:20,914
[SPEAKER_10]: to define student competencies.

624
02:57:21,674 --> 02:57:36,489
[SPEAKER_10]: This ballot question does not eliminate the MCAS as a standardized assessment tool, but rather constrains its influence over classroom teaching practices and empowers our educators to consistently employ equitable practices for facilitating student learning.

625
02:57:37,776 --> 02:57:43,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Question seven, concerning the stabilization of the Medford Public Schools budget and investment in the Medford Department of Public Works.

626
02:57:44,562 --> 02:57:52,789
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford School Committee recognizes the need to permanently fund essential activities and jobs previously and currently supported by temporary pandemic relief funds.

627
02:57:53,429 --> 02:58:06,240
[SPEAKER_10]: The assessment of tax dollars for this purpose avoids in perpetuity this suite of devastating cuts for staff and services proposed in the last budget cycle and establishes these roles and responsibilities as essential fixtures

628
02:58:06,860 --> 02:58:09,222
[SPEAKER_10]: in the fiscal year 2025 budget and beyond.

629
02:58:09,722 --> 02:58:17,587
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, the Medford School Committee believes that timely and effective maintenance of the city's roads and sidewalks is essential for students' and staff's safety.

630
02:58:18,107 --> 02:58:25,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Increased staff capacity within the Department of Public Works improves accessibility and expands transportation options for all members of the school community.

631
02:58:26,837 --> 02:58:31,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Question eight, concerning the expansion of educational offerings and services for the Medford Public Schools.

632
02:58:32,361 --> 02:58:42,908
[SPEAKER_10]: This Medford School Committee is keenly aware of existing and emerging operational and instructional challenges in our schools, as well as increasing competition in neighboring districts to attract and retain staff.

633
02:58:43,368 --> 02:58:53,995
[SPEAKER_10]: The funds assessed by this initiative will allow the district to expand educational offerings for students, make long deferred improvements to infrastructure and increase compensation for educators and paraprofessionals.

634
02:58:54,758 --> 02:59:23,801
[SPEAKER_10]: In supporting the above measures, the Medford School Committee recognizes the multifaceted impact of these actions on Medford taxpayers and affirms Medford Public Schools' commitment to open and transparent budgeting as dictated by law and our professional and personal responsibility to the citizens of Medford, continued collaboration with our state delegation as well as public and private partners to increase revenue to the district in support of diverse and impactful learning opportunities, data-driven

635
02:59:25,162 --> 02:59:47,434
[SPEAKER_10]: pediologically sound decision-making centered on the educational needs of the students, access to high quality professional development for educator and staff professional development, and providing financial assistance for economically disadvantaged members of the school community as we work towards free enrichment and extracurricular activities while maintaining affordability of services and educational opportunities.

636
02:59:49,616 --> 02:59:50,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Reinfeld.

637
02:59:50,737 --> 02:59:51,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

638
02:59:51,777 --> 02:59:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

639
02:59:52,198 --> 03:00:00,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community.

640
03:00:00,803 --> 03:00:06,206
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience.

641
03:00:06,927 --> 03:00:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately.

642
03:00:12,290 --> 03:00:16,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to do that now or give an overview of

643
03:00:18,455 --> 03:00:25,280
[SPEAKER_05]: of what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position.

644
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:34,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement.

645
03:00:34,806 --> 03:00:44,793
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs.

646
03:00:45,173 --> 03:00:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It expands the definition of success.

647
03:00:47,202 --> 03:00:49,744
[SPEAKER_05]: reduces anxiety, and increases equity.

648
03:00:50,645 --> 03:00:55,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Question seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring.

649
03:00:55,029 --> 03:01:06,880
[SPEAKER_05]: To replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be.

650
03:01:07,821 --> 03:01:11,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's valid question seven, along with the...

651
03:01:12,385 --> 03:01:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances.

652
03:01:22,911 --> 03:01:32,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone.

653
03:01:33,097 --> 03:01:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And then question eight.

654
03:01:34,935 --> 03:01:41,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right?

655
03:01:41,258 --> 03:01:48,380
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule.

656
03:01:48,861 --> 03:01:55,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Many people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that.

657
03:01:55,243 --> 03:01:59,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking

658
03:02:01,471 --> 03:02:07,813
[SPEAKER_05]: starting an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week.

659
03:02:08,253 --> 03:02:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a problem.

660
03:02:11,794 --> 03:02:14,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we need to expand what we offer.

661
03:02:14,435 --> 03:02:20,177
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities.

662
03:02:20,217 --> 03:02:25,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class.

663
03:02:26,218 --> 03:02:27,719
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we're gonna ask people to,

664
03:02:29,496 --> 03:02:32,097
[SPEAKER_05]: to spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that.

665
03:02:32,197 --> 03:02:35,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We found out how low many of our stipends are.

666
03:02:36,379 --> 03:02:40,120
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been hearing for years about competition with other districts.

667
03:02:41,140 --> 03:02:43,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that is question eight.

668
03:02:45,042 --> 03:02:49,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems.

669
03:02:49,803 --> 03:02:53,745
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still committed as a body to working to make sure

670
03:02:54,798 --> 03:02:57,201
[SPEAKER_05]: our students and educators have what they need.

671
03:02:57,761 --> 03:03:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.

672
03:03:07,592 --> 03:03:08,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

673
03:03:09,855 --> 03:03:10,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Branley?

674
03:03:12,044 --> 03:03:14,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just have a question on number two.

675
03:03:14,646 --> 03:03:21,090
[SPEAKER_06]: If we eliminate the MCAS as the standard, then what are we using as a requirement for competency to graduate?

676
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:24,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So it moves to the district to define student competencies.

677
03:03:25,473 --> 03:03:26,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's our definition?

678
03:03:27,415 --> 03:03:32,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So the school committee does have graduation requirements outlined in the handbook.

679
03:03:32,598 --> 03:03:32,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

680
03:03:33,619 --> 03:03:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.

681
03:03:42,011 --> 03:03:42,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

682
03:03:43,391 --> 03:03:54,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, you know, I was talking to a friend who lives in Cambridge about this question, and it was interesting because she's a highly engaged voter, an attorney.

683
03:03:55,274 --> 03:03:57,955
[SPEAKER_15]: She had read the actual state packet.

684
03:03:58,635 --> 03:04:01,296
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a little booklet.

685
03:04:01,956 --> 03:04:03,857
[SPEAKER_15]: The booklet that comes out and explains it.

686
03:04:04,257 --> 03:04:08,258
[SPEAKER_15]: And she had read it, and her impression was that it removed the MCAS.

687
03:04:09,298 --> 03:04:09,418
[SPEAKER_15]: And

688
03:04:10,529 --> 03:04:15,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't received mine yet, so I haven't read it yet, so I don't know what the language is exactly, but I think it's such an important thing.

689
03:04:16,055 --> 03:04:19,038
[SPEAKER_15]: We, first of all, in Massachusetts, cannot end.

690
03:04:20,199 --> 03:04:25,925
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's not MCAS, it has to be something else, because the federal government requires that we do this testing.

691
03:04:26,386 --> 03:04:30,790
[SPEAKER_15]: The federal government does not require that it be a graduation requirement.

692
03:04:32,904 --> 03:04:35,865
[SPEAKER_15]: we could not, the state could not end MCAS.

693
03:04:36,546 --> 03:04:42,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they did, they just have to institute something new and give it a new name that would be MCAS.

694
03:04:43,329 --> 03:04:54,655
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think anybody who's afraid that we're going to stop being able to compare Medford to other districts, if that's something you want to do and you want this one test, you'll still be able to do that.

695
03:04:55,795 --> 03:04:58,216
[SPEAKER_15]: But it does mean, and you know, it's...

696
03:04:59,537 --> 03:05:24,789
[SPEAKER_15]: it's talked about as it's not a common thing but it does happen where students are excellent students they are engaged they get great grades but they are for whatever reason just incapable of passing this test they cannot get a diploma in this state which is insanity teachers assess their students all the time and if the

697
03:05:25,168 --> 03:05:30,694
[SPEAKER_15]: professionals with masters and PhDs think that this student is, is competent.

698
03:05:30,794 --> 03:05:41,044
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why that isn't good enough, rather than a test that was written by, frankly, not educators in, you know, some offices somewhere.

699
03:05:41,305 --> 03:05:43,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And why did Desi move?

700
03:05:44,468 --> 03:05:46,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know where, I don't know where they moved.

701
03:05:47,796 --> 03:05:51,323
[SPEAKER_15]: that they're the wrong people to determine that this person is ready for graduation.

702
03:05:52,185 --> 03:05:56,052
[SPEAKER_15]: And before that, before we had the MCAS requirements for graduation,

703
03:05:56,772 --> 03:06:01,493
[SPEAKER_15]: we were still at the top, Massachusetts as a whole, was still at the top for education.

704
03:06:01,553 --> 03:06:04,233
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like the MCAS made us number one.

705
03:06:04,253 --> 03:06:05,574
[SPEAKER_15]: We were number one before.

706
03:06:06,294 --> 03:06:18,656
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think the harm that the stress, the pressure, the teach to the test, all that other stuff, it's just negatively impacting education.

707
03:06:18,876 --> 03:06:20,096
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not exactly news.

708
03:06:20,896 --> 03:06:24,477
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm very supportive of getting rid of the MCAS requirement.

709
03:06:24,717 --> 03:06:24,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

710
03:06:26,650 --> 03:06:28,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Ruseau, Member Intapa.

711
03:06:30,121 --> 03:06:32,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor.

712
03:06:32,562 --> 03:06:35,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS.

713
03:06:36,543 --> 03:06:53,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation.

714
03:06:53,808 --> 03:06:58,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know,

715
03:06:59,844 --> 03:07:01,706
[SPEAKER_13]: due to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue.

716
03:07:01,886 --> 03:07:07,930
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that.

717
03:07:09,391 --> 03:07:20,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it.

718
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:22,862
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing.

719
03:07:24,443 --> 03:07:28,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened?

720
03:07:28,966 --> 03:07:29,967
[SPEAKER_13]: if we get rid of it.

721
03:07:30,307 --> 03:07:35,709
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go.

722
03:07:37,430 --> 03:07:40,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that.

723
03:07:40,651 --> 03:07:43,052
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, thank you.

724
03:07:43,992 --> 03:07:48,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there a motion to sever so we can- So I will motion to sever each question.

725
03:07:48,534 --> 03:07:48,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_10]: electronic pipes, I didn't realize there's so many things, or other similar products that rely on vaporization or aerosolization within the school buildings, school facilities, on school grounds or school buses or at school sponsored events by any individual, including school personnel is prohibited at all times.

813
03:11:21,356 --> 03:11:25,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Staff members who violate this policy will be referred to their immediate supervisor.

814
03:11:27,301 --> 03:11:29,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

815
03:11:29,402 --> 03:11:31,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some, I have a couple of questions.

816
03:11:31,263 --> 03:11:31,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

817
03:11:32,124 --> 03:11:38,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious what happened to the language about student use and signage from the original policy or what's online?

818
03:11:38,668 --> 03:11:40,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor?

819
03:11:41,930 --> 03:11:42,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, members.

820
03:11:43,051 --> 03:11:51,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually submitted two policies and the other one got dropped by accident because somebody thought it was the same policy.

821
03:11:51,976 --> 03:11:56,979
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the next agenda, there will be a different one, which is around use by students and staff.

822
03:11:59,244 --> 03:11:59,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

823
03:11:59,704 --> 03:12:04,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum.

824
03:12:04,445 --> 03:12:07,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well.

825
03:12:07,886 --> 03:12:18,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah.

826
03:12:19,569 --> 03:12:22,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine.

827
03:12:22,209 --> 03:12:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

828
03:12:23,710 --> 03:12:28,591
[SPEAKER_15]: So the amendment is to add to the listing of the products

829
03:12:31,103 --> 03:12:32,023
[SPEAKER_15]: to include, what is it?

830
03:12:32,743 --> 03:12:34,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicotine pouches.

831
03:12:35,764 --> 03:12:39,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that.

832
03:12:39,366 --> 03:12:44,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.

833
03:12:46,448 --> 03:12:47,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Edward-Vincent just mentioned that.

834
03:12:47,929 --> 03:12:49,390
[SPEAKER_10]: What about people that are prescribed?

835
03:12:49,650 --> 03:12:51,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's gum or patches.

836
03:12:51,510 --> 03:12:52,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Patches, so.

837
03:12:52,431 --> 03:12:53,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should.

838
03:12:53,571 --> 03:12:56,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Not patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.

839
03:12:57,313 --> 03:12:58,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

840
03:12:59,329 --> 03:13:01,390
[SPEAKER_16]: people are putting in their bottles.

841
03:13:01,630 --> 03:13:05,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have our assistant super chair saying yes.

842
03:13:07,493 --> 03:13:11,815
[SPEAKER_10]: So are we excluding that from the policy if people are prescribed and they're trying to quit?

843
03:13:12,936 --> 03:13:14,337
[SPEAKER_15]: They wouldn't be prescribed a pouch.

844
03:13:14,537 --> 03:13:16,078
[SPEAKER_10]: The pouches are included in the policy.

845
03:13:16,098 --> 03:13:19,219
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a recreational activity.

846
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:26,823
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're excluding anything that is prescribed by a doctor for those trying to quit, like patches and gum.

847
03:13:26,843 --> 03:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

848
03:13:29,571 --> 03:13:39,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, motion on the floor for approval as amended by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Branley.

849
03:13:40,561 --> 03:13:41,341
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

850
03:13:41,882 --> 03:13:42,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

851
03:13:42,422 --> 03:13:43,183

854
03:13:51,490 --> 03:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Consolidation language for facilities maintenance.

855
03:13:56,394 --> 03:14:06,220
[SPEAKER_10]: The city facilities director would support school facility needs by being a resource to the assistant superintendent for enrichment and innovation and the director of building and grounds.

856
03:14:07,040 --> 03:14:24,851
[SPEAKER_10]: The support that the city facilities director would provide to the school department would include creation of policies and procedures to ensure preventative maintenance tasks are completed promptly, establishing regular maintenance contracts that comply with procurement law for school facilities beginning January 1 or sooner, depending on funding and need,

857
03:14:25,580 --> 03:14:30,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Review the RFP for the new cleaning contracts at the McGlynn and Andrews and serve on the review and selection committee.

861

862
03:14:48,319 --> 03:14:54,024

863

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

865
03:15:04,845 --> 03:15:09,008
[SPEAKER_10]: From the chair, this is the vote that was taken in June for consolidation.

866
03:15:09,168 --> 03:15:15,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And at that time, the school committee wanted to make sure before we made any changes or consolidation, we came to you with language.

867
03:15:15,934 --> 03:15:17,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is something...

868
03:15:18,935 --> 03:15:36,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham helped me with as well, but drafted this up with her edits to try to move this forward, especially where if we do have an override that passes, some of that funding will be going to much-needed preventative maintenance, and it's going to take months to obtain those contracts and do it the right way.

869
03:15:37,323 --> 03:15:39,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And the MSBA project is also extremely important.

870
03:15:39,864 --> 03:15:41,225
[SPEAKER_10]: We get the right professionals on staff.

871
03:15:42,686 --> 03:15:43,586
