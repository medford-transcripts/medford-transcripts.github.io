00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Present, seven present, none absent.

2
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,916
[SPEAKER_14]: All please rise and salute our flag.

3
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:19,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

4
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:22,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of the minutes of the May 20, 2019 meeting.

5
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,733
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a motion for approval by Ms.

6
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,014
[SPEAKER_14]: DeRusso, seconded by Ms.

7
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:27,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

8
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,395
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

9
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:30,019
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

10
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

11
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds, and approval of perils.

12
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:35,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

13
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:36,424
[SPEAKER_14]: DiBenedetto.

14
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

15
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have a few questions.

16
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,330
[SPEAKER_13]: See?

17
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:45,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Mic tags.

18
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:46,493
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

19
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:53,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So on page 1 of 23, the second one from the bottom, Boston Public Schools for $2,222, guidance, contracted services,

20
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:00,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we contract with Boston Public Schools?

21
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:07,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and that is for the Department, and I can get you the breakdown of what that covered.

22
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that just seemed unusual to me.

23
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

24
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,476
[SPEAKER_13]: On page two, there's a few guys, sorry.

25
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:21,460
[SPEAKER_13]: On page two, about 10 up from the bottom, Groundmasters Corp, $5,025, building operators, I was just wondering,

26
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:30,204
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the maintenance of grounds for the schools.

27
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:34,206
[SPEAKER_11]: That's within the custodial building and grounds category.

28
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we outsource some of that work, the groundmaster?

29
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,310
[SPEAKER_13]: They are a contractor.

30
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, what kind of, do they do specific stuff that our in-house don't do any of the grounds?

31
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I see them up at the high school growing lawn.

32
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:51,477
[SPEAKER_11]: This would be significant landscaping and or providing loom and things of that sort.

33
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:52,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, gotcha.

34
00:10:53,359 --> 00:11:01,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Further down on that page, for $50,000 to Robert W. Arvine and Sons, contracted services.

35
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:02,905
[SPEAKER_13]: That just seemed like a lot.

36
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I'd ask.

37
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:11,330
[SPEAKER_11]: They are a state bid contractor for various electrical work that we have required throughout the buildings.

38
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, great.

39
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I just like to know different stuff.

40
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:15,352
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm nosy.

41
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,734
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, next page.

42
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Just about six or seven down.

43
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:26,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Fringe benefits from method retirement system.

44
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,159
[SPEAKER_13]: What are fringe benefits?

45
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,099
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of fringe?

46
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,502
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be city retirement allocation, and that's part of a grant requirement.

47
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

48
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:39,524
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's paid directly to city retirement.

49
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think I only have one more, Christine.

50
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,426
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's on page 9 of 23.

51
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:54,081
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the one I always ask you about, miscellaneous charges, but it looks like it's a lot of money for the high school.

52
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,644
[SPEAKER_13]: It says Medford High miscellaneous charges is $35,266.

53
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:57,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Student activities, the prom.

54
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:03,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm just curious.

55
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:08,746
[SPEAKER_13]: I just like to know what those big line sums are because I forget from time to time.

56
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion for approval on the floor?

57
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:12,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Ms.

58
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:13,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz, seconded by Ms.

59
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:14,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot.

60
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote, please.

61
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:17,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

62
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

63
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:28,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of secretary?

64
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:29,298
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

65
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:31,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Suspension of the rules.

66
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:32,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

67
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:36,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone would like to move for suspension of the rules to take papers out of order on the motion.

68
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:37,495
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

69
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:37,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

70
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:39,077
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

71
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:42,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion is granted and you'd like to take papers 2, 3, and 4 out of order.

72
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 2.

73
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:47,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Recognition of Medford High School Ethics Bowl Team.

74
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

75
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

76
00:12:56,602 --> 00:13:00,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I am joined tonight by Mr. Esner, who you met a few months ago as well.

77
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having us.

78
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:09,005
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know from my last presentation regarding the Ethics Bowl, they had an extremely successful year.

79
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:21,548
[SPEAKER_00]: They, on February 2nd at Tufts University, won the New England Regional High School Ethics Bowl competition, and that is where they outperformed in multiple rounds against many teams, such as

80
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Phillips Exeter, Phillips Andover, Lexington High.

81
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:31,628
[SPEAKER_00]: And from this win, they then participated in the semifinals, which was on February 24th.

82
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:34,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And they once again achieved great success.

83
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:40,875
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, that win led us to allow them to compete in the National Ethics Bowl.

84
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:46,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a wonderful experience at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in early April.

85
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:53,494
[SPEAKER_00]: The students learned a great deal at the event, and they worked very hard to compete among the best teams in the nation.

86
00:13:54,175 --> 00:14:07,227
[SPEAKER_00]: They were phenomenal, and I wanted to thank all of you, including the superintendent and all members of the school committee, and Mayor Burke for their generosity in supporting our students.

87
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:11,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a very special thank you to Mr. Esner for that.

88
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:21,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to thank the female chaperone that accompanied them, Ms.

89
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahoney, for giving up her time as well throughout those days.

90
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:25,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to her as well.

91
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, we want to honor them tonight, recognize them for all of their hard work and discipline.

92
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:38,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Esner is going to read the names.

93
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:44,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that how we want to do it?

94
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:50,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight is the senior barbecue, so we are missing some members through all these three papers.

95
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,697
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would like to invite whoever is here up to the side.

96
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,059
[SPEAKER_14]: They can all come up to the side and we'll call your names.

97
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.

98
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,456
[SPEAKER_20]: We have Maria Carmona.

99
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,744
[SPEAKER_20]: And Katie Stefani.

100
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:56,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Maida Mankakar, Drexel Osborne, Josh Cugno, and Shane Keddy.

101
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:11,178
[SPEAKER_20]: And those seniors that couldn't join us tonight were Julia Gelbach, and Brendan Mayer, and Jessica Taddeo.

102
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:12,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's it.

103
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:13,719
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's it.

104
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations.

105
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:22,802
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

106
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:23,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

107
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:23,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great to see you.

108
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:24,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

109
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:24,802
[SPEAKER_14]: You did a great job.

110
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:25,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

111
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:29,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful job.

112
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:00,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, job outstanding.

113
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:01,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Well done.

114
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:14,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up, we have the report on 2019 high school science and engineering fairs.

115
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Seery.

116
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:24,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening school committee members, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent.

117
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:34,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here to give you a quick update on our local fair, regional, state, and international science and engineering fair participants.

118
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:43,623
[SPEAKER_15]: First, very quickly, the local fair was held on April 11th, which is after the regional fair.

119
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,806
[SPEAKER_15]: The regional fair is held on March 9th.

120
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:53,155
[SPEAKER_15]: We decoupled those two events to make sure that kids had ample opportunity to prepare for projects at our local event.

121
00:17:54,336 --> 00:18:06,686
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time, we have students who do participate in the regional fair and they have to fill in a lot of paperwork and dedicate large spaces in their homes to conduct a lot of these science fair experiments.

122
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:15,973
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also provide some sort of one-on-one support to the students who are going to go to the regional before that event.

123
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:19,651
[SPEAKER_15]: and sort of vet their projects and then move them into that event.

124
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:29,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we do provide that sort of individualized attention on the project, the students did show some success at the regional fair.

125
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Four of the students who participated, all four moved on to the state fair.

126
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:42,808
[SPEAKER_15]: And then one of the students was selected to participate in the International Science and Engineering Fair.

127
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:50,395
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a really ambitious sort of project that these kids

128
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,511
[SPEAKER_15]: take on for themselves.

129
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:59,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And going through a science fair is a very individual event.

130
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:05,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it's a little different than being on a team than in this particular event.

131
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm very proud of the students.

132
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have one of the four.

133
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:12,284
[SPEAKER_15]: The others are at the barbecue this evening.

134
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:19,566
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Tufts University provides us with a tremendous amount of support for this.

135
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:30,608
[SPEAKER_15]: They come in and do a reverse science fair, and then they also come in and volunteer as judges for our local event, and also contribute at the regional event.

136
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:37,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are constant partners all the way through for our students and for the school.

137
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,771
[SPEAKER_15]: In particular, Karen O'Hagan, who has been

138
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:49,664
[SPEAKER_15]: in front of this board before has provided a tremendous amount of support for the science fair students and for the event overall.

139
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,945
[SPEAKER_15]: She's from Tufts University.

140
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:57,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this time, I'd like to call one of the students who did participate, Mr. Albert Farah.

141
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:05,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on up, Albert.

142
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,287
[SPEAKER_15]: This year Albert is a junior.

143
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:24,051
[SPEAKER_15]: He studied modeling mass flow distribution in a multi-stage rocket concept design.

144
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:32,177
[SPEAKER_15]: He placed second overall at the regional and then went to ISEF from there.

145
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:35,079
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in Phoenix for a week, about a couple of weeks ago.

146
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,301
[SPEAKER_15]: The event itself is a pretty amazing thing.

147
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:47,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love to say that Medford, in the last eight years, has gone to ISEF five times with three different students.

148
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:52,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Outstanding.

149
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:55,605
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a remarkable accomplishment by kids from Medford.

150
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:56,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Remarkable.

151
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:57,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

152
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:02,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, primarily.

153
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:15,927
[SPEAKER_15]: The other three participants were Morgan Simcoe, Subhesha Durali, who has been before this board for a number of times, and Sarah Elkendackley.

154
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,088
[SPEAKER_15]: All three are seniors.

155
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,509
[SPEAKER_15]: All three participated in the regional and the state.

156
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,471
[SPEAKER_15]: And that concludes my report for this evening.

157
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

158
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:28,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

159
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:30,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Albert.

160
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:33,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

161
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:34,056
[SPEAKER_14]: DiBenedetto.

162
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:34,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

163
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:36,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to congratulate Albert.

164
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known him for many years.

165
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:43,400
[SPEAKER_13]: His older sister was also wonderful in science, as was his older brother.

166
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We have seen them come before us for many, many years.

167
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:51,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And we still have one more year left to go, so I can't wait to see what that's going to be.

168
00:21:52,524 --> 00:22:01,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, I also want to comment on having those new science labs and opening up opportunities not only for our vocational students, but our

169
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:11,699
[SPEAKER_13]: high school students and bringing Tufts down and partnering with them and it really opens up so much for students in our community.

170
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:21,961
[SPEAKER_13]: I know myself as when my daughter was a junior, she was able to go to the Broad and work in the organic chemistry lab and that opened up doors for her actually through today.

171
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:27,923
[SPEAKER_13]: So Method has amazing programming and kids do wonderful work and

172
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:31,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but I see rocket science from Albert.

173
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I've always seen that.

174
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,695
[SPEAKER_13]: We've heard that tonight.

175
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:41,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait to see what he grows up and does for all of America and us in general.

176
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:50,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So our future is great because of students like that, and because of the educators who devote their lives and times to make sure our students have all those opportunities.

177
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you to them as well.

178
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:52,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

179
00:22:58,964 --> 00:22:59,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

180
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:05,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Recognition of Seal of Biliteracy, Velma Bebeau.

181
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

182
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening their school committee, good evening Mayor Burke, and good evening Superintendent Edouard-Vincent.

183
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:23,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for allowing me to be here tonight.

184
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:35,424
[SPEAKER_04]: For the second consecutive year, Medford High School has provided seniors with the opportunity to take the Actful Assessment of Performance Toward Proficiency in Languages test.

185

[SPEAKER_04]: This test recognizes qualifying students with the seal of biliteracy for those who demonstrate a high level of proficiency in both English and another language.

186
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: students must meet the state-approved proficiency level on the state-approved English and foreign language assessment.

187

194
00:25:57,544 --> 00:26:02,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge achievement for these students and for the district.

195
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:03,408
[SPEAKER_14]: In some cases, tri-literacy.

196
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:04,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

197
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:05,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.

198
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:05,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Very amazing.

199
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to them.

200
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

201
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, you're at the senior barbecue tonight.

202
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:20,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're at the senior barbecue, but I have the certificates, and I'll make sure that they receive it.

203
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:29,890
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'll allow me, I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge something extraordinary that happened to our department and thus to our district this year.

204
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:41,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Our student, Joseph Schmidt, has received this letter from the college board, and he brought it to our attention, or better, to be more precise, to the attention of his teacher, Ms.

205
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:42,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelida Nepore,

206
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: a Spanish teacher.

207
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:45,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

208
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big thing.

209
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the letter.

210
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very short.

211
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:56,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Joseph, I'm writing to share some exciting news.

212
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:08,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Your performance at the AP Spanish Language and Culture exam in May 2018 was so superior that it falls into a very select category.

213
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:20,667
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, advanced placement exams are scored on a scale of 1 to 5, where a 5 is equivalent to a grade of A in the corresponding college course.

214
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: you not only received the top score of five, but were one of only 100 students amounting to just 0.053 of 2008 Spanish language and culture exam takers from around the world to earn every point possible on this difficult examination.

215
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:57,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We applaud your hard work, diligence, and enthusiasm, and wish you many future successes.

216
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:58,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations once again.

217
00:27:58,526 --> 00:27:59,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness, that's fabulous.

218
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but I can't help myself that we have this treasure.

219
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

220
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:11,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness, what a wonderful speech.

221
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

222
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:15,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank Nelida Lepore, who does a phenomenal job teaching Spanish all levels.

223
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:27,428
[SPEAKER_06]: She is truly a gem and I enjoyed working with her as a colleague and on an interim basis right now as the interim director of the World Language Department.

224
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:31,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It also is a joy to work with Vilma B. Bowe.

225
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:38,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that she really took on the seal of biliteracy last year under the former director and this year officially.

226
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And she wanted to deliver the report and I absolutely supported that.

227
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:44,912
[SPEAKER_06]: She has done an absolutely fantastic job.

228
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say thank you.

229
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,849
[SPEAKER_06]: to both Vilma and Nelida.

230
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:49,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

231
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:53,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

232
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to mention one thing about Joseph.

233
00:28:55,572 --> 00:29:04,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only is he obviously quite talented in that arena, but also he received sports accolades the other evening last week at the M Club banquet.

234
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:10,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And he is working on our enslaved project this Saturday that will be dedicated in our old burial grounds at 10 o'clock.

235
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:14,179
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's a wonderful, outstanding student from Medford.

236
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:15,460
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations.

237
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Job well done.

238
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

239
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

240
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a lot of English Portuguese.

241
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:30,244
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't offer Portuguese as an AP class at Medford High, do we?

242
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:31,824
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my understanding.

243
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:34,905
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the beauty of the Seattle Methodist.

244
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the beauty of the Seattle Methodist that gives the opportunity to our heritage students to perform, to take this test.

245
00:29:48,070 --> 00:30:01,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I'm learning, this is my second year, as I'm learning more about the test, it is my goal to coach, to teach even students languages that we don't have, to teach how to take this test to give more opportunities to our seniors.

246
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:14,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to stay with the state standards, such as only seniors can take it up, but I think it's a nice beautiful crowning at the end of their high school career.

247
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I repeat that I love in particular about the SEAL because it does not stop on the languages that we're teaching, but it opens up to other heritage languages, which it gives, it's a social justice aspect that is very important in our culture today.

248
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:37,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And this beautiful district that is so multicultural and so diverse and needs to, we need to have something like this.

249
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:44,976
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Mayor Burke, that's what stood out to me because I knew we didn't have Portuguese as a class

250
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:46,658
[SPEAKER_13]: at MedFed High School.

251
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:57,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have a large population of Portuguese people moving into MedFed in that it might be an opportunity to add that.

252
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:14,775
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, just even maybe working with that ESL director to encourage more of our students that have been in the ESL program to initiate and to feel proud and strength and show them your native language

253
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:23,626
[SPEAKER_13]: you can still take that with you and not lose it while you're here and it can be celebrated through these exams.

254
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:26,668
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hoping to see more of that.

255
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:33,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, and I already collaborated with the ELA director as well as the LA director.

256
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:42,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be, all these stakeholders need to be on board in order to give, to promote the Seal of Valoracy, to implement the Seal of Valoracy.

257
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So they already are on board, and I participated last year and this year, but it would be my goal to

258
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:56,018
[SPEAKER_04]: teach the kids how better to take the exam.

259
00:31:56,058 --> 00:32:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, take your time, respond thoroughly to give them the opportunity to score higher to gain the seal.

260
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:06,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

261
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

262
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

263
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:08,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

264
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:15,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

265
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:20,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 5, recommendation to approve field trip, Dr. Bernadette Rigdelli and Marine Island.

266
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:24,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

267
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:29,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So good evening again.

268
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:32,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight, we have Marina Island.

269
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:35,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria is a French teacher at the high school.

270
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:43,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And she will be presenting her plan, her request, I should say, for a field trip to France in 2020.

271
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening, school committee.

272
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:48,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Ms.

273
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor and Ms.

274
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent.

275
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I'm here tonight to request an approval for our first ever

276
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:59,720
[SPEAKER_03]: a trip to Paris, France.

277
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you all have a packet, which includes the itinerary, which is Paris and Provence and Nice and Versailles.

278
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:16,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will take place, we're hoping this will take place next April vacation.

279
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We fly out on Friday and then we return on Sunday.

280
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So we won't be missing any school days.

281
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:24,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The flight is late Friday evening.

282
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no school days that we would miss.

283
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:31,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great, it's very aligned to the curriculum.

284
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:36,977
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have almost 40% of the students are French students.

285
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, we talk about the castles in the Loire Valley, and we're actually going to go there.

286
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: A good thing with this program that we're using, Travel Design Italy, which is the same tour guide that we use for the Italy trips, we actually were able to customize our trip, which is fantastic, as we told them.

287
00:33:57,448 --> 00:34:02,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We do castles, so can we go to Loire Valley, because after all, that would be wonderful to see that.

288
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's on the itinerary.

289
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:10,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 39 students all signed up with their deposits down, ready to go.

290
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: 35 are going to be seniors.

291
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, two sophomores and two juniors.

292
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be a very nice senior trip other than the other two.

293
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some additions here.

294
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, 40% is French.

295
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave you a list of all the students there.

296
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:34,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?

297
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:37,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any questions from the body?

298
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:42,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto, can you just clarify the total cost of the trip?

299
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Insurance, I want to make sure you understand that insurance is not an option.

300
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:48,625
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to be included in the price.

301
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,450
[SPEAKER_13]: We made that motion many years ago when we had to cancel a trip abruptly.

302
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:54,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, yes.

303
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:59,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the good thing with using the same company that we use for Italy, he has it down-packed.

304
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a routine going, he knows exactly what needs to be included.

305
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:13,355
[SPEAKER_03]: The chaperones are six to, I'm sorry, one to six, one chaperone to six students, which is fantastic.

306
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:18,059
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a Montreal, Quebec city two years ago, and it was 10 to one.

307
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: which was a lot.

308
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:25,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to that one too, and I've gone to the Italy one, and the 6 to 1 is way better, a lot better.

309
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more in control, and that's what he does.

310
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, right now the price is $2,100, including insurance, which is not an option.

311
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:36,242
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to

312
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:37,557
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for that.

313
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:38,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So the full price is $2,100.

314
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've all put down $200 deposit.

315
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:52,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Once this gets approved, I do want to have a meeting next week, like maybe one of the final days, maybe Tuesday night, Wednesday night.

316
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:53,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a letter at the back there.

317
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:59,348
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that because I would like to meet the parents and just tell them how things are going to run.

318
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:04,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So the $2,100 is for the ground tours and the hotels and all of that.

319
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:05,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And the flight.

320
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:07,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that include the flight?

321
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,670
[SPEAKER_13]: It includes the flight.

322
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:08,670
$2,100.

323
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

324
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

325
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's for everything.

326
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And how are chaperones chosen?

327
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Chaperones are chosen by experience.

328
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about three or four that have gone on these trips on a regular basis.

329
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,096
[SPEAKER_13]: And then... How much do chaperones pay?

330
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:31,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do they go free?

331
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,417
[SPEAKER_03]: They go free.

332
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:33,778
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working.

333
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:34,958
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working, yes.

334
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:37,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm just curious.

335
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,000
[SPEAKER_06]: They are on.

336
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,302
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of responsibility, so it's built into the price.

337
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:43,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ms.

338
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:47,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Nyland is working to select the chaperones.

339
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it to be balanced.

340
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: We want male and female.

341
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:53,167
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to have chaperones with experience.

342
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:55,492
[SPEAKER_13]: In the language as well, right?

343
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:55,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

344
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:56,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, correct.

345
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:58,136
[SPEAKER_03]: In the language as well.

346
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:01,261
[SPEAKER_03]: To get around, absolutely.

347
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:08,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself speak French, and then there's one more chaperone who also speaks French, but the other ones don't.

348
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:11,076
[SPEAKER_03]: but at least some of us do, right?

349
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:14,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I do wanna, I'm sorry, the total price is $3,000.

350
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:21,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 31, and because we have a high number, it went down $100, so we're at $3,000.

351
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:35,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Air, land, insurance, meals, right there, on the itinerary, you've got eight nights, five dinners, two luncheons, entrance fees, admissions, so basically, all the students bring is spending money.

352
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:36,271
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they bring.

353
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

354
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:51,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, by the way, I love these trips for students in these opportunities I do also one of the things that the school committee worried about previously Is that the list would be given to the school nurse to find out whether there is any special?

355
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:53,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So the school nurse has been consulted.

356
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:57,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have the original.

357
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,670
[SPEAKER_03]: She did sign my copy.

358
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:02,613
[SPEAKER_03]: She signed it after your copies were made.

359
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:03,314
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

360
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

361
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:05,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I second it.

362
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,959
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion seconded by Mr. Gero.

363
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote, please.

364
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:10,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

365
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:16,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

366
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:16,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

367
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,551
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

368
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

369
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

370
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:21,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

371
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

372
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a great trip.

373
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:29,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And one final item while we're under suspension, item 7, recommendation to appoint Dr. Peter Cushing to position of assistant superintendent.

374
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:31,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Edouard Vincent, please.

375
00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:33,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, good evening.

376
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing, can you come forward, please?

377
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:45,194
[SPEAKER_18]: This evening I present to you my recommendation to appoint Dr. Peter Cushing to the position of assistant superintendent.

378
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:54,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Upon the conclusion of an extensive leadership search, it is the administration's recommendation to offer the position of assistant superintendent

379
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,275
[SPEAKER_18]: to Dr. Peter J. Cushing.

380
00:38:57,116 --> 00:39:02,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing began his teaching career as a long-term substitute in the Lynn Public Schools.

381
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:14,156
[SPEAKER_18]: During his tenure, he had a myriad of experiences, including teaching history and serving students in the Alternative Education Program for transition back to the comprehensive high schools.

382
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:25,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing earned his master's degree in educational leadership from Boston College at the Lynch School of Education, where he served as a supervisor for student teachers.

383
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:32,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing continued his educational track by earning a doctorate from Boston College as well.

384
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:43,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing's experience includes teaching in Arlington Public Schools, serving as vice principal and then principal at Narragansett Regional Middle School.

385
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:52,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Under Dr. Cushing's strong leadership, he led Narragansett Regional Middle School to level one status under the previous accountability system.

386
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:59,490
[SPEAKER_18]: He is currently serving in Webster Public Schools as principal of Bartlett High School, a turnaround school.

387
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:19,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Cushing's educational passions include focusing on issues of equity for students in economically disadvantaged subgroups, building school pride, academic professional development, collaborative leadership, and fostering strong and positive relationships among all stakeholders.

388
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:25,542
[SPEAKER_18]: His diverse educational experiences and successes will benefit Medford Public Schools.

389
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:28,865
[SPEAKER_18]: It is with great excitement that I recommend the approval

390
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:33,065
[SPEAKER_18]: for Dr. Cushing's appointment to the position of assistant superintendent.

391
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:36,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Cushing, would you like to say a few words?

392
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:44,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say how humbled I am for this great opportunity to work with a great team and to be part of an amazing district.

393
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:50,418
[SPEAKER_17]: And in many respects, to come home to the north of Boston region and to be a part of

394
00:40:51,078 --> 00:41:07,345
[SPEAKER_17]: just the amazing things that I've heard tonight, the amazing things that people have done with the Ethics Bowl and with the science fairs, and by putting together a trip that is $1,200 or so less than a trip that was just approved at my high school, which is really phenomenal.

395
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:10,466
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, what tour company is that?

396
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:16,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it's really awesome, and I'm so very excited to be a part of this community, and I really look forward to

397
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:24,194
[SPEAKER_17]: serving humbly and learning about MedFed and becoming a Mustang through and through.

398
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:25,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

399
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:25,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

400
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

401
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:28,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

402
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

403
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to say welcome to MedFed.

404
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the opportunity of meeting you at a subcommittee meeting for personnel.

405
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I enjoyed meeting you.

406
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:44,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that your talents will be greatly used here in MedFed and welcome.

407
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I motion to approve.

408
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:51,411
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of the recommendation, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

409
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:56,474
[SPEAKER_14]: You had an outstanding interview last week.

410
00:41:56,534 --> 00:42:00,977
[SPEAKER_14]: We were very impressed with you, not only your credentials, but how you conducted yourself before us.

411
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:05,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are thrilled that Dr. Marisa Edward-Vincent has recommended you.

412
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,081
[SPEAKER_14]: So we wish you the very best.

413
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:07,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

414
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:13,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the vote.

415
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:13,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

416
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone, please call the roll, Madam Secretary.

417
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:23,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

418
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:24,964
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

419
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:25,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

420
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:26,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

421
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

422
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostone, seconded by Ms.

423
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:34,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

424
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:35,113
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

425
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:35,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

426
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:36,735
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

427
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:37,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

428
00:42:38,296 --> 00:42:39,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of committees.

429
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:41,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Support Service Subcommittee.

430
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:41,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo.

431
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:41,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

432
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:55,489
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Support Services Subcommittee has met a few times over the last, well, it's been almost a year, to update our medication administration policy.

433
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:05,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's been a substantial number of changes that I really can't get into because I don't have the old policy in front of me.

434
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:08,677
[SPEAKER_16]: But this new policy,

435
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:21,489
[SPEAKER_16]: is better organized, and I think better reflects what we have actually been doing here in Medford, and closes a couple of concerns that there might have been around parental notification.

436
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,452
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there aren't any questions, I'd like to move the motion.

437
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:26,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

438
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:28,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept the report by Ms.

439
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:29,995

[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

441
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:31,576
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

442
00:43:31,936 --> 00:43:32,016
Aye.

443
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:33,257
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

444
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:34,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

445
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:35,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

446
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Rules Subcommittee, Ms.

447
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:38,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

448
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Rules Subcommittee meeting last Thursday, and the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Medford Schools Meals Charge Policy, just minor modifications.

449
00:43:54,246 --> 00:44:00,928
[SPEAKER_02]: The language in the policy was changed consistently throughout the document, so now in the document you will see

450
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: food services everywhere throughout the document.

451
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,935
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also one other minor change.

452
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:17,439
[SPEAKER_02]: The last sentence on the original policy under paragraph three was removed because it conflicts with one of the sentences in paragraph one.

453
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just simply removed.

454
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:27,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And if everybody agrees and doesn't have any questions, we can, motion, okay.

455
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:31,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to adopt the changes in the policy.

456
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:31,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

457
00:44:31,696 --> 00:44:32,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone?

458
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:32,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

459
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:34,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Ms.

460
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:34,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

461
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:35,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto?

462
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:46,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke, I love our food policy and how we make sure that when kids are in line, they're not stigmatized if they don't have money and that we're going to continue to give them a lunch.

463
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:56,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't want, I know they can't take other items, they can just take a general lunch and like money isn't discussed.

464
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,232
[SPEAKER_13]: at that point when their friends are in line.

465
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:01,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to reiterate that we do that.

466
00:45:02,635 --> 00:45:03,816
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very important point.

467
00:45:04,296 --> 00:45:17,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I also wanted to talk, actually a community member texted me this morning with an offer to help us write a grant for $10,000 per school for Breakfast After the Bell.

468
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:24,493
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would like to connect that person to our superintendent

469
00:45:25,193 --> 00:45:27,294
[SPEAKER_13]: and our superintendent in charge of finance.

470
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:36,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And see, I know we have it on the books to look into, Breakfast for All, but this is one particular program called Breakfast After the Bell.

471
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:44,403
[SPEAKER_13]: This community member runs a group that will provide you someone to help you write the grant.

472
00:45:44,773 --> 00:45:47,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's 10,000 per school, not per district.

473
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:49,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So every school in the district.

474
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:55,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would love to see it all the way from kindergarten through our 12th graders, because our high school students are hungry as well.

475
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:57,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to just keep that in mind.

476
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll provide the information.

477
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:07,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I would love to see if we can get a grant to help us get underway with that initiative.

478
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:10,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I know two of our schools get breakfast now.

479
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:17,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to see every student have breakfast and have a successful day, because they're not walking into a classroom hungry.

480
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So just those two comments, and thank you for the report.

481
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:22,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

482
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:29,759
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to adopt the changes to the policy as offered by the chair of the Rules Committee, roll call vote, please.

483
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:29,939

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

497
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:39,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

498
00:46:39,544 --> 00:46:40,384
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

499
00:46:40,404 --> 00:46:41,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Community participation.

500
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:44,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing, seeing none.

501
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:47,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of the superintendent.

00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:49,467
[SPEAKER_14]: The superintendent's updates and comments.

503
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:50,407

504
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:54,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

505
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,109
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a fantastic weekend, I can say.

506
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Action-packed weekend.

507
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,731

[SPEAKER_18]: And it was a lot of fun to be had by all who were able to attend.

512
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,003
[SPEAKER_18]: The weather really turned out beautifully.

513
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:30,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, yesterday we celebrated Medford Day over at the Andrews Field, which was another wonderful opportunity to see us all together.

514
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:32,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone came out.

515
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:37,526
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, it just reminds me of one Medford and one beautiful

00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,014
[SPEAKER_18]: district city that we are in.

517
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:45,297
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to share that tomorrow there are a lot of activities.

518
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:59,005
[SPEAKER_18]: This is our final official school committee meeting before the close of school because this year Old Man Winter was very cooperative and so the last day of school is Thursday, June 13th.

519
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:04,548
[SPEAKER_18]: So although we have a meeting scheduled for the 17th, school is not officially in session.

520
00:48:04,953 --> 00:48:09,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to give the listening audience and those of you here some of the things that are coming up.

527
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:13,172
[SPEAKER_18]: So Tristan did compete, mostly against seniors, so this is quite an accomplishment because we still have him.

528

545
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:15,764
[SPEAKER_18]: during National EMS Week.

[SPEAKER_18]: We had 15 students along with their teachers, nurses Linda Trofimbo and Sandra Savini.

547
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:29,893
[SPEAKER_18]: They were able to attend this workshop and learn about the importance of the immediate use of tourniquets.

548
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,876
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, students were able to review the steps for CPR

549
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:42,019
[SPEAKER_18]: and AED, as well as learning how to choke save infants or adults that are choking.

550
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:55,764
[SPEAKER_18]: The paramedics showed them how to intubate a patient using a special instrument called a laryngoscope, and we are appreciative of Armstrong's strong partnership with Medford Public Schools.

551
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:04,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, the past few weeks, we opened our new Mustang Mall, which is located in the lobby of our high school.

552
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:28,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to recognize that today, earlier today, we had the unveiling of an additional 3D, three-dimensional sidewalk at the Roberts Elementary School, so similar to the Brooks, and so I'm thankful to the mayor's office and the teams that put that together.

00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:38,277
[SPEAKER_18]: to put the 3D sidewalk and there was a lot of positive media coverage and hopefully we'll be able to grow it to all of our schools.

[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to recognize, I didn't have a chance to thank our newly, Marie Cassidy received her honorary doctorate from Tufts University and so I have to stop calling her Dr. Cassidy yet.

00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:11,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

577
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:13,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for being patient.

578
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:19,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Melanie McLaughlin, and I am from Austin Street in Medford.

579
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:22,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Tanya Sullivan, and I'm from Brackett Street in Medford.

580
00:56:23,315 --> 00:56:25,616
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are the co-chairs for the Medford CPAC.

581
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:31,857
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for letting us present to you annually what we accomplish throughout the year.

582
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:35,579
[SPEAKER_12]: So CPAC is the Special Education Parent Advisory Council for Medford.

583
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:40,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And our logo is where everyone belongs.

584
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:51,050
[SPEAKER_12]: We are happy to have been of service to the 888 or so families that are receiving special education services and supports in Medford.

585
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:58,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of you folks know that the CPAC is required under the Massachusetts General Law.

586
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:02,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So every school district is required to have a special education parent advisory council.

587
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:07,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And our role is to advise the district on matters pertaining to special education.

588
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,700
[SPEAKER_12]: services and programs, and safety of individuals with disabilities.

589
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:18,282
[SPEAKER_12]: We look for input from parents, guardians, family members, and we meet regularly with school officials.

590
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:25,185
[SPEAKER_12]: We participate in the planning of programming and the evaluation process of the special education programming as well.

591
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:28,987
[SPEAKER_12]: We plan workshops and seminars for families and community engagement.

592
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:33,669
[SPEAKER_12]: We field lots of phone calls from parents as they're navigating the special education system.

593
00:57:34,649 --> 00:57:36,490
[SPEAKER_12]: We host family-friendly events and

594
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:41,719
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really been a joy to serve the community for the past several years.

595
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Our board members are myself and Tanya Sullivan.

596
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Treasurer is Jameel Webb Davis, who's with us tonight.

597
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:50,401
[SPEAKER_12]: And our secretary is Anne Russo.

598
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,282
[SPEAKER_12]: We have lots of people who help out with the Medford CPAC.

599
00:57:53,322 --> 00:58:06,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And for folks that are watching tonight, we want to say thank you all for all your help and participation in coming to our seminars and workshops over the years, and for being there to not only support the CPAC, but to support each other, because we're stronger as a community together.

600
00:58:07,995 --> 00:58:09,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

601
00:58:09,096 --> 00:58:17,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Membership includes students and families who have IEPs or 504 plans and other interested parties.

602
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,903
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we say where everyone belongs, it's where everyone belongs.

603
00:58:21,963 --> 00:58:26,205
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're all included to attend and be part of, and we welcome.

604
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:31,068
[SPEAKER_12]: My apologies for the little alignment here.

605
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:33,970
[SPEAKER_12]: We uploaded to Google Drive just a few minutes ago.

606
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily, for your help with that.

607
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:48,090
[SPEAKER_12]: So our goals, we advocate for every child in our community, and we promote equity in our schools for all children, regardless of race, color, ability, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, or race.

608
00:58:49,191 --> 00:59:04,804
[SPEAKER_12]: We really want to provide mentorship, support, resources, and expertise to families and community members on issues of inclusion and exclusion, and offer equality of opportunity, civil and human rights, and legislative advocacy, especially on behalf of our marginalized children.

609
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,754
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk about equality of opportunity, a lot of people might not know what that means.

610
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:12,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And essentially, we don't believe that every child should get the same.

611
00:59:12,997 --> 00:59:14,879
[SPEAKER_12]: We believe that every child should get what they need.

612
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:16,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Next.

613
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we actually updated this a little bit.

614
00:59:21,403 --> 00:59:23,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy Medaglio just gave us a little bit of an update.

615
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:28,288
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the beginning of the year, we had 770 students on IEPs.

616
00:59:28,408 --> 00:59:31,710
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually gone up over the year because of new enrollments, what have you.

617
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,811
[SPEAKER_12]: We're roughly at about 888 right now.

618
00:59:34,716 --> 00:59:36,798
[SPEAKER_12]: But the percentages are roughly the same.

619
00:59:36,878 --> 00:59:39,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So 18.8% of our student population.

620
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,424
[SPEAKER_12]: So almost 20% of our students are receiving special education supports and services.

621
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:49,108
[SPEAKER_12]: We have actually about 32 out of district.

622
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:55,273
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit higher than the state average, but Kathy can talk a little bit about that as well if folks are interested.

623
00:59:55,333 --> 01:00:01,878
[SPEAKER_12]: But out of district families are folks who are placed in other outside schools for varying reasons.

624
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:03,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of our goals for the upcoming year

625
01:00:04,787 --> 01:00:07,288
[SPEAKER_12]: help those families feel more involved and part of our community.

626
01:00:07,868 --> 01:00:13,909
[SPEAKER_12]: I think our out-of-district families especially need to feel that they're a part of a community when they're not in our schools.

627
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:24,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lower full inclusion rate than the state, but we have a higher partial inclusion rate in our special education classrooms, and we have a lower subseparate rate.

628
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:29,974
[SPEAKER_12]: So the difference between those, our full inclusion is 80 percent or more in general education setting.

629
01:00:30,814 --> 01:00:32,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Partial inclusion is between 79 and 40 percent, so that's a

630
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:37,664
[SPEAKER_12]: wide range for partial inclusion.

631
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:43,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And then subseparate would be 40% or less time spent in general education.

632
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:48,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of our accomplishments for the past year is we host multiple seminars.

633
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,510
[SPEAKER_12]: We meet the second Wednesday of every month.

634
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:58,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Principal Downs has been so generous in offering the Andrews Middle School to us every month, as Paul DeLeva did before.

635
01:00:58,193 --> 01:01:00,414
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're so happy to have that venue.

636
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:02,495
[SPEAKER_12]: They've always been so welcoming to us.

637
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:07,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Second Wednesday of every month from 7 to 9 we meet, and we host workshops.

638
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:17,835
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we had workshops on anxiety in schools, dyslexia, ELL, disability rights as human rights, executive functioning, and we've also hosted coffee with the principals.

639
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:29,102
[SPEAKER_12]: We should note for the anxiety, dyslexia, and ELL presentations, we've worked with administration and our central administration to bring in speakers from our schools.

640
01:01:29,162 --> 01:01:30,703
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've had our ELL director,

641
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:32,965
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had guidance Councilors come in.

642
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:41,290
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a really nice collaboration between families and administration and teachers working together to help our families across the district.

643
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:48,614
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also presented workshops at Bridgewater State, the Mass Down Syndrome Congress, and Federation for Children with Special Needs.

644
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:58,580
[SPEAKER_12]: We helped create and participated in a universal design for emergency preparedness safety in our school subcommittee with national recognition of our efforts featured on NPR.

645
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,821
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a link to that that we're happy to share.

646
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:02,916
[SPEAKER_12]: The NPR recognition was really nice.

647
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:19,661
[SPEAKER_12]: We've worked really hard on that committee over the past year, and we've had about seven committee members, again, administrators, parents, a number of folks looking at safety in our schools and how we think about emergency preparedness for all our students using universal design.

648
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:26,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So essentially the idea that if you design something for everyone with everyone in mind, then everyone will benefit.

649
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:33,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And so our safety in schools, you know that we did a presentation to you folks last month on that, and we're going to continue that committee.

650
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:38,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been very effective, and we've really enjoyed working on that as well.

651
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:39,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Next page.

652
01:02:42,184 --> 01:02:45,845
[SPEAKER_12]: We also helped launch and participated in a special education subcommittee this year.

653
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:48,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the subcommittee members here, the school committee.

654
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:53,927
[SPEAKER_12]: We really appreciated that happening, and we've been focusing on disability awareness and out-of-school time.

655
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:57,684
[SPEAKER_12]: including after school and recreational program for students with disabilities.

656
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:18,517
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, we spent the year meeting with school committee members and administrators and folks from community stakeholders, talking about how we can improve access to our after school and recreational program for students with disabilities, for all students really, and also how we could improve disability awareness.

657
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:23,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the things that came out of that that's been really great is the Director of Speech and Language

658
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:27,205
[SPEAKER_12]: along with others, created a disability awareness course in the district.

659
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:32,287
[SPEAKER_12]: And about, I think, 44 teachers and staff enrolled in that disability course.

660
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:37,610
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had the pleasure of presenting at the first course on disability rights as human rights.

661
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:39,751
[SPEAKER_12]: The class was really well received.

662
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:51,257
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just really nice to see people asking questions and really understanding what disability awareness is and how disability is another aspect of diversity, and having disability pride and celebrating that.

663
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:58,287
[SPEAKER_12]: They also had a panel where they included siblings and family members and a self-advocate.

664
01:03:58,667 --> 01:03:59,708
[SPEAKER_12]: The course was wonderful.

665
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:01,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume that they're going to teach it again next year.

666
01:04:01,748 --> 01:04:03,289
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really well received.

667
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:07,751
[SPEAKER_12]: They're talking about also maybe people were asking for a 2.0, so that was exciting.

668
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:17,094
[SPEAKER_12]: We partnered with community organizations for family outreach, including the West Medford Community Center, Medford Family Network, community schools, and CCSR.

669
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:21,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you can skip that.

670
01:04:21,944 --> 01:04:22,665
[SPEAKER_12]: That's repeat.

671
01:04:23,045 --> 01:04:24,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And then our recommendations for the year.

672
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:26,887
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have just about five recommendations.

673
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:38,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that was really effective about the subcommittee, special education subcommittee this year was we felt like we focused on two issues and we could really move those issues forward when we can focus on just a few.

674
01:04:39,415 --> 01:04:48,040
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're respectfully asking the school committee, the mayor, the superintendent to look at these five topics and think about how we can move these

675
01:04:48,547 --> 01:04:53,888
[SPEAKER_12]: forward, even if we pick a few of them over the next year to work on so that we can see some progress.

676
01:04:54,908 --> 01:05:00,450
[SPEAKER_12]: One is that we would recommend creating a district-wide survey slash inclusion report.

677
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:12,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we're recommending for this is that we survey general education teachers, special education, paraprofessional, administrators, and families on the current culture in our schools for inclusive practice and what improvements are needed.

678
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:14,833
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd also obviously like to hear what's working.

679
01:05:15,867 --> 01:05:25,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can continue to improve, to continue to implement that, but also to think about what we can do to move things forward for more inclusion for every student.

680
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:35,984
[SPEAKER_12]: We also would like to recommend offering professional, meaningful professional development on differentiated instruction and supplemental curriculum for teachers, paraprofessionals, and families in partnership with the CPAC.

681
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:39,507
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the reasons we talk about that specifically in partnership with the CPAC

682
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:49,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a very personal experience where we didn't understand until I think third grade or the end of third grade that there's actually a supplement to our curriculum for students with disabilities.

683
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:56,290
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we found that out through the ELL department because we understood that there's a supplement for English language learners.

684
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:03,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we were able to explore a little bit more and understand that you folks had voted on a supplement for special education, which was really wonderful.

685
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:07,935
[SPEAKER_12]: So I felt like if I didn't know that, that there's probably a lot of folks out there that don't know that.

686
01:06:09,085 --> 01:06:14,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we want to make sure that folks do know that and that that's a real stepping stone for differentiated instruction for everyone in the community.

687
01:06:15,808 --> 01:06:22,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the professional development would be around how to use that supplemental curriculum and how to, you know, show parents what that is and how they can use that at home as well.

688
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:27,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We would also recommend implementing a co-teaching model at the elementary level.

689
01:06:27,806 --> 01:06:30,688
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that there's some co-teaching at the elementary level.

690
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:38,031
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not systemized and sort of, yeah, systemized, I guess, as it is at the high school level.

691
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:49,677
[SPEAKER_12]: And we think it's been a really good model, and we know that it's a proven effective model for being able to work in general education settings for students with and without disabilities to be effective in teaching all of our children.

692
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:54,868
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a low-hanging fruit, if you will.

693
01:06:54,948 --> 01:07:02,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Replace and create consistent language for school missions, websites, school-to-home forms, et cetera, to be inclusive.

694
01:07:03,013 --> 01:07:09,156
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one of the things that we talked about at the subcommittee for the school committee as well, is just how are we looking at our language across the district?

695
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:14,539
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did a preliminary study, nothing sort of expansive, but we just started to poke around on our websites.

696
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:17,514
[SPEAKER_12]: look for the language on each of the school websites.

697
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of the schools had school improvement plans.

698
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:20,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Some didn't.

699
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:21,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Some had missions.

700
01:07:21,975 --> 01:07:23,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Most all of them had missions, I believe.

701
01:07:24,116 --> 01:07:28,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Not all of them mentioned inclusion or equity or students with disabilities.

702
01:07:28,956 --> 01:07:36,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And we just think that it would be nice to have a language that would be inclusive, because we know that Medford is an inclusive community and wants everybody to feel welcome.

703
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:37,338
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are one Medford.

704
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:43,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And just thinking about how we're thinking about our messaging of that, if you think about the four frames of Bowman and Diehl,

705
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,168
[SPEAKER_12]: and the symbolic frame, how we're messaging that across the district.

706
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Publishing school improvement plans on all school websites.

707
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So like I said, there was just probably one or two that didn't have the school improvement plans.

708
01:07:54,493 --> 01:08:02,598
[SPEAKER_12]: And seeing them are really helpful, but also seeing what the plans are for almost 20% of students with disabilities in the schools would be really helpful.

709
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:08,502
[SPEAKER_12]: And then expand inclusive communities for children with and without disabilities.

710
01:08:09,063 --> 01:08:12,405
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would recommend providing training for inclusive community schools.

711
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,301
[SPEAKER_12]: athletic and after school program.

712
01:08:14,641 --> 01:08:19,164
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the things that we worked on in the subcommittee was the after school and out of school time.

713
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:23,167
[SPEAKER_12]: And we talked about some of the language and making some of that language more uniform.

714
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:27,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's going to be a training provided for the summer fun camp and the Councilors there.

715
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,331
[SPEAKER_12]: We think that's a really great first start.

716
01:08:29,351 --> 01:08:38,997
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to expand on that to make sure that our community school programs, athletic programs, recreation programs, what have you, all have experience in working

717
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:41,598
[SPEAKER_12]: and embracing children with disabilities.

718
01:08:42,058 --> 01:08:44,560
[SPEAKER_12]: An example of that is we were in the swim program this year.

719
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:50,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was interesting for me to see there was a little bit of disconnect in the swim program.

720
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:54,885
[SPEAKER_12]: And we went, I think, to the second or third swim lesson.

721
01:08:55,065 --> 01:09:08,993
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just occurred to me that nobody had ever taught the swim instructor in the pool with our daughter just something really basic, which is just, first of all, it might be difficult to hear because of the acoustic, especially if the child has a hearing deficiency.

722
01:09:09,343 --> 01:09:11,465
[SPEAKER_12]: but the acoustics in the pool can be really hard to hear.

723
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:20,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So sometimes just, you know, motioning or, you know, saying swim or, you know, so using some, you know, basic sign language can be really helpful, but also just the first then.

724
01:09:21,273 --> 01:09:28,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Like first you're going to swim, then we're going to jump or whatever, just some basic, you know, and it was really, it wasn't fair.

725
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:37,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I realized in that setting that it wasn't fair to the person that was in the pool, nor was it fair to the child just to not have that basic communication that we as parents

726
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:39,145
[SPEAKER_12]: just sort of take for granted.

727
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:43,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe some of the administration takes for granted, too, because they're so used to doing that with our children.

728
01:09:43,907 --> 01:09:45,387
[SPEAKER_12]: So just some basic training.

729
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:49,349
[SPEAKER_12]: We would love to see a Best Buddies program within our district.

730
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:55,971
[SPEAKER_12]: We used to have one at the McGlynn Middle School, or a Best Buddies-like program, if the Best Buddies program is too expensive.

731
01:09:56,031 --> 01:10:01,132
[SPEAKER_12]: But we could potentially create a friendship program, a mentoring program.

732
01:10:01,172 --> 01:10:03,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of these recommendations, we want to assure you,

733
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,312
[SPEAKER_12]: We're ready to roll up our sleeves and work with you on these.

734
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:08,233
[SPEAKER_12]: These are nothing that we're asking other people to do.

735
01:10:08,313 --> 01:10:18,220
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to work with you to make them happen and offer written guidelines on requirements of ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and building inclusive communities.

736
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:30,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So in some experiences, our families have inadvertently, mostly because it's just people who maybe don't experience life with disabilities themselves and just don't understand that

737
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:49,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Accessibility is an important part of our community, but also it is part of the law and helping people understand what the Americans with Disabilities Act is, even if it's just in basic, you know, writing that, you know, folks need to provide reasonable accommodations when children are accessing programs within the district.

738
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:54,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, of course, we want to know how we can help and what next steps can be taken.

739
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:58,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And for folks who want to know what that sign is, that's the sign for I love you.

740
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:07,183
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my daughter, and she has a t-shirt on it that says, keep calm, it's only an extra chromosome.

741
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:12,406
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want to know how we can help, and we'd be happy to take any questions if anyone has any.

742
01:11:15,589 --> 01:11:16,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Ruggiero.

743
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:17,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

744
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much for this presentation.

745
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:23,714
[SPEAKER_19]: I did have a question on page three of the handout.

746
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:30,284
[SPEAKER_19]: You mentioned our lower full inclusion rate and lower subseparate rate as compared to the state.

747
01:11:31,364 --> 01:11:33,665
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you tell me what the state average is and where we compare?

748
01:11:34,365 --> 01:11:36,626
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have them with me, but I can certainly get them to you.

749
01:11:36,786 --> 01:11:37,246
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

750
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:39,646
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are, you know, they're right on the DESE website.

751
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:40,867
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you do school district profiles.

752
01:11:40,907 --> 01:11:41,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I checked.

753
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:43,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I missed it in the wrong place.

754
01:11:43,487 --> 01:11:44,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't find it.

755
01:11:44,248 --> 01:11:45,848
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll look for it again.

756
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:46,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, I can email it to you.

757
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:47,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

758
01:11:47,568 --> 01:11:49,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure we can have it our way.

759
01:11:49,069 --> 01:11:51,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we talking like a huge difference or small difference?

760
01:11:52,089 --> 01:11:53,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Small difference for the

761
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:56,110
[SPEAKER_12]: higher for partial inclusion.

762
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,590
[SPEAKER_12]: We're very high for the partial inclusion.

763
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:07,395
[SPEAKER_12]: For the full inclusion, I think it's a smaller, but the range for the... One of the difficulties is, you know, with DESE as well, that the range for partial inclusion, like we said, is 79 to 40.

764
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:10,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's a pretty big stretch, right?

765
01:12:10,836 --> 01:12:12,897
[SPEAKER_12]: So what does that really mean and what does that translate into?

766
01:12:12,937 --> 01:12:16,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's when you start to look into the programs and see what's happening around our schools.

767
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:24,282
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, you know, as was said in the school committee meeting for the last session, I think it's really valuable to go into the classrooms

768
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,409
[SPEAKER_12]: and see what's happening in our classrooms here.

769
01:12:26,449 --> 01:12:31,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had that experience this year where I was able to sort of observe some of the classrooms and some of the programming.

770
01:12:32,012 --> 01:12:37,836
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really encourage the school committee to do that and to see for themselves what's happening in our subseparate classrooms.

771
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:47,121
[SPEAKER_12]: So in our partial inclusion classrooms and our full inclusion classrooms, because we should be looking at every classroom and seeing how we can help and how we can support every child.

772
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:52,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your report.

773
01:12:53,064 --> 01:13:03,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to underline, I think, that this real accomplishment this year, and it certainly was so great to hear about, was the universal design for emergency preparedness.

774
01:13:04,028 --> 01:13:06,709
[SPEAKER_05]: A real kudos for the CPAC.

775
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:07,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks so much.

776
01:13:08,049 --> 01:13:08,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

777
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,290
[SPEAKER_12]: We really enjoyed that.

778
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And it wasn't obviously just the CPAC.

779
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:15,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Central Administration, Kathy Medaglio, lots of folks really helped out with that.

780
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:20,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that's really exciting about that is we created what we're calling an IER, which was an

781
01:13:21,132 --> 01:13:38,444
[SPEAKER_12]: individual emergency response, much like an IEP, an individual emergency response form so that families who need extra planning in their IEP for emergency response have this form that can be looked at and they can review if your child needs extra help in an evacuation center or a fire alarm or whatever.

782
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:41,326
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be part of the legal document, part of the IEP.

783
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:49,031
[SPEAKER_12]: So the IER is something that we're actually going to present at a state level as well to the Committee on Education because we think it should be something that should be not only

784
01:13:49,347 --> 01:13:52,089
[SPEAKER_12]: It's statewide but national, so once again, Medford's leading the way.

785
01:13:52,129 --> 01:13:53,410
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really happy to be part of that.

786
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:54,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

787
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:56,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

788
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:56,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Kreatz.

789
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

790
01:13:58,093 --> 01:14:01,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the report, and thank you for the wonderful presentation.

791
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:03,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a question.

792
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know, like, is there, like, currently, you know, professional training for the afterschool teachers at the different schools?

793
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is that already in place right now this year?

794
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:14,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that I'm aware of.

795
01:14:14,693 --> 01:14:21,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, so actually Megan came to the subcommittee meetings for the special education committee, so out of school time and after school.

796
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:25,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Anthony Petrellis is working with the Summer Fund Camp to have training.

797
01:14:26,058 --> 01:14:32,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Megan was just saying at our last meeting that she would like to implement the same training that they're happening at the Summer Fund.

798
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:33,421
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, that's going to start.

799
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:35,742
[SPEAKER_12]: It hadn't in the past, but it's going to happen this year.

800
01:14:35,782 --> 01:14:36,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're really excited about that.

801
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you for asking about them.

802
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:39,521
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really exciting.

803
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,462
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I know, really important.

804
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:40,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

805
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

806
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:41,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

807
01:14:42,464 --> 01:14:42,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

808
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:43,666
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

809
01:14:43,686 --> 01:14:44,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

810
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:44,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

811
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:45,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

812
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:46,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Ms.

813
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:47,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Stone had her hand raised.

814
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Christmas stone, she yields to you.

815
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:51,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

816
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:54,318
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't usually put your hand up, so I bow.

817
01:14:54,598 --> 01:14:56,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought she was stretching.

818
01:14:56,679 --> 01:14:57,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to stretch too.

819
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:01,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Melanie and Tanya for an excellent slide show.

820
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering, and I'm not sure if it's Kathy or you folks that can answer.

821
01:15:05,641 --> 01:15:10,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So your slide says 770 kids on an IEP, but then our hard copy is 888.

822
01:15:10,503 --> 01:15:11,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

823
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:14,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy can talk about that if you want her to, but it's really just

824
01:15:15,419 --> 01:15:16,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll volunteer you, Kathy.

825
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,402
[SPEAKER_09]: But to increase by 118, is that an average for the beginning and the end of a school year?

826
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:31,547
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the 770 actually came from the 2016-2017 school year, because that information came off of a report from the Department of Ed website.

827
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:36,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So the 885 is what I calculated the other day.

828
01:15:36,309 --> 01:15:42,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's natural to students move in, new students are identified, especially

829
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:45,863
[SPEAKER_08]: We have preschoolers turning three all the time.

830
01:15:46,343 --> 01:15:51,766
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably pick up a good 40 to 50 three-year-olds over the course of one school year.

831
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not unusual to have that difference.

832
01:15:56,028 --> 01:16:03,771
[SPEAKER_08]: The 770 number, on the Department of Ed website, they post different statistics within different reports.

833
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the October 1st report that goes in, that 770 came from a

834
01:16:09,058 --> 01:16:11,699
[SPEAKER_08]: students who are ages 6 to 21.

835
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,340
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

836
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:22,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my concern or question, thinking of budgeting, is do you see a higher than average increase in the last few years of kids on IEPs?

837
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:27,567
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been somewhere around the 18th percentile.

838
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:32,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So we fluctuate right around 18, all the way up to 19%, depending on the year.

839
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:32,710
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

840
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,911
[SPEAKER_08]: The difference is the number of students enrolled in the school district.

841
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:45,542
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, fewer students, but, you know, what is the proportion based on... Okay, so it's 18% on average for the last 10 years?

842
01:16:45,562 --> 01:16:49,584
[SPEAKER_08]: No, what we do have is an increase of preschoolers becoming eligible for special ed services.

843
01:16:49,644 --> 01:16:50,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right.

844
01:16:50,084 --> 01:16:51,965
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a stress area.

845
01:16:51,985 --> 01:16:53,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, all right, thank you very much.

846
01:16:54,707 --> 01:16:55,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

847
01:16:55,968 --> 01:16:56,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

848
01:16:57,048 --> 01:17:03,091
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, throughout this year, I've gotten to see many

849
01:17:04,806 --> 01:17:19,511
[SPEAKER_13]: instances where the collaboration between the Special Education Administration and the CPAC have worked together, and it's been really a joy to watch, because a lot of districts don't have that, and we do in MedFed.

850
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:25,773
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an excellent CPAC that's very well organized and trains us in a lot of different things.

851
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:31,514
[SPEAKER_13]: I've learned a lot at some of the meetings, and so have so many of our parents.

852
01:17:31,874 --> 01:17:33,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love to see an increase

853
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:37,483
[SPEAKER_13]: in your enrollment and participation in those programming.

854
01:17:37,743 --> 01:17:48,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So in any way that the district can help facilitate that, either with the auto call or some ways, I would love to see that as a goal for next year.

855
01:17:48,506 --> 01:17:49,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

856
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,387
[SPEAKER_13]: As a school committee member.

857
01:17:51,587 --> 01:18:02,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And any way that we can enlighten more parents and more families to your programming and to these opportunities to learn more in order to help their children.

858
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:06,691
[SPEAKER_13]: is also a benefit to all throughout the district.

859
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:15,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also had the opportunity to chair the special education subcommittee meeting that is a new subcommittee that we formed about a year ago.

860
01:18:15,912 --> 01:18:18,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank my colleagues for coming to all those meetings.

861
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:27,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to provide good snacks and keep it to the correct time frame and really just

862
01:18:29,362 --> 01:18:35,025
[SPEAKER_13]: make sure we didn't ask for 20 things when we could ask for two and really facilitate change.

863
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:47,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like moving forward, if you work on two basic things, three are tops, you make effective change and that change sustains for years to come.

864
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:50,692
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would make that recommendation to the CPAC as well.

865
01:18:50,952 --> 01:18:56,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's 50 things that you can think of that the district could improve because we all want the best for our children.

866
01:18:57,285 --> 01:19:08,332
[SPEAKER_13]: But we really need to focus and plan for next year and see what those items are going to be with the superintendent as well as our new special education director.

867
01:19:09,093 --> 01:19:16,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to take this opportunity, because it is the last meeting of the year, to call up Kathy Medaglio for a minute, if you don't mind.

868
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:17,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, when you're finished.

869
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:18,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

870
01:19:18,919 --> 01:19:19,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

871
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just have one more thing that we wanted to do.

872
01:19:21,805 --> 01:19:23,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we appreciate that very much, Erin.

873
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:31,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And it has been a real joy working with our special ed administration and our administration and teachers across the district.

874
01:19:31,828 --> 01:19:40,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of the things that people don't realize is that when we have these events, I think oftentimes people think, oh, that's for families of children with disabilities or that's for students with disabilities.

875
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:42,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And these events are for everyone.

876
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:43,791
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, they benefit everyone.

877
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:48,873
[SPEAKER_12]: The school safety thing was for anybody, elderly, preschoolers,

878
01:19:49,287 --> 01:19:49,727
[SPEAKER_12]: anyone.

879
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:51,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're really helpful.

880
01:19:51,128 --> 01:19:53,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Anxiety, lots of folks have homework anxiety.

881
01:19:53,449 --> 01:19:56,170
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not necessarily diagnosed as disabled.

882
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,651
[SPEAKER_12]: So the other thing that we really want to remind people is disability is natural.

883
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:01,372
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all disabled at some point.

884
01:20:01,512 --> 01:20:07,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could be temporarily disabled, or you could get hit by a car and be disabled for the rest of your life.

885
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:09,575
[SPEAKER_12]: You could be disabled through pregnancy, what have you.

886
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:10,695
[SPEAKER_12]: So disability is natural.

887
01:20:11,055 --> 01:20:14,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, no one questions anybody that walks through that door or why they come.

888
01:20:14,837 --> 01:20:15,997
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just happy to have you there.

889
01:20:16,017 --> 01:20:18,018
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also have good snacks.

890
01:20:19,745 --> 01:20:25,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And the next actually slide that we wanted to share is that we have our CPAC award, our 2019 CPAC award.

891
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:34,320
[SPEAKER_12]: So the CPAC award, we give an award every year in recognition of a community member who exemplifies the CPAC mission of equity, diversity and inclusion for every child.

892
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year we want to give the award to, drumroll,

893
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:54,639
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to say it's been a joy working with Kathy over the past several years, and I can assure you there are many CPACs that would not necessarily say that about the Director of Special Education.

894
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:54,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

895
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:56,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you.

896
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:02,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so honored.

897
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:02,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I really am.

898
01:21:03,048 --> 01:21:03,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very honored.

899
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:05,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been a pleasure working with all of you.

900
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:08,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done a lot of good work.

901
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:15,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes we might be having discussions that are quite strong and vivid.

902
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,051
[SPEAKER_08]: But we get there, and we get it done.

903
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:21,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do want to say that it really has been a pleasure.

904
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:38,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is very lucky to have such a strong group of parents who really have a voice and they're very clear and they help us to keep moving forward and to look at things from different perspectives.

905
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:51,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very important to listen to parents, so I just wanna put that out there and make sure that we're hearing from the home perspective what we can all do to grow and develop and keep moving forward.

906
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

907
01:21:52,383 --> 01:21:53,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna miss you.

908
01:21:58,503 --> 01:22:01,525
[SPEAKER_12]: We just want to take a picture for one minute if you don't mind indulging us.

909
01:22:02,546 --> 01:22:03,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to be in that picture.

910
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:05,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the whole school committee should join.

911
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:24,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, come on over, come on over.

912
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:26,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the whole crowd in the picture, I know.

913
01:22:26,903 --> 01:22:27,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that pretty?

914
01:22:27,724 --> 01:22:30,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, come on, thank you guys.

915
01:22:30,565 --> 01:22:34,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thanks.

916
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:39,289
[SPEAKER_12]: How many years has that been?

917
01:22:39,969 --> 01:22:40,689
[SPEAKER_08]: What, he remembered?

918
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:41,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

919
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:41,030
33.

920
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:41,410
[SPEAKER_08]: 33 years.

921
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:41,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

922
01:22:51,360 --> 01:23:09,572
This is really cool.

923
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:09,933
Wow.

924
01:23:27,573 --> 01:23:28,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke, if it's okay.

925
01:23:30,134 --> 01:23:30,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto.

926
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:31,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

927
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:43,702
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know we have another meeting on June 17th, but this is the last meeting where, you know, parents in the district may be watching because their kids will be out of school for the next meeting.

928
01:23:43,942 --> 01:23:51,387
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just personally, I've worked as a school committee member for eight years now, and I work in special education in my day job.

929
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:56,533
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to say how much respect I have, in admiration for Kathy Medaglio.

930
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:58,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I know she's retiring this year.

931
01:24:00,074 --> 01:24:06,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say what a pleasure it's been to work with you on so many issues for so many families.

932
01:24:07,577 --> 01:24:09,338
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been an excellent SPED director.

933
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:14,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only do you pass all of our coordinated program reviews with flying colors, which is

934
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:18,389
[SPEAKER_13]: a really great accomplishment for a school district.

935
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:27,036
[SPEAKER_13]: You also work with compassion, and you keep what's best for the children in the district at the forefront, mostly the children.

936
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:31,259
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tell you how much respect I have for you.

937
01:24:31,379 --> 01:24:35,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your years of service in MedFed, and you will always hear from me.

938
01:24:36,563 --> 01:24:38,264
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if that's a good thing or a threat.

939
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:42,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

940
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:42,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot.

941
01:24:43,682 --> 01:24:51,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathy, Erin said it very well, so I don't want to take a lot of time, but I really want to thank you for all of your service to us.

942
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:55,916
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done a magnificent job working in a sometimes very difficult area.

943
01:24:56,636 --> 01:25:04,425
[SPEAKER_05]: You've kept the needs of the kids in the forefront, and I really appreciate having you here, and we wish you every good thing in your retirement.

944
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:22,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to echo what has been said, and as a new kid on the block, I've only been here for a little under a year, 11 months, so I think I'm not quite a toddler.

945
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:28,159
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I just want to say I have truly enjoyed working with Ms.

946
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:37,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Kathy Medaglio, and she's such a hard worker, a tireless worker, works very, very long, long hours.

947
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,140
[SPEAKER_18]: and has great insight.

948
01:25:41,021 --> 01:25:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: And I look forward to finding a creative way to continue to tap into your creative insight.

949
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:52,450
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just so appreciative of having had this one year to work with you.

950
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:56,493
[SPEAKER_18]: I do look forward to working with Joan as well, and I know you've trained her well.

951
01:25:57,094 --> 01:26:02,518
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to just say thank you for all your years of service and for all that you've done for Medford Public Schools.

952
01:26:02,878 --> 01:26:03,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

953
01:26:08,887 --> 01:26:09,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Kathy.

954
01:26:10,408 --> 01:26:10,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Big heart.

955
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:18,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up, recommendation to approve teacher unit MTA pay frequency changes.

956
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:18,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

957
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:18,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Patterson.

958
01:26:18,893 --> 01:26:19,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept.

959
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept by Ms.

960
01:26:21,995 --> 01:26:23,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone, is a second by Ms.

961
01:26:23,696 --> 01:26:23,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

962
01:26:24,417 --> 01:26:25,297
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

963
01:26:25,957 --> 01:26:26,898
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

964
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:27,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

965
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:28,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

966
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:34,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on K to 12 assessments.

967
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:36,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

968
01:26:37,372 --> 01:26:56,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so attached, this was the report from our last session that was tabled, but this was just a comprehensive listing of all of the assessments that are given over the course of the school year to support teaching and learning.

969
01:26:57,778 --> 01:27:01,882
[SPEAKER_18]: at elementary, middle, and high school levels.

970
01:27:02,702 --> 01:27:14,711
[SPEAKER_18]: And the addendum, the added sheet gave the official MCAS test sessions and the amount of sessions that students do take.

971
01:27:15,372 --> 01:27:21,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So I feel that it is very self-explanatory, but I'm open to answering any questions.

972
01:27:22,978 --> 01:27:23,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

973
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:23,778
[SPEAKER_14]: DeRusso.

974
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:24,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

975
01:27:26,177 --> 01:27:28,098
[SPEAKER_16]: a bit of an effort to compile this.

976
01:27:28,138 --> 01:27:30,399
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a useful thing for the district to have.

977
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:37,903
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you probably can imagine, this was just a first step in what I was going to be seeking.

978
01:27:38,903 --> 01:27:42,545
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we see the district report card, we see the MCAS results.

979
01:27:44,206 --> 01:27:48,128
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a secret that I think of them as relatively useless pieces of data.

980
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:55,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Within this set of assessments, though, I think is where the educators actually live

981
01:27:56,462 --> 01:27:58,242
[SPEAKER_16]: and learn about their students.

982
01:27:58,722 --> 01:28:21,547
[SPEAKER_16]: And so my hope is that some of these, not all of them, because we couldn't possibly sit through a meeting that long, even this committee couldn't probably last that long, that some of these things could be pulled out into sort of an annual state of the system report to help us understand, you know,

983
01:28:22,695 --> 01:28:28,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these assessments could tell us really very useful information that I don't think we get out of MCAS.

984
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:34,642
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm not requesting a report or specifying a date when that would happen.

985
01:28:34,682 --> 01:28:38,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that you probably are doing this already.

986
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:47,429
[SPEAKER_16]: But figuring out what in here you think we should be presented with that gives us an understanding of what's really going on.

987
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Because MCAS- In the community.

988
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,151
[SPEAKER_16]: In the community, obviously, yes.

989
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:58,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I don't feel like I really have a sense of what's going on from MCAS scores.

990
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:00,071
[SPEAKER_18]: And I agree with you.

991
01:29:00,732 --> 01:29:11,446
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel that the MCAS scores, although they are very important to have a standard that you can measure yourself against the state in how surrounding districts are doing,

992
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:25,831
[SPEAKER_18]: But the real work that actually happens day to day over the course of the school year, what's happening in November, what's happening in January, the incremental steps that take place over the course of the year.

993
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:37,299
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will definitely be able to work on that and try to select other pieces of data to be able to show that we are moving the needle.

994
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,562
[SPEAKER_18]: And this assessment inventory report

995
01:29:41,059 --> 01:29:54,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the directors worked on it and really thought about what were the key, the kind of key levers that take us from here to preparing the students to take the state-level assessments.

996
01:29:54,866 --> 01:29:59,889
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is something that I will definitely be able to do for you during next school year.

997
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:01,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

998
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:04,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Mr. Rizzo, continue.

999
01:30:05,052 --> 01:30:09,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, I'm very happy that clearly you understand what I'm looking for.

1000
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:38,164
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, some of these assessments are offered multiple times per year, and I think that is, for me, you know, these AWIN assessments and literacy, for instance, four times a year, knowing that at the beginning of the year, this is where third grade at Columbus is at, and this is where they are at the end of the year, and identifying that that's not, that's great, that's what we were hoping for, or there's something missing and we need to improve that.

1001
01:30:40,379 --> 01:30:43,041
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, that's really, that's going to be good.

1002
01:30:43,061 --> 01:30:51,727
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm thinking like a year from now, assuming I'm still sitting here, you know, if that's not on the schedule, I would certainly want to propose that.

1003
01:30:52,668 --> 01:30:53,629
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

1004
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:55,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Rousseau.

1005
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:55,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1006
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:56,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1007
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:56,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

1008
01:30:57,211 --> 01:31:00,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Superintendent.

1009
01:31:00,694 --> 01:31:05,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We also received in our packet while we're on the topic of assessments,

1010
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:15,383
[SPEAKER_05]: a follow-up report on the universal dyslexic screening cost analysis, and that is not on our agenda specifically, although it certainly is an assessment.

1011
01:31:16,784 --> 01:31:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't thinking that tonight we would be debating which one we're going to do, but I'm assuming, and I just want you to confirm this, that our professionals will be looking at this and will be making a choice and will be part

1012
01:31:30,075 --> 01:31:34,676
[SPEAKER_05]: it will be budgeted for in our upcoming school year budget?

1013
01:31:34,836 --> 01:31:35,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1014
01:31:35,416 --> 01:31:36,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it will definitely be budgeted.

1015
01:31:36,876 --> 01:31:37,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1016
01:31:37,776 --> 01:31:38,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1017
01:31:38,517 --> 01:31:38,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1018
01:31:39,337 --> 01:31:39,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1019
01:31:39,997 --> 01:31:40,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion?

1020
01:31:40,677 --> 01:31:41,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Ms.

1021
01:31:41,157 --> 01:31:41,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Mastone.

1022
01:31:42,537 --> 01:31:42,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1023
01:31:43,377 --> 01:31:55,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to share a conversation I had with one of my children's teachers at the Roberts because the assessment was on our last agenda that we were just talking about what the report was about.

1024
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what was the backstory?

1025
01:31:58,061 --> 01:32:01,582
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to know about all the assessments taking place, how much instruction time is lost.

1026
01:32:02,362 --> 01:32:11,243
[SPEAKER_09]: What I didn't know, which I thought is helpful for parents to know, is that at least for the math benchmarks, the student takes it on their Chromebook.

1027
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:15,564
[SPEAKER_09]: The results of the test or the benchmark are all downloaded.

1028
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:22,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the math coach at the Roberts receives it all and can see where the needs are and what's missing or what needs to be highlighted.

1029
01:32:23,226 --> 01:32:25,746
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the math coach met with the teacher to review

1030
01:32:26,313 --> 01:32:31,997
[SPEAKER_09]: So at least I can only speak about math because I only had 10 minutes, you know, at drop-off to talk about it.

1031
01:32:32,437 --> 01:32:37,881
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do think, I guess I never thought assessments went anywhere except they filled them out and they were filed somewhere.

1032
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:43,745
[SPEAKER_09]: But the math coach is at least looking at the math part, so that is direct service to see how they can help.

1033
01:32:43,965 --> 01:32:53,532
[SPEAKER_18]: And just part of best practices, once an assessment is given, you analyze the data, the teachers, and whether it's their planning time,

1034
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:56,689
[SPEAKER_18]: The data is looked at to inform next steps.

1035
01:32:56,729 --> 01:33:07,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you hear me talking about data informed decisions, you need to have an assessment so you know where to start and what areas you need to focus on.

1036
01:33:07,376 --> 01:33:15,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And the math coaches, the beauty of having them is that they are able to kind of work side by side with the teachers, help them impact the data.

1037
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:20,813
[SPEAKER_18]: come up with additional lessons to target areas of weakness.

1038
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:27,318
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yes, you got that unsolicited feedback, but it is happening in all areas.

1039
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:28,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1040
01:33:28,419 --> 01:33:28,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Doctor.

1041
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1042
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. Russo.

1043
01:33:30,841 --> 01:33:36,686
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have one more question about the addition to the, that included the MCAS testing times.

1044
01:33:37,247 --> 01:33:42,371
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it says in here that for grades three to eight, the ELA test, there's two sessions.

1045
01:33:42,953 --> 01:33:46,355
[SPEAKER_16]: the recommended testing time is two to two and a half hours per session.

1046
01:33:46,836 --> 01:33:49,398
[SPEAKER_16]: But these are untimed.

1047
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:57,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what I understand that to mean is that even though it's two to two and a half hours, it's a whole school day without any instruction.

1048
01:33:58,584 --> 01:34:01,206
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on the level that the student is.

1049
01:34:01,286 --> 01:34:05,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Some students can finish the assessment in a shorter amount of time.

1050
01:34:05,269 --> 01:34:07,911
[SPEAKER_18]: And now that the computers are online,

1051
01:34:10,323 --> 01:34:16,065
[SPEAKER_18]: If someone were to need more than two and a half hours, then the test is not taken away from them.

1052
01:34:16,645 --> 01:34:26,969
[SPEAKER_18]: So DESE gives you their recommended amount of time, but a testing session should never be longer than one school day.

1053
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:28,149
[SPEAKER_18]: There are rules.

1054
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,190
[SPEAKER_18]: So two to two and a half hours.

1055
01:34:31,544 --> 01:34:34,506
[SPEAKER_18]: is the recommended amount of time for an assessment.

1056
01:34:35,006 --> 01:34:40,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Some students do need a little bit longer and others don't.

1057
01:34:40,269 --> 01:34:45,133
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's, you know, it's hard to tell until the assessment's in front of them.

1058
01:34:45,573 --> 01:34:53,258
[SPEAKER_18]: And now that the assessment is online, it's, you know, it's even harder to say is someone struggling or not.

1059
01:34:53,278 --> 01:35:00,023
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still, you know, figuring out how students are responding to the state assessments since they're taking it online.

1060
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:01,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1061
01:35:01,776 --> 01:35:18,502
[SPEAKER_16]: But so from the perspective of counting up all the time that our students are in school and actually not learning, this two-hour session from a six-hour school day is really six hours that they are not learning, because they're not being... It technically can't be six.

1062
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:20,522
[SPEAKER_18]: They still will have a lunch period.

1063
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:21,382
[SPEAKER_18]: They still have a break.

1064
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:28,965
[SPEAKER_18]: They still will... So, I mean, worst-case scenario, it might be four and a half to five hours,

1065
01:35:30,132 --> 01:35:36,734
[SPEAKER_18]: For the purpose of DESE, you're not... But I mean from the planning, I'm teaching fifth grade.

1066
01:35:38,174 --> 01:35:40,375
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to plan anything for that whole day, correct?

1067
01:35:41,895 --> 01:35:45,196
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would say it depends on how the assessment is.

1068
01:35:45,236 --> 01:35:57,340
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're the teacher of record, sometimes, depending on how many students are left, they may move a smaller group of students to a different location and have them, it's supervised,

1069
01:35:57,841 --> 01:36:10,366
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have 20, 25 students and 22 of them have completed the test, you don't say to the 22, okay, close your computers, silently read for the remainder of the time.

1070
01:36:10,786 --> 01:36:19,470
[SPEAKER_18]: They may at that point in time say, okay, two or three students or four students need a little more time, let them continue testing with a proctor.

1071
01:36:19,893 --> 01:36:21,314
[SPEAKER_18]: and the other students can go back.

1072
01:36:21,895 --> 01:36:35,407
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have to understand, the children are young, it's stressful, so usually after testing, the teachers try not to give them something that's so cognitively demanding, because it does cause stress sometimes.

1073
01:36:35,827 --> 01:36:44,375
[SPEAKER_18]: So they try to make it be, you know, they finish testing, but it's not something that's so, you know, intense, or they start introducing new content.

1074
01:36:44,835 --> 01:36:46,637
[SPEAKER_18]: They give the students time to kind of

1075
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:58,960
[SPEAKER_18]: decompress and do something that's less stressful, still academic, but less stressful so that they can just kind of, you know, regroup until they get the hang of it.

1076
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, by the time they're in middle school, I think they're pretty much professionals.

1077
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:08,002
[SPEAKER_18]: But third, fourth, fifth grade, you could still see them being tired after testing.

1078
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:09,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1079
01:37:10,383 --> 01:37:11,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1080
01:37:11,343 --> 01:37:11,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mayor Burger.

1081
01:37:12,657 --> 01:37:19,418
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the questions that came up when we were doing our budget discussion earlier was students, sometimes the Chromebooks will blink out.

1082
01:37:21,319 --> 01:37:25,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we ever have students lose data when they do the online assistant if we have a Chromebook that blinks out?

1083
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,220
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like they have to start from the top.

1084
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,740
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they don't start from the top.

1085
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,341
[SPEAKER_18]: It is saved.

1086
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:41,123
[SPEAKER_18]: They will have to reset it or if there have been a few computers, Chromebooks that just weren't functioning, so they'd have to close the session and then reopen it on

1087
01:37:41,777 --> 01:37:43,298
[SPEAKER_18]: a new computer that's functioning.

1088
01:37:43,698 --> 01:37:48,741
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're able to go back and continue from, you know, whatever point they were at.

1089
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:49,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1090
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:49,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1091
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:50,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1092
01:37:50,402 --> 01:37:50,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1093
01:37:50,742 --> 01:37:56,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

1094
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:56,886
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1095
01:37:56,906 --> 01:37:56,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1096
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:58,467
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1097
01:37:59,007 --> 01:37:59,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1098
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:02,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on professional development.

1099
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:02,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not see Ms.

1100
01:38:02,949 --> 01:38:03,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell.

1101
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:03,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1102
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Riccidelli.

1103
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:06,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Riccidelli.

1104
01:38:06,612 --> 01:38:06,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

1105
01:38:07,132 --> 01:38:08,493
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll present that report.

1106
01:38:08,693 --> 01:38:09,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1107
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:12,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1108
01:38:12,568 --> 01:38:13,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1109
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:23,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell is unable to be here tonight, so I've been asked to read the report that, present the report that she has written.

1110
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:29,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So the report is on professional development as it stands now, and

1111
01:38:32,065 --> 01:38:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: as we move on into the future.

1112
01:38:33,906 --> 01:38:41,312
[SPEAKER_06]: The Metropolitan Public Schools has a rich portfolio of professional development offerings for our faculty, our paraprofessionals, and our administrators.

1113
01:38:42,133 --> 01:38:53,761
[SPEAKER_06]: This report will provide an overview of the professional development offerings provided to these staff members, as well as the number of conference days and monies spent on the coursework.

1114
01:38:54,642 --> 01:39:03,230
[SPEAKER_06]: In school year 2018-19, the Metro Public Schools offered a total of 128 professional development offerings in the following areas.

1115
01:39:03,891 --> 01:39:15,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Curriculum committees, so that would include our PBIS, our WIN advisory, our teacher assistant teams, and our ELA benchmark curriculum committees for a total of four.

1116
01:39:16,723 --> 01:39:39,079
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes district-sponsored offerings, including risks to resiliency, disability awareness, FOSS, Think Central for a total of 87 offerings, and various professional development day offerings, including safety care training, SEL, or social emotional learning, concepts in art education, and best practices for a total of 37 offerings.

1117
01:39:39,939 --> 01:39:43,402
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to conferences, there were a total of 150 approvals made in the 18-19 school year.

1118
01:39:46,032 --> 01:39:54,635
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of staff that attended conferences, and again, when we're talking about staff, we're talking about faculty, paraprofessionals, and administrators.

1119
01:39:55,536 --> 01:40:01,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the number is over 150, which means that staff participated in workshops outside the district.

1120
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:16,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time when we approve staff members to attend out of district offerings, we do ask them to present their learnings within the district at department meetings, school-wide meetings, or other professional development opportunities.

1121
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:21,732
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to tuition reimbursement, the total is $40,000.

1122
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:23,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We spoke a little bit about this at the last meeting.

1123
01:40:24,353 --> 01:40:27,575
[SPEAKER_06]: That is broken up by semesters.

1124
01:40:28,817 --> 01:40:37,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I mentioned, $14,000 is allocated for the summer reimbursement and $13,000 for each of the fall and spring reimbursement.

1125
01:40:38,985 --> 01:40:52,395
[SPEAKER_06]: When staff members get approval to take these courses, these courses, if they are approved and they apply, can be used for salary increment credit.

1126
01:40:56,067 --> 01:41:03,190
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to grant funding, this past year we have spent $15,577.

1127
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:09,132
[SPEAKER_06]: We get that money from the Title II-A grant, and to date that number is $5,177.

1128
01:41:09,212 --> 01:41:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So examples of where that money was spent would be to Teachers 21, Dr. Nadine Gobb, and staff member payment for professional development.

1129
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Title IV, another federal grant.

1130
01:41:24,556 --> 01:41:36,322
[SPEAKER_06]: To date, the amount that has been spent is $10,400, and we can identify mentor training and a landmark PD that was provided specifically to the McGlynn Middle School.

1131
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:44,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Public Schools will continue to be responsive to the needs of our district and the faculty and provide high-quality professional development.

1132
01:41:44,847 --> 01:41:50,990
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I know I mentioned when I presented a couple of weeks ago is that we are working with the Teachers Association

1133
01:41:51,968 --> 01:41:53,789
[SPEAKER_06]: our professional development advisory committee.

1134
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:56,110
[SPEAKER_06]: We've looked at what we've offered.

1135
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:58,811
[SPEAKER_06]: We've looked at a lot of the good things that we've offered.

1136
01:41:59,151 --> 01:42:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope to improve upon that.

1137
01:42:00,752 --> 01:42:04,713
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think overall, we're doing a commendable job.

1138
01:42:05,173 --> 01:42:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we hope to improve, but I don't want to take away what we have done.

1139
01:42:10,395 --> 01:42:13,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to answer any questions that you have.

1140
01:42:13,497 --> 01:42:14,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Aguirre.

1141
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:15,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much, Mayor Bergen.

1142
01:42:15,738 --> 01:42:16,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1143
01:42:16,218 --> 01:42:16,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1144
01:42:17,289 --> 01:42:19,271
[SPEAKER_19]: for the report, I was hoping we could speak to Ms.

1145
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:22,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Caldwell about it, but I appreciate you presenting in her stead.

1146
01:42:23,996 --> 01:42:32,485
[SPEAKER_19]: First off, I was curious, so in front of the curriculum committee, how many requests are made for professional development?

1147
01:42:34,807 --> 01:42:36,088
[SPEAKER_06]: To form curriculum committees?

1148
01:42:36,529 --> 01:42:40,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so four were granted approval, is that correct?

1149
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:42,681
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1150
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:48,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not aware of any denials for curriculum committees.

1151
01:42:50,365 --> 01:42:58,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the curriculum work has occurred not in official committees but in department meeting settings.

1152
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:04,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I trust the number is correct.

1153
01:43:04,872 --> 01:43:05,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It's four.

1154
01:43:06,273 --> 01:43:07,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do the research on this.

1155
01:43:08,198 --> 01:43:10,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's the best answer I can give you at this point.

1156
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:22,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, because I remember when the teachers were here speaking on this very issue, they seemed to be, almost all of them, seemed to have the impression that they've presented things and they haven't had a chance to be approved on.

1157
01:43:23,097 --> 01:43:27,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that one of the things they were talking about is outside professional development opportunities.

1158
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:33,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone mentioned AP offerings, the desire to be a reader, the desire to go for AP training.

1159
01:43:34,745 --> 01:43:42,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know that that's one area in which they are looking for more access that would not be included in curriculum.

1160
01:43:42,331 --> 01:43:52,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I would, if possible, I would like to request a report to get a percentage of what our denial versus approval rate, but I have a couple of other questions in this regard as well.

1161
01:43:53,146 --> 01:43:59,790
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of our tuition reimbursement, how do we compare looking at other similar school districts?

1162
01:44:02,311 --> 01:44:07,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Bedford is very generous to offer $40,000 in tuition reimbursement.

1163
01:44:08,094 --> 01:44:12,577
[SPEAKER_18]: That tuition reimbursement allows you to get a step in lane increase.

1164
01:44:13,017 --> 01:44:20,361
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are paying for you to take the course and then we're paying you again to receive an increase in your pay

1165
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:21,890
[SPEAKER_18]: until you retire.

1166
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:26,253
[SPEAKER_18]: So I didn't have that as an option from the district that I came from.

1167
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:31,996
[SPEAKER_18]: I would definitely have taken advantage of that since I enjoyed going to school a lot.

1168
01:44:32,177 --> 01:44:40,862
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I think it's a very generous offering to offer $40,000 every year to pay for professional development.

1169
01:44:41,463 --> 01:44:45,666
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a commitment and an investment that we're making to have

1170
01:44:47,243 --> 01:44:52,588
[SPEAKER_18]: highly qualified and teachers that are getting top-notch professional development.

1171
01:44:53,048 --> 01:45:02,095
[SPEAKER_18]: In regards to the comment about the curriculum committee, the comment that was made at the last session was about attending the

1172
01:45:03,038 --> 01:45:07,199
[SPEAKER_18]: conference, a professional development conference that was out of state.

1173
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,720
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, we approved 150 conference days.

1174
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,480
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's one of, we're only in school 180 days a year.

1175
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,721
[SPEAKER_18]: So to have 150 conference days, that's a significant number of days that

1176
01:45:24,602 --> 01:45:53,180
[SPEAKER_18]: people throughout the district are accessing professional development, and sometimes you may have more than one person attending a particular conference, but you do have to have people back home, and you do have to have a reasonable amount, but I feel that 150 conference days, as they come in, that's a very generous and reasonable number.

1177
01:45:53,542 --> 01:46:07,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I mean, I can certainly, as a former educator myself, I've taken part of these conferences and I've learned a lot, but on the school committee I can also appreciate the stress to make sure that we have all these positions filled and if someone's away for a couple of days.

1178
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:09,850
[SPEAKER_19]: that we can fill their spot.

1179
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:25,334
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess the sense that I had when TA was here is that it seemed, and many people nodded, and many people expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount of conferences that they had been approved for.

1180
01:46:26,354 --> 01:46:30,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, whether that's true or not, I mean, I understand that you

1181
01:46:31,112 --> 01:46:32,353
[SPEAKER_19]: You think we're being very generous?

1182
01:46:32,433 --> 01:46:33,833
[SPEAKER_18]: We are being very generous.

1183
01:46:34,073 --> 01:46:49,339
[SPEAKER_18]: And although there was dissatisfaction expressed, I think if we were to pool the 150 people who were able to participate in professional development conferences, I think they would be satisfied with that.

1184
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:54,601
[SPEAKER_19]: If possible, it would be very helpful for me, because I do have these conversations when teachers approach me.

1185
01:46:56,985 --> 01:47:06,949
[SPEAKER_19]: ill-equipped to represent the district and say, no, actually, we gave 150 conferences versus Melrose, which only gave 35, or Arlington, which only gave 85.

1186
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:12,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would be very helpful for me to understand where other districts are in this regard.

1187
01:47:12,711 --> 01:47:18,614
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you have a superintendent database that you would access, but if you could do us a favor,

1188
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:28,874
[SPEAKER_18]: I can definitely try to find some information from colleagues, but I mean, with it being the last week and a half of school, it's the timing.

1189
01:47:28,934 --> 01:47:31,195
[SPEAKER_18]: It can come in October, of course.

1190
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:36,257
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't anticipate that you, everyone's busy doing graduations, and that would be a terrible time.

1191
01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:45,301
[SPEAKER_19]: But at your next superintendent conference, when you all meet, if you could pool five or six of our sister districts and say, how many do you guys give out?

1192
01:47:45,481 --> 01:47:47,342
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you can report back those figures to us.

1193
01:47:47,402 --> 01:47:48,002
[SPEAKER_19]: It would help me.

1194
01:47:48,642 --> 01:47:55,345
[SPEAKER_19]: When a teacher finds me shopping at Wegmans and they're hitting me with that right now, I feel ill-equipped to represent.

1195
01:47:55,365 --> 01:48:08,050
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think any teacher understands that there is a give and take, but on the other side, it's important for us to recognize that we are part of the voice of the schools, and it'd be helpful to me to have those numbers.

1196
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:09,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1197
01:48:09,629 --> 01:48:10,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1198
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:13,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1199
01:48:13,432 --> 01:48:13,773
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved.

1200
01:48:13,813 --> 01:48:15,894
[SPEAKER_14]: By Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Giroir.

1201
01:48:15,934 --> 01:48:16,695
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1202
01:48:16,715 --> 01:48:17,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1203
01:48:17,676 --> 01:48:18,377
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1204
01:48:19,217 --> 01:48:19,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1205
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:22,800
[SPEAKER_14]: New business.

1206
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,121
[SPEAKER_14]: School committee resolution.

1207
01:48:24,302 --> 01:48:29,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Margaret Peggy Kane.

1208
01:48:29,826 --> 01:48:30,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1209
01:48:30,047 --> 01:48:32,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Kane was an English teacher at Medford High School for 35 years.

1210
01:48:33,369 --> 01:48:35,331
[SPEAKER_14]: She actually was my teacher when I was in high school.

1211
01:48:37,178 --> 01:48:37,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1212
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:38,438
[SPEAKER_14]: VanCleef?

1213
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:46,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to add she also was my children's teacher and she went on and was a school committee member in her community.

1214
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:49,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Peggy was a great person and it's a great loss.

1215
01:48:50,682 --> 01:48:59,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And also if we could hold a moment of silence for those in Virginia Beach, 12 people killed Friday evening in a government building, four injured, police officer injured.

1216
01:48:59,185 --> 01:49:01,706
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1217
01:49:14,135 --> 01:49:16,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Non-negotiation and legal matters.

1218
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:21,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Union negotiations, non-unit contracts.

1219
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:25,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to go into executive session by Mr. Ruggiero?

1220
01:49:25,598 --> 01:49:26,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Ms.

1221
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:27,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot.

1222
01:49:27,438 --> 01:49:28,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote, please.

1223
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:33,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1224
01:49:36,309 --> 01:49:36,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1225
01:49:37,712 --> 01:49:38,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1226
01:49:38,032 --> 01:49:39,915
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1227
01:49:39,955 --> 01:49:40,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1228
01:49:40,677 --> 01:49:41,959
[SPEAKER_14]: We will enter executive session.

1229
01:49:42,861 --> 01:49:47,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the conclusion of executive session, we will open it up in room 207 and then exit from there.

1230
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:48,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
