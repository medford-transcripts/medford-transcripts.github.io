[SPEAKER_07]: And George Scarpelli declined to participate.

18
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The moderators for tonight's forum will be myself and Phyllis.

19
00:03:54,265 --> 00:04:01,929
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're joined by volunteers from Jumbo Vote, a nonpartisan student-run organization from the Titch College of Civic Life at Tufts University.

20
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,992
[SPEAKER_07]: The co-president of Jumbo Vote is Tegan Mastone.

21
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's volunteers also include our timekeepers, Julia Kiko, Macy D. Giuseppe, and stage managers Amy Zhao and Ella Hochman.

22
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:26,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have a volunteer from Medford High School, Jacob Yee, who will be operating the lights and providing technical assistance.

23
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:34,426
[SPEAKER_07]: The format of tonight's forum will consist of two rounds of questions and responses, with each candidate receiving one question in each round.

24
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:38,028
[SPEAKER_07]: We will then have each candidate deliver a closing statement.

25
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:48,915
[SPEAKER_07]: The order of speaking was determined by a random selection conducted earlier this week by members of the organizing committee, with candidates allowed to swap positions if they wanted to by mutual agreement.

26
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:55,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Each candidate will be allowed two minutes response time for each question and two minutes for the closing statement.

27
00:04:56,309 --> 00:05:05,471
[SPEAKER_07]: The timekeeper will display a yellow card when 15 seconds remain and a red card when time has expired.

28
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,692
[SPEAKER_07]: The moderator will then tell the candidates that time is up.

29
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now introduce each candidate.

30
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:17,594
[SPEAKER_07]: When your name is called, please stand if able, greet the audience, and then please be seated.

31
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:19,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin Tseng.

32
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:41,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Liz Mullane, Matt Lemming, Nick Guerrillo, Anna Callahan, Zach Bares, Melanie Tringali, Emily Lozaro, Miranda Prezzino, and Patrick Clerkin.

33
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:48,225
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now conduct the Q&A portion of tonight's forum.

34
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:53,987
[SPEAKER_07]: The questions will be asked in two rounds, with each candidate responding in the order previously determined.

35
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We have developed several questions for tonight's forum.

36
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:05,611
[SPEAKER_07]: The questions will be drawn from a glass bowl by one of the student volunteers and provided to the moderator, who will then ask the question to the candidate.

37
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The candidate will then have two minutes to respond as they wish.

38
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:32,646
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time as you can see Bruce is taking the questions out of an envelope and placing them into the bowl so that each candidate's question can be drawn by our student volunteer here.

39
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:42,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So our first question will be for Justin Tseng.

40
00:06:52,142 --> 00:07:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: What will you do to address residents' concerns about desensification, gentrification, and teardowns of historic homes?

41
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:18,692
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I want to thank the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Medford Community Media, and my fellow counselors for all being here and organizing this event tonight.

42
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank all of you watching at home.

43
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:26,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a Bruins game on, so we're competing with something really fun too.

44
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,375
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to your question.

45
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:34,737
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the most pivotal questions that our city is facing now.

46
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:37,938
[SPEAKER_09]: The cost of living crisis is a defining challenge of our time.

47
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it all too well.

48
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:47,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm someone who wants to stay in Medford, who's finding it tougher and tougher to stay in Medford, and so many of my classmates have been priced out and left behind.

49
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,486
[SPEAKER_09]: They're moving to New Hampshire, to Worcester, to places that they can't afford and commuting into work.

50
00:07:55,395 --> 00:08:21,047
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to gentrification, desensitization, historic buildings, we have to treat this moment as an opportunity, an opportunity to do more, to build the housing that our residents deserve and demand, to cut red tape for affordable housing, and to embrace important reforms like a historic conversion ordinance, which we can do via a comprehensive zoning process.

51
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:26,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the concerns of residents are real, and they're valid.

52
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to do more to communicate with the public about what we're doing as well.

53
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:37,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And that includes taking advantage of the resources that we've created, the listening sessions, newsletters, et cetera.

54
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:45,461
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also requires informing the public about best practices and about what we can be doing going forward.

55
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,723
[SPEAKER_09]: We can embrace zoning reform that is

56
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,225
[SPEAKER_09]: step up in many communities.

57
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:59,912
[SPEAKER_09]: We can bring mixed-use residential and commercial development to Medford and increase RSA over the process too by demanding accountability from big developers.

58
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:02,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Justin.

59
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question will be for Liz Mullane.

60
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:28,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Liz, how would you continue the work to update zoning in our squares and commercial areas to revitalize our business districts and build new housing?

61
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:29,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

62
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:30,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Phyllis.

63
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:36,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I also want to thank everyone for being here this evening and for the opportunity to speak on some of these questions.

64
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:46,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the rezoning in our commercial districts and bringing more businesses down to downtown Medford and our squares and corridors

65
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,081
[SPEAKER_01]: is incredibly important.

66
00:09:49,161 --> 00:10:03,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great opportunity for us to be able to bring in mixed use space, for people to be able to have housing, be closer, more small businesses would be able to have more people come in and be able to utilize their services or the different

67
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,566
[SPEAKER_01]: the different restaurants and bars that are there and available.

68
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:16,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is an opportunity for Medford to really be able to grow, to be able to bring new people to our community.

69
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:24,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that it's something that's really important if we're going to continue to be able to provide housing affordability for more and more individuals.

70
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:38,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for me, knowing that we're trying to look at this very strategically, we're trying to look at the different areas and really trying to focus on places where we are able to build and grow and bring in more of those different small businesses.

71
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:40,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.

72
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

73
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:42,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Liz.

74
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:42,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

75
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question is for Matt Lemming.

76
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, the city's infrastructure needs far exceed the amount of available funds.

77
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:09,414
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you see as the most effective way the city council can help the city generate more revenue to address infrastructure needs?

78
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:19,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, Villas, and I'd also like to repeat the thanks to the Democratic City Committee for hosting this forum.

79
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:28,339
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my biggest efforts this past term is updating our developer impact fee program, our linkage fee program.

80
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:42,722
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where when developers build any large developments, they have to give a certain amount to the city in order to, so that the city can update our parks, our sewers, our roads, put more money towards the police and fire department.

81
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:51,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And Medford hasn't updated that program since it was first instituted in 1990, even though they're required to update it every three years.

82
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:59,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what the city council has done is we have a bill that was engrossed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

83
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I just checked.

84
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:06,907
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on a going to a third reading in the Senate right now, which would allow us to actually update those fees proportional to

85
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:10,954
[SPEAKER_10]: with inflation.

86
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:20,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So because we haven't updated any of our linkage fees since 1990, the value of them is between one-half and one-third what they were then as they are today.

87
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:29,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this bill would enable us to actually increase that over time so that we're not just losing value and seriously undercharging developers.

88
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,447
[SPEAKER_10]: That leaves the city with less money.

89
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:36,171
[SPEAKER_10]: That leaves us with fewer resources to actually update our infrastructure and address the

90
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:56,990
[SPEAKER_10]: $67 million backlog we have in pavement repairs that we need to do a lot of this a lot of Medford's problems are money problems longer term of course we do need to update the commercial tax base that involves changing the zoning to the squares and main corridors so that we can encourage that sort of

91
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:01,414
[SPEAKER_10]: that sort of development we've already rezone Mystic Avenue.

92
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:03,336
[SPEAKER_10]: We've rezoned Salem Street.

93
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:12,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to continue that process and I'm looking forward to seeing the Medford Square and West Medford Square rezoning from the Community Development Board as well.

94
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you very much for the question.

95
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:15,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

96
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:16,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

97
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:18,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question is for Nick Galeo.

98
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I said it correctly tonight, Nick.

99
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:21,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Jaleo.

100
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:22,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaleo.

101
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

102
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,095
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

103
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:39,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, how should Medford approach the issue of minimum off-street parking requirements for residential development?

104
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:43,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the question.

105
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:48,411
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd reiterate what my fellow panelists up here have said.

106
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all for being here tonight.

107
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Parking is a key issue in Medford.

108
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:55,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Many residents are concerned about it and its availability.

109
00:13:55,595 --> 00:14:00,298
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a special concern about it given the zoning proposal on the table at the moment.

110
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:01,679
[SPEAKER_13]: How will it impact parking?

111
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:04,480
[SPEAKER_13]: have any studies been done indicating that.

112
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:06,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately the answer appears to be no.

113
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:12,028
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't really know if this massive residential rezoning plan how that's going to impact parking.

114
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:21,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And parking is very important I'd say economically and commercially for our city because it encourages people to go to our businesses and spend money at our businesses when it's available.

115
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:25,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford Square for example is significantly problematic because of the lack of parking.

116
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,867
[SPEAKER_13]: You go there where you put your car.

117
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,228
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you go to the businesses.

118
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,291
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really do have to take another look at parking and do much better with it.

119
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:39,856
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to make sure parking is available throughout the city in the event we pass any zoning changes.

120
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:41,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a priority for me.

121
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,759
[SPEAKER_13]: I want studies done.

122
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:54,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I want input from residents and I want to make sure that we just accept the reality too that you know people have cars and not everybody drives a car but people have cars and they need a place to put the car.

123
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to make sure we have places for that.

124
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,951
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my answer.

125
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:58,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

126
00:14:58,872 --> 00:14:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

127
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question will be for Anna Callahan.

128
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: The Commonwealth recently enacted policies to require auxiliary dwelling units and multifamily and designated transit zones to help address the housing shortage and cost of housing.

129
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:28,898
[SPEAKER_04]: What additional options would you support to reduce housing costs.

130
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:31,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

131
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:38,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to thank you for putting on this event and also everyone who is here, everyone who is watching.

132
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for the question.

133
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:48,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the state really has taken these steps to allow ADUs, those are accessory dwelling units, so that means

134
00:15:48,590 --> 00:16:05,780
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want for your parents to move back in with you as they're aging, if you want to just have a little part of your home that you can have available to rent out to a family member or to someone, that you are able to do that.

135
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is something that the state has mandated.

136
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we will be doing that as a city.

137
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, multifamily near these high transit

138
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,536
[SPEAKER_06]: the areas, so that'll be near the Green Line stations, the commuter rail station, and

139
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:36,058
[SPEAKER_06]: In Medford, one of our issues is that the vast majority of the people who live here, I think it's around 68, 69%, are one- or two-person households.

140
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:43,123
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have only about less than 20% of our homes are studio or one-bedroom homes.

141
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:47,447
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of four- and five-bedroom homes.

142
00:16:48,868 --> 00:17:00,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of those are occupied by a bunch of young professionals living together because it's the only way that they can afford to live here.

143
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:10,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that we're hoping to do with some of the mixed use development in Mystic Ave and in some of the areas near transit

144
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:27,254
[SPEAKER_06]: is to allow people to take like a five bedroom home or, you know, I live in South Medford right now, some of these two families, and convert them into homes that have, you know, a house that might have a single family to a two family or a two family to a three family.

145
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:32,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that will help us with affordability and also just with the housing crisis.

146
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:32,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

147
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:32,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

148
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question will be for Zach Beres.

149
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:40,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope it's zoning.

150
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We put all of the questions into the bowl.

151
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,660
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot help how they come out.

152
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not touch them, so it is yes.

153
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:52,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you, Zach.

154
00:17:56,736 --> 00:18:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Zach, what is your position regarding greater civilian oversight or an independent review board for policing issues?

155
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Not zoning.

156
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:19,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we've seen civilian review or community review board for police in several communities here in Massachusetts and in other communities.

157
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:25,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Really having residents directly involved in reviewing police policies and practices is an important thing.

158
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:40,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been, I think, really lucky here in Medford to have had some leadership in our police department that has done some good work on updating policies and building a culture and addressing some past problems in policing.

159
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:45,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to talk about the Memorial Day bank heist or anything like that back in the 80s.

160
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a long, long way from that culturally.

161
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:52,168
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that connection is really important, having residents directly involved.

162
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:57,835
[SPEAKER_08]: so that they understand what our police policies and practices are and that they have a role in making them.

163
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:02,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely support creating a civilian review board for that purpose.

164
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

165
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question will be for Melanie Tringali.

166
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:35,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie, what is your position regarding the creation of historic districts to protect the fabric of some residential neighborhoods from developers who might replace this current single family home with a maximally large structure that revised zoning might allow?

167
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat that question one last time?

168
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty long one.

169
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:41,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I will.

170
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to repeat it.

171
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:43,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

172
00:19:44,681 --> 00:20:00,630
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your position regarding the creation of historic districts to protect the fabric of some residential neighborhood from developers who might replace a current single family home with a maximally large structure

173
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,231
[SPEAKER_04]: that revised zoning might allow.

174
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

175
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:09,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for having this again, having this forum.

176
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:13,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was on the Historic District Commission for two years.

177
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a huge believer in preserving our history in the city of Medford.

178
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually own a home that's built in 1850 and worked tirelessly to reconstruct it and redevelop it as a single family home.

179
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that we should preserve our history.

180
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a beautiful history here in the city of Medford, and we should be preserving our homes.

181
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:55,643
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I do believe that there should be some incentives to make those homes into multifamily homes as long as they stay within the structure of the historic nature of the neighborhood.

182
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Melanie.

183
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

184
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And our next question will be for Emily Lazaro.

185
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Emily, should there be a role that the city council can play in creating a self and welcoming environment for LGBTQ plus members of our community?

186
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:25,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Phyllis.

187
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for having us.

188
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:37,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I do believe that there's a role that the city council can play to make marginalized people of all types in Medford feel welcome.

189
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:50,447
[SPEAKER_12]: As an example, this past term, Councillor Seng and I wrote an ordinance to help shore up the rights of some folks whose

190
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:59,271
[SPEAKER_12]: who were under threat by the federal presidential administration of having some of their health care being removed.

191
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:15,980
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Health Care Ordinance, which stated that anybody who was receiving health care, trans people and women who were receiving health care

192
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:21,045
[SPEAKER_12]: that may be deemed inappropriate by the federal administration.

193
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:26,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Those people receiving the health care and people dispensing it would not be prosecuted in Medford.

194
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,951
[SPEAKER_12]: To whatever extent we can protect those rights, we wanted to make sure that we could.

195
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:36,854
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's because people in the community were asking for that, for those protections.

196
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,741
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of ways that people in a community can make other people feel safe.

197
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:54,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that we can do as a city council is we can say we can respond to people who ask us to do things for them in an official capacity.

198
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,569
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is it's a statement about.

199
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:06,106
[SPEAKER_12]: what we believe in and what we care about and how we can show up for the people who live here when they ask us to.

200
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:10,867
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that way, I believe that the city council has a role to play.

201
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:25,251
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also believe that any time that a resident comes to the city council and says, I feel afraid or I feel that I am in danger in some way and I would like you to help me feel safer, I think it's important that we do that.

202
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:26,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

203
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:27,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Emily.

204
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We will next hear from Miranda Riseno.

205
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say it correctly?

206
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Riseno.

207
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:35,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Riseno.

208
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:35,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yo.

209
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Riseno.

210
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:38,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

211
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:39,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is your question.

212
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:54,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Miranda, we have a significant road and sidewalk repair backlog.

213
00:23:55,158 --> 00:24:03,221
[SPEAKER_04]: The new road repair crew hired with the override funding of 5,000K per year will help do repairs more efficiently, but it's not sufficient.

214
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,382
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you propose to tackle the backlog?

215
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:09,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat that one more time?

216
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

217
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course I can.

218
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:15,431
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a significant road and sidewalk repair backlog.

219
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:24,524
[SPEAKER_04]: The new road repair crew hired with the override funding of 500K per year will help us do repairs more efficiently but is not sufficient.

220
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,328
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you propose we tackle the backlog?

221
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:29,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the question.

222
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.

223
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:39,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, the new hard roadway repair crew is really just going to make a small dent in the large issue.

224
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know to be true that our sidewalks and our roads are in a state of disrepair.

225
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:46,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something I handle at work professionally at MassDOT.

226
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:51,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's something to be said for more strategically using grant funding from the state.

227
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:57,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor did just increase our chapter 90 funds, which is for surface transportation improvements.

228
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really coming up with a plan.

229
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:04,835
[SPEAKER_02]: making that plan really visible and clear to residents at the doors.

230
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:13,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of folks who are seeing infrastructure repair happen but aren't clear as to when or why it's happening.

231
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:16,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really making that more clear to residents.

232
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Our D.P.W.

233
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:19,814
[SPEAKER_02]: staff is absolutely trying their best and right now

234
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:27,139
[SPEAKER_02]: while they're waiting to get those new hires on board are really just patching band-aids as much as they can.

235
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So really strategically using grant funding, going after more grant funding, making sure that we are both addressing the emergencies and the urgent need of our infrastructure that's really bad, and also making a plan to maintain that infrastructure in a state of good repair.

236
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:48,051
[SPEAKER_02]: When we make that clear, when we've set that forth in a plan and say,

237
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: when this sidewalk gets to 80% of its useful life, i.e.

238
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: it's starting to deteriorate already, let's make a plan to address it now rather than when it gets to 50% because then we're paying more.

239
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:08,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really investing in that and then also looking to not just patch the band-aids but also

240
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:09,953
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we make things better?

241
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so many sidewalks I know around me and Hillside don't have curb ramps.

242
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:20,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm lucky enough to be able to get around that as a young person, someone who's able-bodied, but that's not true for everyone.

243
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:25,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're, you know, all going to get older and have different abilities.

244
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really thinking about that as we're also investing in repairs.

245
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

246
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next question will be for Patrick Lurken.

247
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:48,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick, recently the city released a proposal for new residential zoning.

248
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,234
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been met with mixed reactions.

249
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you modify the current proposal to address this?

250
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And would you like me to repeat the question?

251
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,060
[SPEAKER_11]: No, thank you.

252
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

253
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

254
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:06,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Without getting into the deep details of wording, I think that overall one of the big issues is of balance.

255
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:19,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there are people in various neighborhoods who feel like their sections of the city are the local equivalent of flyover states, and I've seen that myself walking around the city.

256
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:22,386
[SPEAKER_11]: There's areas of the city that people don't go to harvest votes.

257
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,187
[SPEAKER_11]: They've never seen a candidate there.

258
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:33,534
[SPEAKER_11]: There's places that are basically, we've heard the term food deserts, we've heard the term banking deserts, basically information deserts in the city.

259
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:44,182
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think that one of the big steps towards engaging the neighborhoods and actually balancing the needs of the neighborhoods with the needs of the city overall

260
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:58,786
[SPEAKER_11]: is having some physical gathering points like bulletin boards, not just the bulletin boards that you see in the laundromats or kind of randomly scattered about, but some known locations.

261
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:01,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think that it would help to

262
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:13,353
[SPEAKER_11]: bring forward some of the projects that are happening in the city onto the main page of the website so that there are quick links and guideposts for people.

263
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:19,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would allow more leadership to emerge in the various parts of the city.

264
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:25,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would also be a step forward for the charter, which is on the ballot in November.

265
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:31,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it happens, whether it doesn't, we need local leadership in the wards and in the neighborhoods.

266
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,382
[SPEAKER_11]: All of those things combined, I think if we get that right, we get the money in the coffers.

267
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:42,845
[SPEAKER_11]: If we get the money in the coffers, we fix the streets, we get the high school we want, we get all this other stuff.

268
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an engineer by background, so I like getting into the root causes.

269
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:52,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see all these things as comprehensive and intertwined.

270
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be how I would approach it comprehensively.

271
00:28:57,573 --> 00:28:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Patrick.

272
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:00,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you bring the mic back now?

273
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:07,889
[SPEAKER_04]: While the mic's being brought back, I want to inform or remind the audience that these questions were all submitted to us.

274
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:16,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee asked for input from city residents, and that's where the questions came from, and we put them into categories.

275
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want everyone to know that these are from the residents.

276
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, good job, residents.

277
00:29:22,357 --> 00:29:22,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

278
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:27,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That concludes the first round of questions.

279
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,740
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now proceed to round two.

280
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,663
[SPEAKER_07]: We have replaced the questions in the jar with a separate set for round two that will include different topics.

281
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,625
[SPEAKER_07]: The first question goes to Justin Tsang.

282
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:51,773
[SPEAKER_07]: The new charter would give the city ward representation on city council a four-year term for mayor with four-term limit

283
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:56,224
[SPEAKER_07]: and the ability of the school committee to elect its own chair, among other things.

284
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:59,686
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your position regarding passage of the new charter?

285
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I support the new charter.

286
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:03,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted for it to pass through city council.

287
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:13,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, there was a lively debate that got quite substantive into the details, but I think when we're talking about the foundational document for our city, it's really important to consider every detail.

288
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:18,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to leave it to residents at home to make their own decision on this.

289
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:25,736
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I think this new charter does is give neighborhoods more representation, which I think we need from my own perspective.

290
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:33,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a lot easier to sort through constituent cases when we know which counselor is in charge of which part of the city.

291
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:38,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a model that will boost representation with

292
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:45,084
[SPEAKER_09]: minorities with people who have traditionally been overlooked in the process and neighborhoods that have been traditionally overlooked in the process.

293
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Going forward, we'll have to keep an eye on whether this new charter works if it passes.

294
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:59,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why there's also a five-year review built into the charter so that we can keep an eye on those details and work through deeper conversations about what works and what doesn't work.

295
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:01,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Justin.

296
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:03,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question is for Liz Mullane.

297
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:21,458
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you approach your role in oversight, funding, and collaboration with the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee to ensure a transparent and fiscally sound process?

298
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:22,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

299
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:23,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bruce.

300
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:36,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the work that the school committee has been doing right now, as they've been working to try to pull together information about pulling a new Medford High School, is incredibly important.

301
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:51,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's something that is absolutely needed and something that we need to, as a community, really understand what's available for us and to be able to work with the district and be able to work with our colleagues to figure out

302
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,445
[SPEAKER_01]: how best to be able to provide funding.

303
00:31:54,465 --> 00:32:03,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as we're sitting here in the building now, when I've gone to doors and I've spoken to parents, I think it's a huge concern.

304
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:10,001
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to make sure that we have the money and the availability to be able to provide for our schools and for our students.

305
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:17,667
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who works in higher ed and serves as an adjunct faculty member, I know firsthand just how important that is.

306
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:26,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do believe that being able to invest in our students and making sure that they have everything that they need to be successful is incredibly important.

307
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:33,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the school committee is going through all the due diligence to ensure that they put together the right plan and the right things needed.

308
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:37,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's a new high school, then that's something I'm completely behind.

309
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Liz.

310
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question is for Matt Lemming.

311
00:32:52,755 --> 00:33:04,600
[SPEAKER_07]: What specific steps should the city take to support small businesses and local entrepreneurs while ensuring Medford's growth remains responsible, sustainable, and aligned with the needs of residents and the community?

312
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

313
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:10,022
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of that really

314
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:18,941
[SPEAKER_10]: It does come down to, in terms of the levers that the City Council has to pull, zoning our commercial districts and corridors.

315
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:24,084
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been kind of an issue that a lot of parts of our current zoning code are not clear.

316
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:31,146
[SPEAKER_10]: We also need to bolster staffing, particularly within the planning department.

317
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:39,510
[SPEAKER_10]: We did get, in this past term, we got an economic development director as well as an assistant economic development director who had been working.

318
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,072
[SPEAKER_10]: who's been working in the planning department for eight months.

319
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:54,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a really important role to sort of help small businesses that may have no experience with Medford and tell them these are what permits you need.

320
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,661
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the steps you need to take to actually open up a small business.

321
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So really approaching that from City Hall as a sort of

322
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:05,269
[SPEAKER_10]: customer facing role when new businesses want to come into the city.

323
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:23,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And improving, I mean, improving relations with a lot of the, I would say, the folks who own many of the vacant storefronts and incentivizing them strongly to not let storefronts sit there and not be used for months, years at a time.

324
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:28,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Me and Councillor Lazar and myself are working on

325
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:37,931
[SPEAKER_10]: an ordinance that would be able to disincentivize that moving forward, but we're still hammering out the specific details.

326
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:51,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, Medford just needs to do a million different things to become a more friendly business environment, and I could sort of keep going down the list of things I think we could do better, but I do only have two minutes on this stage.

327
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:56,978
[SPEAKER_10]: But overall, I'd just like to say thank you very much for the question, and I'll pass it on.

328
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:58,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Matt.

329
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,939
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question goes to Nick Girelio.

330
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Closer, Girelio.

331
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Girelio, thank you.

332
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:06,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

333
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:11,565
[SPEAKER_10]: You can call me Nick G, too.

334
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:12,266
[SPEAKER_07]: That's insulting.

335
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:23,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Please explain your position on whether using free cash to cover operating expenses is a fiscally sound policy and why.

336
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,003
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a very good question.

337
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:36,129
[SPEAKER_13]: So for those who don't know, free cash might sound like something wonderful and magical, but essentially it's over-budgeted money that the city over-budgets in a given year.

338
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:46,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And with the debate over whether or not we should pass our Proposition 2.5 overrides that we had just about a year ago, there was a lot of discussion about free cash and its viability.

339
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:51,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So the important thing to know about free cash is it's a limited amount of money and

340
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:55,579
[SPEAKER_13]: If we spend too much of it too quickly, it affects our city's bond rating.

341
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,141
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to be intelligent about it, and typically it's only used for one-time expenditures.

342
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:07,986
[SPEAKER_13]: That said, though, my position with the overrides was that free cash could have been used smarter to meet our spending needs and avoid

343
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:15,111
[SPEAKER_13]: having to essentially hike taxes and put a significant burden on residents to meet our spending needs.

344
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:19,374
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we can use free cash much more intelligently.

345
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:21,736
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be my position going forward.

346
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:27,540
[SPEAKER_13]: We can use it to meet our spending needs while also not raising concerns about our city's credit.

347
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,641
[SPEAKER_13]: So, free cash is out there.

348
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,521
[SPEAKER_13]: It is an option.

349
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:43,168
[SPEAKER_13]: And really, you know, my position with any sort of, you know, need for tax hikes in the future has been, you know, we should really, really look at every other alternative before we put that burden on residents.

350
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:44,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're struggling.

351
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:50,131
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a huge cost of living crisis out there and taxes are going up and rents are going up and people are really having a hard time.

352
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:54,174
[SPEAKER_13]: So, let's look at every other option before we put that burden on residents.

353
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:54,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

354
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Nick.

355
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:02,460
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question goes to Anna Callahan.

356
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:14,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford has many heat islands, a diminished tree canopy, and areas vulnerable to flooding.

357
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:21,598
[SPEAKER_07]: What is one specific action you would like to take to address climate change risk for Medford, and how would you pay for it?

358
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:23,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

359
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:28,517
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually an area that is of particular importance to me.

360
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I am shepherding three tree ordinances through the city council.

361
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:38,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also been pushing for us to have to add green score incentives to our zoning.

362
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:43,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing I want to talk about most is my volunteer tree

363
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:47,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Planting initiative where I have a team of volunteers.

364
00:37:47,614 --> 00:38:00,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I have five teams of volunteers So if you want to work with me on something I always try to engage the community in making our city better and one of my teams of volunteers is working to create events

365
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:01,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're working with the city.

366
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:11,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be having events where neighbors get together in a sort of party to retree our most barren blocks which happens to the heat islands.

367
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:16,339
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens to mostly that residentially happens to be in South Medford.

368
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm currently living in a block that has only one tree.

369
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:24,303
[SPEAKER_06]: The one next to me has zero trees on the entire block, no sidewalk trees.

370
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be creating these wonderful community events that are going to retree our blocks.

371
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:39,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And the wonderful thing is that it's going to cost the city very little because it's mostly the cost of planting trees is mostly labor.

372
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So having our residents perform that joyfully in fun events and be able to make that happen is going to save our city a lot of money.

373
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:52,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor has agreed to take the funds for the actual trees out of our free cash, our savings account.

374
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it will cost the city very little.

375
00:38:55,723 --> 00:39:00,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping that that will be something that we just continue to do year after year.

376
00:39:00,186 --> 00:39:08,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine getting together with your neighbors and planting trees and then being able to watch those trees on your own block grow for decades.

377
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:10,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

378
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:11,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Anna.

379
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,141
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question is for Zach Baird.

380
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,784
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your position on the current divestment policy recently vetoed by the mayor?

381
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:38,430
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you monitor and enforce it without undermining the city's fiscal flexibility or return on investments?

382
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, if you don't agree with it, what alternative ethical investment criteria, if any, would you propose?

383
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:46,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

384
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I am the sponsor and I've led the effort on this ordinance.

385
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It is been crafted over the last 10 months or so.

386
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:56,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I've met with the city treasurer.

387
00:39:56,922 --> 00:40:16,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I've met with the chair of the board of trust fund commissioners, met with the chief of staff, met with many people on this ordinance to craft a policy that really fits our city's values, that makes sure that we're investing our public funds intelligently and not into

388
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:19,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Industries of destruction and violence.

389
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:25,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's something anyone wants here in our city When we've looked at it, you know

390
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We have gotten legal review from KP Law.

391
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,638
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gotten legal opinions from a number of sources.

392
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:38,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had a lot of meetings that have incorporated the legal comments from city legal advisors.

393
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:43,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's pretty clear that this is an eminently enforceable and clear policy.

394
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:48,208
[SPEAKER_08]: There are not many city funds that are actually right now invested in

395
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:59,476
[SPEAKER_08]: oil companies, weapons manufacturers, people who are making profits from private prisons, companies that are committing human rights violations across the world.

396
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:06,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We've actually, in the ordinance, included a condition, a set of conditions from Morgan Stanley.

397
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:12,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we think this is some radical thing, Morgan Stanley's conditions are the ones that we're using.

398
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Wall Street investment firm.

399
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:21,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Because even on Wall Street, they know that our money should not be put into these companies that are committing violence.

400
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And that it's actually not a good return for residents.

401
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:31,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The ordinance includes a fiduciary responsibility following all of the relevant state laws.

402
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:36,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my conversations with the city treasurer, this is easy to enforce.

403
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:43,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't appreciate the veto and I think we'll work through it collaboratively as I've worked through collaboratively with the mayor on many issues.

404
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:44,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

405
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to note that at this time Carol Caravaglia has joined us on stage.

406
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,594
[SPEAKER_07]: She will be delivering Rick Caravaglia's closing statements shortly.

407
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,756
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question goes to Melanie Tringale.

408
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:15,694
[SPEAKER_07]: What city department do you feel is most in need of significant increase in its budget for the next fiscal year and why?

409
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:20,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a tough one.

410
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've always been talking about our streets and sidewalks, our infrastructure, and our fire and police.

411
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely think that we need more money in those.

412
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be focusing on our streets and our sidewalks.

413
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in serious disrepair.

414
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:55,968
[SPEAKER_03]: From the sidewalk perspective, we have senior citizens, disabled people that find it very difficult to walk.

415
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:02,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known several people that have fallen and fell and have hurt themselves pretty seriously.

416
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:04,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that is one.

417
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that the fire department needs some serious funding.

418
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:16,096
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to really need to look at what we're going to do to help them in their fire, in their fire department area.

419
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say those two areas.

420
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:21,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of needs and we need to figure out how we're going to support all those needs.

421
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:22,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

422
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:23,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

423
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,601
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question goes to Emily Lazaro.

424
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:43,382
[SPEAKER_07]: What specific tools, meetings, or outreach methods will you use to strengthen communication and engagement with the community?

425
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:45,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Bruce.

426
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:53,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Something we do as part of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee on City Council right now is

427
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:59,873
[SPEAKER_12]: something that we call listening sessions that was an initiative of the committee this term.

428
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:13,042
[SPEAKER_12]: The one thing that we do consistently every month is the fourth Thursday of the month one member of the committee will be at the senior center offering a listening session.

429
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:21,208
[SPEAKER_12]: We're there for an hour and it's open to the public and people can come and tell a city councilor

430
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:41,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Items of concern, we hear consistently about the roads, about parking, about cost of living issues, about taxes, about a lot of things that are, even things about people's own property, things they need help with, connecting at City Hall.

431
00:44:42,648 --> 00:44:50,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Listening sessions have been a big success and I would love to expand that to reach other aspects of the community.

432
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:57,662
[SPEAKER_12]: That just happens to be the senior center is a great consistent place that people are always present.

433
00:44:58,137 --> 00:45:01,339
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's easy to get into their newsletter.

434
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,522
[SPEAKER_12]: So that committee also has a monthly newsletter that we've released.

435
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:05,823
[SPEAKER_12]: We started doing that this term.

436
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Members of the committee are also here.

437
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Singh, Councilor Lemming is the chair.

438
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:14,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan is also on the committee.

439
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:21,274
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been pushing to try to have a lot more transparency.

440
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:25,217
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have staff to communicate these things out.

441
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:27,298
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just do it ourselves.

442
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody works for us except for the city clerk's office and they also have to do all the marriage licenses and everything.

443
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:36,985
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's more to do and we're excited to keep doing it.

444
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:38,146
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to keep doing it.

445
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very eager to do more outreach in another term.

446
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

447
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Emily.

448
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:51,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to remind the candidates at this time to refrain from invoking the names of other candidates in their responses.

449
00:45:52,037 --> 00:45:52,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

450
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,476
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question goes to Miranda Roseña.

451
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:02,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I say that right?

452
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:04,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.

453
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:06,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

454
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:12,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, it's really fine.

455
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't be, you're not the first, you're not the last.

456
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.

457
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking ahead five to ten years, what is your vision for Medford's future?

458
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:26,023
[SPEAKER_07]: What role do you see the city council playing in helping us get there?

459
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:38,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Five to ten years, I would say a big, so many things really.

460
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,503
[SPEAKER_02]: actual, if it doesn't exist now, making sure it exists and it's obvious to residents.

461
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:59,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Sidewalk and road maintenance, annual plans and status updates, flatter sidewalks, maintain sidewalks, sidewalks with curb ramps, with bus benches and places to rest.

462
00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:08,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I take the bus and the T every day to work and if anyone takes the Green Line, you know just how hot it gets on Boston Ave.

463
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:10,834
[SPEAKER_02]: when the sun is beating down and you're walking down that way.

464
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:23,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really investing in the trees and all the things that kind of make it, make the foundation of the things that connect us to each other a lot more inviting and a lot easier.

465
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially too around our squares.

466
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:34,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So many folks I've talked to on the campaign trail have mentioned, we all know how much we love Medford Square, West Medford Square, and all of our squares.

467
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But for folks who might just be coming in for one visit at a night,

468
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:56,789
[SPEAKER_02]: for the show at the Chevalier or whatnot might not always see that and so really investing in better trash cans and upkeep and simple things like planters and really making the built environment more inviting around our squares, around the centers of our community like the library, the senior center.

469
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:04,930
[SPEAKER_02]: and making those a lot more places to be, even though we know that they already are.

470
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:11,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And just those little improvements, I would really want to see really improved roadway safety initiatives.

471
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:16,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had two pedestrian deaths in Medford this year, both elderly gentlemen.

472
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:25,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really investing in the infrastructure that we know that helps keep pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users safe, like speed bumps,

473
00:48:25,938 --> 00:48:33,130
[SPEAKER_02]: But crosswalk bump outs and better visibility for all vulnerable road users so that both drivers and pedestrians are safe.

474
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:35,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Miranda.

475
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And the final question tonight goes to Patrick Clurkin.

476
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:52,776
[SPEAKER_07]: If elected to Medford City Council, what is your top priority for the city?

477
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,239
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you plan to turn this into action?

478
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And what specific steps will you take to make measurable progress about that within your term?

479
00:49:02,348 --> 00:49:07,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've been a broken record on the issue of communication, so I'll stick with that.

480
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:16,129
[SPEAKER_11]: The main things that I would like addressed, or how I would address it, are some of the ones that I mentioned previously.

481
00:49:16,749 --> 00:49:27,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Neighborhood bulletin boards are a big thing, some physical infrastructure, because there's people in the community who aren't as aware of the technological updates that are put out there.

482
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:29,173
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll just say that in general.

483
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:36,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that just because something is put on the website, and we do have a great new website, it doesn't mean it's beamed into everybody's head immediately.

484
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if you have to go,

485
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:40,939
[SPEAKER_11]: searching for it, you don't know what you don't know.

486
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So you really have to stumble upon it.

487
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:51,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So the physical infrastructure and then the digital infrastructure on the main page of the website, I think we have to be clear with our processes.

488
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:54,009
[SPEAKER_11]: In some cases, we don't even have processes.

489
00:49:54,930 --> 00:50:00,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So some process diagrams so people can follow along as to where we are in a given process.

490
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:04,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think that just in general, people have talked about

491
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,440
[SPEAKER_11]: how having body cams on police officers.

492
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:20,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not advocating having body cams on politicians or government officials, but I do think that the equivalent of that would be having open databases, like tracking databases, so people could follow along with

493
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:27,515
[SPEAKER_11]: projects that are happening and really see where things are and to see how the priorities are shifting.

494
00:50:28,135 --> 00:50:38,989
[SPEAKER_11]: If that doesn't exist right now and if some of the government officials feel like they would be squeamish about that because it would kind of put them front and center,

495
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:44,370
[SPEAKER_11]: It might actually hold them accountable in ways that's good for both the public and them.

496
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:58,353
[SPEAKER_11]: With the body cam example for the police, originally the police were concerned and then a lot of officers said that it actually sort of makes their job easier in a lot of ways because it puts the footage out there for other people.

497
00:50:58,413 --> 00:50:59,674
[SPEAKER_11]: So something like that.

498
00:51:01,454 --> 00:51:03,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a work in progress of an idea.

499
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:04,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Patrick.

500
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

501
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:14,695
[SPEAKER_04]: This concludes the question and answer portion of tonight's forum.

502
00:51:15,116 --> 00:51:25,263
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, each one of the candidates will have two minutes to make some comments to the residents here in the hall and people listening to the live stream or watching on television.

503
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:29,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The candidates will come to the podium.

504
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:33,929
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I ask each candidate to do is if you're tall, raise the mic.

505
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:40,706
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're short, lower the mic so that it can be picked up, the sound can be picked up.

506
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to thank the candidates.

507
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:47,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've done a wonderful job of answering the residents' questions.

508
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the citizens for their questions, and I want to thank you for your full attention.

509
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:56,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this time, we're going to reverse the order that we had for questions.

510
00:51:57,115 --> 00:52:00,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start closing remarks with Patrick Clerkin,

511
00:52:01,337 --> 00:52:07,723
[SPEAKER_04]: When Mr. Caraviello's spot will be, I think, fourth, we'll have his wife come to the podium and she will speak on his behalf.

512
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:11,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So Patrick, whenever you're ready, if you could come to the podium.

513
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

514
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Long time no see.

515
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:37,553
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess that I'll start off by saying that like water seeks level, I seek common ground.

516
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:38,593
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in my nature.

517
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:43,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I would bring to city council, first and foremost.

518
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:48,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the character, I have the work ethic, and I have the competence.

519
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:55,178
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you need proof of that, I recommend looking at my campaign website.

520
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:11,292
[SPEAKER_11]: 44 character references from people throughout my life, neighbors, friends, co-workers, and I also have posted ideas across my social media profiles to demonstrate that

521
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,954
[SPEAKER_11]: basically to demonstrate my approach, how I look at things.

522
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:29,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And the areas that I want to focus on are areas that I've mentioned before, communications primarily, the city budget, and the zoning and development, because I see those three as the core issues.

523
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:34,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if we get those right, it pays dividends into the other issues.

524
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:38,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I suppose I'll leave it at that.

525
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:41,029
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the temperament I bring.

526
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm calm.

527
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:43,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm collected.

528
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:44,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm respectful.

529
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:46,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm nonpartisan.

530
00:53:46,513 --> 00:53:47,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm nonideological.

531
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:56,300
[SPEAKER_11]: So I truly go across the aisle in all ways, generationally, demographically, geographically, whatever.

532
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:01,784
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really want to bring Medford together, build bridges, and just

533
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:09,223
[SPEAKER_11]: get past the kind of general nastiness out there and get neighbours talking to neighbours again.

534
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:09,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

535
00:54:19,352 --> 00:54:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Patrick.

536
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:25,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to call Miranda Bresnio to the podium, please.

537
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,031
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.

538
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:48,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running for Medford City Council because I believe the city we live in should reflect all of us, all of who we are, and serve all of us.

539
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud to call Medford home, and like many of you, I felt the pressure of rising housing costs and the stress of trying to build a future in a changing world.

540
00:54:57,618 --> 00:55:00,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what it's like not just to live here, but to want to stay here.

541
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:03,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I want to build a Medford where everyone belongs.

542
00:55:04,944 --> 00:55:13,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve a city that invests in the public places that connect us, our schools, parks, and library, places where everyone can gather, learn, and feel at home.

543
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:17,915
[SPEAKER_02]: As a renter, I've experienced firsthand how hard it is to stay here.

544
00:55:18,756 --> 00:55:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We must strengthen and fund the Affordable Housing Trust, hold developers accountable for building truly affordable homes, and require better community benefits when they do build here.

545
00:55:28,504 --> 00:55:33,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to protect residents from displacement so elders can age in place and everyone can put down roots.

546
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:40,114
[SPEAKER_02]: A truly safe Medford is one where no one is left behind, and it starts with care and prevention.

547
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:49,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That means investing in an unarmed mental health crisis response team, in harm reduction and social services, and protecting our immigrant neighbors from ICE.

548
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety also means making our roads and sidewalks safe for everyone, for those who walk, bike, roll, or ride.

549
00:55:56,742 --> 00:56:02,865
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past five years, Medford has seen dozens of serious crashes, and we must treat traffic violence like the emergency it is.

550
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:06,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring more than ideas, I bring experience.

551
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:16,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped design Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, and at MassDOT, I connect communities to funding for the major projects that make our streets safer and more accessible across the state.

552
00:56:19,202 --> 00:56:22,705
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of all, I bring my heart and my commitment to this work and to our city.

553
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:27,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Medford, and I love the people who make it vibrant, diverse, and resilient.

554
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:33,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Together, we can build a Medford that works for everyone, a city where every person feels safe, seen, and supported.

555
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:37,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to meeting you, hearing from you, and hopefully earning your vote in November.

556
00:56:38,037 --> 00:56:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

557
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to call Emily Lazaro to the podium.

558
00:57:01,137 --> 00:57:03,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for being here tonight and for your civic engagement.

559
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:09,665
[SPEAKER_12]: I am running for reelection to Medford City Council because my work has just begun.

560
00:57:09,685 --> 00:57:19,734
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to continuing to protect Medford because the work of government, in my opinion, is to take care of those of us who need the most help right now.

561
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:24,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all been in a position where we could have used a little extra help and we will be again.

562
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:34,924
[SPEAKER_12]: As a city councilor, that looks like protecting residents from federal overreach by shoring up their rights to bodily autonomy at a time when federal policies are changing.

563
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:46,351
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like keeping our pedestrians and cyclists safe on our streets, funding our schools, and using creative strategies to increase revenue so we can help as many people thrive as possible.

564
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody deserves to love where they live, and someone who works tirelessly for their community.

565
00:57:52,932 --> 00:58:02,736
[SPEAKER_12]: You can count on me to continue to put in the work to keep residents safe and healthy, bring businesses to Medford, and ensure all those who call Medford home can afford to stay here.

566
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:14,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It is my duty and my honor as an elected representative to do that work, and I would relish the opportunity to do it together in partnership with all of you, no matter who you are, for another two years.

567
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:14,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

568
00:58:21,008 --> 00:58:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, I'll call Carol Caraviello, who is speaking for candidate Rick Caraviello.

569
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the committee and everybody here that's in attendance.

570
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Caravello has dedicated more than three decades of service to Medford.

571
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:51,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, Rick has been a consistent advocate for strong neighborhoods, responsible development, and transparent government.

572
00:58:53,125 --> 00:59:08,090
[SPEAKER_00]: He has stood firmly against radical zoning schemes that threaten the character of Memphis communities while supporting thoughtful commercial growth that strengthens, not overwhelms, our city.

573
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:16,473
[SPEAKER_00]: He has pushed for investments in infrastructure because he knows that strong foundations make for a stronger city.

574
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:31,854
[SPEAKER_00]: His proudest accomplishments were being the leader in delivering Meffitt's state-of-the-art public library, art center, projects that have already become a cornerstone for learning, culture, and community life.

575
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:45,022
[SPEAKER_00]: This achievement reflects his belief that a thriving city must invest not only in roads and schools, but also in the culture and educational space that brings people together.

576
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:54,677
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been an advocate for education, fighting to deliver a new high school with facilities and resources our students deserve.

577
00:59:56,998 --> 01:00:06,582
[SPEAKER_00]: He has prioritized services for seniors, veterans and residents in need, ensuring that Meffitt remains a city where every generation is supported.

578
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:14,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking ahead, his vision is clear, a method that thrives through balanced growth, safe streets, and efficient city services.

579
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:26,295
[SPEAKER_00]: He believes in restoring accountability by bringing back weekly council meetings, fully staffing public safety departments so that everyday services are reliable.

580
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:38,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Above all, he is committed to listening to residents, protecting Meffitt's character in building a city government that is open, responsive, and focused on the people it serves.

581
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:50,631
[SPEAKER_00]: With a proven record and unwavering dedication, he offers Meffitt not only just experience, but a vision rooted in community, accountability, and progress.

582
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:51,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

583
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:00,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we'd like to call Melanie Tringali.

584
01:01:00,696 --> 01:01:08,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

585
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the Medford Democratic City Committee for hosting tonight's forum.

586
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:16,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for being here and those that are watching on TV tonight.

587
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for the candidates for being here.

588
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:24,966
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, running for city council is not an easy job.

589
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:26,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work.

590
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:34,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to, it's a lot of work, so I appreciate all of you, too, in trying to serve our city.

591
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:38,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running for city council because I love this city.

592
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:39,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been living here for 30 years.

593
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:41,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my home.

594
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:48,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that it needs a leadership that truly focuses on what makes Medford special.

595
01:01:50,231 --> 01:01:56,356
[SPEAKER_03]: My campaign has really been focused on a couple of things, mostly the rezoning and protecting our neighborhoods.

596
01:01:57,097 --> 01:01:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been living here for 30 years.

597
01:01:58,658 --> 01:01:59,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my neighborhoods.

598
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:00,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the community that we have.

599
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:03,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep it that way.

600
01:02:04,483 --> 01:02:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: People move here for a reason.

601
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,768
[SPEAKER_03]: They move here to the neighborhoods and we need to keep them.

602
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,250
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I've been focused on is our streets and sidewalks.

603
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that our streets and sidewalks need to be fixed.

604
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:26,456
[SPEAKER_03]: The sidewalks, I had to help a senior citizen the other day cross one side of Medford Square to the other side of Medford Square because she couldn't maneuver it on her own.

605
01:02:27,197 --> 01:02:32,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do that for our senior citizens and for those that are not as well physically challenged.

606
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,821
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to support our first responders.

607
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:41,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fire and police are important for keeping us safe.

608
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:49,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fire department is living in quarters that are not livable and need to be updated.

609
01:02:50,705 --> 01:02:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not fully staffed either.

610
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:59,110
[SPEAKER_03]: As our city grows, which it has been doing, we need to make sure that our first responders are fully staffed and supported.

611
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to focus on our budget, too, as well.

612
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to have budget transparency.

613
01:03:07,978 --> 01:03:13,019
[SPEAKER_03]: For the past four years, we've had over $25 million in free cash.

614
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, free cash is really the taxpayer's money.

615
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's money that you guys put in to that budget.

616
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we need to be able to understand where our money is going and making sure that we're spending money reasonably in the way it should be spent.

617
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:30,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even see you.

618
01:03:30,564 --> 01:03:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sorry.

619
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,737
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, we'll welcome Zach Beers.

620
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:49,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm a city councilor who invites strong opinions.

621
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:50,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of people love me.

622
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:52,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of people don't.

623
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:54,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, I want to speak to everyone else.

624
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:57,409
[SPEAKER_08]: People who've never supported me, but are thinking about it.

625
01:03:58,009 --> 01:04:00,691
[SPEAKER_08]: People who used to support me, but aren't sure if they do anymore.

626
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:03,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Or people who are just getting to know me for the first time.

627
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:05,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Medford.

628
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:08,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up here, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.

629
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:13,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I first ran for office because I'm committed to making our city, my hometown, a better place.

630
01:04:14,812 --> 01:04:21,119
[SPEAKER_08]: A Medford where people, whether they're 22 or 82, aren't worried they'll get pushed out of their homes because Medford's not affordable anymore.

631
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,285
[SPEAKER_08]: A city of yes, where we come together and get big things done.

632
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:34,517
[SPEAKER_08]: A Medford that is not for sale, where we have a head seat at the negotiating table and we make sure that developers, Tufts, or the MBTA pay their fair share.

633
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:39,743
[SPEAKER_08]: A Medford for all of us, where we stand up for our inclusive values and protect our neighbors.

634
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:47,389
[SPEAKER_08]: The Facebook bullies have tried to paint a pretty nasty picture of me, but I ask you to ignore the noise and talk to people who actually know me.

635
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:54,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sat down with hundreds of people who don't agree with me, whether that's about the city budget, or zoning, or street safety.

636
01:04:55,113 --> 01:05:00,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had good conversations, we've learned from each other, and I've made better decisions because of it.

637
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:04,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't pretend that I have all the answers, and I admit when I'm wrong.

638
01:05:05,145 --> 01:05:09,007
[SPEAKER_08]: That's who I am, and it's the kind of leadership I want to see in my own representatives.

639
01:05:09,787 --> 01:05:13,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether you vote for me or not, I will continue to listen, learn, and lead with compassion.

640
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:22,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I work hard every single day for our city, and win or lose, I'll keep working to help make the best choices we can for Medford's future, because I love living here.

641
01:05:23,472 --> 01:05:29,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Zach Baers, I'm running for re-election to the Medford City Council, and I hope I can earn your support and your vote on November 4th.

642
01:05:29,695 --> 01:05:29,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

643
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Next we'll hear from Anna Callahan.

644
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:45,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

645
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:47,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks everyone for being here.

646
01:05:47,645 --> 01:05:48,726
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Anna Callahan.

647
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:52,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a first term incumbent and I am running for re-election.

648
01:05:52,848 --> 01:06:02,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can count on me to represent the values that I believe we share here in Medford and that means having

649
01:06:02,994 --> 01:06:23,430
[SPEAKER_06]: really vibrant community where you can walk to a local shop and run into friends and neighbors along the way and we support each other, an inclusive city where everyone feels welcome, a green and sustainable city, as well as a really vibrant democracy where people are actually engaged in the political process.

650
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:29,635
[SPEAKER_06]: A few of my policy positions, I do think that we need to spend more on our roads.

651
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:32,097
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some savings that we could be spending on our roads.

652
01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:38,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing to understand about roads is that the more dilapidated they are, the more expensive they are to repair.

653
01:06:39,023 --> 01:06:48,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's actually financially responsible for us to bring those back up into better shape quickly, because then it'll be easier and cheaper for us to repair going forward.

654
01:06:49,892 --> 01:07:02,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we really have to tackle our housing crisis, and I want us to be creative and think about ways that we can create more affordable housing, keep tenants in their home, keep older folks aging in place.

655
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:12,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I really want us to have local businesses and to support our small local shops and have vibrant squares.

656
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:22,451
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that makes me truly unique as an elected official is how I engage the community in making our city a better place.

657
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:26,654
[SPEAKER_06]: It's how much I care about democracy and engaging people in the political process.

658
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:34,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a whole team of volunteers dedicated to helping me set up listening sessions throughout the community.

659
01:07:34,478 --> 01:07:37,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And out of those listening sessions come policy ideas that people want to work on.

660
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I have five volunteer teams working on different ideas that came up from the community, and I invite you to reach out to me.

661
01:07:45,843 --> 01:07:48,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to hear your ideas and help you work on them together.

662
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:49,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

663
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:57,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, Nick Giuleo.

664
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:05,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect pronunciation.

665
01:08:12,768 --> 01:08:17,453
[SPEAKER_13]: A great teacher I had at the school we're in tonight once told me that you should always end a speech with a thank you for listening.

666
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:22,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take his advice but flip the timing and begin by thanking all of you for being here and listening.

667
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:25,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Our city might be more divided than ever.

668
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:32,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Rather than brood on the reasons why in these two minutes I have with you, I'd like to instead reflect on the path forward.

669
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:36,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no doubt that everyone on this stage wants what is best for Medford.

670
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:46,052
[SPEAKER_13]: We may disagree on what is best and how we get there, but I think the most important thing to remember is that the system of government our city operates under was designed to handle these differences.

671
01:08:47,232 --> 01:08:50,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford is an enormous city, nearly 60,000 people.

672
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:57,336
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt that among the 60,000, we have residents with a very wide range of perspectives, ideas, and points of view.

673
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:02,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I've always been a strong believer that diversity in this respect makes government better.

674
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:11,777
[SPEAKER_13]: It avoids the many pitfalls of groupthink and leads to legislating that, while might not leave no one fully happy, represents workable compromise.

675
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:15,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Compromise is good and is something I believe we should all be striving for.

676
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:26,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I've said much in these many months of campaigning, but of all the themes I've touched on, the one that has given me the most passion to keep going is the value of the ordinary person's opinion.

677
01:09:27,004 --> 01:09:39,331
[SPEAKER_13]: My first glimpse of this was in my professional life when I tried my first few cases before a jury, but I really learned it observing the many intelligent people in our community come up to the podium at our meetings and express their thoughts on the issues that matter to them.

678
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,551
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to preserve that voice.

679
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:44,352
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to be wary of a government that discounts it.

680
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:49,034
[SPEAKER_13]: The voice of the ordinary person matters, and their collective voice makes a difference.

681
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:57,857
[SPEAKER_13]: The greatest case I can make to you for electing me is I have a passion to preserve this voice, and it goes far beyond the voices of people I already agree with.

682
01:09:58,677 --> 01:09:59,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear from people who don't.

683
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:03,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear from people whose perspectives differ from my own.

684
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:10,210
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear from all voices in Medford, because every voice matters, and the city we call home.

685
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:11,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

686
01:10:13,412 --> 01:10:18,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask Matt Lemming to come forward.

687
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody, my name is Matt.

688
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:36,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a first term city councilor in Medford running for a second term.

689
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:45,368
[SPEAKER_10]: When I first moved here, I was a postdoc at Mass General and back then I was barely able to afford a room in a small apartment.

690
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:53,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that's not because of the fact that my, that's not because my research wasn't important enough to earn

691
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,858
[SPEAKER_10]: larger housing space.

692
01:10:56,898 --> 01:11:00,300
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because the housing system we have right now is broken.

693
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:09,405
[SPEAKER_10]: In the past four decades, rents have risen over 300 percent, home prices more than 400 percent, and incomes have grown only 37 percent.

694
01:11:10,545 --> 01:11:16,468
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I got involved locally, first by lobbying council to create Medford's Affordable Housing Trust, and then running myself in 2023.

695
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:24,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford faces two big challenges, a strained budget and housing that is far too expensive.

696
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:28,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city was for too long penny smart and dollar stupid.

697
01:11:29,093 --> 01:11:33,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been working with my colleagues to bring Medford out of this stagnancy this past term.

698
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:41,623
[SPEAKER_10]: This past term, backed by parents and families, we passed a ballot initiative that saved 40 teaching jobs and funded a full-time road repair crew.

699
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:49,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look forward next term to supporting the building of a new high school, even if it requires a debt exclusion to fund.

700
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:54,485
[SPEAKER_10]: We approved new senior housing, and I've been working to fund our new affordable housing trust that I lobbied for.

701
01:11:55,366 --> 01:12:02,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked with the State House on a bill that will update our developer impact fees for the first time in 34 years so that we can upgrade our infrastructure.

702
01:12:03,898 --> 01:12:10,704
[SPEAKER_10]: We're modernizing our rules around development, making our city's growth greener, more sustainable, and aligned with Medford's long-term vision.

703
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:21,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I've pushed for a more transparent city council, starting a newsletter, live-streaming meetings, holding office hours, and writing all of it on my website nonstop.

704
01:12:21,752 --> 01:12:32,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I launched a program to house low-income veterans and create an emergency fund for in-need veterans, and I proudly championed our Welcoming City Ordinance, which offers protections to vulnerable non-citizen residents.

705
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:34,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Local government has stopped kicking the can down the road.

706
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:37,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fighting for a more affordable, vibrant Medford.

707
01:12:37,515 --> 01:12:38,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll keep doing that work.

708
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for your time.

709
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize that Phyllis is standing right here.

710
01:12:44,782 --> 01:12:47,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Very last sentence, thank you for your time, and don't forget to vote on November 4th.

711
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

712
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to call Liz Mullay to the podium.

713
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:06,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Liz Mullane and I'm a new candidate running for Medford City Council.

714
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:18,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start by thanking the Medford Democratic City Committee for organizing tonight and to my fellow candidates and everyone in attendance here or watching at home for their participation in this process.

715
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:31,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that my 20 years of experience working within nonprofits, building programs, raising funds, managing budgets, and leading teams at complex, multilayered organizations would be an asset on the City Council.

716
01:13:32,757 --> 01:13:42,326
[SPEAKER_01]: As a fundraiser, being able to identify new sources of revenue to fund our community services that benefit everyone, like our libraries, senior centers, and mental health providers.

717
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:56,233
[SPEAKER_01]: with my MBA taking a close eye to our budgets for more transparency, addressing a array of shortfalls, and helping to prioritize key areas, like repairing our streets and sidewalks to make them more accessible for all of our residents.

718
01:13:57,727 --> 01:14:12,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, this background will allow me to provide guidance in bringing in and keeping more small business in Medford through streamlining our process, providing incentives, and eliminating the barriers of entry into our city, all the while helping to grow our commercial tax base.

719
01:14:13,837 --> 01:14:23,003
[SPEAKER_01]: As an adjunct faculty member in higher ed, I've seen firsthand just how important it is to fund our schools and advocate for our students to set them up for lifelong success.

720
01:14:24,403 --> 01:14:35,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stand up and continue to stand up for my neighbors against ICE, protect the individual rights of our residents, invest in affordable housing, and champion for sustainability and more green space.

721
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:43,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a listener, a collaborator, and a person who simply wants to use their knowledge to continue moving Medford forward.

722
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:51,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe when we invest in our community, in our children, our families, and our seniors, we all win.

723
01:14:51,978 --> 01:14:55,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll consider me as one of your seven votes on Tuesday, November 4th.

724
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

725
01:15:01,804 --> 01:15:04,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to call Justin to come to the podium.

726
01:15:04,145 --> 01:15:05,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin Tang.

727
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:13,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for being here tonight.

728
01:15:14,111 --> 01:15:15,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks, Medford is a special place.

729
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:20,855
[SPEAKER_09]: My parents moved here over 20 years ago because it was where they could afford to find a home.

730
01:15:22,135 --> 01:15:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Little did they know they were joining a community that would mean so much to them.

731
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:34,403
[SPEAKER_09]: As they worked paycheck to paycheck, they could always count on their neighbors to lend a hand, to look after me after school, and to make sure we got by.

732
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:40,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And our public schools gave me opportunities I never imagined, including the chance to attend Harvard Law School.

733
01:15:40,928 --> 01:15:51,738
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something special about Medford that a shy little boy in the back of a classroom who started kindergarten not knowing many words of English could one day find his voice and give back to the city he's always called home.

734
01:15:53,026 --> 01:16:11,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran because I wanted the next generation to have even more opportunities than I did, because too often City Hall felt like a place where you needed to know someone to get something done, because diversity too often felt like just a slogan, and because too many of my friends were being priced out while our schools struggled to get by.

735
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,120
[SPEAKER_09]: The status quo just wasn't working.

736
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:32,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Over my last two terms, we've begun to change that, making historic investments in streets, schools, taking on the housing crisis through once-in-generations reforms that create hundreds of new affordable housing units, and standing up for our neighbors' rights, safety, and financial security.

737
01:16:33,482 --> 01:16:36,444
[SPEAKER_09]: But in a time like this, Medford can't afford to turn back.

738
01:16:37,045 --> 01:16:40,967
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our opportunity to dream big and act bravely.

739
01:16:41,568 --> 01:16:49,013
[SPEAKER_09]: An opportunity to keep building a city that welcomes and listens to everyone, whether you've lived here your whole life or whether you just moved in yesterday.

740
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:54,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Our opportunity to rebuild Medford High, invest in our students, and repave our roads.

741
01:16:55,717 --> 01:16:59,959
[SPEAKER_09]: With steady hands and bold leadership, we can keep building a future for us all.

742
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:22,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Two rounds of two-minute answers aren't enough to answer everything and to lay out a comprehensive vision for the city, but I hope you'll visit my website at www.justin4medford.com, the number four, and it's been an honor to speak to you all tonight to serve the city, and I ask for one of your votes on November 4th.

743
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:23,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

744
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:31,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to take a few minutes.

745
01:17:31,363 --> 01:17:36,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we finished ahead of time because we did not have all the candidates for a variety of reasons.

746
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:48,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to take a moment to thank the candidates for being here tonight, for sharing your responses to the questions from the citizens of Medford, for sharing why you want to serve in our great city.

747
01:17:49,008 --> 01:17:53,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do believe we have a great city, and I'm very happy that we are given opportunities

748
01:17:54,330 --> 01:18:04,595
[SPEAKER_04]: to have events like this to inform the public and where the public can also have input into what they'd like to find out about people running for positions in our city.

749
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:19,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to thank, if anyone doesn't mind to indulge me for a moment, I'd like to thank the members of the Democratic Committee, Bruce, Mark, Anne, and Max, because a lot of time and effort went into preparing this night and they were happy to do so.

750
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to thank them for doing that.

751
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:26,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the Tufts volunteers.

752
01:18:26,971 --> 01:18:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to stand up.

753
01:18:28,212 --> 01:18:30,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so nice to see the young people with us.

754
01:18:30,733 --> 01:18:34,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a step in the right direction for MedFed.

755
01:18:35,217 --> 01:18:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Kevin who came to some of our meetings via Zoom so we could help with the audio.

756
01:18:41,681 --> 01:18:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank the audio and visual people, the media, and Medford High School for allowing us to use this facility.

757
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: The most important thing I'd like to say this evening is this.

758
01:18:51,664 --> 01:18:55,746
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a vote coming, and we have that wonderful opportunity.

759
01:18:55,786 --> 01:19:01,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the gift of voting for the people we think will best bring our city forward.

760
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:05,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So our voting day is November 4th.

761
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Early voting starts October 25th.

762
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:08,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So vote.

763
01:19:11,152 --> 01:19:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to have great representation moving our city forward.

764
01:19:15,163 --> 01:19:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for coming tonight.

765
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the candidates.

766
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck to all of you.
