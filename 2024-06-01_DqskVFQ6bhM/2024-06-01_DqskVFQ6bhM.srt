[SPEAKER_09]: Uh this meeting will take place at seven p.m.

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,911
[SPEAKER_09]: in the city council chamber.

[SPEAKER_09]: Second floor.

14
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,532
[SPEAKER_09]: We have zoom link.

15
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:33,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Um the action item on today's agenda is paper 23-474 offered by Council President Bears the 2023

16
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:45,926
[SPEAKER_09]: met on this once before, just to determine a future path forward.

17
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:59,134
[SPEAKER_09]: In previous Council meetings, other Councilors, such as Councilor Scarpelli, have put on the agenda that this Governance Committee conduct more oversight of the Elections Department, of our new Elections Department,

18
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:03,357
[SPEAKER_09]: following what we've heard from previous city elections.

19
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:10,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I have invited the members of the Elections Commission as well as Chief of Staff, Ina Nazarian, to this meeting today.

20
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:18,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Chief of Staff has been helping out with the Elections Department for the Presidential Preference Primary held earlier this month.

21
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, before I start, do any of you have any questions?

22
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:46,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, if the Chief of Staff would want to come up and address the Council, or if any election commissioners want to address the Council to introduce remarks, I'd be happy to recognize you.

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chief of Staff.

24
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

25
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:53,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly would defer to the Elections Commission members who are on the Zoom call to start out if they would like.

26
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:54,662
Thank you.

27
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:54,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

28
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:55,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

29
00:01:56,511 --> 00:02:04,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Any, are there any elections commissioners on the Zoom call who would like to say anything, introduce their remarks to us?

30
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:13,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I know, so yes, Councilor Riveras?

31
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I missed, you went quickly through the introduction.

32
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:20,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I maybe missed my opportunity to jump in as the person who introduced the paper.

33
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for that.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:44,028
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you did know, Councilor Scarpelli and myself and I believe other councillors in November, Councilor Morell, Councilor Caraviello, we did introduce a number of papers regarding the issues that had gone on with the municipal election of 2023.

35
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:49,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Procedural errors that occurred prior to the counting of the votes and

36
00:02:51,533 --> 00:03:00,878
[SPEAKER_00]: how those were disseminated to the public and what the responses and solutions to those were going to be and kind of what the accountability system was going to be.

37
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:07,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that was even resolution submitted before the recount, which occurred, which did, of course, affirm the results.

38
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:17,027
[SPEAKER_00]: But the underlying issue of when we have procedural errors, what is the protocol of the elections department?

39
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:24,547
[SPEAKER_00]: in clearly notifying everyone and being very transparent an error occurred.

40
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,849
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the error happened.

41
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We've identified the issue.

42
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,513
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're going to rectify it in the future so it doesn't happen again.

43
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:46,104
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really what I think was the main concern of all involved, was making sure that there was that openness about issues happening and making sure that

44
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:51,731
[SPEAKER_00]: there was clear understanding about addressing them in the future.

45
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:56,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we continued to kind of have issues.

46
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:03,196
[SPEAKER_00]: really through earlier this year, then obviously there was a staffing change in the office.

47
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:10,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that since then, when there have been errors, we have received very clear reporting of this was the issue.

48
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,746
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we identified it.

49
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:14,789
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the solution that we're putting into place.

50
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:19,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We did also receive the report that we requested and we have discussed it in council in January.

51
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:26,137
[SPEAKER_00]: going over the 2023 election, and that was from the elections manager at the time.

52
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:38,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do appreciate the elections commission chair also submitting his own report as an addendum to that, that really, I think, got into some of the deeper details.

53
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:44,414
[SPEAKER_00]: and the procedural fixes that need to go into effect.

54
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:54,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that we do need to note across this whole question is we have more complicated elections than we've ever had before.

55
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:59,618
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many elections every year, generally at least two elections every year.

56
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:08,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the new laws at the state level with the Votes Act and the permanent mail voting,

57
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:16,516
[SPEAKER_00]: early voting, very extensive, of course, coming up this year for our presidential election.

58
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's 14 days of early voting.

59
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:23,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, polling location issues, et cetera, et cetera.

60
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:33,705
[SPEAKER_00]: We have running elections in the city has never been more logistically complicated, requiring more resources and more staff, including full-time staff and part-time staff.

61
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important to recognize that.

62
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the question, at least that I had was,

63
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:47,022
[SPEAKER_00]: One, do we have the staffing levels needed to succeed in these roles?

64
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:59,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, do we have the staffing levels needed to succeed without elections commissioners who really are not supposed to be doing day-to-day work, who had been doing more, I think, than the general

65
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:00,817
[SPEAKER_00]: that.

66
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Um assessment is of what elections commission should be doing.

67
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,642
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be reviewing the results and approving things and addressing procedural issues outlined by state law.

68
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that really is to me the, um.

69
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:22,169
[SPEAKER_00]: First question, and then I think we also quite frankly had a question of did we have staff in place who we felt, um, was doing the job and meeting the meeting the moment.

70
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's in the past, so we don't need to

71
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:32,902
[SPEAKER_00]: the elections commission and from the chief of staff.

72
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:33,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

73
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,623
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a fully staffed elections office full time.

74
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:54,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and make sure that we have the election staff and on the part time basis, our wardens are elections official officers at the polling places, folks to staff early voting people working on the on the mail balloting, um, to do the job effectively.

75
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that in this case, the past

76
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:06,293
[SPEAKER_00]: that because of the departure of a member of the staff that the chief of staff was doing the bulk of that work.

77
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously that's not a sustainable model.

78
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:14,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We need staff in the elections department to do that.

79
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:19,089
[SPEAKER_00]: those are kind of just that's kind of my general framing on all of this.

80
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:27,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to acknowledge some significant improvements and when I did issues are identified that we did receive clear reporting on that.

81
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was public discussion about it, which is important.

82
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:45,574
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to note that we as a council did pass a resolution and I have had conversations with the chief of staff to really clarify that there is an elections department in the city of Method that is staffed by staff members.

83
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,424
[SPEAKER_00]: that is separate from the Elections Commission, just like the Board of Registrars was different than the people in the Registrar and Voters Office.

84
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:59,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to understand, we don't call the Water and Sewer Department the Water and Sewer Commission.

85
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:05,609
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the Water and Sewer Department, and there's a Water and Sewer Commission that oversees it, but then there's the actual staffing of that.

86
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:15,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think just updating our nomenclature, signage, et cetera, in physical form and digital form to make it clear, there's an Elections Department,

87
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:25,136
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a staff member of that elections department who runs it, there are other staff members within that department, both full-time and part-time, and they're the ones who manage the elections is really key.

88
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Chair Tsang.

89
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:36,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Councilor Scarpelli's hand, and there was a hand on Zoom, but I'll, from Commissioner Bell, go to the Council first.

90
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:38,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

91
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:43,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chair, I think this,

92
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,976
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, first, I think the Election Commission does the best they can.

93
00:08:48,036 --> 00:09:07,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know, Henry and his team try to stand above it all, but there are some huge deficiencies that were realized in November and then magnified again for the federal elections past March, which

94
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:18,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that brings me to my conclusion that, you know, appreciate the reports, but reports mean nothing when the same thing keeps happening over and over again.

95
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:33,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel that this council should ask the administration or demand that the administration call for an outside audit to come in and audit and educate our election department and commission and support.

96
00:09:34,878 --> 00:10:01,652
[SPEAKER_10]: the, you know, the counting of the ballots, the process of that, the counting of the ballots, the voting process that's in place and the lack of education for our poll workers and the lack of guidance of understanding what their jobs and roles are done on a person to person basis and polling location, polling location basis is very different and it opens up

97
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,835
[SPEAKER_10]: an avenue for distrust and for confusion.

98
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:12,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, let me repeat, most importantly, it's not the poll workers' fault.

99
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,844
[SPEAKER_10]: The poll workers' fault are doing exactly what they know what to do.

100
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:29,612
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't been trained, they haven't been vetted properly to make sure that they're given the tools to succeed, and I think that's been a huge problem.

101
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:48,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we, as a council, asked, oh God, years ago, to look at our voting list and to eliminate all of the people that are in the election list and clean that up.

102
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:50,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can't do that.

103
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:55,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're having households receiving ballots when they don't even live there anymore.

104
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,808
[SPEAKER_10]: We have people that,

105
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:07,585
[SPEAKER_10]: are on the voter registration list when you go into vote and you're seeing people that moved out of your own neighborhood when you look down 10, 15 years ago.

106
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:13,150
[SPEAKER_10]: You see voters, Medford voters that have passed on that are off in heaven and still are on a voting list.

107
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,512
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot that can be done to help our poll workers.

108
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:23,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing we need to do, unless we try to get ahead of it right now, I think we'll never catch up.

109
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:37,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to put some funding and some support to this venture right now, before the federal election, to make sure that we have crossed our T's and dotted our I's in this community.

110
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:49,526
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever we saw in November, whatever we saw in November, in our elections in November, we saw some we witnessed some similar issues that happened in March.

111
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:58,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said this before the November elections, I said, please, perception is reality.

112
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever we need to do,

113
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:11,040
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever this council needs to do, let's help the administration give them what they need to make sure that this doesn't happen again.

114
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're happening again.

115
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:26,404
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure you've heard all the rumors about, you know, who's come into the city, the investigations that are going on in the city, you know, different different federal departments talking to people interviewing people.

116
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:29,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's, it's, it's scary.

117
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:37,695
[SPEAKER_10]: for the fact that one of these days something's gonna happen and we're gonna be left holding the bag.

118
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Because listen, we know what's going on.

119
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,821
[SPEAKER_10]: We know there are issues.

120
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:46,283
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that there are serious issues as a council, we know.

121
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we need to give

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:13:05,484
[SPEAKER_10]: the commission the tools that they need in the election department, the staffing and the tools they need to properly educate to properly inform to properly hold an election and making sure we're giving them all the tools possible.

123
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:10,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think one of the biggest things you start with first is looking at our role looking at our

124
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:17,215
[SPEAKER_10]: people that are on the on the election roll.

125
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,538
[SPEAKER_10]: See, see if they're even living here.

126
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:21,580
[SPEAKER_10]: See if they passed away.

127
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Because what is it they're saying is 45 registered 45,000 registered voters 42,000.

128
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see that.

129
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:31,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see that at all.

130
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:37,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a big piece that, you know, you have election workers going through numbers.

131
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:40,506
[SPEAKER_10]: You have, you know, poll workers going through numbers that aren't even there.

132
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that causes more issues because, you know, you heard what happened in November.

133
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,713
[SPEAKER_10]: You had more line, you had a bigger line of people

134
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:57,099
[SPEAKER_10]: waiting in a separate line because they were told that they weren't registered voters when you had former city councilors that were told that.

135
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not, this isn't good.

136
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:13,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that we need to, as the reports, we appreciate the report that came back, we understand and we see some of the inequities, but what I don't see is a clear path to fixing this.

137
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:21,098
[SPEAKER_10]: If tonight's tonight's meeting was to hear what they were going to say, and see what the administration is going to say, see what happened.

138
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:27,682
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I hope at the end of this, that we have a clear vision of what we need to do.

139
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:30,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So this doesn't happen at the presidential election.

140
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very simple.

141
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:41,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I would ask the chief of staff, how often do you see a chief of staff running an election?

142
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,511
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't look good.

143
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,715
[SPEAKER_10]: that just doesn't look good.

144
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether whether there's nothing there or something there, it just doesn't look good.

145
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Not having a chief of staff running your elections.

146
00:14:55,218 --> 00:15:01,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's it's it speaks volumes and where we are and we need to we need to figure this out before the next election.

147
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:07,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate Mr. Chair for letting me share my opinions.

148
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:13,242
[SPEAKER_10]: But as for one, I'll be one council that will support any endeavor that

149
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:22,907
[SPEAKER_10]: will lend support to the commission and the election department to make sure they have all the tools possible that the same issues don't happen again.

150
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Ballots going out when they shouldn't.

151
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Too many ballots going to people's homes.

152
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:32,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Election numbers not being tabulated in the proper timeline.

153
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:41,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Numbers that not not being released in a proper timeline, poll workers that don't understand the protocol from one polling station to another.

154
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:42,297
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's

155
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:45,635
[SPEAKER_10]: that.

156
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, it leads to.

157
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Perception being reality, and that's it.

158
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:51,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want that to happen.

159
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

160
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Um I think I saw a Councilor bears his hand.

161
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:59,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I see Councilor Collins's hand to so go in that order.

162
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:02,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

163
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that I agree with some of what was said.

164
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:06,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are.

165
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:08,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Procedure There were

166
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:25,136
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a report back, again, from the elections commission, from the chief of staff to the elections commission to the city council about the Super Tuesday primary.

167
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,617
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a signage issue at the Roberts School.

168
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:29,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Site visits were made.

169
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,218
[SPEAKER_00]: There were not further complaints after signage was remedied.

170
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,359
[SPEAKER_00]: There was election results subsequent to the closure of the polls.

171
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:43,861
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what Councilor Schapiro is talking about with the central tabulation system.

172
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:55,035
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have had conversations with the Elections Commission, and it's right in here, that the file download was slow, and that may be a technology issue going on when doing central tabulation.

173
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,898
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know,

174
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:10,327
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an issue with 77 ballots in post-election tabulation, where there's a communication with the elections division of the Secretary of State's office.

175
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:15,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have communicated personally with the elections division of the Secretary of State's office.

176
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:21,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I communicate with them before the November election, after the November election, sometimes this year as well.

177
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,927
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not come in here and look at anything.

178
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:28,389
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not come in and say that there was a broken system of any kind.

179
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:39,997
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a recount run by some of the most respected legal counsel on the petitioner side, as well as on the city side.

180
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:47,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And while issues were identified, those issues were not determinative of the outcome.

181
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, I think the point is we need to address

182
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:53,592
[SPEAKER_00]: issues like this, right?

183
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:56,674
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that the process is up to snuff, that the staff is there.

184
00:17:56,714 --> 00:18:18,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on that's the one piece of this that we all agree on, but the idea of, you know, investigatory issues into like large scale problems here, the secretary of state's office and the elections division has not made that determination, has been asked to make that determination and has declined to make that determination.

185
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:28,279
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am interested in hearing what is our plans on staffing and financial resources for the elections department going forward.

186
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely do agree that there needs to be.

187
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:47,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a full time elections department director, and as this council has said multiple times, I do not believe, and this council has voted multiple times to say that we do not believe that 2.5 FTE in that office is sufficient.

188
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:58,967
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have the authority to increase any line item in the budget whatsoever, including that line item, but we have said many times in the past that it doesn't seem like the two and a half

189
00:18:59,431 --> 00:18:59,511
[SPEAKER_00]: that.

190
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:02,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that F T is sufficient, but I will.

191
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:15,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop there, and I'm interested to hear from our elections commissioners and our chief of staff about what the plan is around staffing that office getting the open positions filled as well as if there are additional changes coming down to make sure that staffing and training are

192
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:34,077
[SPEAKER_00]: that this it's from my observation in my conversations with the election staff members at all levels, this past March election was much smoother than the November election.

193
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:36,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

194
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Sang.

195
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the, you know, I

196
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:46,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that we have the opportunity to continue this conversation.

197
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:55,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for myself, my concerns also center around what this council has been talking about for

198
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:06,766
[SPEAKER_03]: months since before, you know, the March and the November 2023 election, which is the under-resourcing and under-capacity of our elections department.

199
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:16,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true of any department, and it's not specific or personal to anybody who's been involved in elections in Medford, that when there's not enough people on the case, things will fall through the cracks.

200
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we did see that

201
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:18,831
[SPEAKER_03]: with November.

202
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw that less with March, and that's a positive thing.

203
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still really concerned.

204
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:34,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we have our chief of staff filling the role of the executive in that office right now, and we've seen transparency and communication increase from that department during that time.

205
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:43,001
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, everybody's extremely aware, I'm sure, most of all the chief of staff, that that's glaringly, obviously, not a permanent solution.

206
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:56,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made it really clear a lot of times, I think that that should be a director level position, especially this year, but every year we need the best possible candidate running elections in the city of Method.

207
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:03,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said it many times before, I think that this is a department that needs to have more than two and a half full-time employees.

208
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,021
[SPEAKER_03]: When any department is stretched that thin and tasked with so much,

209
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: things fall through the cracks.

210
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:22,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that it is a symptom of a properly resourced, you know, professional level, municipal level elections department to

211
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,583
[SPEAKER_03]: be it a state capacity wise where we're wrangling signage on an election day.

212
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:45,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's absolutely not a criticism of any person or involved or any system leading up to the March election, but rather this is, if this is the level of capacity that the elections department is at, to me, that is a resources and staffing issue.

213
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:50,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was happy to see that that was responded to very quickly.

214
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue was rectified, but our Medford deserves an elections department that has

215
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: tackled the issue of keeping signage organized and is proceeding along to, you know, are we keeping our softwares modernized so that, you know, for example, files don't download as quickly as they need to.

216
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be at a level of resources and staffing where we can be a proactive elections department, as opposed to one that occasionally has to put out fires when there are really much more consequential things to be doing.

217
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So I absolutely would echo my fellow Councilors in saying whatever proposals the Elections Department and the Elections Commission has for identifying and prescribing and improving on current systems and identifying and improving on past problems, I'm eager to stand in support of those ideas.

218
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But my highest priority is getting to a place where we can elevate the

219
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,370
[SPEAKER_03]: to a director level position.

220
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:07,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really what's needed and taking a hard look at how many part time and full time employees does is really required for an elections department in a city of 60,000.

221
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:08,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

222
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:10,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

223
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Councilors have asked for comments from the chief of staff in the Elections Commission.

224
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:19,706
[SPEAKER_09]: But before I move on, are there any other comments from Councilors?

225
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,362
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing none.

226
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:29,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I see, um, Henry Moore and one of our election commissioners hands raised on zoom.

227
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I will recognize him.

228
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're already a co host.

229
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:34,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he can unmute.

230
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Commit Commissioner Miller.

231
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:49,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And can you unmute yourself on zoom?

232
00:23:52,748 --> 00:24:06,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just ask them to unmute.

233
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,905
[SPEAKER_09]: As we wait for Chairman Warren to unmute himself.

234
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:21,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Laming?

235
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:46,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I just, just to be clear, I'm not a voting member of this committee, so I don't think that my, I didn't want to prioritize my comments, but while we have a pause here, I'd just like to point out that I think when we say under-resource and under-staffing, I would just like to say that it's not just about the number of staff there, just backing up the conversations that we had about the finance department.

236
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,079
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also partially an issue of software.

237
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: A few weeks ago, I went to the, you know, there was like a had like an hour to go before a city council meeting.

238
00:24:55,345 --> 00:25:05,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So, some of the people working the elections there decided to show me what their day to day was like, and they showed me the software that they're using to enter.

239
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:17,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Voter information into their computers and it was a ridiculously slow process given the resources that they had and this was something that absolutely necessarily had to be done.

240
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's so

241
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:34,763
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to invest not just in more staff members, but in an updated infrastructure that would allow the existing staff members to do their jobs more efficiently would also be very critical for this.

242
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:43,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also like to echo what my colleague Councilor Scarpelli was saying about the idea that the 42,000 voters that the city

243
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:52,579
[SPEAKER_02]: currently has on its registered voter list is very likely not up to date.

244
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at it myself.

245
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There were former roommates that I'd had that moved out of the city years ago on it.

246
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:06,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think that we should be

247
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: we shouldn't necessarily be blaming the elections department for not doing um uh for deprioritizing tasks that aren't uh aren't necessary for the for the next election but i do i fully agree that there are a lot of things that need to be updated in terms of data so thank you yes just on this question of inactive voters and the size of the voter registration list i just think it's important to note that one

248
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:41,808
[SPEAKER_00]: the voter registration, the RIS system is maintained by the Secretary of State's office, not by the city of Method.

249
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:47,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, if someone moves within the state and re-registers to vote within the state, then that pings within.

250
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:53,292
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had a roommate who moved out of the state and they never re-registered in Massachusetts, they're gonna be in that system.

251
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:58,454
[SPEAKER_00]: The catch, the back catch to that is the census and inactivation system.

252
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:04,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Councilor Scarpelli was mentioning there were people being put in a line to say you're an inactive voter, that's because

253
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:10,618
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't fill out their city census form, or their city census form did not arrive at City Hall.

254
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they did fill it out, it didn't arrive.

255
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:14,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to the Postal Service.

256
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:17,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had some things disappear in the mail lately.

257
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:25,458
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the catch, essentially the secondary system for addressing that issue.

258
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:30,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been some questions around that, but that does generally happen.

259
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:33,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the census is an intense amount of work for that office.

260
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:38,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to put that, the city census, which is very different from the federal census.

261
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:47,571
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to put that out there, because I think we would see that there is a very well, as best as possibly can be, the thing that we control is the city census.

262
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the,

263
00:27:49,332 --> 00:28:13,089
[SPEAKER_00]: role of who is active and inactive that is a much more culled list it is there's you know generally 20 to 25,000 active voters in the city who are returning a city census during federal elections like and honestly quite frankly some of this is cyclical and due to turnout right we have around 30 to 35 percent turnout in municipal elections that's generally consistent although it's a

264
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:15,351
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2015 is much higher.

265
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:18,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be between 20 to 30 percent, so that's actually better.

266
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:29,607
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, you have 30 to 35 percent turnout in a municipal election, 50 to 60 percent turnout in a state general election, the off year, the 20, you know, 22, 26, the gubernatorial election.

267
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a presidential general, you have 70% to 80% turnout.

268
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:41,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have people who are coming out in the federal presidential and then not voting again for four years, they're dropping off.

269
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:46,353
[SPEAKER_00]: They're staying registered, but they're dropping off of the active voter list.

270
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:51,054
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why even then the active voter list is in that 20,000 range.

271
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,975
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also people who are turning back in the city census.

272
00:28:54,015 --> 00:29:01,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think where there's a desire for this to be perfect, and I certainly support it,

273
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:07,798
[SPEAKER_00]: The pieces of it that are within our hands generally seem to be going relatively well.

274
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It can always be improved.

275
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a way to do the city census better.

276
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:15,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the state allows us to do it other than the paper way that we do it.

277
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:30,717
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's that 42,000 registered voter number has a lot of, there are a lot of reasons that number exists and some of them don't have anything to do with Medford whatsoever.

278
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that's important to put out there.

279
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be great if it was a little lower and a little more accurate, because then we can say we have higher turnout, but, you know.

280
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:41,639
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you for clarifying, Council President Bears.

281
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Councilor Lazzaro' hand.

282
00:29:45,801 --> 00:30:00,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of to piggyback off what President Bears was saying, there are a lot of rules that the state sets for elections that I think it's valuable for us to keep in mind that

283
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:22,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not sure it's as necessary for us to try to be purging the voter rolls as much as it is that we can, um, help voters who want to vote on the day that they're there, even if they may be inactive in that moment, but they're living in Medford and they, uh, are able to get a provisional ballot.

284
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, these are the things that I, I worked, I worked the polls in 2020.

285
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:26,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I.

286
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:39,129
[SPEAKER_04]: observed a lot of that because a lot of people were very interested in voting at that time who may have been remiss on a few of their forms, but it was very important to them to vote in that election.

287
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:46,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I saw then when I was working there was that we had a lot of election workers kind of showing up.

288
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:48,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the height of COVID.

289
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had masks on and was sanitizing.

290
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like running back and forth and sanitizing everything.

291
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:59,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really amazing what our election workers were able to do and what our election staff was able to do.

292
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:07,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if we can keep supporting this office, and this department, and this commission, then we can keep being able to pull that stuff off.

293
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think that...

294
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:35,796
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some things that happen at the state level, like what President Bears was talking about, where there are policies that, like, if you don't fill out your census, you get kind of, like, placed on a list, and then it's not as easy for you to vote in future elections, which I'm not sure that's something that we would, I mean, the lists get really funky and weird because of those policies, and I don't know that any of that is either here nor there.

295
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,045
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we want to be able to do is say, our city is ready to deal with that craziness on the day.

296
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more ready we are, the better.

297
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more support we can offer, the better.

298
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:56,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And pulling people off of the lists wouldn't be the highest priority, I think.

299
00:31:58,897 --> 00:31:59,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.

300
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:02,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sure.

301
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello?

302
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:23,597
[SPEAKER_10]: We wouldn't know, to my fellow councilors that I've mentioned, but we wouldn't know, but that will, from what I hear is when I've talked to different elections commissions and other communities, this is just a basic fundamental process that could be done with a consultant that can come in and do that.

303
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would eliminate that question.

304
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, like I said, perception's reality.

305
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:30,191
[SPEAKER_10]: We all see it.

306
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,114
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that might not be a priority, but it's a piece that needs to be cleaned up.

307
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:34,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

308
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:36,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

309
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:44,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Commissioner Malorin's audio is working now, so I'll ask him to speak if no other councillors have questions.

310
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:49,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you, Councilor Tseng, and thank you to all the councillors.

311
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:54,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot being said there, but I always said the same way.

312
00:32:55,467 --> 00:33:01,752
[SPEAKER_01]: to really understand what's involved in an election, is to be a part of the workers.

313
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:05,815
[SPEAKER_01]: If you never work an election, you don't know what's involved.

314
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:06,555
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.

315
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:14,081
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be elected, but I'm not taking away your knowledge or understanding of what's going on.

316
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's go back to, back to 2023. 2023,

317
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:25,190
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a transition of a new department, new commission.

318
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a new employee on board.

319
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:33,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't enjoy putting anybody under the bus.

320
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:38,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy somebody to be, you know, loyal to, to me.

321
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me the truth.

322
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

323
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unless you tell me the truth, I won't be able to help you.

324
00:33:44,700 --> 00:34:01,381
[SPEAKER_01]: uh in the past we conducted because council Scott barely mentioned that so many times here it's not a question we do not train the poll workers is the question here in place would have been did we okay prior to the 2023 election because

325
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:07,811
[SPEAKER_01]: 2021, 2022, I was a part of this organization.

326
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I was appointed as a commissioner in 2022.

327
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,474
[SPEAKER_01]: But prior to that, I was a poll worker.

328
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:15,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it all.

329
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:19,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I lift boxes, and there's a lot I've done.

330
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:29,742
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to squeeze at least two election training for poll workers.

331
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:33,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And we broke our training, two training,

332
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:39,809
[SPEAKER_01]: for the warden and clerk and two training for the inspectors.

333
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:58,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that help if you look at, I said that in a way people think it's a little sensitive, but I can say it because I'm a, one of the senior citizen, a guy like me, if you tell me something three, four months before take place, I'll probably forget.

334
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:08,054
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you tell me two weeks before, even you guys who are elected officials knows well that elections are run within two weeks of the date.

335
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It will stay in your mind.

336
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:16,438
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2023, there was an election, training was conducted.

337
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:18,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of pressure.

338
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it.

339
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:27,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I, as a, not as a chairman, I, as a citizen, was not happy.

340
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,396
[SPEAKER_01]: with that election training.

341
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:30,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was done well.

342
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:41,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it fit the purpose, which caused an impact on the date of the election of November 2023.

343
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:56,212
[SPEAKER_01]: We had poll workers that did took action that weren't supposed to be taken, which caused the number on the memory card to zero

344
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:00,716
[SPEAKER_01]: and wipe out the whole day of election.

345
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:01,936
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that happened.

346
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,596
[SPEAKER_01]: But we took corrective action.

347
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We took correct measure.

348
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:24,580
[SPEAKER_01]: When people are saying that recent election proved to everyone in the city of Method that it wasn't the case of 2023, we actually, we say what we were gonna, we did what we said we were gonna do.

349
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the

350
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: The result came in a little bit late, but the city council must realize Medford is as the equipment that we use in the election.

351
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:45,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They are as old as Medford.

352
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,801
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a laptop that is not up to date.

353
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I will even play any game on that thing.

354
00:36:56,784 --> 00:37:11,293
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the application, the Microsoft Excel application that you need to download the data from the high-speed tabulator.

355
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,015
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to download

356
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:20,752
[SPEAKER_01]: a volume of data from a laptop to a home drive, it takes forever.

357
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:23,534
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Henry Malone going to church, okay?

358
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:24,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Twice.

359
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slow.

360
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:26,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Very slow.

361
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:39,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't that now we realize what was missing and this is something we're in the middle of budget and that's something I and I will always take my hat in front of uh

362
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:50,286
[SPEAKER_01]: communicated effectively with me and understood what was going on.

363
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:56,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not putting anybody else down because you know, this is not my style.

364
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:57,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

365
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:01,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh and and I don't stop early.

366
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,291
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll love that.

367
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:05,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, you you were my friend before Zach, you know that.

368
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:07,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So, don't worry.

369
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:08,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to go anywhere.

370
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:10,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the thing we have to

371
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:15,586
[SPEAKER_01]: communication.

372
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:35,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to touch about staffing because I will defer that when the time comes for the you know, chief of staff to speak about that because we're doing as best we can to see uh within the next 160 days, we have somebody on.

373
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:38,444
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have the staff in place to do the work.

374
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:45,781
[SPEAKER_01]: people listening.

375
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:52,443
[SPEAKER_01]: People listening is confusing in the city of Method because people keep referring to them as caucus.

376
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:58,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Others refer to them as uh confirmation of uh residents or address.

377
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:04,626
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's world of because you guys talk about other uh communities.

378
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:10,708
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's one person who works with other communities, his name is Henry Miller and because that's

379
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:26,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I go all over, I do election in Randolph, I do election in Brockton, I do election in Boston, I do election in Springfield, and so on to name a few, okay?

380
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:35,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Today as well, people receive a lot of information, and it happened recently.

381
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:41,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the city of Method, and we will, during this past election, during March,

382
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:45,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone mentioned to me about registration of voters.

383
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:52,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to explain it to them how people receive multiple voter registration.

384
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it from MassHealth.

385
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:55,767
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it from IMV.

386
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,469
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it from limit.

387
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:58,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.

388
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,972
[SPEAKER_01]: That same day I got home, my wife

389
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife, who's an active voter, never miss an election, okay?

390
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:10,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when she was working in Washington, will fly in to vote in Medford.

391
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Receive at least three on the same day.

392
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:22,519
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, Reginald, who is a disabled citizen, received four that same day, okay?

393
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:23,859
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this thing happen.

394
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard one of the council mentioned the fact about

395
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:32,902
[SPEAKER_01]: inactive.

396
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:43,447
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's fair because Councilor Scapelli mentioned a former city councilor who happened to be my friend too.

397
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:48,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Who happened to insult a friend of mine at that polling location.

398
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:58,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I walk, I go to a bank every day and at one point someone asked me for an ID, the best I can do is pull that ID and say there it is, okay?

399
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:23,976
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sent you the street listing which is what you call a local census, if you fail to turn it back to the, send it back to the registry of God at the time or to the election commission now, we will send you a second notification.

400
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:29,878
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you up to three notification to tell you what

401
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,880
[SPEAKER_01]: X, we did, we sent it to you, you didn't read, we never got it back.

402
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,181
[SPEAKER_01]: But after the third one, what you do, you become inactive.

403
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:49,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Being inactive, and I will say it again for people, does not stop you from voting.

404
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of no one, no one ever should ever be

405
00:41:56,494 --> 00:42:23,170
[SPEAKER_01]: uh prevented from exercising their civic obligation which is to vote but there are ways of doing it if you come to me you say you voted because right now we're conducting and to find out someone who lives here and we're trying to find out whether that person is registered in new hampshire we don't know that because new hampshire doesn't have uh an agreement

406
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:28,118
[SPEAKER_01]: with the state of Massachusetts to share database, okay?

407
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,899
[SPEAKER_01]: That has nothing to do with the process.

408
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have the best process around?

409
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:34,821
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.

410
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:44,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But every day we, just like I said back in November, I believe I sent this on the council's meeting of January 23rd, 2024.

411
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:45,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a report that was first.

412
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:59,795
[SPEAKER_01]: the attendance of our commissioners, which I sent, and it's part of, it's fair.

413
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:12,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a personal after action report from that election of November 23, detailing, just like it says, okay, what is our mission?

414
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,252
[SPEAKER_01]: What we were expected to do?

415
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,322
[SPEAKER_01]: What didn't we do to cause the issue?

416
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:24,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And what will we be doing moving forward to prevent that from ever repeating itself?

417
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:33,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it before, any election without irregularities is not an election, it's a selection.

418
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:39,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Because anytime you have human doing transaction with document,

419
00:43:40,712 --> 00:43:43,313
[SPEAKER_01]: with manual, there will always be an issue.

420
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:48,996
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to recognize what took place and make action of it.

421
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:52,477
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about memory card.

422
00:43:53,538 --> 00:44:09,285
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the thing I did on the last election this March 5th, I created a document to track down how fast am I, we are receiving in the vault, how fast we receiving the memory card that we need

423
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:12,744
[SPEAKER_01]: to get our unofficial result.

424
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:19,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it started, we closed the poll at 8 p.m.

425
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:28,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have to do additional ballot depositing because we closed all the poll.

426
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:30,548
[SPEAKER_01]: The last group of

427
00:44:31,821 --> 00:44:32,361
[SPEAKER_01]: four.

428
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I receive it was 859.

429
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:36,663
[SPEAKER_01]: That number strike in my head.

430
00:44:36,723 --> 00:44:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the report in front of me but I remember the first one came in at 834.

431
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:53,968
[SPEAKER_01]: The last group, we had four two runners, two commissioners and we had uh and I believe uh commissioner Aaron D Benedito is on the call.

432
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:55,609
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of the commissioners

433
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:05,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the last one came back to me at eight fifty-nine.

434
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:09,096
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about nine o'clock almost an hour after the polls close.

435
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:20,680
[SPEAKER_01]: We were lucky we both we shared this unofficial report at ten thirty-eight PM on March 5th.

436
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,201
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge improvement from

437
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:34,092
[SPEAKER_01]: two key personnel in the election department.

438
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:57,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the chief of staff, the chief of staff to me, because there's a lot of things, I heard that, I allowed a lot of things to happen because she was there to be our eyes, the eyes of the commissioners, the eyes of guiding people to make sure

439
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:02,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it better be done at 8 o'clock.

440
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:25,180
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say we're going to do 10 days from such a date, we have to do it because I heard one commissioner mentioned there's so many laws, so many chapters in the Massachusetts General Law that guide the process that tells us what to do, when to do it, how to do it.

441
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to follow it.

442
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:29,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I said before, I will say it again.

443
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:36,401
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of running right now, we're in the process of getting our election ready.

444
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get our calendar ready.

445
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:39,383
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get our place ready.

446
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:52,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked close with the City Council to find out when we were on the verge of displacing people from Ward 4, Precinct 2, which is Walking Court.

447
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:53,775
[SPEAKER_01]: which we didn't know.

448
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:57,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, already we are in that process.

449
00:46:57,477 --> 00:47:00,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be able to use that in September.

450
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:11,766
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know yet but I was curious to find out if we don't start now, I don't need to go and try to give a false breath, you know, not to know exactly where we're going to go.

451
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:12,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's a lot.

452
00:47:25,214 --> 00:47:31,018
[SPEAKER_01]: We are out there doing, downloading the high-speed tabulator.

453
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:31,658
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes longer.

454
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:34,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was there telling people, it's 40% done.

455
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,341
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 45% done.

456
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:37,702
[SPEAKER_01]: All that thing is slow.

457
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:38,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 50.

458
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:40,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I was counting the percentage.

459
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:46,628
[SPEAKER_01]: You think the people of Medford will give you the respect to say, OK, this is not you.

460
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:48,369
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a machine.

461
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:52,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person that was doing it knew it was a machine.

462
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:56,888
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was told that I'm in violation of election law.

463
00:47:57,168 --> 00:48:01,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, then if I do, sue me, you know, because I don't see any election violation there.

464
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:08,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a machine that is older than Henry Malone, okay, that I didn't purchase for the city of Method.

465
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:10,454
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know that exists.

466
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:12,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know it exists.

467
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:13,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what to do with it.

468
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:18,320
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have my computer every year, I get that upgraded.

469
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:20,782
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not up to the commission.

470
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:23,405
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not up to the council.

471
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the council who will present that to the commission and see.

472
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:30,351
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give us all the stuff that we need.

473
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:33,054
[SPEAKER_01]: We will work it.

474
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:37,324
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have enough staff to work, we're going to make it.

475
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:40,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to get a clear and first election.

476
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:45,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go back to 2022, because Councilor Zach was on a call with me.

477
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:50,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a call which may have saved a more issue.

478
00:48:51,187 --> 00:49:00,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in front of election manager who probably never, ever summarized the result of an election.

479
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:05,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It was close to twelve thirty in the morning and I made a call.

480
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:16,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, whatever we have today, we're going to stop and we're going to come back the next day and get it right because no matter what we put out, it's going to be an issue and that was the right call.

481
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,657
[SPEAKER_01]: When I checked with the state, the state said, you make the right call.

482
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the council didn't like it.

483
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fair, fair game.

484
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the the citizen didn't like it.

485
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:25,543
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

486
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:30,946
[SPEAKER_01]: frame work of election.

487
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:33,290
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need to take in consideration.

488
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't think anybody wants it to run any better than I do.

489
00:49:37,356 --> 00:49:41,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not because I'm a chair of that commission, because I am Henry Malone.

490
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:44,286
[SPEAKER_01]: People knows who lives in the city.

491
01:02:51,795 --> 01:02:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, again, I'm happy to answer any questions.

492
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:59,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try not to go down any rabbit holes, but I, those are my comments.

493
01:03:00,303 --> 01:03:03,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemingng, did you have any follow-up questions as of right now?

494
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:11,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly I'd like to just know what, how the search for a new election manager is going.

495
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:17,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it's going good.

496
01:03:17,265 --> 01:03:29,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I always treat these search processes as confidential because there's just a lot of best practices in terms of like I'm not gonna I wouldn't stand before this committee and state the number of applicants were interviewing.

497
01:03:29,913 --> 01:03:33,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't state the number of applicants that applied for the position.

498
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:35,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's in the industry.

499
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:37,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really considered a confidential process.

500
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:43,855
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I will say I'm feeling very positively about it.

501
01:03:47,177 --> 01:03:50,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I recognized Councilor Collins earlier and then Councilor Bears.

502
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Councilor Bears.

503
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:54,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

504
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:59,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had two quick questions on the timeline.

505
01:04:00,665 --> 01:04:07,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like the pool is good and you're not gonna get into specifics, I respect that, but hopefully within four to six weeks there'd be someone

506
01:04:08,257 --> 01:04:09,278
[SPEAKER_06]: That would certainly be my hope.

507
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:10,439
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

508
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:19,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And the halftime position, I know we've had some applicants, some hiring rounds, some non-hirings eventually.

509
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:20,666
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we there?

510
01:04:20,906 --> 01:04:21,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have applicants?

511
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:22,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have someone in that position?

512
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:28,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that I need to check with our human resources office about the next steps.

513
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:33,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's my understanding we're ready to move to a second meeting.

514
01:04:33,655 --> 01:04:34,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really formal when it's

515
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:45,461
[SPEAKER_06]: we set up a formal interview committee, usually with, you know, full-time, you know, but it all depends and varies.

516
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:47,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And this- But there's people in the pipeline for the half-time position.

517
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's more of a, I think the next step on this one is more of a meeting and a, you know, kind of a validation, so to speak, but then we're ready to move forward.

518
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

519
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:56,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, so.

520
01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:56,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

521
01:04:57,047 --> 01:04:57,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

522
01:04:57,888 --> 01:04:58,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

523
01:04:58,928 --> 01:04:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

524
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:02,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Stang.

525
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being here to

526
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:13,065
[SPEAKER_03]: speak to this and for, you know, all of the very obviously extra work you've been doing over the past several months to fill this gap in the elections department.

527
01:05:13,805 --> 01:05:20,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the council really sees that, and speaking as one councillor, it's really appreciated, and I hope that this additional labor is over for you soon.

528
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:29,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No specific questions to the chief of staff at this point, but just, you know, to further echo my, I'm really happy to hear that.

529
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's obviously totally sensible that, you know, priority number one is filling that role.

530
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:36,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else flows from that, right?

531
01:05:36,634 --> 01:05:46,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And it strikes me that, you know, I tend to look at most of the issues that we have to collaborate on in the city as, you know, a problem or perhaps a potential solution of,

532
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: project management.

533
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:59,631
[SPEAKER_03]: This certainly seems like one you need to find that person through whom policy updates and further staffing evaluations and the work of the department will flow through.

534
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:02,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's good to hear that that's being prioritized.

535
01:06:02,832 --> 01:06:05,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's a priority that this council shares.

536
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:10,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just to take it back to the big picture, I again want to

537
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of reaffirm, you know, in my perspective, what this conversation is and what it isn't.

538
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:27,781
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll speak only for myself, but I know that every city councilor, you know, sees the hard work that's put in by the Elections Commission, and that has never been in doubt.

539
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:36,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when we talk about having support and having resources and having bandwidth, it's about resiliency.

540
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:42,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think if, you know, if all the population of Medford

541
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:56,240
[SPEAKER_03]: stepped up in the way that our elections commissioners and that team does so reliably and so, you know, above and beyond, then, yeah, our staffing needs within the city would be a lot lower because that would be a city full of superheroes.

542
01:06:57,721 --> 01:07:11,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a city council and as an administration, you know, it's our responsibility to make sure that these systems are resilient so that, you know, if another more enticing commission steals away, you know, the chair of the elections commission,

543
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:20,667
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's still ample people to do the work that absolutely needs to get done and can't not get done legally and for the health of the democracy of the city.

544
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really the motivation behind these conversations is to say, how can we help to make sure that the elections department is as resilient as it needs to be?

545
01:07:33,305 --> 01:07:40,128
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that the next election, another consequential one, you know, goes as well as March did or even better.

546
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:48,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make sure that city staff and commissioners and all residents and voters can feel that peace of mind throughout the year.

547
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:51,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate everybody's participation in this process.

548
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:55,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's really great to have these conversations out in the open.

549
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:57,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Bears.

550
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:58,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

551
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to add one more thing, which is it may be valuable when the new person is hired for them to issue.

552
01:08:08,147 --> 01:08:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: As maybe I know you mentioned a post election audit.

553
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:19,116
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask the team what they thought went well, what didn't go well, and we're going to, um, you know, update where needed procedures, processes, systems, etcetera.

554
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:19,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was great.

555
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:22,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may be worth it.

556
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:33,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may meet some of the suggestions and thoughts of others to have the new elections manager kind of do an entry audit of some kind to say, okay, I have now arrived.

557
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:41,351
[SPEAKER_00]: here's what I see that playing, and I don't want to prescribe too much to it, but just to say, here's where I see things now.

558
01:08:41,971 --> 01:08:47,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to working with this team to run through the election.

559
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:53,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would kind of give a benchmark from a somewhat outside perspective of someone who's new to the office.

560
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:59,727
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just be a way to have fresh eyes on something right away, write something to say, here's my perception on day one.

561
01:09:00,609 --> 01:09:08,772
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of what I think the office is, what my priorities are going to be going in, what I'm hearing from my staff, from the aid team, from the elections commission as priorities.

562
01:09:09,572 --> 01:09:18,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, after the September election, that could be a benchmark for them to write a report as well to say, you know, here's what I saw coming in.

563
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:19,956
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been through the primary.

564
01:09:20,877 --> 01:09:22,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some stuff, some conclusions that I'm going to put out there.

565
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:26,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to put that out as maybe a potential way for, um, uh,

566
01:09:27,825 --> 01:09:47,340
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential thing for them to do when they start and also a way to talk to us and share with us what their vision is to be in this role, since it has been such a, there's been a lot of eyes and cameras and conversations and resolutions and public discussion about this role.

567
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:53,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is kind of the reality of elections being the person running elections.

568
01:09:53,544 --> 01:09:53,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a,

569
01:09:55,430 --> 01:10:00,693
[SPEAKER_00]: a level of responsibility to, nothing else happens if the democratic process doesn't happen, right?

570
01:10:00,773 --> 01:10:02,735
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a level of responsibility there.

571
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:06,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to, again, I don't want to be too prescriptive about what that would look like.

572
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:15,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to necessarily say, write everything down, tell us everything you think on day one and without some sort of editing process, of course.

573
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,044
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there could be some value there.

574
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:19,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a thought.

575
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:23,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly appreciate the thoughts.

576
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:30,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only thing that I would say, a couple of things I would probably say, but I'll reserve to one thing, which I think is the most important of the two.

577
01:10:33,306 --> 01:10:40,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my role here in, I think, today's discussion,

578
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:50,171
[SPEAKER_06]: pertains to the March 5th election because I'm happy to answer any questions that pertain to that election because I have more firsthand knowledge.

579
01:10:51,653 --> 01:10:56,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly didn't touch every single thing in that election, but I had a responsibility to that election.

580
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take responsibility for that election.

581
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the any errors from that election are on me.

582
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:08,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I know that the commissioners absorbed some of that, too, and I appreciate their support in all of that.

583
01:11:08,456 --> 01:11:10,557
[SPEAKER_06]: But I take responsibility for any of those.

584
01:11:11,257 --> 01:11:24,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as far as other areas of my involvement here, I obviously I'm here to speak to this council about anything budget oriented, where the chief of staff relates to the elections department, and I'm happy to

585
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:25,872
[SPEAKER_06]: that discussion as well.

586
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:48,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not be here to I would be here to take back ideas and information for future discussions with an election manager, but I have to respect the role that the commissioners play in all of this and certainly defer to them on further discussion as to that with amongst themselves and with the elections manager in the future.

587
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:48,825
[SPEAKER_06]: future.

588
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:53,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that that's clear, because I'm not going to overstep the Elections Commission.

589
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:57,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not suggesting you're saying that, but I just want to, I want to clarify the rules.

590
01:11:57,187 --> 01:12:03,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to clarify, you know, any, what commitments I can make and what commitments I shouldn't be in a position.

591
01:12:03,408 --> 01:12:08,949
[SPEAKER_00]: That idea goes out to Henry, Aaron, the commission, when I looked at you the whole time.

592
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:10,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know.

593
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:11,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I read it.

594
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah,

595
01:12:18,086 --> 01:12:26,588
[SPEAKER_01]: through uh council's like uh there I share uh a report to share with everybody on the council.

596
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:37,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go through it step by step but I will go out of the nine thing that put one of the key thing that strike me the most is resolve and transparency.

597
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:38,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

598
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The counting and tabulation of vote were conducted.

599
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:48,636
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lack of accuracy, okay?

600
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:54,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that and we took action to fix that.

601
01:12:54,381 --> 01:13:11,816
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommendation based on past election, I said, we have to strengthen effort to engage everybody, every group in the city of Bedford who are citizen of Bedford to ensure inclusivity, inclusive

602
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:15,405
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout our election process.

603
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:20,906
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to improve our technical infrastructure at polling station.

604
01:13:21,686 --> 01:13:38,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the report the chief of staff shared with you for March 5th, I was all over the city making sure the night before the election we had challenge of polling station.

605
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have too many places in Medford.

606
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:51,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that we worked at the council saying was with me the night, the final day that before we make the final decision on walking court.

607
01:13:53,237 --> 01:13:55,278
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to signage.

608
01:13:55,438 --> 01:14:03,085
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an issue with signage, which you saw on the recent report of March 5th.

609
01:14:03,325 --> 01:14:04,066
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact I,

610
01:14:05,643 --> 01:14:22,279
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically stated to DPW instead of leaving our sign to the actual polling station, polling location, bring it back to the election department where we can sit down prior to an election.

611
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:24,781
[SPEAKER_01]: We know exactly how many signs we have.

612
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:29,205
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a clear number, you don't know how to do it.

613
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:29,766
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that.

614
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:34,410
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest issue is training.

615
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:39,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in this past election, we conducted as many training we were able to.

616
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:44,552
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some in the morning, we did some at night to make sure people were present.

617
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:49,854
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key thing that I've caused issue is communication.

618
01:14:50,774 --> 01:14:52,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Communication is key during the election.

619
01:14:53,035 --> 01:15:01,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be able, no matter where you are, at a given, it's like me, for instance, I told people, you call me, I'll be there in no time, okay?

620
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:18,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's the same thing if I need from the election office on election day To get in touch with a police officer or to get in touch with a poor polling A poll worker, which is uh, most more than likely.

621
01:15:18,434 --> 01:15:27,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be the warden because he's the ceo of that polling, uh station That should be done without any issue.

622
01:15:27,959 --> 01:15:30,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an issue there and I don't think

623
01:15:31,232 --> 01:15:37,475
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout our training, we told the people, make sure we have a communication between us.

624
01:15:38,675 --> 01:15:41,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Transparency, we gotta get more detail.

625
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:53,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, what I'm saying, I said, past election were conducted to the best we had in our hands, or to the best we had, whatever we could have done, we make it happen.

626
01:15:54,202 --> 01:15:54,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it perfect?

627
01:15:54,962 --> 01:15:56,023
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't perfect.

628
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:57,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Was I happy?

629
01:15:57,043 --> 01:15:57,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.

630
01:15:58,204 --> 01:16:00,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go back and said, and which I

631
01:16:01,539 --> 01:16:04,181
[SPEAKER_01]: believe I shared that through a conversation with.

632
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:24,654
[SPEAKER_01]: After the municipal election of 2023, I went home and spent an entire weekend where my wife almost throw me out of state because I was working too much on election after election, because I wanted to create a what you call a post election audit, what you just mentioned there.

633
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:25,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So Zach,

634
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:28,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, you know what?

635
01:16:28,808 --> 01:16:30,689
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go through a recount.

636
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,850
[SPEAKER_01]: That never took place.

637
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:32,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done.

638
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:36,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying to establish how do we do it?

639
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we do it online?

640
01:16:37,754 --> 01:16:39,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we do it in paper?

641
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:46,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're dealing with poor workers that has limited access to technology, okay?

642
01:16:46,919 --> 01:16:48,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them will want to do it.

643
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:52,109
[SPEAKER_01]: that all this, we never got a chance to do it.

644
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:55,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, what we end up doing, we did a recount audit.

645
01:16:56,051 --> 01:17:02,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, past election of March 5th, what we did, we went different.

646
01:17:02,474 --> 01:17:10,579
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked every warden, every clerk, every inspectors, write something.

647
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:13,000
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see something that didn't go well,

648
01:17:14,154 --> 01:17:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: during the election, let us know.

649
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:21,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have someone who collected all that together.

650
01:17:21,377 --> 01:17:37,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the conversation I may have with some of the workers, and I believe I may have mentioned that during a conversation with the chief of staff, it may or may not be true, is we need to have a post audit election for March 5th.

651
01:17:38,385 --> 01:17:42,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're not doing this is that we don't have an election manager.

652
01:17:42,348 --> 01:17:48,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We would prefer to sit down with that election manager and say, this is what took place.

653
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:50,655
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what went OK.

654
01:17:50,775 --> 01:17:54,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to keep that in an archive for reference.

655
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:22,818
[SPEAKER_01]: councils any council can come in and say what happened on January 23rd and we should be able to look and find out exactly what happened what didn't we do what did we do and those are the things I wanted to say and they're in place and they are being conducted if you went on the same package that I've sent to to the council which made the agenda is the fact I spoke

656
01:18:23,562 --> 01:18:28,606
[SPEAKER_01]: step-by-step on each irregularities that came to my attention.

657
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying to all to the election commission.

658
01:18:31,989 --> 01:18:47,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to my attention because we took a vote on the night November 18, 2023 and ask every commissioner write something, write an after action report.

659
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:50,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps what I observe is not what you observe.

660
01:18:50,903 --> 01:18:51,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps what

661
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:57,459
[SPEAKER_01]: what uh John Doe observed is not what uh Jack observed.

662
01:18:57,519 --> 01:19:03,284
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that way we could have put a master together and serve answer to your question better.

663
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:04,985
[SPEAKER_01]: We are frustrated.

664
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:07,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We are mad and people knows me.

665
01:19:07,127 --> 01:19:08,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Things don't go well.

666
01:19:08,648 --> 01:19:16,514
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's upset but the thing is we are trying to enhance any irregularities that exist.

667
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:17,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Take action

668
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:22,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an example.

669
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:24,597
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, Warbird School.

670
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an election at Warbird School.

671
01:19:26,758 --> 01:19:28,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We changed our normal entrance.

672
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:29,740
[SPEAKER_01]: We took action.

673
01:19:30,401 --> 01:19:32,442
[SPEAKER_01]: We went there to make sure we had light.

674
01:19:33,576 --> 01:19:34,516
[SPEAKER_01]: We had signage.

675
01:19:35,057 --> 01:19:36,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we have enough signage?

676
01:19:36,637 --> 01:19:37,598
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we did not.

677
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:41,400
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, in the next election, will we have enough?

678
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we know.

679
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we had four, that didn't work.

680
01:19:44,381 --> 01:19:45,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we may need six.

681
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:48,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we had an issue at Brooks, okay?

682
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:52,265
[SPEAKER_01]: People come personally who knows me, call and say, Henry,

683
01:19:52,845 --> 01:19:53,005
[SPEAKER_01]: election.

684
01:19:53,025 --> 01:19:56,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I couldn't get through where we normally vote at the Brooks.

685
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:58,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we say, okay, we're going to fix that.

686
01:19:59,089 --> 01:19:59,949
[SPEAKER_01]: We had that fix.

687
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:01,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not me who was fixing.

688
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:16,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my job is to go to every single polling station on the giving day of an election to see what's in my eyes, not as a commissioner, as a citizen, what's right, what's wrong.

689
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:16,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I've

690
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:21,700
[SPEAKER_01]: city clerk.

691
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:31,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, he will, he will post something, set a polling station, I will go and sneak behind him to see if he did it well for the disability people.

692
01:20:31,977 --> 01:20:33,500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how sneaky I can be.

693
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, it's fair

694
01:20:36,346 --> 01:20:42,788
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone sees something that's not right with an election, you bring it to our attention and we take action.

695
01:20:42,848 --> 01:20:44,248
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanted to bring up.

696
01:20:44,608 --> 01:20:49,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the next report about irregularities, I believe step by step.

697
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to read the whole thing.

698
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to waste your time with more than what's in front of you.

699
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're doing.

700
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:01,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Commissioner Lauren.

701
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:03,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your detailed response.

702
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:10,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other Councilors for our questions from Councilors before I asked a really short few questions?

703
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:12,281
[SPEAKER_09]: None?

704
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:13,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

705
01:21:14,022 --> 01:21:26,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering, Chief of Staff, if you could speak to what the audit process looked like, the one that, the post-election audit that you mentioned in your report after the March primary, and I was wondering what the progress on that is like.

706
01:21:28,746 --> 01:21:29,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

707
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:40,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually gonna defer to Commissioner Malorin on that because it's something that Commissioner Malorin has in his mind as to how that process would go.

708
01:21:40,755 --> 01:21:46,079
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, we have prioritized our time and resources right now into the hiring.

709
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:54,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that process is underway sufficiently and doesn't require the level of time and energy, I think we're gonna begin on that next step.

710
01:21:54,685 --> 01:21:56,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, I defer to Commissioner Millard.

711
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:56,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

712
01:21:56,886 --> 01:21:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Commissioner Millard, can you speak really quickly to that?

713
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:13,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, quickly, just like I just mentioned quickly to you, we provided every election poll worker to submit irregularities as they observe during the day of election.

714
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:18,335
[SPEAKER_01]: All those have been retrieved by a member of our team.

715
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:20,750
[SPEAKER_01]: put together in a group.

716
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:35,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what we're going to do, we're going to review them and master them into a master document to go over them with the next hiring manager, because we try not to do it ahead of hiring somebody.

717
01:22:35,894 --> 01:22:41,295
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do it as a whole, that will actually fall exactly where council Zach mentioned.

718
01:22:41,675 --> 01:22:46,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way that election manager will walk in and know what didn't go right.

719
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:54,785
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're trying to correct, so we'll give her at least some objectives as to what we want to do.

720
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:58,111
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a process, it's a process.

721
01:22:59,443 --> 01:23:06,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering, I think we were focusing a lot on the day of the election and days leading up to the election.

722
01:23:06,829 --> 01:23:12,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some of the irregularities might be explained by just a long-term setup.

723
01:23:12,514 --> 01:23:20,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering if there, in soliciting feedback, are you also asking about the months before the election as well?

724
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:23,943
[SPEAKER_01]: The most that we have, we're looking at both of them.

725
01:23:24,223 --> 01:23:28,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you have to remember one thing Council was saying, we're looking at the municipality,

726
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:37,314
[SPEAKER_01]: election of 2023, we're also talking about the March 5th presidential primaries.

727
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:47,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as to the municipality, we still have to do, we, that's, that's the one that gave us the idea of creating a survey.

728
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:52,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's what you called it, a survey after the election.

729
01:23:53,087 --> 01:23:54,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's broken down.

730
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:57,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I can even share it with you councils, okay, to see it.

731
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:01,411
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it, because we agree we're going to work with each other.

732
01:24:01,971 --> 01:24:09,535
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at the model we put together and you can see, you know, we can add more.

733
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:20,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So as to march 5th, that's when we're doing the post audit because there's no reason now to go back into uh, 2023.

734
01:24:20,236 --> 01:24:21,137
[SPEAKER_01]: We already did that.

735
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:29,621
[SPEAKER_01]: We count we already provide the council Uh the last council with uh, not the last because it was in december, right?

736
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we provided a recount

737
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:37,710
[SPEAKER_01]: a post recount or a report where you may call it.

738
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:43,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the one thing we're working on is the post audit of March 5th.

739
01:24:43,634 --> 01:24:46,216
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be on the day of the election.

740
01:24:46,376 --> 01:24:49,538
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it internal and external.

741
01:24:49,678 --> 01:24:58,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be when we say internal, we had the advanced team, those who were there for pre-election

742
01:24:59,153 --> 01:25:00,994
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation prep, okay?

743
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:01,454
[SPEAKER_01]: They were there.

744
01:25:01,474 --> 01:25:04,135
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things they did that went well.

745
01:25:04,216 --> 01:25:09,218
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things they did that didn't go well for them and we intend to take correction.

746
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're talking on the day of the election.

747
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,621
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I give you an example.

748
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:22,424
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was talking, I said, uh, uh, just today I was having a conversation and something came to mind.

749
01:25:22,504 --> 01:25:24,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, okay, uh,

750
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:47,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 20 minutes of 7... at 20 minutes of 8, I'm sorry, 7.40, we tell our runners to go to the polling site to retrieve the memory card and return them to... to City Wall, so we can get our...

751
01:25:48,673 --> 01:25:50,336
[SPEAKER_01]: discount of election.

752
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:51,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing it right?

753
01:25:51,978 --> 01:25:53,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're doing it right.

754
01:25:53,380 --> 01:26:04,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what it is, let's say if I have a guy who I send one courier to the temple, which is on Winthrop Street, I send the same courier, I send that same courier to

755
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:07,164
[SPEAKER_01]: to former Columbus school.

756
01:26:07,344 --> 01:26:08,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good height.

757
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:20,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the thing we're trying to do now, try to look at same way together, a group of where you say you go to the fire station on West Medford,

758
01:26:21,013 --> 01:26:21,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can.

759
01:26:21,673 --> 01:26:23,815
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you can go to the American Legion.

760
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:27,297
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you can go to the temple.

761
01:26:27,577 --> 01:26:31,339
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, on the way back to City Hall, you can stop at Walking Court.

762
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,060
[SPEAKER_01]: That will do you for the night.

763
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:37,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guy who's at Tufts University can go from Tufts.

764
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:43,987
[SPEAKER_01]: He or she can swing by to the fire station on Main Street and do the city.

765
01:26:44,207 --> 01:26:48,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the things we're trying to put together for the post-audit.

766
01:26:49,091 --> 01:27:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: it won't happen before the next election and when I say the next election remember elections start with early voting it's that we vote by mail I believe right now we're about 160 days away from

767
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:07,398
[SPEAKER_01]: September 23rd and 200 something days from November.

768
01:27:07,838 --> 01:27:18,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we will get that done before that because once we clear with the managing process, we get the staff together and people are recovering from election.

769
01:27:18,606 --> 01:27:19,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have that.

770
01:27:19,766 --> 01:27:25,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get it done, you guys will be the first to receive it because we owe that to you.

771
01:27:26,465 --> 01:27:27,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Commissioner Mullen.

772
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I have full faith that you'll get that report done.

773
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:35,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the length of this meeting, I want to wrap up pretty soon.

774
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:39,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for the chief of staff, two really short questions.

775
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:47,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you were in charge of a lot with this most recent election, and it seems to have gone better than previous elections.

776
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:50,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you could speak to what went right about it and what we can continue doing.

777
01:27:52,683 --> 01:28:15,432
[SPEAKER_09]: to in that process because it seems like there were improvements and um you know i i think we've we've all made our stance clear on our individual stances clear on the number of fds we think are needed for the the department um i've personally heard from members of the the team that um that they would prefer more fds in the department

778
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:23,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was wondering if you could explain a little bit, you know, how might we reassess or assess whether we need more to keep the same number?

779
01:28:23,519 --> 01:28:24,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

780
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:26,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

781
01:28:26,162 --> 01:28:28,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to answer those questions the best I can.

782
01:28:28,884 --> 01:28:39,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to dodge the first question, but I do want to recognize that I, you know, I'm only able to speak firsthand knowledge on one election, and I don't know that it would be entirely

783
01:28:41,906 --> 01:28:55,214
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't want to be haste in answering that question and, you know, not have the benefit of multiple experiences to have a really well-rounded answer for you.

784
01:28:55,234 --> 01:29:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I think having been, I think the best thing I can say to this committee and to the council as a whole is this elections are,

785
01:29:07,194 --> 01:29:09,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's a lot that goes into it.

786
01:29:09,375 --> 01:29:11,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I, I am.

787
01:29:12,876 --> 01:29:16,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I somewhat feel fortunate to have had that opportunity to learn that.

788
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:27,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really truly, I would say that for any one of our departments, but now I've had the chance to specifically, um, work alongside with many of our elections.

789
01:29:28,183 --> 01:29:30,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Team members and can say that one firsthand.

790
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:31,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

791
01:29:33,052 --> 01:30:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much that goes into it and there's a lot of moving parts, you know, and I and I I will say, you know, there's Based the best thing I think I can share with this committee is based on what one would learn from one election The biggest reflection I can share is that one election only gives you a snapshot of everything that goes into it and all the detail and all the work and all of the

792
01:30:04,013 --> 01:30:06,214
[SPEAKER_06]: hidden possibilities, right?

793
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:12,536
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the hidden possibilities that Commissioner Malorne and I prepped for was signage, really, truly.

794
01:30:12,596 --> 01:30:21,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it seems like we might not have prepped for it because we had an issue at the Roberts School, but we went to almost every polling location in advance of the election.

795
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: He drove and I observed because I wanted to be sure that I had some knowledge as to the location, some wherewithal as to how to address a problem when it came through and how to adequately do it because we knew we were flying blind with signs.

796
01:30:41,273 --> 01:30:46,238
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't want to be in that situation, but we had been in that situation for the last, I don't know how many years.

797
01:30:50,155 --> 01:30:50,815
[SPEAKER_06]: more than several.

798
01:30:51,175 --> 01:30:56,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that means, but so we prepped signs.

799
01:30:56,836 --> 01:30:59,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I was prepping signs in advance of election day.

800
01:30:59,477 --> 01:31:09,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We were calling and we were finding out what signs, it turns out, again, I think that this may have been in my report, but we had signs at virtually 18 locations throughout the city.

801
01:31:10,018 --> 01:31:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a sustainable way to determine your sign inventory.

802
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:13,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We've corrected that.

803
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:16,219
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to have that issue in September.

804
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,020
[SPEAKER_06]: But

805
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only know what you can foresee, and you can't reasonably foresee certain things.

806
01:31:26,936 --> 01:31:33,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I think many, if not all Americans, would probably agree that the November election is going to be a challenging election.

807
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,101
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only so many things we can foresee.

808
01:31:37,521 --> 01:31:44,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, having had this experience, I think the best thing I can say to this council, candidly, openly, and honestly, is

809
01:31:46,104 --> 01:31:48,210
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some things that can't be foreseen.

810
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:52,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you that with confidence right now, because I've been through this experience.

811
01:31:53,593 --> 01:32:16,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to have faith that people are going to do their best to be prepared, and that this organization, the mayor's office, the commission, the staff, and the existing staff are gonna do their absolute best to support the future elections manager, and that elections manager, I'm sure, is gonna do their very best to support this community in what will be, I'm sure, a very successful process.

812
01:32:17,592 --> 01:32:19,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are gonna be calls about problems.

813
01:32:20,154 --> 01:32:25,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want anyone to be under any false notions that we're not going to expect any problems in November.

814
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as a nation, we're expecting a lot of problems.

815
01:32:28,582 --> 01:32:37,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I think every American, or at least the vast majority of Americans, would say that, regardless of what political party you might view or be a preference to.

816
01:32:38,931 --> 01:32:40,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the best I can share on the first question.

817
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:44,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to certainly reflect on the question and think further.

818
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:59,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to dodge it, but I just, I don't think it's fair for me to say what went well and be somewhat, you know, I feel like it would be a little preposterous of me to do something like that.

819
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:03,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, thank you for your indulgence on that.

820
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:07,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second one, as far as staffing is concerned, I would say,

821
01:33:09,022 --> 01:33:24,690
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know if the A-team members who made that comment or those comments to you may have been referring to the vacant positions and the filling of those vacant positions and how that will change the makeup of the office and the perspective.

822
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:28,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, it wasn't a perfect solution or scenario that we were in.

823
01:33:28,172 --> 01:33:31,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't disagree with comments or the way it was characterized.

824
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:37,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't foresee this occurring, and I didn't necessarily want to be responsible for this.

825
01:33:38,758 --> 01:33:44,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely see it as a positive opportunity for me to have a better understanding of the support that that office needs.

826
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:49,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that support doesn't come in the way of more FTEs.

827
01:33:49,562 --> 01:33:58,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that support comes in the way of making sure that I'm able to pave the path and the way for the elections department and office to be able to

828
01:34:00,106 --> 01:34:07,411
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly and effectively turn issues around to prepare for the next several elections or the next couple and then beyond, of course.

829
01:34:08,052 --> 01:34:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I don't know the context.

830
01:34:10,073 --> 01:34:10,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't speak to it.

831
01:34:11,454 --> 01:34:17,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that the first step certainly is staffing that office, getting it fully staffed.

832
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:20,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, as I said before, I think I think we go from there.

833
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to understand what that looks like, because I believe that system can work.

834
01:34:26,363 --> 01:34:26,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

835
01:34:27,344 --> 01:34:38,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess that's something that we can talk about with a new elections manager, see, you know, let them determine what, from their perspective, what makes most sense in terms of staffing.

836
01:34:41,094 --> 01:34:43,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any motions on the floor, Councilor Collins?

837
01:34:45,938 --> 01:34:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna say kind of, you know, to wrap up, really appreciate your time tonight and all of the information, the context.

838
01:34:53,864 --> 01:34:54,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this has been a,

839
01:34:56,072 --> 01:34:57,993
[SPEAKER_03]: a real exercise in transparency.

840
01:34:58,173 --> 01:35:02,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that, you know, I think given the topic, I think that's a positive thing.

841
01:35:03,955 --> 01:35:22,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also say, you know, to echo your words, Chief Staff Sarian, and also what a mission, long day, Elections Commission Chairperson Lawrence said earlier, I don't think anybody on this council is saying, you know, we have to get to a point where we can

842
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:27,292
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, realistically assume that no problems will occur.

843
01:35:27,412 --> 01:35:28,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that's not the case.

844
01:35:28,332 --> 01:35:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing this in the context and under the backdrop of reality after all.

845
01:35:31,753 --> 01:35:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I appreciate the ability, the opportunity to, you know, talk about what's being planned, what's being worked on so that things will, you know, be professionalized and modernized and be as we intend them to be.

846
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:52,557
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I don't want to supersede any other councilors questions or motions, but after I think a long and productive discussion, I would motion to adjourn.

847
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:55,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

848
01:35:55,823 --> 01:35:58,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments or questions from councillors at this time?

849
01:35:58,845 --> 01:36:00,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

850
01:36:00,627 --> 01:36:03,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I missed my moment to say there are unknown unknowns.

851
01:36:11,637 --> 01:36:15,721
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how a FOPA can also be a great analytical matrix at the same time.

852
01:36:21,186 --> 01:36:24,294
[SPEAKER_00]: As a chair, I wanted to... Justin was two when he said that, by the way.

853
01:36:24,314 --> 01:36:24,936
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true.

854
01:36:31,043 --> 01:36:40,089
[SPEAKER_09]: As the chair of this committee, I wanted to thank you, Chief of Staff Nazarian, and thank our election commissioners for their work, and thank our elections department for the work that they've put into the elections as well.

855
01:36:40,469 --> 01:36:49,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's not easy, and there are a lot of unforeseen circumstances that are difficult to address, and, you know, we might have different perspectives on how to solve it, but it is...

856
01:36:51,702 --> 01:36:58,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're all united in wanting to get a better elections department and elections process for the city.

857
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we take any votes, I wanted to open it up to public comment.

858
01:37:02,308 --> 01:37:05,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there are people who have been on Zoom and in person.

859
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:08,691
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's any public comment, I'd be happy to recognize that.

860
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:10,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible for me to just make one last comment?

861
01:37:11,653 --> 01:37:25,779
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people who, whether it's from our various departments who help us set up and staff the elections between DPW, police, fire, we have a lot of departments, parking, we have a lot of departments who are involved in this.

862
01:37:25,819 --> 01:37:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanna say thanks to them.

863
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:30,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna say big, big thanks to all the support systems.

864
01:37:31,522 --> 01:37:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've mentioned our head clerk in our office who was instrumental.

865
01:37:36,284 --> 01:37:40,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I highlighted enough how instrumental Chairman Malorin was.

866
01:37:40,247 --> 01:37:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it goes to any of you as a surprise, but I just don't think we would have been able to do some of this success, and I think that goes to Councilor Collins and other Councilors' points.

867
01:37:52,255 --> 01:38:01,221
[SPEAKER_06]: They're valid, and I think they're well taken, but I do think that if we have a full staffing of that office and the circumstances behind the staffing we have right now, hopefully

868
01:38:01,821 --> 01:38:02,061
[SPEAKER_06]: the process.

869
01:38:02,081 --> 01:38:04,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that a lot of the commissioners don't present themselves, but I do think that, um.

870
01:38:04,824 --> 01:38:05,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have other commissioners.

871
01:38:06,025 --> 01:38:10,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Debated Edo, who's been learning a lot and been an instrumental part of the process as well.

872
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:18,955
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think that we have that sustainability built in and building so I, um, just wanted to say a special thanks to Commissioner more.

873
01:38:19,135 --> 01:38:19,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

874
01:38:19,676 --> 01:38:19,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

875
01:38:27,538 --> 01:38:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Melanie Trangali, 16 Forest Street.

876
01:38:33,062 --> 01:38:35,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a couple of comments and questions.

877
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:39,247
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it's good to see that there's work being done.

878
01:38:40,287 --> 01:38:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of you know I actually requested a recount at the November election due to all the issues that transpired.

879
01:38:48,093 --> 01:38:50,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's good to see that this election went a lot smoother.

880
01:38:50,714 --> 01:38:53,875
[SPEAKER_05]: There was still some hiccups, and there's still some issues.

881
01:38:54,476 --> 01:38:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that cleaning the voter rolls is very important.

882
01:38:59,858 --> 01:39:05,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You're wasting money sending things to people anyways that aren't eligible to vote, and that shouldn't be happening.

883
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:09,662
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things on Henry Milleran's

884
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:18,893
[SPEAKER_05]: thing here that I wanted to comment on or question on is, he talks a lot about fixing irregularities in our election.

885
01:39:19,193 --> 01:39:25,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the first four, he talks about what he wants to do, but there's really no game plan on how that's going to be done.

886
01:39:26,597 --> 01:39:31,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope to see that there's going to be some plans on how that's going to be done.

887
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: It talks about identifying and investigating irregularities.

888
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:36,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great, but how is that going to be done?

889
01:39:38,783 --> 01:39:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Establish an independent investigation committee.

890
01:39:41,805 --> 01:39:42,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Another good idea.

891
01:39:43,366 --> 01:39:44,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Secure and audit voting machines.

892
01:39:44,947 --> 01:39:46,188
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that being done?

893
01:39:46,788 --> 01:39:54,473
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that came across during the election and during the recount is what we found was that machines were counting ballots incorrectly.

894
01:39:54,913 --> 01:40:02,498
[SPEAKER_05]: There was several machines, actually, I think about 60 to 75% of the machines had different counts than actual ballots.

895
01:40:03,058 --> 01:40:07,621
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't see anything here in this plan addressing how that's gonna be rectified.

896
01:40:08,162 --> 01:40:13,886
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that came up during the recount is there was over 130 million ballots that were never counted.

897
01:40:14,246 --> 01:40:23,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, there's no plan in here to rectify or count the number of actual ballots that were received and the actual number of ballots that were counted.

898
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:29,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope to see that addressed in this plan, or hope to see it addressed in some plan.

899
01:40:30,459 --> 01:40:32,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then just one other comment.

900
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading another report here.

901
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:39,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know if this is an error or but I mean, it is kind of true, but I think it's an error.

902
01:40:39,842 --> 01:40:47,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it says seven results in transparency, the counting and tabulation of votes were conducted with transparency and a lack of accuracy.

903
01:40:47,285 --> 01:40:48,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess that that is accurate.

904
01:40:48,925 --> 01:40:52,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it goes on to say instilling confidence in the election outcome.

905
01:40:53,607 --> 01:40:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to that doesn't make sense to me.

906
01:40:57,208 --> 01:40:58,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my those are my comments.

907
01:40:59,249 --> 01:40:59,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

908
01:41:00,572 --> 01:41:01,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your comment.

909
01:41:02,713 --> 01:41:06,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's one more hand on Zoom.

910
01:41:07,735 --> 01:41:12,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that the next meeting that the governance committee is holding is going to be on this as well.

911
01:41:12,157 --> 01:41:15,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, as we can tell, tonight's already been a long meeting.

912
01:41:15,638 --> 01:41:16,818
[SPEAKER_09]: We have lots more to talk about.

913
01:41:16,858 --> 01:41:19,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there will be more to talk about at that meeting as well.

914
01:41:19,659 --> 01:41:21,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully, we'll maybe have more documents.

915
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:27,643
[SPEAKER_09]: an idea of what that post-audit report from this presidential preference primary says.

916
01:41:28,243 --> 01:41:35,067
[SPEAKER_09]: On the recount itself, we had lawyers in the room who are top lawyers in election law.

917
01:41:35,507 --> 01:41:41,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, what we found is there are questions about absentee ballots that didn't get sent to polling stations.

918
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:44,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That changes the numbers, not the ballots themselves being counted wrong.

919
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:48,553
[SPEAKER_09]: But I saw one hand on Zoom.

920
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Eileen Lerner, do you still want to speak?

921
01:41:55,777 --> 01:42:01,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, hand raised, but I think you're... If you want to speak, please raise your hand.

922
01:42:10,276 --> 01:42:12,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

923
01:42:13,099 --> 01:42:13,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you unmute?

924
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:41,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see that mute button on your screen?

925
01:42:45,418 --> 01:42:45,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

926
01:42:45,798 --> 01:42:48,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're having technical difficulties with Zoom today.

927
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:49,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

928
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:56,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

929
01:42:57,812 --> 01:43:05,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Aileen, we're pressing the unmute button for you, but you have to press unmute as well once it pops up on your screen.

930
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:23,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

931
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:29,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, because of technical difficulties, I think we'll have to end public comment there.

932
01:43:30,842 --> 01:43:32,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a motion on the floor to adjourn.

933
01:43:33,243 --> 01:43:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second on that motion?

934
01:43:34,684 --> 01:43:36,165
