00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

19
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:26,632
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-519, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration report to the council the following, a listing of all collective bargaining agreements entered into by the school department and the city of Medford with employee organizations, including the effective dates of each agreement and the current status of any ongoing successor agreement negotiations.

20
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:27,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

21
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

22
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:49,933
[SPEAKER_17]: As we've started our budget hearings and we've discussed a lot about personal and ordinary expenses in the City of Medford's budget, one of the things that we continuously discuss is the fact that the majority of the funds that are being appropriated in the FY18 budget are for negotiated salary increases and contractual obligations.

23
00:01:50,758 --> 00:02:05,659
[SPEAKER_17]: As such, Mr. President, I'm requesting that the administration provide us with some documentation relative to the status thereof related to collective bargaining agreements between employee organizations in the city and the school department so that we have a better understanding as to where they are and what direction these negotiations are going in.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,001
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

26
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

27
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:15,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

28
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,283
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-521 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern.

29
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the implementation of an ordinance to help fix all level three natural gas leaks and hold the gas companies accountable for better surveying, reporting, planning,

30
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,828
[SPEAKER_03]: in remediation of such leaks.

31
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo-Kearns.

32
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

33
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,373
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an issue that the city of Boston took up not too long ago.

34
00:02:48,314 --> 00:03:01,000
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think after reading about it, after discussing it with our environmental, somebody from our environmental committee, I think it's something that we definitely could benefit from having it in Medford.

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:15,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we have the engineer's office potentially getting a new traffic engineer that may help with our issue that we have with the utility companies ripping up our roads and replacing them the way they should.

36
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:20,230
[SPEAKER_11]: This is also maybe a third issue that potentially could be worked on.

37
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:29,756
[SPEAKER_11]: This ordinance, which I have the city of Boston's ordinance, which I've reviewed and read, it would entail

38
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:45,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Any time the city of Medford opens up a street for any reason or any construction project, any time the street is opened, our utility companies, National Grid, Eversource, would be invited or asked to come and review that portion of the road.

39
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And there would be a hope that they would survey and figure out where there are any potential leaks.

40
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Boston estimates they have thousands of gas leaks in their community, and this is a way to reduce that number.

41
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:13,024
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a city that's obviously smaller than Boston, but we do have several, many, many gas leaks that I think need to be looked into, and we need to make that a priority.

42
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:24,273
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not good for the environment, it's not good for public health, and obviously, so many more reasons why we should be getting on top of these gas leaks.

43
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:25,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

44
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:32,014
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Falco.

45
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:32,654
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

46
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,875
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could before the roll is called.

47
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Longo-Kearns.

48
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:46,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just ask that we, I'm going to send around, I'll email all the councilors the city of Boston's ordinance so that we could maybe take the summer to review.

49
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I would just ask that a committee of the whole meeting be set up in September.

50
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,841
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully once we review it, we can implement this.

51
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,569
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many other facets to the ordinance.

52
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:16,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about nine pages long, but not only fixing the leaks, but within the ordinance, we can also mandate that anything National Grid or Eversource or any gas company provides to DPU, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, that they provide to the city of Medford.

53
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:23,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So our engineer's office, our environment office can use that and help, obviously, do what we need to do

54
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,928
[SPEAKER_11]: alleviate the many, many leaks that we have in the community.

55
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:38,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So it goes into depth and I won't go into it tonight, but I definitely would appreciate if my colleagues would read it so we can go through it and in the early fall and try to get this implemented as soon as we can.

56
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

57
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

58
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:43,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:46,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up.

60
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

61
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:59,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought up an issue probably about a month and a half ago regarding the meeting that took place on March 20th in this city, where National Grid had a community public meeting at the McGlynn Middle School.

62
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And come to find out, Mr. President, currently, according to the figures we received from National Grid, we have no grade one or grade two leaks in the community.

63
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade one is eminent threat of explosion.

64
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade two threatens health or property.

65
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:24,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And grade three, we have over 260 leaks in this community.

66
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though it's no threat to health and property, Mr. President, there still are leaks in the community.

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And these particular leaks over time naturally become larger leaks.

68
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:53,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I found out from National Grid is that they currently don't prioritize grade 3 leaks, which we have over 260, because they receive no reimbursement on grade 3 leaks.

69
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:57,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So they prioritize grade 1 and grade 2 leaks and nothing on grade 3.

70
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:05,556
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can make it part of the report also, Mr. President, and I think it was part of the report several months back.

71
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:06,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we got a response or not.

72
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall seeing a response.

73
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:28,067
[SPEAKER_02]: What we can do with the grade three leaks, should we be petitioning National Grid, even though they don't prioritize them, that they come into the community and start working on these low-level grade three leaks, which to me is alarming when you have close to 300 leaks that they're aware of in the community.

74
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And those leaks could be decades old.

75
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm concerned about that equally.

76
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my colleague for putting this on tonight.

77
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:37,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

78
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Member O'Karn.

79
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and I thank Councilor Marks for his comments.

80
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:50,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we probably would see a level of times two or three of that 260 number, and that's very concerning, and I agree.

81
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this ordinance, if we implement it, it would give it some teeth.

82
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if a gas company refuses to survey an open site,

83
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:04,691
[SPEAKER_11]: or doesn't repair a leak found at the site, the city will then have the right to deny permits for other street digging they apply for.

84
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:17,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it goes in conjunction with the committee of the whole meeting we had a week or two ago with the engineer's office, where how can we have oversight and how can we put more teeth into it when they're not doing the right thing?

85
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And this would be another avenue to make sure not only are they repairing our street properly when they dig it up, but also come to every single

86
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:30,499
[SPEAKER_11]: project that we're doing and make sure these Level 3 leaks are fixed and fixed accordingly.

87
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:48,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's a tool that the engineer's office would hopefully, especially getting a new position, maybe including this job title in that position, I think we can make a huge dent in these Level 3 leaks that maybe they're not affecting life, but they're killing trees.

88
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:49,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Gas leaks kill trees.

89
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,006
[SPEAKER_11]: It kills vegetation.

90
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:51,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all

91
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,274
[SPEAKER_11]: outlined in the Boston City of Boston's ordinance.

92
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:58,734
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's something that we need to we've got a lot done this council.

93
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:04,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is one extra thing that we can include since we're on the utility companies.

94
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:22,120
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one extra thing that we can use to not only for the council to have some teeth because we're allowing for certain permits, but the DPW and the engineer's office, it definitely will allow them to, you know, if they if we can get on top of it, we can make a huge dent in the level three leaks as Boston's doing.

95
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And

96
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:32,275
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue with Boston and other cities and towns implementing this is that National Grid and Eversource are going to focus more on the communities that have these ordinances in place.

97
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:40,923
[SPEAKER_11]: So come time when we're one of the only ones that don't have it, we'll be down on the totem pole of when they're going to fix the leaks we do have.

98
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:50,231
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is instrumental in staying on top of it and staying in the 2017 plus time frame of what needs to be done

99
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:55,361
[SPEAKER_11]: to cure the problem, so hopefully we can get this done in the fall and move forward.

100
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:56,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

101
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:57,381

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,701
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-522 offered by Councilor Lango-Kern.

123
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:47,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the office of the city solicitor report back to the Memphis City Council with regards to how many claims have been received in 2016 and 17 as it relates to damage to persons and or property due to potholes, sunken manholes, grates, and the like.

124
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lango-Kern.

125
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:52,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

126
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:52,827
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could just...

127
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:58,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking for 2016, 2017.

128
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:04,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to see the difference in claims from our law department.

129
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:14,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that we did meet with Solicitor Rumley yesterday, and he did give us some insight or numbers off the top of his head with regards to how many claims have been put in.

130
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was great that he was on top of it.

131
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:26,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was about 30 claims from pothole and street defects and nine personal injury claims from potholes, two of which

132
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:33,352
[SPEAKER_11]: in addition to were personal injuries from people that were on bicycles that obviously went through a pothole and got injured.

133
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:42,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to know that considering how hard our DPW is working with regards to how many potholes we do have out there.

134
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:45,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we had a bad winter, but they're everywhere.

135
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,498
[SPEAKER_11]: They're getting filled, but there are a number more.

136
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:50,999
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we discussed with the DPW contracting out.

137
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to really see within this budget

138
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:06,127
[SPEAKER_11]: how it evens out claims versus filling versus getting a contractor so that we can make an educated decision come next week or the week after when we have to make recommendations and approve or disprove the budget.

139
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,649
[SPEAKER_11]: So I move approval, ask for a roll call vote.

140
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:09,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

141
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,631
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Council Member Kern, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

142
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested.

143
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:21,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRusso?

144
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:21,337
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

145
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

146
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:23,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

147
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Layton.

148
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:25,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

149
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:26,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kern.

150
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:27,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

151
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Monson.

152
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:29,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

153
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Stafanowicz.

154
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

155
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:31,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello.

156
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

157
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

158
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:48,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Falcone to take a paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

159
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:48,827
17-525.

160
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:53,384
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-525.

161
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:58,366
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-525 offered by Councilor Falco.

162
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:05,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas continuous speeding and careless driving poses a significant problem for the residents of Fern Road.

163
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford DPW place a temporary speed bump on the lower end of Fern Road and that the Medford Police Department increase patrols in the area in the interest of public safety.

164
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:19,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

165
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:20,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

166
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:27,653
[SPEAKER_01]: had the opportunity last week to attend the monthly community police meeting down at the Medford Police Station.

167
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, they had a nice crowd, probably about 25, 30 people.

168
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:36,937
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was about 10 people from Fern Road that attended.

169
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:42,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had major issues on that road with regard to traffic and speeding.

170
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of Fern Road is the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Vista Ave and the other side of Fern Road.

171
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:50,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a four-way

172
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a location for a bus stop.

173
00:13:54,531 --> 00:14:04,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And the traffic in that area in the morning and in the evening is really, really bad, with people flying through the stop sign and then progressing down towards the Felsway.

174
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And the speeding is really out of control.

175
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:10,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And the residents that were there that night expressed that.

176
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to ask for increased patrols on that street.

177
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:19,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could add a temporary speed bump to that street as well.

178
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,068
[SPEAKER_01]: It came up that night.

179
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Sacco said, you know, he had no problems with it.

180
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,910
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in favor of it.

181
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I wrote this resolution, I've also talked to Brian Kearns as well.

182
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Sergeant Hartnett was going up to look at the situation today.

183
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that's a little bit of an update.

184
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:43,117
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are actually a couple of residents here that would like to speak on this issue.

185
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:44,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you

186
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

187
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

188
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:53,723
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Janice Ronzio.

189
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 66 Fern Road.

190
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And my name is Judy Seifert, and I live at 60 Fern Road.

191
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:00,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

192
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,551
[SPEAKER_10]: We're neighbors.

193
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,093
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, thank you for allowing us to speak.

194
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:10,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'd love to thank Councillor Falco for all his help.

195
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,478
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been right there with us, trying to assist us.

196
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,360
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been an ongoing problem for years.

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,982
[SPEAKER_12]: My children are now in their 30s.

198
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:25,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they were little toddlers, I had signs put up on the street, you know, slow signs.

199
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was 37 years ago.

200
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is something that's not happened overnight, but it's been going on for a long time.

201
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:34,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's at the point now where it's just really out of control.

202
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,694
[SPEAKER_12]: They're blowing through the four-way stop sign.

203
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:40,135
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a bus stop, as Councilor Falco said.

204
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:47,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if I had kids going to get on the bus, I wouldn't want them being up there by themselves.

205
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,418
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how bad it is up there.

206
00:15:50,121 --> 00:16:06,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And coming down Fern Road, what they're doing is the traffic and to avoid Fulton Street in the morning because of the light that backs up all the way up Fulton, they're coming down Fern Road and then coming out onto the Felsway and they're trying to get out on the Felsway and that's backed up.

207
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:17,124
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had gone to a couple of police meetings and expressed to the chief that we would like something done

208
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:26,071
[SPEAKER_12]: And Thursday, the day after the police meeting, there was a police officer up at the corner and he was pulling cars over for blowing the stop sign.

209
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:31,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also stopped somebody near mine and Judy's house that was speeding down the street.

210
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:38,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're very appreciative that we're able to get something done at this point.

211
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:41,257
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also are hoping that

212
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,359
[SPEAKER_12]: the police could make some more presence.

213
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we know that they can't be there all the time.

214
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,141
[SPEAKER_12]: We understand that.

215
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:48,682
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's problems everywhere.

216
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:49,222
[SPEAKER_12]: We get that.

217
00:16:49,983 --> 00:17:06,735
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we could just for the next couple of weeks until school gets out at least, um, have a police presence in the morning, um, when it's busy, people going to work, going to school and then, you know, later afternoon, like supper time when people are coming home from work, um, to just

218
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:20,097
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe be there a couple of times a week for the next few weeks just to show their presence so that people in the neighborhood or whoever's traveling will understand that something is being done to resolve this.

219
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:22,498
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do appreciate all the help that we're getting.

220
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco, thank you very much.

221
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,140
[SPEAKER_12]: And my neighbors, we have a great neighborhood.

222
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And a couple of years ago, we actually had a problem with a car coming up the street.

223
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,002
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a young kid texting.

224
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,994
[SPEAKER_12]: flying up the street and going up the hill.

225
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Fern Road's a pretty steep hill.

226
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:44,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was going at a pretty good speed and he knocked a tree over on the sidewalk.

227
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:47,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So luckily there was nobody there on the sidewalk at the time.

228
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,962
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's, this is just an, just an idea of what goes on daily on that street.

229
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:58,325
[SPEAKER_12]: People think Fern Road is like, like a fantasy world that nothing happens up there, but it's, it's really pretty bad.

230
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:04,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're, you know, we're going to do what we can do to help alleviate the problem too if we have to put

231
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:08,923
[SPEAKER_12]: these signs up, you know, the signs that say drive as if your children lived here.

232
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:14,964
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're willing to buy those and put them on our lawns, whatever we have to do to help.

233
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,045
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do appreciate all the help that we're getting here.

234
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:17,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

235
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:18,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

236
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:28,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also aware that when that new traffic engineer is hired, we'd certainly like that person to take a look because this is like, for now, this would really make a big difference.

237
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:32,868
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think there's probably ways that we could solve this problem more.

238
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:38,087
[SPEAKER_10]: permanently, because I don't know if the speed bumps are temporary or not.

239
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:38,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they are.

240
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a temporary speed bump that they pull up in the winter because of the plows, they can't keep it down year round.

241
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:54,855
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely, I think, something that would help in this situation.

242
00:18:55,375 --> 00:19:01,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I live right around the corner and I took a walk down the street and met with the residents on Saturday.

243
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:04,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting, there's a pothole in the street.

244
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:08,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them don't fill the pothole because it slows down the traffic.

245
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if it gets any bigger.

246
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Put a couple of cones around just to slow some people down.

247
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really shouldn't be the solution.

248
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:18,466
[SPEAKER_01]: We should make sure that we fill the pothole and slow down traffic.

249
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:29,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping that putting in that temporary speed bump would help slow down the traffic, help drivers realize that, you know what, this is a busy neighborhood.

250
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,634
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people, a lot of cars.

251
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,516
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a school bus stop close by.

252
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:33,717
[SPEAKER_01]: People have to drive safely.

253
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:39,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I basically would ask a move for approval at this point.

254
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:40,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

255
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your support.

256
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:42,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

257
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

258
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:43,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

259
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

260
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:45,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

261
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank fellow Councilman John Falco for bringing that up.

262
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:59,256
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can amend that, if we can maybe add the digital speed monitor, maybe to slow people down.

263
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:00,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I know that

264
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:15,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we've worked both Councilor Falco and Councilor Kern have been working with Sergeant Hartnett on the traffic issues as that's a major cut through, especially with the future work that's being done up there.

265
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:24,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that might be something we need to rekindle for another subcommittee meeting with the hospital site and then bring Officer Hartnett.

266
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:31,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they did a report, a traffic study that counted the cars that went through that area and it was pretty

267
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:46,053
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty astronomical, so I think if we could put that, the machine there, if we can ask the chief to put that up there so people can see the speed limit and maybe that could deter some of the speeding.

268
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,034
[SPEAKER_13]: But thank you again for this resolution.

269
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:49,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

270
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:51,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

271
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

272
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:56,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank Councilor Felco also.

273
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:00,417
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems to be a recurring theme in the community.

274
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:06,960
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're hearing about pedestrian safety, cars speeding throughout our neighborhood and on our neighborhood streets.

275
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:18,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just tell you firsthand, Mr. President, that when we implemented the pilot program for raised crosswalks, I personally like raised crosswalks better than a speed bump.

276
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:26,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Speed bumps are very temporary in nature, and I don't think they accomplish the same goal as a raised crosswalk.

277
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:35,678
[SPEAKER_02]: When we did the pilot program, Mr. President, back some four years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time said we were going to do three raised crosswalks.

278
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:37,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was back some four years ago.

279
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only implemented one on Winthrop Street.

280
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:51,169
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could tell you firsthand that a raised crosswalk in that particular neighborhood and in many other neighborhoods would work wonders on traffic calming, slowing down traffic

281
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular areas.

282
00:21:52,930 --> 00:22:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that coupled with widening sidewalks, putting up blinking lights, increasing signage in the community, that definitely has an impact also.

283
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:06,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, you know, we can't sit back and talk about complete streets.

284
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard complete streets over and over again.

285
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I read articles in the paper.

286
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:10,902
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

287
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making some initiatives on some of the major roads.

288
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:22,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And with $500,000, we're hitting up several neighborhoods and providing some traffic calming initiatives.

289
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:25,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have to, we can't ignore the neighborhoods.

290
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,109
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've been on the council a number of years.

291
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:35,576
[SPEAKER_02]: The concerns I hear over and over again, a lot of them are on main roads, but much, much more, Mr. President, are in the neighborhoods.

292
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm hearing over and over again.

293
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not rocket science.

294
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,824
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ways of calming traffic down.

295
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:48,647
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very simple ways, there's very cost effective ways of doing it.

296
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:56,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's merely just, I know the city of Cambridge does it, they paint what looks like a 3D mural in the street.

297
00:22:56,832 --> 00:23:04,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a car approaches, it looks like there's something impeding them from going forward because of this 3D image that's in the road.

298
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:10,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very unique way of having at least people that are driving to be alert when they come up to an area.

299
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not expensive to do, Mr. President.

300
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:21,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in my opinion, we fall short of the mark in this community when it comes to pedestrian safety.

301
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:25,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, you know,

302
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,760
[SPEAKER_02]: There's money out there.

303
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over $8 million in free cash to move some of these initiatives forward in the neighborhoods.

304
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:48,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll benefit not only the community in general, Mr. President, it'll send a message out to the people driving on our streets, many of which are just cutting through, Mr. President, that we're not going to tolerate this any longer.

305
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sends a message out, Mr. President, when you take back your roads.

306
00:23:53,286 --> 00:24:02,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Several months back, this council voted to reduce the speed limit from 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour on all non-posted roads.

307
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:11,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We have yet to see, that was several months back, one sign be erected that says the new speed limit of 25 miles an hour on our streets.

308
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:20,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we've done a pork job in communicating what was a vote of this council and eventually passed by the Traffic Commission.

309
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:29,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, Mr. President, something that would send a message to people that are coming through our community that you have to reduce speed when you come onto Meffitt streets.

310
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate Councilor Felco for bringing this up tonight, Mr. President.

311
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hope more is done with this new traffic engineer that's going to be approved in the budget to really address neighborhood concerns of improvement of public safety and pedestrian safety in our community.

312
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

313
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

314
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

315
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carvalho.

316
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:02,099
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward and I wanted to second the resolve and just

317
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,567
[SPEAKER_11]: highlight a few points.

318
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I was at the Traffic Commission meeting with you, President Carviello, today.

319
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:10,810
[SPEAKER_11]: There was speeding on Forest Street was on the agenda.

320
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,030
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was... I wasn't aware of that.

321
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was there for the South Street speeding issue.

322
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:19,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is happening all over our community and we just have to keep on top of it.

323
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:24,034
[SPEAKER_11]: And street by street, we need to... And hopefully the traffic engineer will do that.

324
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:30,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Street by street, problem area by problem area, we need to figure out ways to slow down the traffic.

325
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:34,542
[SPEAKER_11]: widening sidewalks is going on up near the Brooks School.

326
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:37,502
[SPEAKER_11]: It's simple signage that can be put up.

327
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:43,084
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do this throughout our community, and this obviously is a problem spot.

328
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,524
[SPEAKER_11]: So I definitely am happy that we're going to try to move forward on this.

329
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:52,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And what is a positive note is that Sergeant Hartnett and the traffic division are working hard.

330
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:58,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I was driving down South Street yesterday, and I see Sergeant Hartnett out with a little machine.

331
00:25:59,312 --> 00:26:01,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And I pulled over and I said, what are you doing?

332
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:07,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we have new laser guns that 10 officers have been trained in recently.

333
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:09,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he said last week.

334
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:11,297
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought that was very positive.

335
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:15,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said the radar guns that they purchased are coming in within the next several weeks.

336
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:25,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Also 200 signs, we were in the traffic meeting today requesting that the 25 miles an hour signs be posted.

337
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:27,102
[SPEAKER_11]: and changed out.

338
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,623
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I understand, they ordered 200.

339
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:35,528
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to do, hopefully, our main thoroughfares first and any points entering the city.

340
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,269
[SPEAKER_11]: But hopefully more are ordered.

341
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:39,771
[SPEAKER_11]: We can switch out those signs sooner than later.

342
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:48,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And Councilor Scarpelli brought it up, too, that the monitor sign, those signs we've ordered, too, and those are coming in very soon.

343
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:54,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And those need to be... I said it before, we need a list of everywhere that people are complaining about and put it there.

344
00:26:55,701 --> 00:27:00,324
[SPEAKER_11]: those two need to be utilized all the time so that we can slow down the traffic.

345
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:02,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So I second the resolve.

346
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:10,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to note some positive points because we have been involved in approving them and the spending of the money to approve them.

347
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:19,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad we have a staff in the traffic division that we are now seeing out and utilizing these tools to hopefully make our streets safer.

348
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:20,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Marks.

350
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:27,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I could amend the paper, if Councilor Falco doesn't mind, just popped in my head.

351
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:30,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Doonan Street is a four-way stop.

352
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:40,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting complaints from neighbors that no one is actually adhering to the four-way stop at all on Doonan, and people just going by without coming to a stop at all.

353
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:46,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we could have Sergeant Hartnett in the Traffic Division go out and take a look at that particular area, Mr. President, that'd be helpful.

354
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

355
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, there's a four-way stop.

356
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:57,157
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern, as amended by Councilor Mox.

357
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:58,657
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

358
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

359
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:01,739
[SPEAKER_03]: In?

360
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Amended by Councilor Scappelli.

361
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,861
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

362
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:10,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

363
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,243
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-523, offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

364
00:28:13,384 --> 00:28:19,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send a written communication to Massport requesting that they- Are we still under suspension?

365
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:20,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we still under suspension?

366
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,377
[SPEAKER_03]: We just went out of order, that's all.

367
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: We just went out of order.

368
00:28:25,258 --> 00:28:29,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I just, can I add something to the suspension while we're talking?

369
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,960
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're under suspension, Vice President Marks.

370
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr., this is an important item.

371
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason why I wanted to bring it up.

372
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Several weeks back, through this council, we requested that the city solicitor talk to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and also Ed Finn regarding a proposed wireless communication ordinance that was proposed back in 2011.

373
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: before this Memphis City Council, and we got a response in our packet, I think everyone has a copy tonight, of the ordinance that was drafted back in 2011.

374
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:11,955
[SPEAKER_02]: This ordinance also includes language that was inserted by National Grid at the time to amend our ordinance, Mr. President, to allow

375
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,628
[SPEAKER_02]: wireless communication on the polls.

376
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:21,799
[SPEAKER_02]: But this ordinance, Mr. President, is directly related to what many people may have saw on the local news just recently.

377
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:27,288
[SPEAKER_02]: The MBTA right now is trying to generate some additional revenue.

378
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:37,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're providing a service to their commuter rail customers that they'll be able to have internet access on the train for a nominal fee, I guess.

379
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to provide that service, they need to erect cell phone towers throughout many communities that the commuter rail goes through.

380
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And I happened to catch it on Channel 5, and this council voted on it.

381
00:29:54,432 --> 00:30:03,095
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple months even prior to it coming up, but most of the communities where the commuter rail goes through, they're going to be erecting cell phone towers.

382
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:12,258
[SPEAKER_02]: In the city of Method, there's already two requests for cell phone towers, one on Tyler Ave and one on Charnwood Road, which

383
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,619
[SPEAKER_02]: directly within neighborhoods, Mr. President.

384
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:28,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ordinance that was offered back in 2011 would prohibit cell phone towers from being erected in any area except for industrial and commercial zones.

385
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:37,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, all you need is a building permit and an electrical permit, and you could erect a 74-foot cell tower in your backyard.

386
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as easy as that.

387
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:56,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ordinance, Mr. President, which I think we have to meet pretty immediately on, I'd ask that it go to the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinance, or unless the council sees fit to have a committee of the whole on it, I would venture to say this language is ready to go.

388
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: This language, in my opinion, has been vetted out thoroughly.

389
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it does deserve to be vetted out more by this council.

390
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:24,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point, Mr. President, I would ask through a vote of this council that this particular correspondence dated June 8th from the city solicitor regarding wireless communication and facility ordinance be sent to either the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee or Committee of the Whole, Mr. President, for further discussion and quick action.

391
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:26,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is a very important issue.

392
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:29,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I would suggest we do a Council of the Whole quickly.

393
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take your recommendation, Mr. President.

394
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:32,065
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

395
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the best we can.

396
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,816
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if we can get it done before the summer session.

397
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:36,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we take a vote on that, Mr. President?

398
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,519
[SPEAKER_02]: This be sent because it's a paper that... Yes, we can.

399
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councillor... Roll call vote, Mr. President.

400
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:44,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Knight.

401
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:48,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, the committee has decided that they want to go to the Committee of the Whole.

402
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:48,629
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

403
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:58,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to inform the delegation that we had some preliminary discussions this evening and early last week about setting up a summer schedule for zoning and ordinance to address some of the papers that are in committee.

404
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:01,742
[SPEAKER_17]: However, if the council feels as though we should go to a committee of the whole first, that's fine with me.

405
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:05,365
[SPEAKER_03]: When time is of the essence on this, maybe we say we'll get this done quicker.

406
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:06,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the body wants to do.

407
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:07,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

408
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Nye.

409
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote has been requested.

410
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:24,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Del Marusso.

411
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:27,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

412
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:28,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

413
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:29,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Night?

414
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:29,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

415
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:30,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Locke-Kern?

416
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

417
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:32,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Montz?

418
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:33,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

419
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

420
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:34,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

421
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Cavillo?

422
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:36,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

423
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

424
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:45,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to revert back to regular order.

425
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,729
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, five, two, three, offered by Councilor Locke-Kern.

426
00:32:48,219 --> 00:33:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send a written communication to Massport requesting that they provide the city of Medford with a noise monitor to be placed above the Andrews School as well as the Medford Heights.

427
00:33:00,964 --> 00:33:15,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the letter be sent from the city, Memphis City Council to all of our state delegation requesting that they contact Massport and request that additional noise monitors within the community.

428
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lango-Kern.

429
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:21,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

430
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just first like to amend this and also request that there be a noise monitor in South Medford.

431
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the last several weeks, South Medford has picked up in flights.

432
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:41,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually went down there last night, and again, every minute, especially over the Columbus Park area and the entire South Medford, I guess, is getting hit pretty bad.

433
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:46,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully, we will see a decrease to a level in a couple of weeks when the two

434
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:52,029
[SPEAKER_11]: runways that are under maintenance are back up and running, but we still have the problem with the 33L.

435
00:33:52,689 --> 00:34:02,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the mayor's office has sent a request to Massport that we be provided another noise monitoring device above the Andrews School.

436
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:15,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the council, if we could get a vote tonight and send a letter from the entire council to Massport and to our state delegation requesting that they do whatever they can to obviously

437
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:17,394
[SPEAKER_11]: alleviate the noise.

438
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:22,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly, what will go with that is the noise monitoring systems.

439
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:28,299
[SPEAKER_11]: One over the Andrews, one over the Heights, and one over South Medford should cover the problem areas.

440
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Wellington's getting hit good, but the Andrews should cover that.

441
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I think any noise monitoring devices that we can get in Medford are going to be beneficial because they're going to track the levels.

442
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:46,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And once the levels are what obviously residents are reporting, sometimes they're flying the way they should, but other times

443
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:51,409
[SPEAKER_11]: If it comes over directly above your home, you feel like the plane is landing on your house.

444
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,410
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to figure out how often that is happening, because it shouldn't be.

445
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:02,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will hopefully help us in getting some relief with regards to what can be done.

446
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:05,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I know MIT is on their second portion of the study.

447
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:12,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to figure out what can be done to help Medford, whether that be flying higher, taking different routes.

448
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:16,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Something needs to be done to help Medford, even after the

449
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:19,707
[SPEAKER_11]: the end of June date we're getting.

450
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:40,279
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just like to back the mayor up on the Andrew School Monitor, request two additional ones, and make sure that the city council, as amended, sends a letter requesting this to Massport and also to our entire state delegation to push and help Medford with this problem that so many are stricken by.

451
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:41,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

452
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Neistat.

453
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

454
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:51,400
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly think that noise monitors will help us in our plight against Massport and the airplane noise that we have in our community.

455
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:59,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have a question, maybe we can put this in as a B paper, as to how the location of the Andrews School was selected.

456
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:01,949
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we've had a number of discussions about

457
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,971
[SPEAKER_17]: locations of noise monitors, where we want to put them, so on and so forth.

458
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:24,614
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're going to be requesting that a delegation expend funds, and we're going to be requesting the placement of additional noise monitors, I guess my question is, do we want to take a longer how to look at it and study whether or not we can get more bank for our buck with the placement of three towers in different locations that may cover the entire city?

459
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:26,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's my understanding we have one tower in the community now.

460
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:31,155
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had four towers in the community, we'd be able to cover the whole city of Medford.

461
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:34,677
[SPEAKER_17]: How was this location selected, I guess, would be my first question, Mr. President.

462
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:36,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

463
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Council Member Kern.

464
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, thank you, President Carviello.

465
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:59,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a great question, and I think the reason why the mayor chose the Andrews Middle School is because, and I attended with a number of my colleagues, I can't remember exactly who was there, but Luke Presner from CAC Board, and Peter Hook, yes.

466
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:05,911
[SPEAKER_11]: They gave us a great outline of what's going on and what's taking place.

467
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:16,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And the new GPS system that they've been using since, oh, for a few years now, it tracks all planes out of 33L that are going in this location.

468
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:19,560
[SPEAKER_11]: They come over the Andrews and then they disperse.

469
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:28,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Andrews was picked because every single plane that flies out of Logan that is coming through Medford is going over the Andrews school and then to

470
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:32,165
[SPEAKER_11]: going in different directions.

471
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:35,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So some are going over South Medford, some are going over the Heights.

472
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:43,373
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that obviously is the number one place that it needs to go, which is why obviously the mayor's requesting that.

473
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:58,244
[SPEAKER_11]: But where the complaints are coming from the Heights and South Medford just as much, maybe not as... I mean, I'm getting complaints from everywhere, but South Medford, North Medford and the Heights are the three locations where I'm seeing all the complaints.

474
00:37:58,304 --> 00:37:59,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if we can request

475
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:01,782
[SPEAKER_11]: as many as possible.

476
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:08,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, three, I think, would cover where the complaints are coming from and where I've seen the problem.

477
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:09,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be helpful.

478
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:10,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

479
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Layton.

480
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:26,901
[SPEAKER_17]: So the reason that the Andrews Middle School would be the selected location is because, based upon the information that our Massport CLC representative has told us, is that 100% of the aircrafts that fly out of Logan on that runway will go over that beacon?

481
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:27,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

482
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:29,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So if 100% of the?

483
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, from their studies, they're saying that they go to the Andes, and then they split.

484
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,919
[SPEAKER_17]: So 100% of the planes are going to fly over there.

485
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,200
[SPEAKER_17]: A good amount of them, yes.

486
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

487
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:48,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank Councilor Longo-Kern for bringing this resolution forward.

489
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:52,564
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue that I get calls about all the time.

490
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:56,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it doesn't matter really what part of the city you live in.

491
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:58,296
[SPEAKER_01]: it impacts everyone.

492
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunate.

493
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:04,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at that meeting about a month ago that they had right here at City Hall, and the place was packed.

494
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really does impact the quality of life.

495
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:10,345
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be doing everything we can to combat this.

496
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:20,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've actually been, you know, communicating to people in the community to, you know, call the Massport line and to, you know, log complaints online.

497
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:21,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.

498
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:26,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that they did mention that night was all of the planes, basically, when they take off, they come

499
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:29,207
[SPEAKER_01]: basically right down Riverside Ave, right over the Andrews.

500
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:32,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does sound like probably a good place to have the beacon.

501
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:50,926
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the thing to really keep in mind here is that, you know, that night at the meeting, what they mentioned is this problem is really only going to get worse because of the reconfiguration of, I think it was Terminal E, and there's going to be over the next, I think, five years, there's going to be more carriers leaving at off-peak times.

502
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So this problem, I know people say, well, once they repair that runway,

503
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:57,233
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's going to get better.

504
00:39:57,753 --> 00:40:03,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll get better for the short term, but for the long term, this is a problem that's going to impact us for a very long time.

505
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:06,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to make sure that we stay on top of this.

506
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

507
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:16,937
[SPEAKER_01]: And people really need to continue to make sure that they call the Massport noise line and to log their complaints online as well.

508
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:18,597
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have an impact.

509
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:23,678
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in Milton, the city of Milton, that it had an impact.

510
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:24,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have

511
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,399
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands of more complaints than we do.

512
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:35,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So people really need to get out, voice their opinion, and let Massport know that this is a problem, and it does impact the quality of life.

513
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd just like to thank you for bringing this forward, and I second the motion.

514
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:39,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

515
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:40,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

516
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:41,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

517
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:41,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Call 617-561-3333.

518
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:42,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

519
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:44,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

520
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:45,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

521
00:40:54,537 --> 00:41:00,619
[SPEAKER_02]: This council, I think it was back a couple months ago, took a vote to ask that another monitor be added to the city.

522
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we gave a location, but at the time we asked.

523
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: The key to this issue, Mr. President, we could talk all we want until we get our congressional delegation to stand up.

524
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:14,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just mentioned by Councilor Felco in Milton.

525
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Milton didn't do it on their own.

526
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:29,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Congressman Lynch that stood up, and the federal government, Mr. President, he got the FFA to have a meeting, FAA to have a meeting, Mr. President, and they acted upon Congressman Lynch.

527
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to say it, Mr. President, but that hasn't happened in this community yet.

528
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen that level, Mr. President, of congressional delegation intervening on behalf of the city.

529
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, and I don't want to rehash old news,

530
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:54,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great, we have two great representatives on that community advisory committee now to Logan Airport.

531
00:41:54,733 --> 00:42:03,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And during those meetings, these local cities and towns all have a representative that sits so they can be at the table and they can add input.

532
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: when Logan Airport and the FAA are making decisions.

533
00:42:08,112 --> 00:42:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And for over five years, Mr. President, and this council brought it up over and over again, for over five years, Meffitt's representative on that committee was a no-show.

534
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Meffitt was not representative.

535
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and I pulled all the minute meetings

536
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:28,032
[SPEAKER_02]: and it showed you where people and what communities were attending those meetings.

537
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:34,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And Meffitt was a no-show for years, Mr. President, while a lot of this discussion and dialogue was happening.

538
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:46,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great now that the mayor's on board, it's great we have two excellent community advisory members, but for years we were not at the table and this city was not representative.

539
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a problem, Mr. President.

540
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:54,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we're able to get around that now with our congressional delegation.

541
00:42:55,162 --> 00:43:08,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know with the renewed interest now in the Community Advisory Board and those particular two gentlemen who are very knowledgeable on air traffic and other issues, I believe we will be represented now.

542
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:13,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think part of the problem was we were a no-show, Mr. President.

543
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,764
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councillor Longo-Kern.

544
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:21,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

545
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:22,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

546
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

547
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:25,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 281 Park Street.

548
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:31,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very close to the Roberts Elementary School, which is also a heavy flyover area.

549
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a lot of loud traffic.

550
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:37,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to echo Councilor Falco that we definitely need to keep up the complaints.

551
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:39,359
[SPEAKER_07]: They do factor those in.

552
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:45,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And because we were absent for so long, other towns mitigation is our increased suffering.

553
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:48,643
[SPEAKER_07]: The runway is actually not slated to be completed.

554
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:50,465
[SPEAKER_07]: completely finished until November.

555
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:53,208
[SPEAKER_07]: They expect it to open partially.

556
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:59,054
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I read on their website as well as when I spoke to someone on the phone there.

557
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:03,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So this noise isn't going to go away when the runway opens anyway.

558
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: The altitude is not going to increase when the runway opens.

559
00:44:07,423 --> 00:44:09,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm clocking planes between

560
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:15,538
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,000 and 1,500 feet coming over my house as late as 3 in the morning.

561
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:17,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very loud.

562
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:18,058
[SPEAKER_07]: My house is shaking.

563
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:21,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't put anything on the edge of a shelf or you're going to find it on the floor.

564
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a very serious issue for us.

565
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that we know exactly where the loudest parts are and the noise monitors are placed there.

566
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:32,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they do give mitigation to the city,

567
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:35,685
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll do it on a very narrow corridor.

568
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:38,667
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll do it on very specific streets and addresses.

569
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:47,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So if a neighborhood that is greatly impacted doesn't have a noise monitor, they may lose out on mitigation if there's not a monitor close enough to them.

570
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a really important factor for us.

571
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:56,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I did price out triple pane windows, which will reduce the noise, and they will run $8,000 to $16,000, and that's just to add a third pane.

572
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:13,901
[SPEAKER_07]: to your existing windows because I did have all of my windows double pane replaced three years ago and I'm told that that is not enough by Massport to reduce the sound and that we would also have to get special soundproofing caulking so it could run up to $40,000 to make your house

573
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:21,429
[SPEAKER_07]: 75% quieter, and running noise machines all night.

574
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:28,717
[SPEAKER_07]: My daughter's neurologist, my nine-year-old daughter, has said it's not good for your brain to not have time to rest at night.

575
00:45:28,777 --> 00:45:31,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a serious issue that I hope will be

576
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,632
[SPEAKER_07]: greatly considered and we can get some action.

577
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:45,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I did meet Pat Jalen on Salem Street a couple of weeks ago and we stood and watched the planes flying across Salem Street for about 10 minutes and it was insane.

578
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:47,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

579
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:47,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

580
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:53,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, if I could amend the paper that we also contact Congresswoman Clock.

581
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:57,444
[SPEAKER_03]: She was at the first meeting with the FAA.

582
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,006
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could have her office be in contact also.

583
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

584
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street, 02155.

585
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:15,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hate to repeat myself from past meetings on this issue.

586
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:28,438
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the time to have spoke up and be at the table would have been pre, before 2007 when they built this runway, 330, whatever it's called.

587
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,901
[SPEAKER_14]: But even then, we didn't have the power of Tip O'Neill

588
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:42,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if we're going to be able to tell Massport and the FDA, whatever it's called, what to do.

589
00:46:43,172 --> 00:47:02,140
[SPEAKER_14]: However, since we are so blessed to have the Atlantic Ocean next to Boston, I would hope at least after a certain time, let's say 8, 9, 10 p.m., seems like 11 o'clock news, they start coming hot and heavy, 11.30,

590
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:06,659
[SPEAKER_14]: As the lady behind me said, three in the morning.

591
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't know, cause I'm dead asleep.

592
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:29,031
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe they could be businesslike and it would work out that after 9 PM or 10, 11 at the latest, hopefully the children will stay asleep, take off over the Atlantic ocean.

593
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:30,812
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I have to say.

594
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:36,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

595
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:37,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

596
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:40,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, Medford.

597
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I've inquired a few times in a few different places.

598
00:47:46,142 --> 00:47:46,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't hear me.

599
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:47,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

600
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:50,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've inquired in a few different places, and I've looked online.

601
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:59,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is perplexing to me that any other business has to comply with our zoning ordinance for noise.

602
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:02,434
[SPEAKER_08]: 11 o'clock to 7 o'clock, you can't make a peep.

603
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't run a construction site before 7 AM.

604
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:07,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do anything.

605
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:13,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even play my radio outside after 11 without being visited if a neighbor decides that that's not acceptable.

606
00:48:14,507 --> 00:48:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So why then are we being exposed to this type of noise overnight?

607
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:23,832
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really detrimental to our health.

608
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:34,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wonder if perhaps you could bring to bear your resources to investigate if perhaps we can do something to curtail the noise because

609
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:44,400
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is the worst at night when people are trying to sleep, especially that Cafe 331 that comes over at 2.30 in the morning.

610
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:46,102
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an Airbus 380.

611
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:50,788
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the largest plane there is, and it's coming over in the dead of the night on a regular basis.

612
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It's terrible.

613
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:54,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe you can investigate.

614
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,041
[SPEAKER_08]: noise ordinance, and if there's some way it can protect us in some manner.

615
00:48:59,061 --> 00:48:59,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

616
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Neistat.

617
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:10,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe the implementation of GPS trackers is part of the federal government's edict to Massport to transition from a beacon system to a GPS system.

618
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:19,670
[SPEAKER_17]: And as part of that, it's a directive of the federal government, which would preclude the city of Medford from going up the chain and suing the state government or the federal government due to federal preemption.

619
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

620
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:24,752
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion.

621
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:35,733
[SPEAKER_03]: By Councilor Langel-Kern, as amended by Councilor Knight, and as amended by President Caravaglia, seconded by Councilor Falco.

622
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:38,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote has been requested.

623
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRusso?

624
00:49:44,535 --> 00:49:44,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

625
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:46,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

626
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:46,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

627
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:47,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

628
00:49:47,796 --> 00:49:48,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

629
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:49,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Langel-Kern?

630
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:49,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

631
00:49:50,256 --> 00:49:51,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks?

632
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:51,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

633
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Stappelli?

634
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

635
00:49:53,592 --> 00:49:54,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Further caviar?

636
00:49:54,472 --> 00:49:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

637
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:58,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

638
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:04,215
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-524, offered by Vice President Marks and Councilor Langel-Kern.

639
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:19,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration provide the council with a plan for next year and a plan moving forward for the use of the former Hegner Center site located at Maple Park, which was recently acquired back by the city of Medford.

640
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President, Councilor Langel-Kern.

641
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:25,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll yield to my senior member.

642
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:29,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only have you been on top of this issue, but, well, senior in age.

643
00:50:30,892 --> 00:50:33,275
[SPEAKER_02]: No, late to service, late to service.

644
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:36,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Box.

645
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

646
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:54,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I offered a resolution, I think it was back three months ago, asking the city administration if we could just get an update on the property formerly known as the Hegner Center on Maple Park Ave.

647
00:50:55,493 --> 00:51:07,418
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, that particular property was deeded over to the Hegner Center back some many years ago with the express purpose of using it for persons with disability.

648
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that building was no longer being used for that,

649
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:18,547
[SPEAKER_02]: express purpose, it should revert back to the city according to the documents that were signed.

650
00:51:20,429 --> 00:51:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hegner Center was taken over by Bridgewell.

651
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:33,482
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide very similar services, and Bridgewell back, I think it was a year, year and a half ago, decided that they were gonna sell the building.

652
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:45,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a building they never owned, never paid a dollar for, and I believe it was up on the market for some $560,000 or right around that, Mr. President.

653
00:51:46,256 --> 00:52:03,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this council that took a vote asking the city solicitor to step in on behalf of the city, and after his due diligence, indeed, that building was vacant for some time, Mr. President, and it wasn't being used for

654
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:14,427
[SPEAKER_02]: its intended purpose of aiding and helping people with disabilities, and the city solicitor was able to negotiate the building back to the city of Meffitt.

655
00:52:14,747 --> 00:52:21,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a building, Mr. President, in my opinion, could be repurposed for a number of uses.

656
00:52:21,735 --> 00:52:23,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the time this council voted,

657
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:32,546
[SPEAKER_02]: to potentially put the Meffitt Arts Center in there or maybe the Meffitt Arts Council and create an art center in that particular area.

658
00:52:33,107 --> 00:52:41,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Residents across the street in the condos are very concerned because they see activity going on in the building and they're not quite sure what's happening.

659
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think both myself and Councilor Longo-Kern, and she'll speak for herself, but put this on tonight, Mr. President,

660
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:54,350
[SPEAKER_02]: so we can get a direction on where we're gonna go with the building the longer it sits vacant.

661
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know what happens to vacant buildings in this community.

662
00:52:58,149 --> 00:52:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna get into disrepair.

663
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:06,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that building doesn't need work anyways, but we have purposes that we could use for that building.

664
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask that we sit down with the city administration.

665
00:53:11,197 --> 00:53:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked for a response, Mr. President.

666
00:53:13,138 --> 00:53:14,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We really didn't get a response.

667
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:25,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time we sit down with the city administration and the Committee of the Whole and directly ask what is the intent and what is the city gonna use that building now that it's back in the city hands, Mr. President.

668
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:27,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

669
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:30,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that the Memphis Police do use that for training.

670
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

671
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:34,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

672
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:39,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks gave a good overview, and I agree with what he said.

673
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,212
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this sparked, people have been asking, what is going on?

674
00:53:43,272 --> 00:53:50,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was some activity from the Memphis Police, and Councilor Marks and I, I think, helped get the questions answered with regards to dog training.

675
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:56,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talked to Chief Sacco, who said that the city did give permission to do that.

676
00:53:56,743 --> 00:53:58,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all well and good.

677
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:00,486
[SPEAKER_11]: But what is the plan?

678
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:14,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would actually like to know something, whether there's been discussions about it, the potential uses for it, the potential for putting money into the building for certain purposes, such as an arts facility.

679
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:19,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I just would like some sort of answer before we vote on this year's budget.

680
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,061
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't seen anywhere in the budget.

681
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:24,984
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to know if, obviously, it's not going to be in fiscal year 2018 budget.

682
00:54:26,976 --> 00:54:28,377
[SPEAKER_11]: what is our plan down the line?

683
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:35,644
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't in the capital plan, the draft capital plan that we got five, six, seven months ago.

684
00:54:35,744 --> 00:54:36,825
[SPEAKER_11]: That has been altered.

685
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:38,506
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't got a new capital plan.

686
00:54:38,686 --> 00:54:39,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Would it be in the new capital plan?

687
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:40,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

688
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:41,849
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't in the first one.

689
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:44,071
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are we going to do with the building?

690
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:45,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And Council Member Mox is right.

691
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:50,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it just going to deteriorate year after year and we're going to get nothing out of it and put nothing into it?

692
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:52,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are we going to maintain it?

693
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:53,399
[SPEAKER_11]: What is our plan?

694
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:53,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether

695
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,649
[SPEAKER_11]: matter what, I think we just need the answer.

696
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,611
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's important because it's a good-sized building.

697
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in a neighborhood.

698
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:02,913
[SPEAKER_11]: These neighbors pay taxes.

699
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:06,395
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to know what's going on, what's going to happen.

700
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,118
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we could get some sort of answer before we vote on this, vote on the budget, I think that would be beneficial.

701
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would get a lot of questions answered.

702
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be able to tell the residents and the neighborhood what the potential plan is.

703
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Or A, B, and C may happen.

704
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:23,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everybody has a right to know.

705
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:29,898
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be very expensive to maintain the building for the long run if we're not going to create a use for it.

706
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,379
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's important.

707
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:32,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

708
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

709
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:34,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

710
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank my council colleagues for bringing this forward.

711
00:55:36,964 --> 00:55:38,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a very important issue.

712
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:39,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.

713
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:41,387
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important piece of property.

714
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:45,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of groups that could use this as a home in the future.

715
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The arts, recreation, you name it.

716
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,621
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a prime opportunity.

717
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad it's back in the city's hands.

718
00:55:55,383 --> 00:56:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when the Council of Marks brought this forward a few months ago, I amended the resolution because I thought that we should honestly have a committee of the whole meeting to actually walk through the site.

719
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:09,730
[SPEAKER_01]: The property has not been in the control of the city for many years.

720
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:14,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should really see firsthand, I think, the condition of the building and what we're getting back.

721
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:18,815
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's not going to happen, I'd like to amend the paper, if you don't mind.

722
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:34,437
[SPEAKER_01]: that we get a report back from the building department that gives us basically a report back to us about the overall condition of the building, you know, with regard to, you know, heating or windows, roofing, I mean, anything like that.

723
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is something that we need to consider.

724
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We should know about this.

725
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:41,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are very important matters.

726
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anytime you have a building like this that's

727
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,336
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, you know, part of your city.

728
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:58,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you really need to know and keep an eye on the maintenance, the preventive maintenance, what kind of money has been spent or is going to be spent, you know, what kind of money it's going to take to bring this back online.

729
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:03,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I assume it's probably ready to go because it was functioning, you know, not too long ago.

730
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:10,828
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really think we should, as a council and as a city, know what we're getting back from Bridgewell.

731
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could amend the paper to include that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

732
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:15,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And I second that resolution.

733
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

734
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:18,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

735
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, again, thank you.

736
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:22,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, my fellow councilors bringing this forward.

737
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:29,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that just to shed some light, this is one of the, uh, first meetings we had with, uh, the recreation focus group.

738
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:32,381
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about, um, facilities.

739
00:57:33,061 --> 00:57:44,169
[SPEAKER_13]: And one thing we did talk about and have met with the mayor's office is that, uh, a dual function, whether it's recreation, whether it's the art council or, um, or such other,

740
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:45,646
[SPEAKER_13]: facility.

741
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:54,353
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know that they've had the building inspectors in there and for the sole purpose to see what we can do for housing.

742
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:59,357
[SPEAKER_13]: It's such a very important initiative.

743
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,538
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that they've been doing that.

744
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:11,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, too, if we can call for that committee of the whole meeting and get an update because, you know, the activity that was there could have been the

745
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,804
[SPEAKER_13]: the builders that were looking in to see what needed to be done there.

746
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:18,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously we know the police have been there.

747
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:27,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I know that the mayor's office has been actively, um, searching and working with that site to see what's best for the city of Medford.

748
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:29,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm pretty excited about the possibility.

749
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your input.

750
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:31,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

751
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:32,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

752
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:34,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Nyeth.

753
00:58:34,368 --> 00:58:35,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

754
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:40,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, may I be so bold as to suggest that we table this matter for one week?

755
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,399
[SPEAKER_17]: For the simple reason that tomorrow night we're having our budget hearings with the building commissioner.

756
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:50,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe this building falls under the jurisdiction of the building commissioner right now as it's a city-owned parcel.

757
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,600
[SPEAKER_17]: It's vacant.

758
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're having our meeting with them tomorrow night.

759
00:58:52,981 --> 00:59:02,364
[SPEAKER_17]: We might be able to get some of these questions answered tomorrow night during our budget debates, our budget discussions, without having to send a paper to the administration and having to wait for it to go through the proper protocols.

760
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:03,865
[SPEAKER_17]: We take the paper, we send it to the mayor.

761
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:06,305
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor takes the paper, she refers it to the appropriate department.

762
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:07,746
[SPEAKER_17]: The appropriate department gets the paper,

763
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:11,436
[SPEAKER_17]: notifies the mayor that they're in receipt, puts a report together, sends it to the city clerk.

764
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:13,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we turn off the radio in the back?

765
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:17,502
[SPEAKER_17]: The city clerk.

766
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:21,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The city clerk then takes that paper and puts it back in our packet as a response.

767
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:26,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it might be a little bit more efficient, Mr. President, if we considered tabling the matter for one week, brought the matter up.

768
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you making a motion to table?

769
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I mean, I think that this isn't my resolution.

770
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:31,872
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a resolution that's been brought forward by two councilors.

771
00:59:31,932 --> 00:59:34,693
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been seconded, thirded, and fourthed at this point in time, Mr. President.

772
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:37,095
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that this is an alternative course of action that we can take.

773
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:38,875
[SPEAKER_17]: We may get an answer a little bit quicker.

774
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:44,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, if it's the body's wishes and the delegation's wishes to go through the process and wait for a response back, that's great.

775
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:49,961
[SPEAKER_17]: If we want to table it and maybe have a meeting tomorrow with the building commissioner and ask him about it, or do both for that matter.

776
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:51,802
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we can raise the issue tomorrow with the budget hearings.

777
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:52,302
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

778
00:59:53,042 --> 00:59:56,024
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think that for us to send the paper forward and then ask for a response and then

779
00:59:56,954 --> 01:00:05,078
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, have the approval of the budget be contingent upon a report back on the Heckness Center, it might be more expedient for us to sit down with the building commissioner and discuss this issue.

780
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:10,061
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be before us tomorrow night anyway, provided we provide him with the notice that this is a topic of conversation.

781
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:14,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think he'll have any problem discussing it tomorrow when answering some of the questions and concerns that we have.

782
01:00:14,923 --> 01:00:22,027
[SPEAKER_17]: If we need to delve further into the situation, then we can put a paper forward addressing the specific questions that we want answered that have ever been unanswered.

783
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:26,586
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I would, um, I certainly would defer to the wisdom of the body.

784
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:29,267
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think that this might be a more expedient way to get it done.

785
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to table it?

786
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:38,892
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'll table it.

787
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:41,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

788
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:43,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Counselor Del Rosso.

789
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think it's unwise and unnecessary to make the, uh, uh, response on this paper, uh,

790
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:53,988
[SPEAKER_05]: a contingent factor in the approval of the budget.

791
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member Kern.

792
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to move forward.

793
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:01,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not making it contingent.

794
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:03,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven people have to vote on the budget separately.

795
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying I would like to have an answer myself.

796
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:07,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm speaking for myself.

797
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:08,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd move approval.

798
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:09,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

799
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:14,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

800
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,682
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor

801
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:25,269
[SPEAKER_03]: by Vice President Mox and Council Member Kern as amended by Councilor Falco and Councilor Night.

802
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote has been requested.

803
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:35,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

804
01:01:36,114 --> 01:01:36,255
Yes.

805
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Night?

806
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:38,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

807
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:40,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kern?

808
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:40,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

809
01:01:41,295 --> 01:01:41,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Monk?

810
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:41,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

811
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:43,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Capelli?

812
01:01:43,597 --> 01:01:43,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

813
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:45,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Caviello?

814
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:45,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

815
01:01:46,478 --> 01:01:47,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Assemblyman DiFermina?

816
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say yes to my resolutions.

817
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,000
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the negative.

818
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

819
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:51,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to take hands.

820
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Papers in the hands of the clerk.

821
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:55,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And the paper in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Knight.

822
01:01:55,865 --> 01:01:57,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

823
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:58,887
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

824
01:01:59,027 --> 01:01:59,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

825
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:02,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

826
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:04,310
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-527, offered by Councilor Knight.

827
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:09,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration report back to the council the status of the lighting upgrades

828
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:13,822
[SPEAKER_03]: in Medford Square, including a schedule of implementation.

829
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor Knight.

830
01:02:16,102 --> 01:02:28,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, on Saturday morning, we had our budget discussions and Chief Sacco was before us and we had a long and very fulfilling discussion about Medford Square and some ways to make Medford Square a little bit safer.

831
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:33,106
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the easiest ways that was noted was to improve the lighting in Medford Square.

832
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:40,941
[SPEAKER_17]: This council has been very proactive in looking at the lighting and the fixtures, so on and so forth, that's going to be utilized down Medford Square.

833
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:45,242
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's my understanding that we're almost at the point of implementation.

834
01:02:45,322 --> 01:02:53,004
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to ask the city administration to provide us with the status of the upgrades, as well as a schedule for the implementation, so that we can share that information with the community.

835
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:58,685
[SPEAKER_17]: So the individuals that contact us with concerns about transient individuals in the square and safety concerns that they have.

836
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:04,045
[SPEAKER_17]: can be addressed appropriately with some accurate information that shows that there is going to be some improvements in the area.

837
01:03:04,706 --> 01:03:05,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

838
01:03:05,146 --> 01:03:09,609
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

839
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:10,210
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

840
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

841
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

842
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:15,353
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-528 offered by Councilor Knight.

843
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:27,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the City Administration provide a cost analysis and feasibility study regarding the information of video monitoring in our public parks and buildings.

844
01:03:27,442 --> 01:03:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

845
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:35,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, yes, we've all seen a trend in government, see something, say something.

846
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:36,939
[SPEAKER_17]: If you see something wrong, you say something.

847
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think one way for us to see more is to have more rise across the community.

848
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:45,826
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had a number of questions and concerns and issues that arise relative to our public parks.

849
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:57,454
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a number of issues and concerns that arise relative to our publicly owned buildings, concerns about vandalism, concerns about injuries, concerns about crimes that may have been committed, concerns about the general maintenance and upkeep and what's going on in the neighborhood.

850
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:58,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that this would be

851
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:11,700
[SPEAKER_17]: a very low-cost proposal for us to implement stronger security measures throughout the community and allow us to have more eyes on the ground, Mr. President, to allow us to go back and take a look and see what happened to this.

852
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:12,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Why did it happen?

853
01:04:12,521 --> 01:04:13,141
[SPEAKER_17]: How did it happen?

854
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:16,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is there a lot of dumping going on in this certain section of the community?

855
01:04:16,444 --> 01:04:20,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is this place structure continuously getting vandalized?

856
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:23,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is this port-a-party in a public park continuously getting burnt down?

857
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:29,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this will be a helpful tool in us identifying some of the concerns that we have in the community related to quality of life and public safety, Mr. President.

858
01:04:29,501 --> 01:04:33,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to move forward for approval and ask my council colleagues to support the paper.

859
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:34,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

860
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:35,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

861
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

862
01:04:36,145 --> 01:04:37,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

863
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:42,909
[SPEAKER_01]: This issue actually came up during a police community meeting a couple of months ago.

864
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:50,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking to the members of the police department, you know, they talk a lot about how surrounding communities have

865
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:59,777
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras in a lot of different intersections and whatnot, and how it's actually been key in solving crimes and whatnot.

866
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:06,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And our city really does not have a lot of cameras, or I don't think any cameras, really, at any of our public places.

867
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:08,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a resolution that I definitely support.

868
01:05:09,642 --> 01:05:19,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to see if the council wouldn't mind if we could amend it to actually look at the feasibility of putting them at some intersections upon consultation with the police, of course.

869
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:26,268
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you wouldn't mind amending the resolution, greatly appreciate it.

870
01:05:26,288 --> 01:05:27,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And I second the motion.

871
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:29,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

872
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:35,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the individual, Councilor, amending the motion.

873
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:42,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultimately, if we think about it, the Boston Marathon bombers were identified through traffic cameras that were in the community.

874
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,958
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a measure that's only going to make us safer.

875
01:05:45,328 --> 01:05:53,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Week in and week out, we hear discussion about roadways that are unsafe, speeding cars, cars blowing through the four-way intersection at the bottom of Doonan Street, for example.

876
01:05:53,471 --> 01:06:02,674
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe we have some problem intersections and some problem locations, and this would be a great idea, Mr. President, for us to combat some of those issues with the limited amount of manpower that we have.

877
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:06,856
[SPEAKER_17]: We can embrace some technology and hopefully see some benefits in investing in technology.

878
01:06:07,056 --> 01:06:07,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

879
01:06:08,056 --> 01:06:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

880
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:16,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

881
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:34,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I understand, because the councilor just said something that, it's one thing to have a camera in place that may capture an incident that took place, but Councilor Light just mentioned about maybe cars that are going through intersections.

882
01:06:35,752 --> 01:06:41,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the intent to use this camera to catch people speeding or going through stop signs?

883
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

884
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:59,612
[SPEAKER_17]: That would not be the intent in my understanding based upon the discussions that I've had with the chief of police is that certain sections of the general laws would need to be adopted before we can utilize traffic cameras to even consider issuing speeding and tickets or parking, moving violations.

885
01:06:59,852 --> 01:07:00,952
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's not my intent at all.

886
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:13,855
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more or less a see something, say something opportunity for us to monitor the streets and if something happens have the ability to go back and review what those eyes have seen to maybe see if we can identify trends or identify certain

887
01:07:15,002 --> 01:07:25,949
[SPEAKER_17]: criteria that might contribute to public safety concerns, whether it be traffic backing up in the morning at Winthrop Street, so cars taking a left-hand turn, go around the rotary once, and then try to cut into the left-hand lane.

888
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:33,554
[SPEAKER_17]: If we see a patent of involvement or a patent of activity at a certain location, maybe we can put a sign up there, a patent of activity where the police have to be called.

889
01:07:33,574 --> 01:07:43,380
[SPEAKER_17]: We can put the cameras up on those intersections and then take a look at what's going on there, and then go back and monitor it and see if maybe we can control it through signage, through other traffic control devices, through education.

890
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:56,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I could, I don't have a problem with the way you just explained it, but you can also accomplish that by doing traffic studies, which we've done in the community.

892
01:07:57,841 --> 01:08:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's a helpful tool, I don't see a problem with it.

893
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:07,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we have the manpower to monitor these particular cameras, how it would be done.

894
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:15,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We seem to not be able to do the very basic things in the community, and I'm not sure how we're going to monitor cameras

895
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:18,226
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the community to make improvements.

896
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I guess it's worth exploring.

897
01:08:21,549 --> 01:08:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

898
01:08:23,452 --> 01:08:24,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Nice.

899
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:29,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, as filed, you know, my concern was more about public buildings than our parks.

900
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the paper was amended to address some certain intersections and streets.

901
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:32,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

902
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:34,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Thurgood.

903
01:08:34,919 --> 01:08:35,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

904
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I amended it was because it did come up at a police community meeting.

905
01:08:39,722 --> 01:09:01,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the police officers that I talked to that were in the room and the detectives, they had mentioned that all the surrounding communities had these cameras and they're very useful in, you know, especially if a crime has happened, you know, they can always consult the cameras or if there's a car chase or something like that, or if something happens in Somerville, uh, you know, and they come through Medford, you know, this, you know, they can actually see things on tape.

906
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:03,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of times, you know,

907
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:06,589
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to Medford, you can't see anything because there's no cameras.

908
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have them in all surrounding areas, surrounding cities and towns.

909
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:11,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been extremely helpful.

910
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:20,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that things have happened in Medford where the people that have broken the law have gone down to cities and towns and they've consulted these cameras.

911
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really helped out a lot from what I've

912
01:09:22,978 --> 01:09:24,038
[SPEAKER_01]: from what I was told that night.

913
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:30,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all accessible right through the phone if they needed to look at a camera right away.

914
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:35,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a good way to possibly help to solve crimes.

915
01:09:36,142 --> 01:09:39,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's a way to go out to see if someone's speeding or something like that.

916
01:09:39,823 --> 01:09:40,683
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the purpose.

917
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:47,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be to actually just to try to, after crime has been committed, to actually go back and look at a tape and say, OK, wait a second.

918
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,009
[SPEAKER_01]: running down Mr. Gabel, whatever it may be.

919
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a good tool to have.

920
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a really inexpensive option.

921
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cameras are pretty inexpensive these days.

922
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:07,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think it's something, I think it's something that could be very beneficial to the police department in solving crimes.

923
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:09,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Member Kern.

924
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

925
01:10:11,422 --> 01:10:17,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Somerville and Chelsea use this as same thing as a tool that if something does happen, a crime, they're able to,

926
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:22,284
[SPEAKER_11]: let's go to the nearest intersection and see which car, where did this go?

927
01:10:22,324 --> 01:10:24,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get a license plate?

928
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:27,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we even see in the vehicle and see how many people were in the vehicle?

929
01:10:27,709 --> 01:10:34,534
[SPEAKER_11]: We had an incident in Wellington Circle, oh gosh, last summer maybe, where a car hit a pedestrian.

930
01:10:34,554 --> 01:10:36,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the pedestrian died.

931
01:10:37,877 --> 01:10:42,881
[SPEAKER_11]: We had no cameras at Wellington Circle, but thankfully I believe my, um,

932
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:50,000
[SPEAKER_11]: The other person that rents out of the building I'm in, the painted bird tattoo head cameras, was able to catch a video of the car.

933
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:57,682
[SPEAKER_11]: That video from the business was put on TV and I don't know if the suspect was caught, but that's something we in Medford don't have.

934
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:08,925
[SPEAKER_11]: You also have a lot of he said, she said car accidents where the victims, you don't know who the actual victim is, but those cameras can help find the true victim very easily.

935
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:14,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a great tool that our police department could use to go back and say, oh, let's see what happened on Main and

936
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:21,616
[SPEAKER_11]: itself last night at 930, I think it would definitely be beneficial, especially if the cost is right.

937
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's something we could use in Medford.

938
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:24,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

939
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,641
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion, Vice President Mox.

940
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

941
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:34,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want people to think I'm opposed to cameras and doing all that good stuff.

942
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:41,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think there could be a potential abuse if we don't know what they're being utilized for.

943
01:11:42,273 --> 01:11:54,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, Mr. President, I think it's been maybe three years that we've asked, this council has requested the administration for a camera on Commercial Street in particular because of the dumping

944
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:58,649
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes on there, TVs, refrigerators, over and over again.

945
01:11:59,429 --> 01:12:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: One camera we asked for on Commercial Street, and to date, it hasn't happened.

946
01:12:04,551 --> 01:12:08,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in favor of cameras on every corner, on every street.

947
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:10,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna happen, Mr. President.

948
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:15,675
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get one on Commercial Street for dumping, which is another use maybe for the cameras.

949
01:12:16,756 --> 01:12:21,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch people that are dumping stoves and refrigerators on a city street, Mr. President.

950
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:24,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

951
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:26,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

952
01:12:26,616 --> 01:12:30,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I certainly understand Councilor Moxley's position.

953
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:38,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that this was more about a question of whether or not Big Brother was watching and they were going to use this as a tool to start finding violators for certain traffic violations.

954
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:39,865
[SPEAKER_17]: That wasn't the intent at all.

955
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:44,288
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a data collection tool, not a punitive measure, punitive tool.

956
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

957
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:52,394
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

958
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:53,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

959
01:12:54,881 --> 01:12:55,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

960
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more papers on the hands.

961
01:12:59,923 --> 01:13:01,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanna get rid of those two more.

962
01:13:02,604 --> 01:13:21,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the missing left side of the stop sign at the ends of Midwood Street where it meets Hicks Ave be replaced in the interest of public safety and be it further resolved that the three construction barrels used for crossing children at the Columbus School be replaced with signs

963
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:23,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks.

964
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:25,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

965
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That stop sign, for some reason, I don't know what happened, but half of it's missing.

966
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says op, whatever that means.

967
01:13:32,744 --> 01:13:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, Mr. President, Columbus Street.

968
01:13:34,945 --> 01:13:44,292
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three barrels that the crossing guard has to pull in and out every day so kids can cross across the street, Mr. President.

969
01:13:45,090 --> 01:14:03,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a makeshift way, in my opinion, to provide public safety for our students, and I ask that a permanent sign be erected, Mr. President, showing where kids cross, that a full-fledged crosswalk be painted and kept up with, Mr. President.

970
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:05,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

971
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,216
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Locke, seconded by

972
01:14:09,266 --> 01:14:10,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

973
01:14:11,328 --> 01:14:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

974
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:13,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Vice President Mox.

975
01:14:14,552 --> 01:14:25,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Veterans Memorial sign located across the Middle Oaks Bakery on Main Street at the corner of Bowen Main be put back where it once stood.

976
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:26,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

977
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

978
01:14:28,226 --> 01:14:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a war memorial sign that is across Middle Oaks Bakery.

979
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,431
[SPEAKER_02]: at the corner of Main and Bow.

980
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no longer there.

981
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:36,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what happened.

982
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:43,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when a sidewalk or a street was replaced, the sidewalk, the sign is missing.

983
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:59,119
[SPEAKER_02]: At tonight's budget meeting, we had Ernest Lindsay, the Director of Veterans Affairs, and I posed the question to him, and he was also gonna look at it, but I'd ask that we send also a communication to the mayor by this council to have it researched, Mr. President.

984
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:04,285
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

985
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:04,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

986
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:05,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

987
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

988
01:15:08,627 --> 01:15:10,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for suspension by Councilor Knight.

989
01:15:11,388 --> 01:15:14,470
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lay on the table.

990
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:22,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the committee reports, 17, 516, Committee of the Whole, May 31, 2017.

991
01:15:24,415 --> 01:15:29,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the meeting was to view and discuss government legislative management.

992
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:30,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

993
01:15:31,502 --> 01:15:33,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I defer to Counselor Falco.

994
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:39,767
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an issue that he's been working on since his start of the term this year, and I think he should be provided the opportunity to present.

995
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:41,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor Falco.

996
01:15:41,107 --> 01:15:41,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:15:41,988 --> 01:15:43,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

998
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:53,614
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the meeting was to view and discuss government legislative management software, which includes the agenda, minutes, and video streaming the meeting.

999
01:15:54,775 --> 01:15:55,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good meeting.

1000
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually asked a lot of questions.

1001
01:15:57,717 --> 01:16:00,298
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a nice presentation from Acela

1002
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:01,608
[SPEAKER_01]: corporation.

1003
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:09,732
[SPEAKER_01]: They have experience with the surrounding communities that also use this type of product.

1004
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:13,334
[SPEAKER_01]: They use it in Somerville, Melrose, I believe maybe Cambridge as well.

1005
01:16:13,854 --> 01:16:24,959
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a product that will bring a lot of transparency to the process and the way we view agendas and minutes here at City Hall.

1006
01:16:25,379 --> 01:16:28,521
[SPEAKER_01]: The public would have all the information at their fingertips.

1007
01:16:29,269 --> 01:16:32,491
[SPEAKER_01]: with regard to researching information if they wanted to.

1008
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:33,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very powerful tool.

1009
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great with regard to transparency.

1010
01:16:36,753 --> 01:16:45,217
[SPEAKER_01]: All the reports that we get back here, they will be able to access on their phones or laptops or iPads or whatever it may be.

1011
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:48,539
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a great tool with regard to transparency.

1012
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Video streaming is a powerful tool as well.

1013
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:52,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It would allow us to actually

1014
01:16:54,588 --> 01:16:58,232
[SPEAKER_01]: film the meetings, the city council office, if we choose.

1015
01:16:58,872 --> 01:17:03,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also great because we have a lot of boards and commissions in our community.

1016
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:07,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people really don't know what the boards and commissions do.

1017
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:17,570
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the agenda minutes meeting software, it would allow all of the boards and commission minutes, agenda minutes and software, all be online.

1018
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:21,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it benefits the community in many ways with regard to transparency.

1019
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd actually be able to view and see the meetings whenever they want.

1020
01:17:25,828 --> 01:17:26,889
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything would be online.

1021
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:30,372
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great meeting, went really well, great questions.

1022
01:17:30,752 --> 01:17:33,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically a brief synopsis.

1023
01:17:33,073 --> 01:17:33,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilman.

1024
01:17:33,594 --> 01:17:35,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the paper.

1025
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:39,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Vice President Marks.

1026
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Felco for bringing up the subject.

1027
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:47,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this has been a bone of contention in this community for a number of years.

1028
01:17:48,662 --> 01:17:56,027
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that there are many board and commission meetings that are taking place on hours that are very difficult for residents to attend.

1029
01:17:56,047 --> 01:18:12,417
[SPEAKER_02]: There are meetings happening during the day that most working people are unable to attend and to have a video stream or a place where you could click on a PDF file and get a copy of the minutes and also a recording of what took place is extremely helpful.

1030
01:18:12,957 --> 01:18:15,239
[SPEAKER_02]: and something that I've supported for a number of years.

1031
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:24,646
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to make this successful, we need to get a buy-in from the administration, because as we heard, that it would be great to have the council meetings recorded.

1032
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:26,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record it on Tuesday nights.

1033
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:29,544
[SPEAKER_02]: They replay us on Thursday and Friday on local access.

1034
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:39,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order for this to be successful, Mr. President, it has to be a buy-in from the administration that all the boards and commissions fall into this also.

1035
01:18:39,528 --> 01:18:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know when the Zoning Board of Appeals has a meeting.

1036
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:43,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the assessors meet.

1037
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,591
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the Liquor Commission meets.

1038
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:50,473
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when the park board is discussing maybe a park in your area.

1039
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:55,995
[SPEAKER_02]: That is vital, Mr. President, to have, as Councilor Falco alluded to,

1040
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency in this community.

1041
01:18:57,886 --> 01:19:04,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked that in the format of a question, and I don't know if we got a response, Mr. Clerk.

1042
01:19:04,868 --> 01:19:11,570
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked that the mayor be fully supportive of the agenda and minutes concept with all boards of commissions and school committees.

1043
01:19:13,711 --> 01:19:15,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we haven't sent this out.

1044
01:19:15,812 --> 01:19:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Mr. President,

1045
01:19:19,749 --> 01:19:25,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important that we receive full support from the administration in order to move this forward.

1046
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:26,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1047
01:19:28,558 --> 01:19:29,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1048
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:34,665
[SPEAKER_06]: As a sign of her support, I believe the mayor allocated funds for this in the legislative budget.

1049
01:19:35,165 --> 01:19:36,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You are correct, Councilor DelaRusso.

1050
01:19:37,348 --> 01:19:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lococo.

1051
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:39,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to back that up.

1052
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:40,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it's in the budget,

1053
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:46,146
[SPEAKER_11]: We do want every single board and commission to be televised.

1054
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,366
[SPEAKER_11]: We want the minutes online.

1055
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:49,687
[SPEAKER_11]: We want complete and full transparency.

1056
01:19:49,987 --> 01:19:54,008
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that the mayor is going to ask each and every board and commission to do this.

1057
01:19:55,068 --> 01:20:05,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's obvious that we want our committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings taped as well as city council meetings here taped and video streamed.

1058
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,491
[SPEAKER_11]: But we also were requesting additional

1059
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:13,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it should be number three on this committee report.

1060
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:17,130
[SPEAKER_11]: We did request additional, I forget what the device was.

1061
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:25,375
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a certain device that is a few hundred dollars that you'll need in each room you want to video.

1062
01:20:25,456 --> 01:20:35,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were requesting not only it be one in this room, but we have one in at least 207 and 201 and maybe even one upstairs so that we can make this possible.

1063
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,924
[SPEAKER_11]: But no matter how many we purchase, we need the mayor

1064
01:20:38,662 --> 01:20:51,594
[SPEAKER_11]: the administration to request and almost mandate that every single meeting is televised and takes part in this program, because that's where you're going to see money being worth it.

1065
01:20:51,794 --> 01:21:02,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Our meetings are televised anyway, but to get every single commission and board meeting televised and open to the public and as transparent as possible is the purpose of doing this.

1066
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:07,391
[SPEAKER_11]: not only city council meetings, but every single board and commission meeting.

1067
01:21:07,431 --> 01:21:08,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's extremely important.

1068
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1069
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:12,134
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by- As amended.

1070
01:21:12,874 --> 01:21:12,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry?

1071
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:16,376
[SPEAKER_11]: We can amend that to request additional funding.

1072
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:20,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the $20,000 included the monitors, correct?

1073
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falcone?

1074
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was $12,000 without the monitor and 20 with?

1075
01:21:24,561 --> 01:21:27,563
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 was a video streaming.

1076
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:27,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1077
01:21:28,524 --> 01:21:32,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually, I was just wondering why it took so long.

1078
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:35,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1079
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:39,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Presently in the legislative section of the FY18 budget, we have funding to implement this.

1080
01:21:39,913 --> 01:21:41,954
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a question here that we're reporting out of the committee.

1081
01:21:41,974 --> 01:21:44,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Can monies be appropriated out of the cable access funds?

1082
01:21:45,096 --> 01:21:52,021
[SPEAKER_17]: If the answer is yes, then maybe we can use the money that gets appropriated out of the cable access funds to implement additional monitors.

1083
01:21:52,902 --> 01:21:53,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1084
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept the committee.

1085
01:21:57,785 --> 01:21:58,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stop.

1086
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And the additional monitors, I believe, were pretty inexpensive.

1087
01:22:01,027 --> 01:22:02,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not big money.

1088
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:03,898
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hundred bucks.

1089
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:06,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record.

1090
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,241
[SPEAKER_08]: G News 035 Paris Street.

1091
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:08,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I attended this meeting.

1092
01:22:09,222 --> 01:22:23,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my recollection that it was $12,000 for the posting of agendas and minutes, 8,000 additional dollars for a total of 20 to engage the streaming module.

1093
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:31,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was room by room between eight and $12,000 for the cameras and equipment to be outfitted.

1094
01:22:31,831 --> 01:22:33,552
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a separate key to outfit.

1095
01:22:33,652 --> 01:22:35,873
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what my notes had said from that night.

1096
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like about $800.

1097
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1098
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:48,138
[SPEAKER_08]: For the transmitter, for the transmitter, but the additional cameras and everything, I thought they said to outfit a room was going to be 12 grand.

1099
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So you may just want to, I know you have questions going to them.

1100
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:53,480
[SPEAKER_08]: You may just want to clarify that because I recall differently.

1101
01:22:57,801 --> 01:22:59,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cover everything except for the

1102
01:22:59,839 --> 01:23:03,321
[SPEAKER_01]: extra transmitters, which were actually going to be a little bit more money.

1103
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:04,742
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was not that much money.

1104
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:12,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember saying, well, this is actually, in the grand scheme of things, it was pretty inexpensive, I think, with regard to transparency and whatnot.

1105
01:23:12,427 --> 01:23:15,389
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

1106
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:16,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1107
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:17,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor DelaRusso.

1108
01:23:17,931 --> 01:23:20,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept the committee report, Mr. President.

1109
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:23,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1110
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:25,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Castaneda cushion street.

1111
01:23:26,617 --> 01:23:35,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, my recollection at that meeting, I asked the vendor more importantly, what would it cost in the future per year?

1112
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:49,702
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe one of the councilors stated that would be in the contract, but at least he was up front enough, hopefully factual and truthful to say the increase can only be a maximum of, I believe it was 3%.

1113
01:23:49,783 --> 01:23:50,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1114
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:56,073
[SPEAKER_14]: So increase.

1115
01:23:56,253 --> 01:24:03,256
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully 3% would be like $600 on top of 20,000 in the following year if they max it out.

1116
01:24:03,996 --> 01:24:08,738
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully it won't be a surprise bill of a hundred thousand for the following year.

1117
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,019
[SPEAKER_14]: 3% is supposed to be the max.

1118
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:15,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would, if you people get into the contract, I would, and sign it.

1119
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I would hope they will stick to that 3% in the contract.

1120
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:22,890
[SPEAKER_14]: so there's no surprises in the future, thank you.

1121
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:23,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1122
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:29,875
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso to accept the paper, all those in favor?

1123
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:31,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes, 17-529.

1124
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:46,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee meeting report, purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the contents of the paper of 16-04, and the following recommendations were made.

1125
01:24:47,269 --> 01:24:49,991
[SPEAKER_03]: One, that the city solicitor provide an opinion on the following.

1126
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:59,567
[SPEAKER_03]: A, does the city have the ability to issue more return on the issuance of permits authorizing public utility companies to excavate city streets and sidewalks?

1127
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:07,413
[SPEAKER_03]: B, does the city have the ability to limit the number of permits issued to public utility companies during an annual construction season?

1128
01:25:07,473 --> 01:25:15,759
[SPEAKER_03]: C, that the city review existing laws and ordinances and recommend to the city council any changes to strengthen the city's position?

1129
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:18,942
[SPEAKER_03]: D, can the city request upfront

1130
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:32,031
[SPEAKER_03]: funding for paving services from public utility companies, D, E, that the city implement a final inspection criteria and establish a stronger construction standards.

1131
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:33,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1132
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:36,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1133
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:52,016
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a common and recurring theme behind this rail for the past term that our public utilities that are performing construction work in the city of Medford aren't doing so in a fashion that would be beneficial to the residents of Medford and their quality of life during the construction.

1134
01:25:53,077 --> 01:25:58,800
[SPEAKER_17]: That the final product that they're leaving us with is shoddy at best and not up to city of Medford standards, Mr. President.

1135
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,181
[SPEAKER_17]: So paper 16404 was filed in April of 2016.

1136
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:07,367
[SPEAKER_17]: The engineering division did not submit a response to the council.

1137
01:26:07,827 --> 01:26:09,548
[SPEAKER_17]: So a committee of the whole was held.

1138
01:26:10,008 --> 01:26:21,113
[SPEAKER_17]: At this committee of the whole, we had a very informative and at-length discussion relative to public utilities, their rights in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in the community of Medford, Mr. President.

1139
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:33,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And ultimately, we've generated several questions that we're going to ask the city solicitor with the hopes of tightening up the permit process so that these public utility companies that are running roughshod over our streets and sidewalks

1140
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,941
[SPEAKER_17]: are held to a better and higher standard.

1141
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,763
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd move for approval on the paper, Mr. President, there was a long time coming.

1142
01:26:39,823 --> 01:26:43,885
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1143
01:26:44,585 --> 01:26:45,426
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1144
01:26:45,786 --> 01:26:45,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1145
01:26:47,347 --> 01:26:48,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1146
01:26:50,148 --> 01:26:55,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to revert back to regular business, petitions, presentation, and similar matters.

1147
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:55,831
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-526.

1148
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:13,370
[SPEAKER_03]: petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., to discuss the Mayor's new water connectivity tax to be effective July 2017 in the Mayor's proposed hotel next to City Hall.

1149
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

1150
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:20,675
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.

1151
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:25,038
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates.

1152
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:40,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community.

1153
01:27:41,268 --> 01:27:44,109
[SPEAKER_00]: In their letter, where they make an assessment of $24,000, is $24,483 is necessary.

1154
01:27:44,129 --> 01:27:47,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here.

1155
01:27:54,929 --> 01:27:55,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me?

1156
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:56,049
[SPEAKER_03]: $24 million.

1157
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,270
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $24 million.

1158
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:59,991
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount.

1159
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:07,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account.

1160
01:28:08,314 --> 01:28:16,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one.

1161
01:28:17,157 --> 01:28:26,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side.

1162
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:35,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going up are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate.

1163
01:28:36,563 --> 01:28:40,605
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee.

1164
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:56,714
[SPEAKER_00]: And this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the property owns the line.

1165
01:28:58,775 --> 01:29:01,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1166
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I was under the impression that

1167
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:12,154
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not the mayor nor the council that set water rates and fees, but it was that of the Water and Sewer Commission.

1168
01:29:14,077 --> 01:29:15,881
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my understanding, Councilor Del Rosso.

1169
01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: continue please.

1170
01:29:17,829 --> 01:29:29,333
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it and the mayor of this community has allowed it and likewise this Metfit City Council has done nothing to rebut it for which you have a unique opportunity right now.

1171
01:29:29,713 --> 01:29:36,335
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance

1172
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:59,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account

1173
01:29:59,925 --> 01:30:02,145
[SPEAKER_00]: for this 2018 year of $300,000.

1174
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:05,746
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not make any sense.

1175
01:30:06,266 --> 01:30:17,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as at the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight.

1176
01:30:17,649 --> 01:30:22,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Any major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.

1177
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:26,410
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a meeting on this a month ago, same similar subject matter.

1178
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,631
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a committee of the whole on this as well, correct?

1179
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did.

1180
01:30:29,453 --> 01:30:34,577
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, I thought there was something in the rules about bringing something up that was already discussed within the last 90 days, Mr. President.

1181
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:35,938
[SPEAKER_17]: It was similar, same subject matter.

1182
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:42,042
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.

1183
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:44,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1184
01:30:44,844 --> 01:30:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1185
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no recollection of the council proposing or issuing a tax on the people of Medford on this matter.

1186
01:30:58,532 --> 01:31:07,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that we've discussed in the past 30 days a fee that has been initiated by the Water and Sewer Commission.

1187
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:08,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1188
01:31:08,841 --> 01:31:11,143
[SPEAKER_00]: The Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the mayor.

1189
01:31:11,163 --> 01:31:20,130
[SPEAKER_00]: They are appointed by the mayor, and their recommendations go to the mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate.

1190
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:24,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.

1191
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:25,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1192
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:37,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I do believe that the Water and Sewer Commission is an autonomous body that's appointed by the administration to implement and effectuate public policy related to the water and sewer, but in no way do they make recommendations to the mayor.

1193
01:31:37,218 --> 01:31:38,199
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually implement policy.

1194
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:39,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1195
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1196
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Vice President Marks.

1197
01:31:42,742 --> 01:31:46,085
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect, the gentleman's up there giving his opinion.

1198
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:48,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That's under public participation.

1199
01:31:49,472 --> 01:31:51,172
[SPEAKER_02]: He requested through the proper channels.

1200
01:31:51,893 --> 01:31:56,574
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're gonna go point, counterpoint on everything he says, Mr. President, I believe that's very unfair.

1201
01:31:57,634 --> 01:32:00,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that the gentleman be given his time allotted to him, Mr. President.

1202
01:32:01,255 --> 01:32:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: He followed the process to speak.

1203
01:32:03,175 --> 01:32:04,836
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't agree with it, you don't agree with it.

1204
01:32:04,856 --> 01:32:09,177
[SPEAKER_02]: But to do point, counterpoint is not beneficial, Mr. President, at this point.

1205
01:32:10,037 --> 01:32:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice Presidents.

1206
01:32:12,998 --> 01:32:14,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President, sorry, Counselor Knight.

1207
01:32:15,018 --> 01:32:19,159
[SPEAKER_17]: I just feel as though sometimes accurate representation of the facts is important when we're here in the public forum.

1208
01:32:19,692 --> 01:32:20,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Inouye.

1209
01:32:21,273 --> 01:32:22,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo-Kearns.

1210
01:32:22,914 --> 01:32:28,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree if you don't agree with the person at the podium, but maybe save our comments till after.

1211
01:32:28,557 --> 01:32:30,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it's almost verging on harassment.

1212
01:32:31,498 --> 01:32:32,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kearns.

1213
01:32:33,099 --> 01:32:33,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1214
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Please continue.

1215
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:49,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills

1216
01:32:50,062 --> 01:32:57,529
[SPEAKER_00]: a letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax.

1217
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:03,075
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill.

1218
01:33:03,455 --> 01:33:05,257
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a connectivity fee.

1219
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:10,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year.

1220
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:15,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Every taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street.

1221
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:17,483
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their pipe.

1222
01:33:17,823 --> 01:33:20,523
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for.

1223
01:33:21,044 --> 01:33:24,584
[SPEAKER_00]: They make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line.

1224
01:33:24,905 --> 01:33:30,806
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection.

1225
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:34,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is

1226
01:33:35,327 --> 01:33:51,114
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position.

1227
01:33:52,054 --> 01:33:57,457
[SPEAKER_00]: My argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word,

1228
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:07,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Honorable, is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus.

1229
01:34:08,156 --> 01:34:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: You've merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one.

1230
01:34:14,821 --> 01:34:31,546
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense.

1231
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:31,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

1232
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:34,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have an $8 million surplus.

1233
01:34:34,567 --> 01:34:36,388
[SPEAKER_00]: You have them both now merged together.

1234
01:34:36,608 --> 01:34:42,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa.

1235
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:49,572
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100.

1236
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:53,592
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a continuation of contract water supplies.

1237
01:34:54,413 --> 01:34:55,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came out in 1994.

1238
01:34:55,233 --> 01:35:12,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And it states the following, you incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people.

1239
01:35:13,057 --> 01:35:14,919
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that at the present time.

1240
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:20,164
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out.

1241
01:35:20,644 --> 01:35:21,325
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have it.

1242
01:35:22,426 --> 01:35:31,234
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city?

1243
01:35:31,855 --> 01:35:34,918
[SPEAKER_00]: The rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from

1244
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:42,822
[SPEAKER_00]: A residential house up to three quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year.

1245
01:35:43,082 --> 01:35:45,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may say it's only $51, but you know something?

1246
01:35:45,822 --> 01:35:50,904
[SPEAKER_00]: $51 to some people is a lot of money, especially if you're on a fixed income.

1247
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:54,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a one inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year.

1248
01:35:56,585 --> 01:36:01,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on.

1249
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,991
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another $50, $60 a year.

1250
01:36:04,212 --> 01:36:07,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year.

1251
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:10,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Your taxes each and every year continuously keep going up.

1252
01:36:10,997 --> 01:36:20,745
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit.

1253
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:36,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, okay, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee and it's at the discretion of the director of public works.

1254
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:42,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one-time fee of $50 and if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it.

1255
01:36:42,652 --> 01:36:49,734
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion

1256
01:36:50,671 --> 01:36:54,538
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same order, it could be abated.

1257
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:58,085
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make any sense.

1258
01:36:59,165 --> 01:37:07,729
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community.

1259
01:37:08,009 --> 01:37:26,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers.

1260
01:37:26,697 --> 01:37:29,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip over to the second part, to the hotel.

1261
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:43,176
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019.

1262
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:51,326
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013.

1263
01:37:52,086 --> 01:37:54,708
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know what the taxes is going to be.

1264
01:37:55,149 --> 01:38:02,974
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel.

1265
01:38:03,575 --> 01:38:05,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your time to discuss it during the budget.

1266
01:38:06,817 --> 01:38:09,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out?

1267
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense.

1268
01:38:12,672 --> 01:38:23,556
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here.

1269
01:38:23,656 --> 01:38:27,358
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here.

1270
01:38:28,078 --> 01:38:38,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus.

1271
01:38:39,023 --> 01:38:41,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts.

1272
01:38:42,805 --> 01:38:48,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability.

1273
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:50,270
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to address that?

1274
01:38:50,830 --> 01:39:00,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds?

1275
01:39:00,876 --> 01:39:02,537
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the questions you need to ask.

1276
01:39:03,157 --> 01:39:07,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this.

1277
01:39:08,163 --> 01:39:24,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him.

1278
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:28,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this.

1279
01:39:29,435 --> 01:39:36,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services.

1280
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:38,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you tell me what it is.

1281
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,561
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me, Mr. President, what it is.

1282
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:55,429
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on?

1283
01:39:57,176 --> 01:40:04,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this budget and remove this connectivity fee.

1284
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:10,879
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford.

1285
01:40:12,059 --> 01:40:13,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

1286
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:14,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1287
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Member Kern.

1288
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:20,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll ask you a question.

1289
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:22,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1290
01:40:23,597 --> 01:40:26,482
[SPEAKER_11]: You had said the council should rebut the tax.

1291
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:35,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I guess we went public, I think it was under Council Max's resolution, with regards to some of us not being happy about this fee.

1292
01:40:37,386 --> 01:40:38,187
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we rebut it?

1293
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:41,209
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was voted on by the Water and Sewer.

1294
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:49,634
[SPEAKER_00]: How you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee.

1295
01:40:50,214 --> 01:41:02,363
[SPEAKER_00]: You justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside.

1296
01:41:03,183 --> 01:41:04,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at every street.

1297
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:06,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the streets that are waiting to be done.

1298
01:41:06,505 --> 01:41:08,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the potholes that can't get done.

1299
01:41:08,445 --> 01:41:13,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke.

1300
01:41:13,968 --> 01:41:15,829
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just go on and on and on with this.

1301
01:41:16,369 --> 01:41:24,773
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.

1302
01:41:26,299 --> 01:41:27,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I voiced my concern at the meeting.

1303
01:41:28,261 --> 01:41:42,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very concerned about how this plays out in the years to come, but the way it was explained to us this year is that the rate was being reduced, this fee was being implemented, and we were raising enough just to cover what we owe MWRA.

1304
01:41:42,834 --> 01:41:47,619
[SPEAKER_11]: There was going to be no excess revenue taken in from

1305
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:50,302
[SPEAKER_11]: the rates and the fee?

1306
01:41:50,682 --> 01:41:55,567
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%.

1307
01:41:56,467 --> 01:42:09,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water,

1308
01:42:10,906 --> 01:42:28,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services?

1309
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,481
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, people are stupid?

1310
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not stupid.

1311
01:42:33,201 --> 01:42:36,183
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right.

1312
01:42:36,564 --> 01:42:39,886
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right?

1313
01:42:39,906 --> 01:42:42,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should get to every one of you members of the city council.

1314
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:50,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this.

1315
01:42:50,575 --> 01:42:51,795
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't even discussed that.

1316
01:42:51,835 --> 01:42:53,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the Water and Soil Commissioner on that?

1317
01:42:56,973 --> 01:42:58,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't mean T.L., Mr. President, but you know something?

1318
01:42:59,454 --> 01:43:06,599
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset, okay?

1319
01:43:07,239 --> 01:43:08,880
[SPEAKER_00]: But every dog has its day, remember that.

1320
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,182
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an election coming up, and I hope people remember that.

1321
01:43:12,522 --> 01:43:12,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1322
01:43:16,945 --> 01:43:17,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

1323
01:43:17,305 --> 01:43:18,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1324
01:43:18,446 --> 01:43:19,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Lisa DeFabritas, Winford Way.

1325
01:43:20,467 --> 01:43:20,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

1326
01:43:21,086 --> 01:43:23,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Lisa DeFabritis and Winford Way.

1327
01:43:23,529 --> 01:43:24,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1328
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:28,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'd like to echo the gentleman's comments.

1329
01:43:28,315 --> 01:43:32,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually attended last week's meeting with the Water and Sewer Commission here.

1330
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:37,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I was one of the, I think one of the only citizens at the meeting.

1331
01:43:38,192 --> 01:43:45,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the same letter and I called the city to inquire, to get more explanation because it was very unclear what that was all about.

1332
01:43:46,135 --> 01:43:49,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And they told me there was a meeting that evening, which I did attend.

1333
01:43:49,917 --> 01:43:50,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I went on your website.

1334
01:43:52,518 --> 01:44:00,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Your meetings for this evening, the council meetings, everything is posted, but the Water and Sewer Commission meetings are not posted.

1335
01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:09,271
[SPEAKER_09]: From my understanding from the city is that the Water and Sewer Commission is their own independent body.

1336
01:44:09,832 --> 01:44:11,494
[SPEAKER_09]: They pretty much, no one answers.

1337
01:44:11,714 --> 01:44:13,497
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really answer to anybody.

1338
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:15,739
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not elected.

1339
01:44:16,804 --> 01:44:19,166
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no transparency.

1340
01:44:19,466 --> 01:44:27,012
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no communication to the public to be able to go to these meetings and voice your opinion and ask questions.

1341
01:44:27,652 --> 01:44:34,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I happened to have gone to this meeting, inquired about this specific agenda item.

1342
01:44:34,778 --> 01:44:43,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And the information that I was told by the chair of the Water School, and there's actually the gentleman from the state, the Department of Water and Sewer from Massachusetts,

1343
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:49,409
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was told at the meeting it was not a connectivity fee.

1344
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:55,374
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fee to read the meter and to send out the bill.

1345
01:44:56,995 --> 01:45:00,058
[SPEAKER_09]: This is exactly how Dominic explained it.

1346
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So $8.61 per meter.

1347
01:45:05,302 --> 01:45:08,385
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's so that the bill can be generated, the meter's read.

1348
01:45:09,266 --> 01:45:11,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the gentleman prior to myself

1349
01:45:12,328 --> 01:45:17,679
[SPEAKER_09]: noted that they will also be lowering the rates of the water.

1350
01:45:18,421 --> 01:45:29,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I express my concerns for various reasons, and I have a document that I provide to all the members of the commissioner, is one, the meter is per meter.

1351
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:45,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have, it's not, first of all, it was not fairly, in my opinion, not fairly implemented in the sense that there are homes that have a meter for their home for your water and sewer in your house, and then you have a meter for your landscaping.

1352
01:45:46,944 --> 01:45:51,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be two, if this fee was going to be implemented, it should be two times.

1353
01:45:51,974 --> 01:45:53,677
[SPEAKER_09]: They say no because it's just one.

1354
01:45:54,259 --> 01:45:56,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have a three family home.

1355
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,657
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one meter coming into a home.

1356
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:07,922
[SPEAKER_09]: You're only charged that $8.61 for the meter, where a single family home is charged the same amount.

1357
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:11,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I question why they're raising the money.

1358
01:46:11,204 --> 01:46:17,908
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it's to ensure a minimum, I believe it's $1 to $2 million a year of guaranteed revenue.

1359
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:26,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And that revenue was supposedly to help pay for infrastructure in the city, for their sewers that needs to be repaired in the years.

1360
01:46:27,036 --> 01:46:31,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get all that, the reason for raising, that you need to generate revenue.

1361
01:46:32,781 --> 01:46:44,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But to charge, to lower rates, and then at the cost of adding more, the cost to other people unfairly,

1362
01:46:46,052 --> 01:46:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: it just wasn't clear.

1363
01:46:47,072 --> 01:46:52,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And I questioned the decision, how they came up with this, this, um, this, this plan.

1364
01:46:52,874 --> 01:46:55,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And the bottom line was the answer I got was unclear.

1365
01:46:55,595 --> 01:46:56,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically this is what we thought.

1366
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

1367
01:46:57,576 --> 01:47:05,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, there was absolutely no discussion input from anybody in, in absolute denial to reconsider the plan.

1368
01:47:05,818 --> 01:47:14,741
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and I requested that, um, it be reviewed and, um, and had people have the opportunity to propose a more fair way,

1369
01:47:15,811 --> 01:47:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: to if they need to generate revenue.

1370
01:47:18,373 --> 01:47:23,776
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the purpose is to generate revenue, why are you lowering the water rates?

1371
01:47:26,738 --> 01:47:28,019
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you justify?

1372
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're lowering, someone's going to benefit and someone's going to pay.

1373
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:33,162
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just shifting the cost.

1374
01:47:33,242 --> 01:47:34,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all this was all about.

1375
01:47:34,663 --> 01:47:44,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to get into it here right now, but in a different forum, if you had to sit there and ask the Board of Supervisors to provide an explanation, all it's going to do is shift.

1376
01:47:46,118 --> 01:47:54,503
[SPEAKER_09]: funds, the revenue you're getting from certain people will benefit and others will be paying more.

1377
01:47:54,863 --> 01:47:57,144
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're offsetting costs unfairly.

1378
01:47:57,885 --> 01:48:01,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why that is and where they came up with it.

1379
01:48:02,287 --> 01:48:09,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel that the city council should be questioning this in the purpose of the Water and Sewer Commission in the city.

1380
01:48:10,872 --> 01:48:12,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Their meeting should be transparent.

1381
01:48:13,078 --> 01:48:14,259
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be held accountable.

1382
01:48:14,359 --> 01:48:15,661
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be open to the public.

1383
01:48:16,201 --> 01:48:21,807
[SPEAKER_09]: They should not be able to make decisions on their own without responding to, I think, at least this committee here.

1384
01:48:22,087 --> 01:48:24,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Their meetings are publicized and open to the public.

1385
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not on the website.

1386
01:48:27,032 --> 01:48:27,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not.

1387
01:48:28,214 --> 01:48:29,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, I was the only one there.

1388
01:48:30,816 --> 01:48:35,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But they usually are posted and they are open to the public.

1389
01:48:35,849 --> 01:48:38,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was open to the public, but it was not posted.

1390
01:48:38,412 --> 01:48:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was posted, but it should be posted.

1391
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:42,075
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it did call and it was not posted.

1392
01:48:42,455 --> 01:48:45,699
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, anyway, so that was, that's just my comment.

1393
01:48:45,759 --> 01:48:50,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I, again, I don't know how that commission is elected or who appoints them.

1394
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: They're appointed by the mayor.

1395
01:48:51,604 --> 01:48:52,205
[SPEAKER_09]: By the mayor.

1396
01:48:52,265 --> 01:48:54,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1397
01:48:56,555 --> 01:49:07,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there should be, you know, in any public office, sometimes you need, uh, there should be a tenor, uh, you know, a limited years that people stay in a position or at least shifted around and move the people up.

1398
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:19,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, because I think sometimes what happens with people in positions for too many years, uh, they think they can, you know, make decisions on their own without feeling consultant, uh, public opinion and getting the input of others.

1399
01:49:19,632 --> 01:49:19,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1400
01:49:20,132 --> 01:49:20,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1401
01:49:23,535 --> 01:49:24,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address of the record, please.

1402
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1403
01:49:26,916 --> 01:49:29,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, I'm Rob Caputi of 71 Evans Street.

1404
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:34,663
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing this up.

1405
01:49:36,144 --> 01:49:41,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say, I mean, this is a very important issue to me.

1406
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:44,752
[SPEAKER_16]: What's actually going to happen

1407
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:51,325
[SPEAKER_16]: with this tax and all the other taxes is the businesses in residence, they're not going to pay it.

1408
01:49:51,345 --> 01:49:56,969
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to pass these costs along to people that rent, to people that buy goods and services.

1409
01:49:57,650 --> 01:50:03,375
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I've been sitting in these subcommittee meetings that this honorable body has been having on the budget.

1410
01:50:04,102 --> 01:50:16,689
[SPEAKER_16]: And to see an issue like this come, and then to hear different department heads, like the chief of police talking about he asked for five new police officers, and that was denied.

1411
01:50:19,591 --> 01:50:27,698
[SPEAKER_16]: It's explained off that they're going to be hiring civil dispatchers, and that will bring in more police.

1412
01:50:27,818 --> 01:50:31,461
[SPEAKER_16]: But in actuality, that's not really going to bring in more police.

1413
01:50:31,761 --> 01:50:44,131
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's just very confusing and frustrating to the citizens who are seeing things like my street, Evans Street, and all the infrastructure repairs that are needed across the city.

1414
01:50:46,253 --> 01:51:12,515
[SPEAKER_16]: to see other ways of bringing money into the city rather than, you know, direct tax or new connectivity fees, to look at the budget that's being proposed here, to see only $97,000, I think the figure is for the Chevalier Theatre, that could be bringing in so much more money, an increase to the investment, to that treasure of a theatre where we could actually,

1415
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:36,357
[SPEAKER_16]: bring in enough money by bringing in bigger names with more investment to that almost 2,000 seat theater to see the increase in sales and whatnot to our downtown business district that's being crippled by the Craddock Bridge repair, and then use that money to actually really reduce water rates and property rates.

1416
01:51:37,338 --> 01:51:40,942
[SPEAKER_16]: and so many other things.

1417
01:51:41,282 --> 01:51:45,968
[SPEAKER_16]: $1,200,000 taken in by the Community Preservation Act.

1418
01:51:46,568 --> 01:51:53,576
[SPEAKER_16]: To see that when we know we have surpluses in other areas, I mean, to me, that's money taken out of the economy.

1419
01:51:54,537 --> 01:51:55,378
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going away from

1420
01:51:55,919 --> 01:52:05,203
[SPEAKER_16]: from people being able to pay a better rent in Medford or a better mortgage or better prices for goods and services.

1421
01:52:06,223 --> 01:52:07,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Mr. Penter is right.

1422
01:52:08,044 --> 01:52:16,507
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this body should stand up on this and sit down with the mayor in the subcommittee meetings that I've been going to.

1423
01:52:17,848 --> 01:52:23,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes department heads coming without full facts on each decimal point.

1424
01:52:25,055 --> 01:52:27,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes department heads not even be in there.

1425
01:52:27,456 --> 01:52:32,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes the Hormel commission department wasn't there on Saturday morning, I believe it was.

1426
01:52:34,697 --> 01:52:39,878
[SPEAKER_16]: And then wondering why is there a Hormel commission in a park commission?

1427
01:52:40,058 --> 01:52:43,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Why isn't that one commission?

1428
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:47,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I am wondering about that.

1429
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:58,531
[SPEAKER_17]: With the land transfer, when the city accepted ownership of Hormel Stadium, the establishment of the Hormel Commission was statutory and is required by state law.

1430
01:52:58,571 --> 01:53:00,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that explains that.

1431
01:53:00,613 --> 01:53:17,347
[SPEAKER_16]: But why can't, through maybe Hormel petition, we combine the two, like we've done in other things, like Councilor Marks brought up on Saturday morning at the subcommittee meeting, different ways that this body has brought other

1432
01:53:18,505 --> 01:53:22,809
[SPEAKER_16]: like the Traffic Commission, I think it was, and the Off-Street Parking Commission into one.

1433
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:26,473
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm hoping to see more of when I go to these subcommittee meetings.

1434
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:32,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Streamlining government, making it smaller, more responsible, more effective, more transparent and accountable.

1435
01:53:35,379 --> 01:53:41,380
[SPEAKER_16]: To see all these dollar amounts, too, that are coming in for $450,000 that was budgeted for 2017.

1436
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:42,880
[SPEAKER_16]: They only spent $420,000.

1437
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,361
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what happens to that other $30,000?

1438
01:53:45,561 --> 01:53:52,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it just gets rolled over into the general fund and not being applied to next year's spending.

1439
01:53:55,163 --> 01:53:56,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1440
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Continue.

1441
01:53:59,143 --> 01:54:00,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a point of information to be made?

1442
01:54:01,064 --> 01:54:02,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1443
01:54:02,665 --> 01:54:04,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1444
01:54:05,127 --> 01:54:10,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say that, you know, I mean, you guys are very smart and intelligent people.

1445
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:13,292
[SPEAKER_16]: You see what's going on.

1446
01:54:14,033 --> 01:54:24,539
[SPEAKER_16]: $167 million being proposed to spend this year, but not in areas where we could actually bring in more money and provide better rates on all sorts of taxes to the citizens.

1447
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:28,602
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a shame and it's disconcerting, and I hope

1448
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:32,392
[SPEAKER_16]: that the public is watching during this election year.

1449
01:54:32,512 --> 01:54:33,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1450
01:54:34,433 --> 01:54:34,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1451
01:54:37,634 --> 01:54:38,835
[SPEAKER_14]: May I have an address to the record, please?

1452
01:54:39,895 --> 01:54:42,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Cushman Street and Abbott Street.

1453
01:54:43,077 --> 01:54:55,283
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same location today, June 13th, 2017, that the big city neglected infested tree had fallen down an hour and a half ago all around my house.

1454
01:54:58,265 --> 01:54:58,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Again,

1455
01:54:59,398 --> 01:55:02,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to repeat myself, I've said it before, I'm not that smart.

1456
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to BU once, it was closed.

1457
01:55:05,622 --> 01:55:06,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going back either.

1458
01:55:07,123 --> 01:55:08,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just not going to go back.

1459
01:55:08,664 --> 01:55:09,564
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to go there.

1460
01:55:10,805 --> 01:55:20,932
[SPEAKER_14]: However, on this connectivity fee, I like to call it, we're already connected to the grid of H2O and the storage going out.

1461
01:55:23,273 --> 01:55:27,756
[SPEAKER_14]: So I kind of understand how you'd want to charge for that.

1462
01:55:28,747 --> 01:55:32,909
[SPEAKER_14]: unless you're doing a new Marauder development and you're putting new pipes in.

1463
01:55:32,949 --> 01:55:34,429
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes sense to me.

1464
01:55:34,449 --> 01:55:38,771
[SPEAKER_14]: You might even charge a thousand, whatever it costs, depending on what the contractor is going to make.

1465
01:55:39,491 --> 01:55:47,854
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as the shape, whatever they call that, that fee that they try to charge contractors at times, if they want to develop.

1466
01:55:49,515 --> 01:55:58,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking out loud, so to speak, I'm wondering if the connectivity fee is a way to generate a base

1467
01:56:00,778 --> 01:56:11,941
[SPEAKER_14]: such as when Representative Congressman Markey, I believe, an example next door in Malden, I believe, lived in Malden, he said, when he was a congressman.

1468
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:18,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure if that water meter was running when he supposedly lived there.

1469
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:24,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now Senator Markey, I guess, would still get a

1470
01:56:27,995 --> 01:56:31,918
[SPEAKER_14]: connectivity fee, a base rate.

1471
01:56:32,659 --> 01:56:37,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't use any gas on my electric on the second floor, because I have an empty apartment.

1472
01:56:38,944 --> 01:56:42,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So the bill should be zero, you would think, but it's not zero.

1473
01:56:43,047 --> 01:56:52,094
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some sort of basic charge on the electric, and as Penta would say, the other conglomerate, for the gas.

1474
01:56:54,563 --> 01:57:05,868
[SPEAKER_14]: With eight and a half million dollars of overcharged money out of our rate payers' money, water bills, you know, it's like 1,200 bucks a year on an average, I'm guesstimating.

1475
01:57:08,389 --> 01:57:11,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do you want to shake down the lower middle class especially?

1476
01:57:11,551 --> 01:57:12,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a break, please.

1477
01:57:14,252 --> 01:57:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1478
01:57:14,632 --> 01:57:17,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1479
01:57:17,914 --> 01:57:19,555
[SPEAKER_08]: G. Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

1480
01:57:20,755 --> 01:57:22,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So having listened tonight,

1481
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:29,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I was unable to attend the last meeting where this topic was discussed, so I'm happy to hear it again and become more familiar with it.

1482
01:57:31,592 --> 01:57:45,094
[SPEAKER_08]: As I sit here and I ponder this, I think about the fact that there are many people who live in the city of Medford that work two jobs to be able to afford the homes they have, and they're strapped, and things are tight for them.

1483
01:57:45,794 --> 01:57:51,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think of our elderly community, which is a high number of people in the city of Medford

1484
01:57:51,452 --> 01:58:01,057
[SPEAKER_08]: more than some other cities, and how they might be on fixed incomes, and others who maybe use water less as a method to help save money.

1485
01:58:01,938 --> 01:58:06,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's decisions like these, $60 for water connectivity, $100 some odd for CPA,

1486
01:58:10,814 --> 01:58:13,075
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really death by paper cut for these people.

1487
01:58:13,615 --> 01:58:18,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incremental and repetitive, and it cuts deeply over time.

1488
01:58:19,097 --> 01:58:33,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's decisions and choices like this that create a tipping point that force these people out of our city and make them move someplace else, a city that has historically been made up of people who are hardworking individuals.

1489
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:38,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And it troubles me greatly that I continue to see this gentrification going on.

1490
01:58:38,722 --> 01:58:40,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really would urge you to consider

1491
01:58:41,468 --> 01:58:47,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, maybe some type of tiered approach, especially for those folks who maybe are just making ends meet.

1492
01:58:48,171 --> 01:58:54,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because some of us can handle it, but there are others in, in our community that cannot.

1493
01:58:54,734 --> 01:58:58,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I just would like to raise that point because it makes them vulnerable.

1494
01:58:59,316 --> 01:59:05,999
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes them vulnerable to the loss of their property and it makes them vulnerable to opportunistic developers.

1495
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:06,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1496
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:07,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1497
01:59:09,043 --> 01:59:10,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1498
01:59:10,804 --> 01:59:12,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1499
01:59:13,327 --> 01:59:17,050
[SPEAKER_17]: My experiences with the members of the Water and Sewer Commission have been nothing but positive.

1500
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:27,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that they're a great group of individuals, and if given the opportunity to explain themselves and explain the connectivity, if you will do so in a fashion that will make people a little bit more understanding of their implementation and their reasoning behind it.

1501
01:59:28,499 --> 01:59:37,286
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, Mr. President, on the community calendar this evening, it's posted that the next Water and Sewer Commission meeting is on 6-28 at 5 p.m.

1502
01:59:37,306 --> 01:59:38,107
[SPEAKER_17]: in the council chambers.

1503
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:47,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So those individuals that do have questions and concerns about the connectivity field, the baseline charges, as it's called, can appear before the commission and take those issues up that evening.

1504
01:59:47,214 --> 01:59:51,196
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be in this room, and it's my understanding it may be televised, but I'm not sure.

1505
01:59:52,417 --> 01:59:54,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that information, Councilor Knight.

1506
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:01,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1507
02:00:02,062 --> 02:00:03,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1508
02:00:04,022 --> 02:00:04,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1509
02:00:05,563 --> 02:00:06,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1510
02:00:07,896 --> 02:00:10,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Records of the meeting of June 6th.

1511
02:00:12,018 --> 02:00:12,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks.

1512
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:20,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you read the records, this past Thursday, we had a groundbreaking in the city of Method.

1513
02:00:21,623 --> 02:00:26,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, Council President Caviello, and Council Member Kern were present.

1514
02:00:27,467 --> 02:00:33,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a groundbreaking, Mr. President, for the first ever dog park in this community.

1515
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:37,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to personally thank Mr. President

1516
02:00:38,224 --> 02:00:39,585
[SPEAKER_02]: the Paws for Method group.

1517
02:00:40,545 --> 02:00:45,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Here was a group of five or six citizens that had a common cause.

1518
02:00:46,307 --> 02:01:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: One night, two and a half years ago, they got together and decided that it would be nice to have a full-fledged dog park in the community, one in which dogs can exercise, socialize, and they felt there was a need, Mr. President,

1519
02:01:02,764 --> 02:01:05,585
[SPEAKER_02]: They never once approached the city administration.

1520
02:01:06,225 --> 02:01:07,265
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out on their own.

1521
02:01:07,785 --> 02:01:14,026
[SPEAKER_02]: They found $250,000 in grant money from the Stanton Foundation.

1522
02:01:14,686 --> 02:01:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out on their own, Mr. President, and found a consultant that does dog park design and design parks in Somerville and Arlington and met with this particular consultant and started the ball rolling, Mr. President.

1523
02:01:30,489 --> 02:01:46,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And this past Thursday, after two and a half years of fundraising, dog washes, the Meffitt Day where they had raffle prizes and come and bring your dog to a picnic and so forth, I'm proud to say, Mr. President, as part of

1524
02:01:47,571 --> 02:01:56,776
[SPEAKER_02]: pause for method that we will have a full-fledged park in our community, one with a small dog and large dogs.

1525
02:01:57,997 --> 02:02:05,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have a full irrigation system, lighting, exercise and obstacle course for the animals.

1526
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:10,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is truly, you know,

1527
02:02:11,594 --> 02:02:20,296
[SPEAKER_02]: when people say you can't fight city hall, you can't get things done, this was truly a groundswell of just residents getting together and moving a very important issue.

1528
02:02:20,976 --> 02:02:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe last year, Mr. Clerk, correct me if I'm wrong, we licensed about 350 dogs, about 400 dogs in the city.

1529
02:02:29,979 --> 02:02:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We estimate through doing some of our own homework

1530
02:02:35,632 --> 02:02:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's over 7,000 dogs that reside in this community.

1531
02:02:41,066 --> 02:02:43,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a need for the park, Mr. President.

1532
02:02:44,965 --> 02:02:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the committee members, Jim Silva, Patty Flynn, Gary DiStefano, Diane Gittner, and John Sardone, who, like I said, spent countless hours, still spending countless hours, in putting this together.

1533
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:10,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the McGlynn administration, who actually heard about it, and got interested, and saw that this group was a working group and wanted to accomplish something.

1534
02:03:10,933 --> 02:03:17,777
[SPEAKER_02]: and came on board, and then Mayor Burke followed through on her and Mr. President, along with Delicia Hunt.

1535
02:03:17,797 --> 02:03:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to thank this group of citizens, and I'm proud that we will have our first park.

1536
02:03:25,903 --> 02:03:32,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be located in between the Andrews and the McGlynn School, along Riverbend Park.

1537
02:03:33,267 --> 02:03:37,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, it's going to be a state-of-the-art park, and something I think we can all be proud of.

1538
02:03:38,487 --> 02:03:46,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and you should be commended for being up front of this a couple years ago, and we thank you for your hard work also, Mr. Vice President.

1539
02:03:47,190 --> 02:03:48,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

1540
02:03:48,191 --> 02:03:49,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1541
02:03:49,391 --> 02:03:50,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say the same thing.

1542
02:03:50,772 --> 02:03:52,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks took the lead on this.

1543
02:03:52,892 --> 02:04:05,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it was a couple years ago, got the support of the council and support of the two mayors, and I too wanna just thank, also thank the committee that has worked tirelessly to raise the funds and make it

1544
02:04:05,962 --> 02:04:13,025
[SPEAKER_11]: a reality, so I look forward to, and many residents, especially those with dogs, look forward to this opening, and great job.

1545
02:04:13,626 --> 02:04:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1546
02:04:15,347 --> 02:04:21,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Records of the meeting of June 6th were passed to Vice President Mox.

1547
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:23,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?

1548
02:04:23,971 --> 02:04:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't have enough time to look at them, so I'm gonna ask that you give me those records.

1549
02:04:32,175 --> 02:04:34,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion that by Vice President Mox that we table the records

1550
02:04:34,829 --> 02:04:37,351
[SPEAKER_03]: until next week, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1551
02:04:37,731 --> 02:04:38,412
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1552
02:04:38,652 --> 02:04:38,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.
