1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,896
Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:06,356
The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:06,416
Ms.

4
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:07,296
Cuno.

5
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:07,416
Here.

6
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:08,657
Ms.

00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:08,837
Rendell.

8
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:09,857
Present.

9
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:09,937
Ms.

10
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:10,457
Braxton.

11
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:10,577
Here.

12
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:11,177
Ms.

13
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:11,377
Stone.

14
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:11,477
Here.

15
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:11,677
Ms.

16
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:11,817
Sherry.

17
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:12,037
Present.

18
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:12,097
Ms.

19
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:14,038
Vanden Heuvel.

20
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:14,198
Here.

21
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:14,258
Ms.

22
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:14,418
Haverly.

23
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:14,878
Present.

24
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,098
Seven present, none absent.

25
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,619
All please rise and salute our flag.

26
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:29,502
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

27
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:33,898
Approval of the minutes of September 12, 2016.

28
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:34,798
Ms.

29
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:36,438
Van de Kloet.

30
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:38,759
Motion for approval by Ms.

31
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:41,480

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,521
All those in favor?

33
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,001
All those opposed?

34
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:45,422
Minutes are approved.

35
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,083
Approval of bills transfer of funds.

36
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,204
Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

37
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:52,685
Cuno.

38
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:53,625
All those in favor?

39
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,165
All those opposed?

40
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,586
Approval is granted.

41
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,027
Approval of payrolls.

42
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,920
Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

43
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,400
Cuno.

44
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,220
All in favor?

45
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,300
Aye.

46
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,761
All opposed?

47
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,241
Approval is granted.

48
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,942
Report of the secretary.

49
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:10,562
None?

50
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:12,523
Report of committees.

51
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,143
Committee of the Whole Minutes, September 12, 2016.

52
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:21,386
There's a motion for approval of the Committee of the Whole Minutes from September 12.

53
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,486
Is there a second?

54
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:26,707
Seconded by Ms.

55
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:27,067
Koretz.

56
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:28,728
Mr. Benedetto.

57
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:33,286
So at that time, we visited the McGlynn School.

58
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:37,169
And I was wondering if we had any dates set to visit any of the other schools.

59
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,331
We will be setting some dates next week.

60
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,773
I'll be in touch with each of you to try and coordinate an evening.

61
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:43,354
OK.

62
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:43,914
Thank you.

63
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:44,575
You're welcome.

64
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,778
Community participation.

65
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,460
Cheryl Rodriguez, Roberts School.

66
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:55,724
Name and address, please.

67
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,404
Hi.

68
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,585
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

69
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,027
My address is 281 Park Street.

70
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:06,601
I prepared a statement because I want to make sure that I get everything that I want to say.

71
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,224
So my daughter is a third grade student at the Roberts Elementary.

72
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:12,145
I'm an active parent at that school.

73
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:16,348
I appeared before this body in the spring to request funds for our mosaic mural.

74
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:21,992
I helped run some of the enrichment nights at the school and the after school enrichment program for the PTO.

75
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,334
So I'm very invested in the school.

76
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:29,598
At the last school committee meeting, there were questions about the classes at the Roberts.

77
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:37,965
And a comment was made that Mr. Johnson distributed his special needs students differently than other schools and no one knew why.

78
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:43,429
So I wanted to explain a little bit and ask for some help from this group.

79
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,913
The Roberts Elementary has the highest enrollment of all the elementary schools in our city.

80
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:54,879
It also houses the welcome program for the English language learners, meaning those with no English skills, and our autism program.

81
00:02:55,838 --> 00:03:02,842
These are two very large programs, 92 and 75, respectively, as of September 16th, but these numbers are constantly changing.

82
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,484
To put that into perspective, it is divided equally by grade.

83
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:11,586
We would have 15.3 ELL students per grade and 12.5 autistic children per grade, so 17% ELL and 14% autistic.

84
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,647
We also have 51% low income.

85
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:28,964
On September 9th, our total population was reported at 547, but as of September 16th, it had already climbed to 555 and is perhaps even higher now.

86
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,087
Conversely, the Brooks Elementary has 449.

87
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:42,895
It was noted at the last meeting that the two middle schools, the one that housed the ELL population was deliberately kept smaller as new students enter the program constantly.

88
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:47,979
The same is true at the Roberts, but we do not have the buffer of being the smallest elementary school with the largest.

89
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:57,311
Our ELL students are taken out of class to receive specialized services to help them to learn English, so they are grouped in the same class in order to accommodate scheduling.

90
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:04,053
Imagine trying to keep five third grade classes on identical schedules to pull ELL students out of each one.

91
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:10,362
Our higher needs autism students are also placed together because some of them share an aid.

92
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:16,106
It was made pretty clear at budget time that there's no appetite on this committee to have an aid in each class.

93
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,129
I do think that this process needs a deeper look.

94
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,452
My daughter has found herself in the autism inclusion class this year.

95
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:28,556
I understand that there are some in the other classes, but there are higher needs students in her class.

96
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,599
The children at the Roberts are the most empathetic children that you will ever meet.

97
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:39,020
But the things my daughter has been exposed to since school started at this class has given me pause.

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,021
Something must be done for these children.

99
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:51,185
The teacher and aide in this class have been hit, furniture has been thrown, the classroom has been evacuated, and children have been physically restrained on almost a daily basis.

100
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,366
Who is benefiting from this?

101
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:58,028
Not the special needs children forced into a mainstream setting that is clearly overwhelming,

102
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,482
not the quote standard students who are witnessing these events.

103
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:07,487
None of them are receiving an appropriate education as all learning must cease when one of these episodes begin.

104
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:13,872
But when I tried to discuss the wild stories that my child was coming home with, I hit a wall of privacy issues.

105
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:21,799
If my child, any child, is being exposed to incidences that are traumatic and are violent in nature, the parents need to be notified.

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,122
Parents should not hear these stories from their children.

107
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:27,874
and hear nothing from the school.

108
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,098
We want to help our children to process what is happening.

109
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,081
We are empathetic to all of the children.

110
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,564
All of the children in this situation need help.

111
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,488
Is this unique to my child's class?

112
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:39,689
I think no.

113
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,232
Is this an appropriate setting for any of these children?

114
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:43,614
Absolutely no.

115
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,093
It is time that we stop acting as if the population of the Roberts as the same as at the other schools.

116
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:55,356
Our school houses two high needs groups and the largest child population in the city.

117
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,298
One of these programs should be shifted to a school with a lower population.

118
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:08,756
If our class sizes were closer to the 15 to 16 mark that some of the elementary schools have, we would be able to have smaller classes for our autistic population.

119
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:15,022
We could easily bring their class size down to 8 to 10 with no negative impact on any other classes.

120
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:19,607
But as it stands, in order to try and bring a second grade class total

121
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:27,856
Down from the 22 average for the autism emerging class, we were forced to have one class have a total of 24 students.

122
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:32,100
As a comparison, the second grade class at the Brooks has an average of 17.25.

123
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:39,206
My daughter is in grade three, which has five classrooms and an average class size of 19.8.

124
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:45,612
Across town, the Brooks has four third grade classes with an average class size of 17.5.

125
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:57,267
This population difference will only intensify when some of the 800 plus units permanent or under construction for the Roberts and McGlynn Elementary School begin to hold residents.

126
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:00,510
The needs of all the children need to be considered.

127
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,871
I care about all of them.

128
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,272
I work with them.

129
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:09,958
So I'm floored by the natural and easy way that they take care of each other and I'm asking the school department to step in and help them.

130
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:17,973
My own daughter is suffering greatly as a result of her exposure in these classes, and I'm still finding out what she's witnessed in small pieces.

131
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:28,618
She's confided in my parents, in the parents of some of her friends, and some in my husband and I. The first thing she told me was that she was worried for the children that were having the incidents.

132
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,140
The second thing she told me was that she was afraid.

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,661
No child should be afraid to go to school.

134
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:40,550
Upon hearing that, I started a crusade to help my child and the other children in her class or classes like hers.

135
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,051
I spoke to the teacher who directed me to the principal.

136
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:53,977
I spoke to the principal, and other than the incident that required a student to leave by ambulance, he had heard of no other incidences, nor had the school department, nor the special needs department.

137
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:55,014
Why?

138
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,556
I suspect it is because nothing will come of reporting it.

139
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,239
But despite my reporting it, nothing has come of it yet.

140
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:12,885
The adjustment counselor at the school has not even spoken to the children about the incident that was reported and happened a week ago, an incident that required an ambulance to remove a student from the school.

141
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,647
The parents have not been notified.

142
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,308
What is the protocol?

143
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:21,031
What measures are in place to help these autistic children who are suffering or the other students?

144
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:24,492
My daughter is refusing to go back into that classroom.

145
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,493
We have been attempting to help her cope with what she has witnessed almost daily.

146
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:30,894
She has been having migraine headaches.

147
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:32,334
She's extremely anxious.

148
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:36,495
This weekend, she had a panic attack, thinking about having to go back to class.

149
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:46,839
She reports that her teachers have assured her that they will keep the children safe, and they neither need to worry nor be afraid because they will worry and be afraid for them.

150
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,060
My daughter's takeaway from that statement is that the incidents will continue.

151
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,968
that there will still be danger and that she's just supposed to ignore it.

152
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:57,368
So please help us.

153
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:01,329
I understand that there's privacy issues, but something has to be done.

154
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,990
The teachers and Mr. Johnson are doing the best that they can with the tools available to them.

155
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,470
They need more tools.

156
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,971
They need a smaller population so they can adjust class sizes to accommodate the high needs of our children.

157
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:18,392
We can't only worry about my one child, but I am worried about my child.

158
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,456
We need to worry about all of the children.

159
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:22,817
The needs of all the children are not identical.

160
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:26,578
Thanks.

161
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:27,259
Thank you.

162
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,580
Mr. Superintendent.

163
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,742
So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.

164
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,703
We went over all these things.

165
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,743
We've prepared some materials for you.

166
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:45,526
I'm going to call upon our special needs director and our assistant for elementary education to speak to the issues.

167
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,147
There is a lot going on.

168
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,064
There's a lot going on of response.

169
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,485
Occasionally, in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.

170
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:59,267
The year starts, some youngsters express themselves, and then we respond to it.

171
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:08,529
When information comes to us, that classroom's been visited multiple times by both Diane and by Kathy, and there's some plans in place.

172
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,790
So I don't believe it's undoable.

173
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,891
I believe the Roberts does have some population issues, but so don't the other schools.

174
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,052
If you're at the Columbus, you have the therapeutic learning program.

175
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,654
At other schools, you have other programs that are there.

176
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:25,015
Some years, the Brooks has had more people than the Roberts.

177
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,355
In some years, the McGlynn has had more people than the Roberts.

178
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:30,496
Population shifts are by geography to some degree.

179
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:39,898
But having said that, let me ask Diane and Kathy to come up and talk a little bit about the specifics that Mrs. Rodriguez has raised.

180
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,839
And I want to make it very clear, we're very concerned when things happen.

181
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,539
We're not unconcerned.

182
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,160
That's not a fair assessment of what goes on.

183
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:49,756
but let them speak.

184
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:51,757
Good evening.

185
00:10:52,597 --> 00:11:04,239
So I prepared a quick report for you to read just to let you know about the incidences that did happen at the Roberts Elementary School in that particular third grade classroom.

186
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,680
We do have some children who are special needs children and some ELL students in that classroom.

187
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:17,422
Two students that we are aware of exhibited loud and aggressive behaviors.

188
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:21,804
that required interventions through the safety care support team.

189
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:30,507
Neither of the students that we are discussing who had these incidences are special education students, and I think I need to make that clear.

190
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:38,650
Prior to the start of school, staff were not aware of any factors that would have helped them anticipate the behaviors of these students.

191
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:47,633
Both of them are linked to community supports, and staff is working to obtain information to expedite an educational evaluation.

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:55,374
The third grade teacher has been working very closely with the safety care team to address the needs of these children.

193
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:05,621
Mr. Johnson reviewed the school year mandates during the first weeks of school, such as he discussed de-escalation strategies and staying calm.

194
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:12,565
When the high intensity behaviors occurred in this classroom, students were evacuated

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,764
to the safety care team so that the safety care team could triage the situation.

196
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:27,230
The evacuations framed as academic movement opportunities for the children in the building, in that classroom.

197
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,974
More intensive incidences were not witnessed by the children, to my knowledge.

198
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:37,935
The Roberts School does have a lot of support in their building.

199
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,737
They have 19 safety care trained staff.

200
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:50,780
They have a full-time BCBA, a .5 school psychologist, and there's a full-time school adjustment counselor as well in the building.

201
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,842
We do need to respect the privacy of the students.

202
00:12:55,382 --> 00:13:02,445
We understand that this can be disruptive to the class, and we know that it can lead to disrupting the learning process.

203
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:22,984
After speaking with the teacher, and I have been down to the Roberts School three times since the very first incident, she has assured me that she is on par with whatever she's teaching in English, literacy, math, and reading, and she does give her children homework.

204
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:27,452
We are organizing the following procedures for these children.

205
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,333
We're conducting risk threat assessments.

206
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:35,154
We will perform full evaluations of the students.

207
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:40,595
We're looking at creating an abbreviated schedules when the students return.

208
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,956
We will discuss and meet with community organizations.

209
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,077
We will meet with the parents.

210
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:50,138
And we will provide additional support

211
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,011
in that classroom if need be.

212
00:13:53,871 --> 00:14:03,135
I think Mrs. Rodriguez knows me especially well enough to know that we will get things in place as soon as possible.

213
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:15,841
The teachers, the support staff, the assistant principal and the principal along with Kathy and I have been working diligently since we found out the information.

214
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,822
Safety is something that

215
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:25,899
we definitely is first and foremost because children can't learn unless they feel safe in a classroom.

216
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,862
Um, I've discussed this with miss Rodriguez and she knows now that the plan is in place to move forward.

217
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:43,486
Kathy, is that, um, yeah, so I just like to mention around the enrollment of special education students at the Roberts is consistent with other buildings.

218
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,467
And in fact, a couple of the other buildings are a little bit higher.

219
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:55,893
I believe the McGlynn has a few more students than over at the Roberts, but it is consistent across all of the schools, all of the elementary schools.

220
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:00,259
Ms.

221
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:00,639
Cuno.

222
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:01,920
Thank you.

223
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Thank you, Ms.

224
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,041
Rodriguez, to inform us of this situation.

225
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:22,546
I guess one of the questions I have is that I appreciate everybody doing this diligently the minute you found out about it, but I guess what goes back to me is the fact of if we have children, whether or not they were in the vicinity or not, rumors start.

226
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:26,607
One story, you know, is a domino effect and becomes a larger story.

227
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:49,564
So I guess for me is why weren't parents informed of not necessarily giving out the information because of confidentiality and things like that, but if the students were talking about this incident that occurred and then they went home and they were telling their parents, why wasn't something like at least sent out saying, you know, we understand what happened.

228
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:50,925
This is what happened.

229
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,066
It's not this story.

230
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,227
It's not that story.

231
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:57,244
It didn't get into a larger scenario.

232
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:08,430
And I think maybe parents would have been a little bit more confident in the fact that they say, okay, the administration knows about it, the kids are talking about it, but let's see what the story is.

233
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,911
And I guess that's my biggest concern.

234
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:17,695
And I know in the past when things have happened, and even though everybody's been really diligent about putting a plan together,

235
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,543
It's at that moment that at least we hope that something goes out from the school saying we're very much aware what happened.

236
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:35,149
And maybe even in that letter saying if there's a child who's having a hard time really understanding what's happening, send them and we'll speak to them.

237
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:44,433
Have one of the counselors speak to them on a one-to-one or something like that just to know that there's the help out there while everything is being placed in a process.

238
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,155
And I guess that's really my concern.

239
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:55,401
Anybody who knows us is always talking about the most important thing, whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, is to make sure that we're all on the same page.

240
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:59,570
And that has to come from the top all the way to the bottom, including parents and students.

241
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:07,053
And students, especially if they're afraid and they hear something, even though they weren't there, are going to go home.

242
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:10,034
And the story is going to change.

243
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:13,215
I'm not saying that the child, by any means, is lying or anything like that.

244
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,817
But they're in their panic mode, and their emotions are high.

245
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,958
So I guess that is my concern.

246
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:21,939
I guess the other concern is that, again,

247
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:23,828
I appreciate Ms.

248
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:37,799
Rodriguez coming and giving us the breakdown, but as a school committee member, I would like to have Mr. Johnson come and speak to us and let us know what's going on in the school with the numbers, what he, you know, what he has planned.

249
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,762
And again, this has nothing in reflection to Mr. Johnson.

250
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:45,886
It's just that he is the principal and we need to get the information from him.

251
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:51,230
We can certainly invite Mr. Johnson to the next school committee meeting if you would like that.

252
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,123
And to answer your question, I agree with you.

253
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:59,628
I think that maybe something should have gone out to parents so that they were aware.

254
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,670
I had this discussion with Ms.

255
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:14,442
Rodriguez this evening, or even to have someone go into the classroom to talk to the children who are clearly upset by something that might have happened and wondering themselves what's going on.

256
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:17,123
Ms.

257
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:17,643
Vander Kloot.

258
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:25,108
I share my colleague's concern about the lack of notification to the parents to let them know what had occurred at school that day.

259
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:28,010
I have to tell you that I still feel like I'm a little bit in the dark.

260
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,993
I understand we very much want to protect the privacy of the students, but just a clarifying question.

261
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,396
Am I to understand were these two students fighting with each other?

262
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:37,456
No.

263
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:38,717
No.

264
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:45,141
It was a situation where there were two different students who experienced

265
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:52,878
significant dysregulation during class time, which resulted in a call to the safety care team.

266
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,379
So on different days.

267
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,339
And they both happened to be in the same classroom.

268
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,881
They both just happened to be in the same room, just random placement.

269
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:03,401
And it happened multiple times.

270
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,622
So it felt magnified.

271
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,723
And I do want to also just mention just a slight correction.

272
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:14,785
When we spoke with the teacher, and we spoke with Mr. Johnson, and all the other staff at the school,

273
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:21,934
They said none of the students have been restrained because I know there was a mention earlier about restraint.

274
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:29,276
So the level of disruption didn't call for that level of intervention.

275
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:35,958
So it was settling things down, counseling, providing whatever support needed to be provided.

276
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:46,966
Did the students on these occasions hit either their classmates or was there any physical?

277
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:51,910
No, but I do believe there was a situation where she was thrown.

278
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:58,176
I'm afraid to give too much information, I guess.

279
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:07,723
So I also heard a mention of, and I know we had gotten a call about a student being taken out to the hospital.

280
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:16,710
Was that one of these students who was taken out because this is what was deemed to be needed to, were they physically?

281
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:28,279
So typically when, um, if a student becomes very upset and it's become obvious that the teacher or the classroom staff will have or having difficulty settling

282
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,052
a situation they call for what's called the safety care team.

283
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:35,515
So each of our buildings has a team whose job it is.

284
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,597
So they have other responsibilities within the building.

285
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:46,083
But when something like this occurs, they come to the aid of their colleagues and they provide additional support to students.

286
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:57,272
In many of those occasions, the school nurse is also involved in the triage of what the student's medical presentation and status is.

287
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,986
So occasionally I suppose it could result in a transport.

288
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:03,468
Okay.

289
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,209
But in this case there was a transport.

290
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:18,280
So if I had a child in this class, I would have to say that I'd be very concerned because now they've witnessed two different kids have multiple incidents and would probably be concerned that my child would be thinking, what's next?

291
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:24,766
And I'm wondering, again, I realize how dicey it is around confidentiality, but

292
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,022
have people gone in and talked to the kids?

293
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,084
Have there been any small groups talking to the kids?

294
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:33,946
It sounded like these kids are going to return to the classroom.

295
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:39,230
And, you know, as a parent, I can certainly understand why Ms.

296
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,573
Rodriguez would be concerned about what the plan going forth is.

297
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:53,141
So, yes, it was suggested that somebody go in and speak to the children, probably tomorrow, the adjustment counselor.

298
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:54,302
Okay.

299
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,107
So that's going to happen.

300
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:03,473
And have both kids been out, or are they both going to be returning at the same time, or do we have any?

301
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:10,199
Both children are out right now, but we expect that they will be returning at some point this week.

302
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:13,662
OK.

303
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:35,578
So I think the communication issue is key, and I hear you not being particularly definitive, and I understand why, but understanding how this is going to be resolved so that the kids aren't so fearful.

304
00:22:36,178 --> 00:22:36,338
Ms.

305
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:43,121
Rodriguez speaks about her own daughter, but I can flash back and understand

306
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,665
what it was like to be a parent when something happened in a classroom and know that kids do carry it with them sometimes.

307
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,747
And some kids carry it a lot more than others.

308
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,208
And we have to worry about them.

309
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:55,429
So I am a little concerned.

310
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,150
Actually, I'm a lot concerned.

311
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:57,951
And I understand that.

312
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,232
And I agree.

313
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:08,258
I think that also adults in their effort to protect confidentiality and other just privacy needs,

314
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:16,630
sometimes leave children with an incomplete story, so they fill in the blanks too.

315
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,693
So I agree that that's something that needs to be done.

316
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:26,857
The teacher has been extremely supportive when I talked to the teacher today.

317
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:32,340
She told me how she supported the children and talked to them.

318
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:37,137
and how she would keep them safe and that type of thing.

319
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:40,178
So she's a very empathetic, compassionate woman.

320
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:45,340
So I think she'll work with the kids as well as a school adjustment counselor.

321
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:50,221
Mr. Benedetto.

322
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:51,862
Thank you very much.

323
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:56,603
I'm actually a safety care trainer as well at my school.

324
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:04,006
So I know a lot of it is de-escalation in removing the audience or the other children.

325
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:09,455
so that way they aren't traumatized as well as the person who's acting out.

326
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:25,264
And I know that Memphis Public Schools uses that, and I'm sure that they had the children move, but I'm sure, as you stated, that your child probably witnessed stuff that made them nervous and anxious and a little afraid to go back to school.

327
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:32,848
So I know that in this report it says more intensive incidences were not witnessed,

328
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:37,897
But that's out of an adult's view of what happened.

329
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:42,579
And each individual adult will deal with different situations.

330
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,541
And it will affect them differently.

331
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,262
And the same thing happens to children.

332
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:55,105
So we're hearing from parents that their child was affected by situations happening in their classroom.

333
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:57,506
So those parents, one, have to be notified.

334
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:02,829
Two, have to have counseling services to make sure that they feel safe coming back to school.

335
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:05,206
And I'm glad that both those things are happening.

336
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:13,030
The main issue I have, and I had this issue before this incident arose, was the number of students in the classes at the Brooks School.

337
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:15,392
We talked about this when we got the graph.

338
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:17,853
And it's not about the type of children.

339
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:21,455
It's a high number for elementary school.

340
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:25,778
And I felt, I mean, I'm sorry, the Roberts School.

341
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:26,678
Sorry, I misspoke.

342
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:34,059
but the Robert schools numbers were much higher than any other elementary school when I looked at this and I brought it up.

343
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,280
At that point, it was the only school that had 24 students in any class.

344
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:48,802
And I understand that some had 21 because of how Mr. Johnson, which I know why and how he does his class allocations.

345
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,482
And I agree with how he does it.

346
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:53,303
Our job here,

347
00:25:54,197 --> 00:26:00,781
is really to make sure we're prepared to meet the needs of all the children in our care.

348
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:09,886
That means all the children, children with disabilities, any child that walks through any classroom door, it's our responsibility that they are safe.

349
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,908
That's first, that's last, that's always.

350
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,709
We're here to educate them, but we have to do that in a safe manner.

351
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:20,892
And I believe that a lower class size might help to ensure that.

352
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:33,287
So I'm gonna ask the superintendent to look at that again, not at this moment, but I want him to go back with his team and really look at what's happening in this school and the population of the needs of the children within this school.

353
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:46,472
And just look at it with clear eyes and observation and really see if this, is the programming specific for the special education students at that school?

354
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:49,193
Is there a type, you know, like I know at,

355
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:52,669
different schools, they have different populations of students.

356
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:57,272
Is there a specific population of students directed towards the Roberts?

357
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:59,193
I know the ELL students are there.

358
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:04,696
Well, each of our elementary schools house a strand of special education services.

359
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,177
Okay.

360
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,658
So the answer to that is yes.

361
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:07,518
Okay.

362
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:15,063
Um, but again, I just want to emphasize that this situation, none of the, none of the students involved were special education students.

363
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:15,864
That's good to know.

364
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,566
And the class, this particular classroom has 20 students enrolled in the classroom.

365
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,011
And we do have an additional teacher.

366
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:23,752
We made sure we had five classes.

367
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:28,354
So there is only 20 students in each of the classes.

368
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,355
And the classroom is staffed with a full-time paraprofessional.

369
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:41,300
So this was an unusual sort of situation that no one anticipated, that everyone has responded to, will continue to respond to this situation.

370
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,282
We will add additional staff if needed, and we will

371
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:56,341
address the concern regarding notification of parents and ensuring that parents know that counseling is available to their children should their children require such a support.

372
00:27:57,021 --> 00:27:57,262
Okay.

373
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:04,525
I think that's great, but I really would really rather be proactive than reactive, especially in this situation.

374
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:13,590
So, um, even a meeting a night with the superintendent to the school or to the children affected or whoever needs to be there may be warranted.

375
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:25,537
just to come and tell them what our plans are, so make sure that everybody is on the same page, and that they're notified face-to-face, and parents have a chance to voice any and all concerns.

376
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:33,400
I think hearing them might help us to develop what's best going to work, because they're the ones who are dropping off their children in our care every day.

377
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:45,410
Are there a greater number of calls for safety care team at one school more so than another?

378
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,691
Do we have those stats?

379
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:50,611
There is, but not this school.

380
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:54,652
Okay.

381
00:28:54,832 --> 00:29:04,054
Just the information so we can decide whether we need to put more funding, more staff, what we need to do, that I'm not trying to, you know,

382
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:14,822
No specifics about students, but we need to know specifics about programs and if we're allocating enough staff and money to a situation.

383
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:26,252
I really don't want to go away from here and then something else happen if that's even more involved or any, you know, situation because we didn't act.

384
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:37,428
So with that in mind, I'm asking the superintendent at this point to look at the class sizes again at the Brooks and the staffing, I mean the Roberts.

385
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:39,449
Sorry, I'm having one of those nights.

386
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:47,935
At the Roberts and really look at it with an objective eye and keeping in mind the needs of the students and the population of the students.

387
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,279
Not only their, all their needs.

388
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,140
You know, 51%

389
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:05,369
low income, how many ELL students and special needs are in each room.

390
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:10,353
I really want to see that information looked at with an objective eye.

391
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,475
And I'm sure you've looked at it once, but I'm asking you to look at it again.

392
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,157
I want to ensure the safety of all the students.

393
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:20,561
And if things need to be shifted, let's not do it because that's where we've always done it.

394
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:27,426
Let's do what's right and move things or fix things or add another class or decrease the size for this year.

395
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:43,010
If we're seeing, you know, there are trends, just like with Park or MCAS, you see one class does a little bit below one year, you look in the next year and see if they're doing a little bit below the next year, well maybe that class needs a little more academic.

396
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,713
So maybe this class needs a little bit more hands-on.

397
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:56,259
We need to look at trends and see if it will happen last year, if it's happening again this year, and look for those patterns so we can meet the needs of these students and the parents.

398
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,280
Thank you.

399
00:30:58,143 --> 00:30:58,803
Mr. Skerry.

400
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:06,488
Madam Mayor, uh, just like to say, I echo the concerns of my colleagues and knowing that the Roberts is a tight knit community.

401
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:13,152
I'm somewhat dismayed that the parents weren't contacted, you know, so that this incident could have been explained to them.

402
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:19,997
We've always worked on the premise of the home and school work in unison and we're not fulfilling our part of the bargain.

403
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:25,060
If we don't contact people in a timely manner towards what's happening, I would suggest that the, uh,

404
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:34,578
So through you to the superintendent, if possible, we could possibly have a meeting with the parents, meet with Mr. Johnson and the team to, you know, allay the fears of the children.

405
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:40,539
I don't want any child going to school, you know, under a cloud of the not knowing what's going to happen next.

406
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:44,180
And I just think would behoove us to, you know, work on this situation.

407
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,461
Although it's an isolated incident, uh, I think we should repair it as quickly as possible.

408
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:53,702
And by that, I would strongly suggest that the administration,

409
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,810
at the parents in that class, you know, in general as to what happened.

410
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:14,841
And if they or their children have any questions, they should have a person they could contact or we could have an evening where the parents that are concerned or that have fears for their children could come in and they could be dismayed because, once again, the Robertsons are a tight-knit community.

411
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:17,923
And, you know, over the weekend, we've heard two or three versions of the story.

412
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:23,027
And I would rather see one concrete piece go out to the parents to allay their fears.

413
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:29,524
So just if I can comment on that for a minute.

414
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:32,646
A situation happens.

415
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:34,887
People are responding to it.

416
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:40,950
Let's not escalate it up and get more people feeling like there's something tragic going on.

417
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,410
There isn't.

418
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:47,073
Some years, a place like the Columbus had the therapeutic learning program.

419
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,714
Some people used to call it the behavior management program.

420
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,235
And some of those youngsters had

421
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:57,510
some serious issues, and they were making noise, and some people said, well, gee, you know, we're gonna move those people.

422
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,092
We deal with it, we work with it.

423
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:01,853
We will contact parents.

424
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,373
We'll meet with people.

425
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:09,097
We'll do what we have to do to allay the fears of students, but let's not escalate it at this point in time.

426
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:10,297
Let's deal with it.

427
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:17,041
This is a situation that occurred in a single classroom at a point in time at the beginning of the year.

428
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:21,344
The two students who weren't on the radar, who aren't IEP students,

429
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:23,809
So let's find out.

430
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:25,250
We'll do the diligence.

431
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,292
We'll look at the makeup of the classes and make some recommendations.

432
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:40,117
But let's keep it calm, and let's be surgical about it, rather than try to raise and elevate concerns where they may not exist.

433
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:42,718
Some people may be more anxious than others.

434
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,139
So we'll talk to people about it.

435
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,279
We'll talk to people about it.

436
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,801
But we did meet with Mrs. Rodriguez, as she's coming to the microphone.

437
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,002
We did meet with her today.

438
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:52,062
We talked with her today.

439
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,578
We will talk to other people, but let's do it surgically.

440
00:33:55,618 --> 00:34:01,022
Let's do it, you know, directly that way rather than try to expand it.

441
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:02,924
Ms.

442
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:04,525
Mustone is next in queue.

443
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:09,509
Um, I want to thank Cheryl for being here and for bringing those numbers.

444
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:20,138
And the other part that we haven't even begun to address is the EL students, which I know my four year old takes speech therapy at the Roberts in his class that he was in last year.

445
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:23,772
was downsized because they needed that for EL students.

446
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:31,015
So I think I don't have the education on special ed law, so I don't feel comfortable talking about that piece.

447
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:43,600
But for EL students, I think at one point in our pre-budget meetings, the director of EL had said possibly moving the older grades of EL students from the Roberts to another school.

448
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,362
Because that, Cheryl, you know the numbers better than I. What was the number of EL students at the Roberts?

449
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:52,085
They said they told me the last number I heard was 92.

450
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:53,427
Right.

451
00:34:53,567 --> 00:35:01,635
So I think that's something that I feel more comfortable that something that we could work on to have the older grades of EL.

452
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:07,381
Um, I just am very uncomfortable talking about the special ed kids and their own lives.

453
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,703
So thank you.

454
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:10,023
Ms.

455
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:10,484
Van de Kloot.

456
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:12,825
to that.

457
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:21,693
The only problem with doing that is that we have ELL students then who have been at the Roberts for the younger grades, who have friendships, who are comfortable there.

458
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:22,894
And now we're, you know.

459
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:26,357
No, because then they're pulled into regular ed, so they're not in the ELL.

460
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,619
So if they came in, correct me if I'm wrong.

461
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,440
Point of information.

462
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh, sorry.

463
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:29,800
Ms.

464
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Mustone.

465
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,802
Mr. Velson, correct me if I'm wrong.

466
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:38,668
If they're in ELL in first and second grade, then they, I mean, Teagan's best friend was in ELL first and second grade, and then she was in a regular ed class.

467
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:40,089
She wasn't in the ELL program.

468
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:42,590
So then she was in the class with them third, fourth, and fifth.

469
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,875
Yeah, but they would be moved out of that comfort.

470
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:48,897
But anyway, it's almost secondary.

471
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:54,863
Mr. Superintendent, I just have to say I disagree respectfully with you a little bit.

472
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,606
I don't think that the urge here is to up it.

473
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,289
I do think that all the school committee members heard

474
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:04,952
that events happened last week and parents weren't notified.

475
00:36:05,572 --> 00:36:17,281
We're into a new week and we're looking back and parent notification when there were incidents in the classroom that were of this serious, I believe should have happened in a much more timely manner.

476
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:20,143
So because it didn't, it's harder to

477
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:27,330
feel great faith that everything will go forward in the best possible way.

478
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,072
Because for many of us, that's a stumbling block that we're hearing.

479
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,714
So I would like to make a motion.

480
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:35,974
I heard you saying you made a motion.

481
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:36,535
I didn't hear it.

482
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,016
I have three motions right now.

483
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:38,536
Three motions.

484
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:39,496
Maybe I could read them right now.

485
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:40,417
Yeah.

486
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:46,300
Mr. Benedetto, motion review the allocation of all of the students in this third grade class.

487
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,260
Ms.

488
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,602
Cuneo, that Mr. Johnson appear at the next school committee meeting to address us on this topic.

489
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:55,883
And Mr. Scarry, that Mr. Johnson and the team meet with parents ASAP.

490
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:56,803
OK.

491
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:58,424
Well, my motion must be slightly different.

492
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:01,845
I just want to make sure that this isn't falling through the cracks for us.

493
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:13,669
So I'd like to make a motion to make sure that we receive a report at our next school committee meeting and at our meeting after that so that we have some ongoing understanding of what's going on.

494
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:14,530
Very good.

495
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:15,450
Ms.

496
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:15,730
Cuneo?

497
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:20,699
Yes, I'd like to basically reiterate what my colleague Paula just said.

498
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:27,524
I don't think, with all due respect, it's not the fact that we're trying to hype it or make it into a different story.

499
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:38,152
I think it's just the fact, again, of something happening a week ago, or I don't know at this point if it was a week ago or two weeks ago, and putting myself in those shoes.

500
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:44,077
And I think that's something that we all have to think of, too, is that as we speak, we're always saying,

501
00:37:45,238 --> 00:37:49,141
special needs, and they have their confidentiality.

502
00:37:49,321 --> 00:38:07,693
And even though we do have confidentiality for all students that come to our district, I think parents need to understand that when we're talking about confidentiality, we're talking about all students and not just the students that are in a particular group, because I think that is, again, extremely important.

503
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:11,976
And again, it's just basically the fact of

504
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:19,303
I get everything that's happened, but I think it was just the fear of listening to your child come home, we're different.

505
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,105
You know, it happens to everyone.

506
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:24,228
It happens to whether you're young or even adults.

507
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:27,771
One person says one thing and then another one adds on and another one adds on.

508
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:32,936
And as a parent, you're home, you really don't know what's going on in the school itself because you weren't there.

509
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:34,957
And now you have all these different stories.

510
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:42,243
So again, I mean, something should have come out from the school saying what had happened.

511
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:50,850
And I guess my other thing, too, is that this is a very isolated situation with two students that happen to be in the same classroom.

512
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:58,976
Since it's already happened, is it possible or is it something to think about maybe trying to separate these two students?

513
00:38:58,996 --> 00:38:59,657
That's in the works.

514
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:00,277
OK.

515
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:02,034
Thank you.

516
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:03,235
That's all I need to know.

517
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,038
Final comments, Mr. Benedetto?

518
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:11,482
Yes, I want to second all the motions except for mine and move forward to put them on record.

519
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,322
And there's a second.

520
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:16,305
Would you like me to reread them or are we all on the same page with them?

521
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:22,470
Motion for approval on all of the motions made including a report update be added to our school committee agenda.

522
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:23,991
All those in favor?

523
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:24,432
Aye.

524
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:25,593
All those opposed?

525
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:27,034
Motion passes.

526
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:28,415
Thank you very much.

527
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:32,698
OK, I just wanted to clarify something about the incidences.

528
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,760
The latest and largest incident was last Monday.

529
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,201
It occurred in the cafeteria.

530
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:44,126
There were several incidences before and after, and we never got notified of any of them.

531
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:50,170
So the reason that I came forward and started speaking to people was because of the larger incident that had happened in the cafeteria.

532
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:56,875
But as I went through and spoke to the principal, and I spoke to Diane Caldwell, and I spoke to someone in the special needs department,

533
00:39:57,235 --> 00:40:04,121
And I spoke to Mr. Belson and no one had heard of any of the incidents other than the one that had happened in the cafeteria.

534
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:14,609
So that's really concerning to me that these issues, maybe they don't know how to report them, who to report them, because these issues hadn't gone beyond the classroom or the safety team.

535
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:21,234
No one else was aware of these instances, which is why I'm saying we really need to look at what's going on for the protocol and what we should do.

536
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:22,575
That will be dealt with.

537
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:23,636
Thank you very much.

538
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:24,137
Thank you.

539
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:37,588
Okay, well, tonight, really quick on that, Mr. Johnson is going to appear before us in the next meeting.

540
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:42,412
I would also like for him to have heads up on all the situations that Ms.

541
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:50,279
Rodriguez brought here, only because I don't want him to come here next week or two weeks, whatever, and say, gee, I'm not aware of it, I'll come back to you.

542
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,420
I want to make it very fruitful.

543
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,261
Okay.

544
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:56,424
No question in my mind they don't know about it.

545
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:04,547
Well, if I could, from the chair, I want to give some accolades out to Cache, who ran a fabulous event this past Saturday.

546
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,188
It was the Mystic River Celebration.

547
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,409
It was a family-friendly event.

548
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:15,614
Many of the parents and children I saw were there all afternoon with great music, great dance, great activities for the kids.

549
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:17,596
So it was just a really beautiful event.

550
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:23,540
And I want to congratulate Laurel Siegel, Laura Beratin, the Medford Arts Council, Allie Fisk,

551
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:32,390
and their major donor, Brookline Bank, for pulling off an amazing event that I hope everybody got to come to, and if you didn't, make sure to put it on your calendar for next year.

552
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,354
It's a fabulous day, so kudos to Caché for pulling that off.

553
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:43,803
To mention that, I think that it's appropriate also to mention the wonderful celebration

554
00:41:44,273 --> 00:42:03,707
for the dedication of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, and to thank everybody in your office who was responsible to make it such a wonderful event, because it truly was great, and I know how much the people enjoyed it and appreciated it, and I felt very blessed to have been able to attend.

555
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,461
Thank you very much, Paula.

556
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:06,882
It was a beautiful afternoon.

557
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:15,163
I think if we all heard one common theme, it was peace and it was faith and it was what gets you through the day, basically.

558
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:18,124
And the things that these people endured is just horrendous.

559
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:24,265
But there is a place now for people to reflect and meet and talk and look to the future.

560
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:26,726
So it was a very proud day for the city of Medford.

561
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:32,700
My staff did an amazing job, as did others in City Hall, DPW, the state.

562
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,243
I mean, all hands were on deck for this event, so it was quite a nice afternoon.

563
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:38,825
Thank you.

564
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:51,535
And we have a special commendation for a lovely lady that is leaving our school district, so I'd like to ask Ms.

565
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:52,997
Padvilli to step forward.

566
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:21,994
I'd like to say that we have had this woman in our school system for the last 35 years, but it's only been two years, three months, four days, and she has accomplished so much in such a little amount of time.

567
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:23,896
You're just an amazing woman.

568
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:30,803
You've brought some ingenious ideas to our school system, and you've certainly automated and made us a more productive system.

569
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:34,686
This doesn't even reflect how we all feel about you.

570
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,627
You know we adore you.

571
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:44,633
But it's congratulations that Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Patricia Bailey for outstanding service as the director of administration and finance, signed by all of us.

572
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:47,435
So we wish you the best in Minnesota.

573
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:49,637
Yeah, Michigan.

574
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:51,298
Michigan.

575
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,641
And we know that you and I can make another

576
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:58,575
very proud.

577
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:02,038
So that she doesn't forget what's really important in life.

578
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,203
Here you go.

579
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:11,989
While you're watching those pitiful lions play.

580
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,990
Stay in touch.

581
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,490
Thank you.

582
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:19,220
I know we've been trying.

583
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,801
We've been trying.

584
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:22,645
We bought a bracelet so that she will find whoever she is.

585
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:24,869
We've been trying really, really hard.

586
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:30,017
And just one other item, if you don't mind me taking it out of order.

587
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,120
I'll give up.

588
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:12,920
Would someone make a motion that we take item?

589
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:15,114
Thank you, Ms.

590
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:15,695
Tuscari.

591
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:20,879
Motion to suspend the rules to take paper number eight of the reports out of order.

592
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,401
It's a report on complete streets.

593
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:31,328
I hope that the community is aware that the city of Medford was awarded $400,000 for complete streets projects within our community.

594
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:43,278
This was part of a community compact that we signed with the governor's office and the lieutenant governor, which allowed us to basically get $90,000 worth of grant money in order to do studies of our streets.

595
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:55,726
With that money, MAPC coordinated a team of traffic engineers and traffic advisors to come out and look at a lot of the issues that we are aware of and then to rank them based upon need.

596
00:45:56,567 --> 00:46:00,009
Once we accomplished that, we had to put together a policy to submit to the state.

597
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,232
Once they approved, we were eligible for some extra points on our application.

598
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:07,494
We were awarded the full amount that you could for this process, which was $400,000.

599
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:15,337
The number one item on our list was the traffic walk in front of the Brooks School.

600
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:22,439
We realized that the width of that area is just a tremendous amount of space and it's a safety hazard.

601
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,040
And as recent as, I think, a week or so ago,

602
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,663
A child was grazed, but it could have been much worse.

603
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:32,125
It wasn't because of the width, it was a glare issue.

604
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:35,087
But in any event, it's a very wide crosswalk.

605
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:49,657
So the people at the tool design, which was our traffic consultants, they went through and they looked at it and they made a host of recommendations for this project, including rapid flash beacons, which is basically if you were going to cross, you press the button and

606
00:46:50,277 --> 00:47:00,664
blinks go off on both sides, curb bump outs so that you're basically tightening the street, and a host of other signage and striping.

607
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:08,830
But in the interim, we're also going to be painting High Street because it is a very wide street going all the way down with cars being allowed to park in certain segments of it.

608
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:16,235
So we will be doing some immediate changes to the street to try and tighten it up a little bit and slow down the cars.

609
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:17,476
We know cars are an issue.

610
00:47:17,872 --> 00:47:23,799
The chief has guaranteed that he's going to have more enforcement on that street, and he will be addressing it.

611
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:26,943
But we had six items that were approved, one including Salem Street.

612
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:30,166
We're doing a traffic study in the Salem Street, Haines Square area.

613
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:36,454
Medford Square, we're tightening up the area in front of River Street.

614
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,252
We're going to make that a tighter walkway as well.

615
00:47:39,392 --> 00:47:42,114
And there's a host of others in South Madrid in front of Tufts Pool.

616
00:47:42,215 --> 00:47:45,337
We know we have a very dangerous crossing section there as well.

617
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:49,901
So if you look up on the website, you can see the list of items that we're doing along with some analysis.

618
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:52,023
But we're just really proud to announce this.

619
00:47:52,343 --> 00:48:01,311
And we're also going to be looking at lowering the speed limits, which the state passed in August that the cities now have the authority to lower the street mileage on roads.

620
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:04,887
before we couldn't touch state roads like Route 60, 16, 38.

621
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:07,249
And now they have passed that.

622
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:08,070
We are able to.

623
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,671
So we're very pleased about that.

624
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:12,253
We've tried it in the past, and they've come down and taken down our signs.

625
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:16,136
So we will be intensifying this process.

626
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,564
I'm particularly happy to hear about the part which deals with the Brooks School.

627
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:33,090
There was a group of parents from the Brooks who have met with former Mayor Mike McGlynn, brought their concerns.

628
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,054
This has been an ongoing issue for some time and it's very good to see that there is a resolution

629
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:40,378
This intensifies it, this complete street.

630
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:45,159
This funding source really does exemplify... Is there a timeline?

631
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:47,600
It has to be spent by June 30th.

632
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,542
So we have an engineer looking at the... When you do curb cuts, you have to have the proper radius and all of that.

633
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:58,442
So someone actually has to spec out the plans that have to go on the street.

634
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,583
So we'll be specing that out over the next month.

635
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:01,603
The money's in hand right now.

636
00:49:02,263 --> 00:49:09,148
And then we'll be putting it out to bid to start as soon as winter's over, as soon as we're able to get in the ground, and then it'll be done probably by April, May.

637
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:09,888
That's great.

638
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:11,049
The long-term plan.

639
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:14,071
The short-term striping, we're going to be getting on that very shortly.

640
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:24,618
And while we are under suspension, could I ask that we also address the addendum that we received this evening regarding the recommendation to accept a gift from Urban Sheds of Medford?

641
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:25,799
Yes, certainly.

642
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,721
Oh, I'm sorry.

643
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:31,433
Mr. Benedetto.

644
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,473
Thank you so much.

645
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:34,415
And I'm really glad that this is in place.

646
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:49,746
This is perfect timing, especially with the events that happened recently, um, and that we're going to put, um, um, some issues in some corrections in place immediately and not wait for this to be completed.

647
00:49:49,806 --> 00:49:51,588
That was a concern from me.

648
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:54,370
Um, so with this brought up,

649
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:56,971
a memory of an update.

650
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:59,955
I need an update from the crossing guard on the Felsway.

651
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:10,869
Did we ever, you know, figure that out with... We had a meeting Thursday with a lot of the team from City Hall as well as some of the parents that were involved in the school.

652
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:14,031
And this issue was brought to our attention at that meeting.

653
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:17,054
And we also had Senator Jalen and Rep.

654
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:18,795
Garbally, who was going to speak to Rep.

655
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:19,235
Donato.

656
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:20,476
It's his district.

657
00:50:20,837 --> 00:50:29,323
And they were going to look into the DCR issues, because that's a DCR road, to see if they could, number one, get a crossing guard down at two locations on the Fellsway.

658
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:33,647
So they were going to take that in their bailiwick, and they were going to address that.

659
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:34,427
OK, great.

660
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:37,370
Because we've been trying for that crossing guard for about a year now.

661
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:39,749
We've been asking about updates.

662
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:44,251
I know we've reached out to the DCR repeatedly and that we really weren't getting anywhere.

663
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,892
So before something happens there, I would like that addressed.

664
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:54,095
And I'm glad that Rep Donato will be handling that because I think he'll do an excellent job and look forward.

665
00:50:54,975 --> 00:50:59,177
Superintendent, could you please give us an update at our next meeting on that?

666
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:00,677
So I'm making a motion to have a report.

667
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,280
Thank you.

668
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:13,106
Motion to send to rep Donato and Senator Jalen, a request for a traffic guard at the crosswalk on the fouls way between Salem street and Fulton street.

669
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:15,528
I believe that's the correct.

670
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:16,268
Yes.

671
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:18,950
There are, there've been several requests made.

672
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,371
This is not a new request.

673
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:26,274
And representative Donato has a bunch of stone wall with a DCR.

674
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,497
But if we get multiple, um,

675
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:38,517
reps requesting it, perhaps that will get a little bit more steam on it, but it's been difficult because this is not a new request that we've been making this request.

676
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:39,198
When St.

677
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:46,324
Francis closed, DCR determined it wasn't necessary, but we think it's necessary and we just have to keep banging your way at it.

678
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:48,746
But that was part of the meeting the other day.

679
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,387
So thank you.

680
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:55,771
We're going to make that a motion to our state delegation on that motion.

681
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,933
All those in favor, all those opposed.

682
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:58,814
Motion is passed.

683
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,060
Ms.

684
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,521
Kretz, did you wish to speak?

685
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:08,123
I had written down the same exact question about the Fells Way, because that was what we were talking about last school year.

686
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:11,705
Yeah, so I mean, everything Erin mentioned was exactly what I had written down.

687
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,966
And this is a great program.

688
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:16,247
And I'm so glad that we got that funding.

689
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:19,969
It's just terrific with all the crosswalks, so dangerous.

690
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:28,213
I just want to know, Stephanie, do you know in the square also where you cross over where Colleen Brigham's is?

691
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:32,006
I know that's a really high traffic area also.

692
00:52:32,146 --> 00:52:35,870
My mother actually got hit in that crosswalk a few years ago.

693
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:43,197
And I think there's a lot of traffic, you know, with people crossing over to go to Colleen's and over to the other side.

694
00:52:43,237 --> 00:52:45,819
And it just seems like a really congested area.

695
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:47,861
So I wanted to just mention, I know it's not really

696
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,408
part of the school zone, but where the money was going to be funded.

697
00:52:51,428 --> 00:52:53,210
Complete Streets isn't strictly a school zone area.

698
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:53,790
It could be anywhere.

699
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,611
So I wanted to mention that.

700
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:59,755
They went in and they evaluated the level of severity, and they came up with the list.

701
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,818
This professional, not the city, the professional engineers did.

702
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:11,064
So they've ranked them all, and the state basically took our first six plus a study, seven items, and that's what they funded.

703
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:15,728
So we'll be applying again for another grant, and we'll be going down that list and hitting more and more.

704
00:53:15,768 --> 00:53:17,409
And then whatever we can accomplish on our own

705
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:19,735
striving to do that as well.

706
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:25,098
And do you know, has, um, has the traffic improved at the Brooke school?

707
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:32,063
Um, I know they wanted to get, you know, police, um, enforcement out there, um, until something is in place.

708
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:36,926
And, um, I did talk to the crossing guard who does that, you know, that, that section.

709
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:45,311
And she said, um, it's still really busy and people aren't stopping or they're stopping, but then they're going and then they're stopping.

710
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:46,732
You know, it's not like really,

711
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:49,870
I don't know why, maybe because it's a busy section.

712
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,410
Yeah.

713
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:55,972
I just know whenever I go there and I use the crossing guard, the cars always stop.

714
00:53:56,012 --> 00:53:56,312
I don't know.

715
00:53:56,332 --> 00:54:02,315
We have a parent here in the audience that maybe she'd like to address, but I haven't seen that issue when the crossing guard is on premise.

716
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:06,996
The problem that I've heard is that when she's not there is when they have issues.

717
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:08,077
Okay.

718
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:11,098
So the chief said he's going to do additional traffic enforcement.

719
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:16,680
We're going to trim some trees as well so that people can see the sign that blasts what their speed limit is.

720
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,682
So we think the issue is when we don't have a traffic guard.

721
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:23,742
Okay.

722
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:27,244
Yes, that is the case.

723
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:29,345
Can you name and address please?

724
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:31,646
I'm sorry, Elizabeth White, 280 High Street.

725
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:42,590
And it's especially bad when parents are leaving after school, if they're picking their kids up between the after school hours, 2.30 and 6, whenever they're getting their kids, and there have been incidents.

726
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,191
I mean, no one's been hit, but it's just so wide.

727
00:54:46,011 --> 00:54:51,293
But typically, I mean, I think when Nicole is the crossing guard, when she's there, she does a phenomenal job.

728
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:58,936
And I've actually seen other people there who have replaced her, even police officers who don't do as good a job as she does.

729
00:54:59,076 --> 00:54:59,576
She's excellent.

730
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:01,317
Thank you.

731
00:55:01,337 --> 00:55:02,277
She'll be glad to hear that.

732
00:55:02,937 --> 00:55:03,298
Thank you.

733
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:03,798
Thank you, Ms.

734
00:55:03,818 --> 00:55:04,058
Kretz.

735
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:17,055
basically echoing what has been previously said, but I was looking at the report and I just want to make sure that, I mean, first of all, I want to say, great.

736
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:19,876
I love the idea that we were able to get this funding.

737
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:26,779
Um, and I know that we are looking at the Roberts, I'm sorry, at the Brooks right now, because especially the situation that occurred,

738
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,541
but my biggest fear is always I don't wanna wait till a situation that occurs.

739
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:45,146
So I also wanna make sure that we're looking at the high school on Winthrop Street because even though we've been trying to put some signs and things up, again, there's a lot of trees that are, they're really low and you really can't see what you're putting on.

740
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:48,547
So I just wanna make sure that we're also looking at Winthrop Street.

741
00:55:48,587 --> 00:55:52,288
We can anytime ask Forestry to turn some trees if they're sinking.

742
00:55:52,328 --> 00:55:56,750
Yeah, and we wanna make sure that we have the proper signage out there, okay?

743
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,721
On the motion to receive and place on file this report, all those in favor?

744
00:56:03,242 --> 00:56:03,922
All those opposed?

745
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:04,903
Motion passes.

746
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,325
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

747
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,027
Oh, no, not yet.

748
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:10,327
Hold it.

749
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:11,328
Hold it, Mr. Skerry.

750
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:11,808
Ms.

751
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:12,749
Van de Kloot.

752
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:18,232
We received as an addendum in our packet a recommendation to accept gifts from Urban Sheds of Medford.

753
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,715
It asks that the Medford High School Garden Club

754
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:26,589
was asking permission to receive a donation of a garden shed from Urban Sheds of Medford.

755
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:36,276
And they're going to build, they've offered to build a custom four by six foot shed in the inner courtyard adjacent to the garden free of charge.

756
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:47,345
Anyway, it's signed by Rhetta Smith, the Garden Club supervisor, the biology teacher, and the Medford High School Garden Club members.

757
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:49,167
And so I'd like to make a motion of approval.

758
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:57,415
that the garden club be able to accept the gift of a shed from Urban Sheds, unless there's any concerns that I don't know about.

759
00:56:57,435 --> 00:56:59,116
Does the school committee accept the gift?

760
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:02,559
Mr. Superintendent, does the school committee accept the gift?

761
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,362
It's a motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

762
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:05,902
Roll call.

763
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:06,843
Roll call vote.

764
00:57:06,863 --> 00:57:07,564
It has to be, yes.

765
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:09,045
Ms.

766
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:14,690
Cuno, Mr. Benedetto, Mr. Kress, Mr. Stone, Mr. Skerry, yes, to continue to approve.

767
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:15,230
Yes.

768
00:57:16,297 --> 00:57:18,103
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

769
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:18,965
The motion passes.

770
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:21,392
I look for a one minute recess.

771
00:58:55,934 --> 00:58:59,659
The next item on the agenda, reports from superintendent.

772
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:05,688
Recommendation to accept school supply backpacks from Aguero.

773
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:32,568
Madam chairperson, we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

774
00:59:33,148 --> 00:59:35,310
I think it's, I think it's, it's my Michael.

775
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,451
I think my mic is on.

776
00:59:36,611 --> 00:59:36,911
Yeah.

777
00:59:42,456 --> 00:59:44,918
Well, now everybody's mic is on.

778
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:46,399
We're on.

779
00:59:47,834 --> 01:00:04,088
Medford Public Schools would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Sidney Wolk, founder of Agero, and the cross-country group, David Farrick, CEO and President of Agero, Sandy Savage, the Vice President of Human Resources, Sandy Reyes,

780
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:15,158
human resource business partner, and all the members of the corporate giving committee for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies to our students.

781
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:21,582
Ajero donated more than 60 backpacks, three times what they gave us last year.

782
01:00:22,162 --> 01:00:36,187
filled to the brim with supplies that include educational games, composition notebooks, markers, rulers, pencils, glue sticks, binders, folders, lined paper, colored pencils, and highlighters.

783
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:43,949
These items have been distributed to our elementary schools, and we had enough to distribute some of them to our middle schools as well.

784
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:51,412
In addition, pencils and spiral notebooks have been given to Medford High School and the Vocational High School.

785
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:58,131
Our principals have decided that the backpack should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students.

786
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:10,165
And in fact, at our elementary schools, the principals actually open and take all the supplies out, and then the teachers can come and bring them to their classrooms.

787
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:18,198
Principals and teachers and students and families were elated when they received their school supplies.

788
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:28,024
We are fortunate to have such generous community partners, such as Ajiro, who come to make such a difference in the lives of the children in our school district.

789
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:34,809
I was hoping Mr. Sidney Wolk would be here tonight, but he is unavailable, and Miss Sandy Reyes is homesick.

790
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:37,591
Otherwise, we would have thanked them publicly for their gifts.

791
01:01:48,432 --> 01:01:53,194
Could we please send a letter of thanks to them an appreciation from the school committee members?

792
01:01:58,076 --> 01:01:58,516
Thank you.

793
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:00,477
Motion accepted and placed on file.

794
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:07,380
Next item on the agenda report school screening brief intervention and referral to treatment.

795
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:12,159
Madam Chairperson, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services is here.

796
01:02:12,879 --> 01:02:19,984
We brought this to your attention last year when we got involved with the opiate intervention activities.

797
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:29,751
And Tony's going to bring you up to date on SBIRT, which is the acronym for this long title, and let you know what we're doing and how it's going at this point in time.

798
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:31,752
Good evening.

799
01:02:33,338 --> 01:02:42,764
I hope everybody received one of the booklets that our team put together that really explains what SBIRT is and what the process for implementation will be.

800
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:47,887
This year in our high school and next year we'll expand to the middle schools.

801
01:02:48,828 --> 01:02:58,114
So in January, Governor Baker signed an act relative to preventing adolescent substance abuse by expanding SBIRT.

802
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:02,136
And it mandates the use of a verbal screening tool for

803
01:03:03,627 --> 01:03:10,789
adolescents in the school setting and starts with grade nine this school year and expands to grade seven next school year.

804
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:32,616
And the, um, the act also provided funding to public school districts and Medford was fortunate to receive almost $15,000, um, that provided, um, training for the school nurse, the high school nurses, the adjustment counselors and guidance counselors, and also permitted us to buy some resources that we would be able to use.

805
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,961
So SBIRT is a verbal screening tool.

806
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:38,742
It's evidence-based.

807
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:40,003
It's used with adolescents.

808
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:44,005
And it's administered during a private one-to-one conversation.

809
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:47,327
It consists of a few questions.

810
01:03:48,008 --> 01:03:58,794
And the goal is to promote prevention and identify early those students whose patterns of drug or alcohol use are presenting, putting their health at risk.

811
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:03,597
Use of the tool allows the screener to determine a level of risk.

812
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:14,698
For students who have a very low level of risk, the screener will support and encourage their positive, healthy decision making and lifestyle.

813
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:25,741
For students who screen higher level of risk, the screener will either provide a brief intervention or the highest level would provide referral to treatment.

814
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,341
So it's a tiered level of approach.

815
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,872
The screening entails students meeting with a trained screener.

816
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:37,372
They meet one-to-one.

817
01:04:37,412 --> 01:04:42,254
We are taking them out of either health ed or physical education classes.

818
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:59,680
And the screener will go through the six questions and then make a decision on whether it's just that we're saying, great, you're doing a wonderful job, you're making good choices, or probing a little bit further with the students.

819
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:07,104
Students and parents have the option of opting out by submitting a letter.

820
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:16,050
And we will be notifying parents during the fall that we will be starting these screenings.

821
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,852
That letter is included in the booklet.

822
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,534
All the interviews are confidential.

823
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:26,717
No results will be placed in any student records.

824
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:34,260
permission to disclose the information can only be granted by the student.

825
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:46,004
So students will be informed that if their health is at risk, if we are really concerned about them, then we will reach out for referral to treatment or we would reach out to parents.

826
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:49,645
So that will be made known to the student at the beginning of the screening.

827
01:05:50,985 --> 01:05:55,327
And there's no disciplinary action associated with any results of the screening.

828
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:58,128
The goal is really identification and

829
01:05:58,952 --> 01:05:59,833
harm reduction.

830
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:03,234
So where are we now?

831
01:06:04,195 --> 01:06:06,076
The staff has been trained.

832
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:08,777
Last spring, the staff at the high school was trained.

833
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:16,001
We convened a small team that worked together to pull together the resources in that booklet.

834
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:27,927
We are looking at this fall, we'll be setting up the schedules for how to pull students out of class, and we expect to begin the screening in mid-January.

835
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:32,375
Let's see.

836
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:34,297
Does anybody have any questions?

837
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,344
So, I read through the material and I just wanted to be clear.

838
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:51,474
So, if a student does reveal information which is alarming, they will be told that what they're saying is not confidential?

839
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:54,377
It depends on the level of harm risk.

840
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:01,666
At the highest level, yes, that the student would be told, I'm concerned about you.

841
01:07:01,706 --> 01:07:05,927
You're putting yourself or others at danger, depending on the answers on the questionnaire.

842
01:07:07,348 --> 01:07:09,728
I would like to refer you on for further treatment.

843
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:16,410
I feel it would be beneficial to inform your parents because we will be an alliance to making sure that you get that treatment.

844
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:24,293
Students do have the option of refusing, and that's all part of the process of

845
01:07:27,354 --> 01:07:33,788
coming to terms with your degree of substance abuse and your readiness for treatment.

846
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:40,292
But that all follows the models of the SBIRT program.

847
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:48,434
I guess I was thinking in particular about one of the questions was about getting into have you ever driven with anybody who's under the influence.

848
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:48,974
Right.

849
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:51,774
And if a student says yes, my dad.

850
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:55,795
And that brings a whole different level to that.

851
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:56,636
Yeah.

852
01:07:56,836 --> 01:08:01,757
And I think there would be further investigation and the team would have to decide where you go with that.

853
01:08:02,764 --> 01:08:05,006
referring to Department of Children and Families.

854
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:07,689
It may be a conversation with the parent.

855
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:10,031
I mean, it will lead to different levels.

856
01:08:10,351 --> 01:08:15,016
I'll be very interested in hearing how this all works out and what the response is.

857
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:26,807
From the experience that I've heard about in other districts that are using it, Natick is using the model, Gloucester, North Andover, Bill Ricka.

858
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:33,544
They have found very low numbers of students that need referral on for high level treatment.

859
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:45,291
If we get them early, 7th to 9th grade, we do really more education and prevention than we do identification of significant illness.

860
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:50,414
You're building good, positive, healthy decision making.

861
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:52,255
Okay.

862
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:56,318
I have a few questions from the podium.

863
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:05,465
My first is, are the children told that the outcome may not be confidential before they begin?

864
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:06,045
They will be.

865
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:06,746
OK.

866
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:13,569
And then, are we sending the op-out form to parents?

867
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:16,891
Are we sending them a form if you don't want your child to?

868
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:17,131
Yes.

869
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:23,183
we have a letter that if that gives them instructions, if they would like to opt out, how they go about doing that.

870
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:23,624
Okay.

871
01:09:23,644 --> 01:09:25,106
It's not like a cutoff on the bottom.

872
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:26,387
No, no.

873
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,229
We're asking that they email us.

874
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,551
Okay.

875
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:33,856
And then we'll, when we set up the schedules, um, then we'll take that into account.

876
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:36,739
We'll remove those children who have, whose parents have opted out.

877
01:09:37,332 --> 01:09:40,094
or a phone number for parents that don't have these.

878
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:41,475
That should be in there as well.

879
01:09:41,815 --> 01:09:42,156
Okay.

880
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:45,959
And then my last question is about staffing.

881
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:49,501
So our nursing department is really going to be taking care of this.

882
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:57,007
And I know our nurses work extremely hard already, and this is a new initiative for them to undertake.

883
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:59,609
Who's doing their job while they're doing this?

884
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:02,971
Well, we will be tag teaming nurses and counselors.

885
01:10:03,372 --> 01:10:05,053
So when we set up the schedule,

886
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:12,799
We look to set up two nurses and two counselors pulling students out of the classes.

887
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:22,906
That leaves, at the high school, one nurse in the high school office, along with me, unless I become one of the school nurses.

888
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:25,268
So I think we will be adequately covered.

889
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:28,310
So we have considered that.

890
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,771
And the same with the counselors.

891
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:34,715
If we have a plan set up ahead of time, they can adjust some of their schedules so that

892
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:36,743
their freedom to do that.

893
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:42,905
Okay, and if not, is there budgetary funds allotted with this to like get a sub-nursing?

894
01:10:43,085 --> 01:10:43,706
There is not.

895
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:46,426
All the funds were specifically for training.

896
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:47,627
Okay.

897
01:10:48,547 --> 01:10:48,767
All right.

898
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:54,969
So we will be looking to do this without, you know, without the use of substitutes if possible.

899
01:10:55,069 --> 01:10:58,670
It will be all about very succinct planning.

900
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:04,045
So my request is that you track that and how many, um, absolutely.

901
01:11:04,506 --> 01:11:09,930
How much coverage one nurse is taking on and like any, the increase in incidents.

902
01:11:09,991 --> 01:11:15,355
So we make sure that we're covered well because we have a lot of students with a lot of different needs.

903
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:16,116
Absolutely.

904
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:19,930
So I want to make sure that all students are safe while we're planning to do this.

905
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:21,372
Any other questions?

906
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:22,153
Mrs. Cuneo.

907
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:23,455
Thank you.

908
01:11:24,136 --> 01:11:32,205
I guess the thing is that when you said that parents are going to be asked if their children want to opt out or not, and then you also mentioned that if

909
01:11:32,826 --> 01:11:41,209
the student decides to do this, they will be informed that depending on the level, some of the information will not be confidential.

910
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:41,649
Right.

911
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:48,612
So I guess in between that, is there something, is there a form that they're going to sign saying that you definitely informed them?

912
01:11:50,212 --> 01:11:51,353
No, that, that, um,

913
01:11:52,244 --> 01:11:55,406
That has not, we don't have that looked into it.

914
01:11:55,907 --> 01:12:06,434
Because my concern is that if we say it verbally, if something comes out that the child doesn't want really to be exposed, they could turn around and say that they were never told.

915
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:15,420
And my other concern is also if the child is 18 years old and older or if the child is 18 and younger.

916
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,622
No, it's all students have the ability to opt out.

917
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:21,834
No, but I'm talking about if there was a form.

918
01:12:21,894 --> 01:12:22,855
Oh, a form, right.

919
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:30,722
If there's some type of form that they have to sign, releasing the fact that they know the outcome, if it's going to be higher, it's not going to be confidential.

920
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:37,028
If the student is 17 years old and they sign the form, then the parents need to sign that form.

921
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:45,055
Actually, the way the state has set this up, students older than 14 can give consent or opt out.

922
01:12:48,613 --> 01:12:56,058
It's just that little piece of confidentiality because they could at that moment say, sure, I'll give you, you know, you ask me and I'll do it.

923
01:12:56,118 --> 01:13:09,666
And then just in case they don't like the, I don't want to say reaction or the restriction from it, I don't want us to be liable saying it's a he said, she said situation.

924
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:10,207
We can do that.

925
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:16,971
We can put together a student form that if a student says, no, I don't want to do this, we can ask them to sign it.

926
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:17,331
OK.

927
01:13:21,223 --> 01:13:24,705
Motion to accept the paper and put it on file.

928
01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:25,445
Motion so moved.

929
01:13:29,307 --> 01:13:30,928
Thank you for all your work, Tony.

930
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,449
Thank you.

931
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,410
Thank you for all the work.

932
01:13:36,972 --> 01:13:40,754
Report on district priority educational costs, SY 2016-2017.

933
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:48,318
So at this time, we'll call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.

934
01:13:51,865 --> 01:13:52,325
Good evening.

935
01:13:52,966 --> 01:13:57,208
Every year we set educational goals, priority goals.

936
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:00,930
I know there are a lot of different categories of goals for school system.

937
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,852
These really deal with the educational elements.

938
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:10,156
And the reason why we get this out really early is because it's tied into the teacher evaluation system.

939
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:20,862
Every teacher starting right now is formulating his or her own educational goals, which is part of the requirement for their evaluation.

940
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:36,246
They're supposed to be establishing one professional growth goal and one student performance goal, and these are in the form of SMART goals so that they're measurable, and again, they've been doing this now for a few years.

941
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:47,291
So each year, what we do is we take the goals we've had the previous year, and we take a look at how well we've accomplished those goals.

942
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,292
Dr. Cadelli is here tonight,

943
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,008
She and I kind of worked on this report collaboratively.

944
01:14:53,588 --> 01:15:03,370
She took the goals from last year and just took a look and went to different people responsible for different areas to see how well the goals were met.

945
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:10,392
I think in most cases, you will see from what she reported out that we did meet the goals.

946
01:15:10,432 --> 01:15:16,874
We have, again, the district priority goals and then within each district priority goal, there are a number of SMART goals.

947
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:27,371
And then with that, we met again with the administrators, got their input as we began to update the goals for this year.

948
01:15:27,631 --> 01:15:35,033
And so, I'm just gonna call your attention to just a few of the things that we updated.

949
01:15:35,053 --> 01:15:36,253
One second.

950
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:42,574
So, with regard to

951
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:57,236
District Priority Goal 1 under B, we added another item to the technology piece, and that was informational literacy.

952
01:15:57,676 --> 01:16:02,358
So that's a different bullet if you were to compare the previous year's goals to these new goals.

953
01:16:03,599 --> 01:16:11,903
The district SMART goals for District Priority Goal 1 under 1 that have to do with professional development,

954
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:21,822
A, B, and C, special education strategies, working effectively with at-risk students and social-emotional learning.

955
01:16:22,282 --> 01:16:28,885
Those are the main areas that our new professional development committee identified as being important.

956
01:16:28,945 --> 01:16:37,508
So we felt that we should incorporate what that committee did in terms of making those focal points for professional development.

957
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:42,110
We also added under district priority goal two,

958
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:50,400
Rather than talk about the negative things, suspensions, we wanted to focus on positive.

959
01:16:50,941 --> 01:17:04,632
So under District SMART Goals 3, under Goal 2, the district will design and offer alternative educational opportunities for students providing for credit recovery and positive behavioral supports.

960
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:10,236
So that language was made to be a little bit more positive.

961
01:17:10,977 --> 01:17:12,178
We added a fourth.

962
01:17:12,815 --> 01:17:19,519
item to that particular goal because we know this is one that's been very important this past year.

963
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:23,341
We want to make sure that we focus a lot of attention on it.

964
01:17:23,861 --> 01:17:34,906
And that fourth one is the district will continue to promote programs and initiatives that seek to educate students on issues related to substance abuse.

965
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:39,749
So we wanted to make sure that that was clearly delineated as a separate entity.

966
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,204
District priority goal three.

967
01:17:43,765 --> 01:17:49,550
In the past couple of years, we focused on English and mathematics because those were the newest frameworks.

968
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:57,557
And again, we were aligning our curriculum, we were purchasing our materials to reflect those changes and those frameworks.

969
01:17:58,218 --> 01:17:59,879
We feel we've made a lot of progress.

970
01:17:59,999 --> 01:18:03,062
As you know, the committee has supported materials at the elementary level.

971
01:18:03,903 --> 01:18:08,667
The directors have done a lot of work on working with the standards, making sure that the

972
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,965
Standards for each grade level are taught and that they are supported.

973
01:18:13,765 --> 01:18:18,587
This year we have a new framework to be concerned about and that is the science frameworks.

974
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:33,991
They were just adopted last spring and again our focus this year under district priority goal three, which deals with curriculum, is to focus on these new frameworks for science and engineering.

975
01:18:34,771 --> 01:18:38,532
Now that doesn't mean we're gonna forget about English and math because again we're still working on

976
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:44,645
different units of instruction, but again, these were the newest ones that we need to pay attention to.

977
01:18:46,046 --> 01:18:54,110
We will continue to support our curriculum with materials, and we come to the committee every year asking for different materials to support the curriculum.

978
01:18:55,211 --> 01:19:07,057
And we are still updating the curriculum areas that have no recent, or actually their frameworks are quite old, and what we do is we look to other sources, so for example,

979
01:19:07,565 --> 01:19:11,447
The frameworks for health education, the last ones were written in 1999.

980
01:19:12,988 --> 01:19:25,455
There are a lot of health issues that are post-1999, so we look to our health supervisor to make sure that what's being taught in classrooms is reflective of the health needs of youngsters in 2016.

981
01:19:27,056 --> 01:19:30,298
We look to national standards, for example, to help us out.

982
01:19:30,758 --> 01:19:36,461
We have the Michigan model, as you know, the new curriculum for health, which focuses on

983
01:19:36,968 --> 01:19:38,189
a lot of these new topics.

984
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:40,269
The same is true for foreign language.

985
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:43,211
Those frameworks, the last iteration of those was 1999.

986
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:45,591
They haven't updated them.

987
01:19:45,832 --> 01:19:48,433
They haven't updated the fine arts.

988
01:19:48,953 --> 01:19:54,815
So again, we are attentive to those simply because the state doesn't choose to update them doesn't mean the district doesn't.

989
01:19:54,855 --> 01:20:04,019
So those directors are at work looking at seeing what's happened up to date and making sure that those items are incorporated in our own curriculum areas.

990
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:23,022
As we move along District Priority Goal 4, we've changed the language to reflect the new upcoming test, which is MCAS 2.0, and we anticipate that that will be the test that youngsters are being assessed on, assessed with this coming spring.

991
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:32,604
So again, we took out the old language of the old MCAS and the PARCC, and we know this will be the only test that will be mandated by the state.

992
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:49,879
The whole language on district determined measures, DDMs, which were assessments that we were supposed to be developing, we did develop them, and teachers were supposed to be using them as part of their own evaluation.

993
01:20:50,299 --> 01:20:53,481
The state has kind of gone backward a little bit on that.

994
01:20:53,601 --> 01:21:01,626
And even though they are not quite sure that we will be using those for teacher evaluation, they believe having

995
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:07,472
common assessments that are standard for different courses, that's a good idea.

996
01:21:07,592 --> 01:21:12,093
So we renamed the DDM's common assessments.

997
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:17,734
Okay, so again, we're still working on them and just changing a little bit of the language.

998
01:21:19,114 --> 01:21:26,596
And moving ahead, district priority goal five under district SMART goal number three.

999
01:21:29,077 --> 01:21:31,197
Again, the positive behavior

1000
01:21:31,624 --> 01:21:35,065
that we want to emphasize is reflected in that goal as well.

1001
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:59,954
District priority goal number six, again, we put in language that, under goal one, that is reflective of what the professional development committee suggested we focus our areas on, and that would be, again, special education strategies, working effectively with at-risk students, and social and emotional learning.

1002
01:22:00,419 --> 01:22:02,240
So we incorporated that language.

1003
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:15,265
And the last district goal seven, we re-emphasized the increase in online communication.

1004
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:23,288
This is under collaboration between the school, family, and community will increase by so many percentages during the school year.

1005
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:28,871
And again, because we have the new school brains, and in the teacher's contract, they agreed to

1006
01:22:30,062 --> 01:22:32,002
be using that for parent communication.

1007
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:33,103
We're getting that up and running.

1008
01:22:33,123 --> 01:22:37,063
That's my next report is to report out a little bit on school brains and our progress.

1009
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:40,384
But again, increase in the online communication.

1010
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:47,065
That language wasn't reflected in the previous year's goals, but we felt it was important to highlight this year.

1011
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:54,527
So what you have in your packet is just last year's goals, how well we did meeting those, which overall I think was great.

1012
01:22:54,547 --> 01:22:56,387
I guess Bernadette wants to address those.

1013
01:22:56,427 --> 01:22:56,847
She can.

1014
01:22:57,368 --> 01:22:59,288
And then moving forward, how we are

1015
01:22:59,715 --> 01:23:27,541
Presenting this to the teachers these goals will go out to the administrators They can give them to the teachers and then the teachers can start to formulate their own professional goals and student goals for their own evaluation So that's kind of the process and we again had to get this out very quickly this month Because we have a timeline in the contract teachers have to do this by a certain date this by a certain date and they need to get their plans and their goals in

1016
01:23:28,112 --> 01:23:30,234
within the next couple of weeks, I believe is the deadline.

1017
01:23:30,934 --> 01:23:33,716
So any questions on that or anything you'd like Bernadette to address?

1018
01:23:34,057 --> 01:23:34,257
Ms.

1019
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:34,877
Van de Kloot.

1020
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:38,600
I just want to say thank you for all the work that this entails.

1021
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:49,809
I went through it and saw how much work, because it's not only articulating them, it's also making sure that we're planning all of the appropriate activities that go along with them.

1022
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:54,853
Does this need a motion of approval to approve the goals?

1023
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:05,426
I'm guessing yes, so I'll make the motion to approve the goals, set forth the district priority educational goals for school year 2016-2017.

1024
01:24:05,686 --> 01:24:09,369
Any other questions?

1025
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,911
I have a few questions if you don't mind.

1026
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:17,915
I compared the goals of what you met, what your goals were for last year and what this year's goals were.

1027
01:24:18,986 --> 01:24:23,030
I'm very happy to say you met a tremendous amount of the goals that you set forth.

1028
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:34,198
There is a few areas that you either didn't meet them as of yet and or you read, you alternated them with other things.

1029
01:24:34,398 --> 01:24:36,199
And if something isn't working, it's great.

1030
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:42,184
I was very happy to see that you took that initiative and moved them forward.

1031
01:24:42,938 --> 01:24:51,568
There was one on Smart Goal, District Priority Goal 2 from last year, number 3.

1032
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,352
No, not number 3, sorry.

1033
01:24:58,578 --> 01:25:01,739
Number two, alternative direction for the goal.

1034
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:12,542
You have the minimum of 10% of educators in each school work with central administration in planning and preparing professional development programs for mass social and emotional curriculum.

1035
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:14,723
And you went the alternative direction.

1036
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:19,824
I didn't see that in the next, this year's goals.

1037
01:25:20,225 --> 01:25:21,265
Did I just miss that?

1038
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:25,430
I will address that.

1039
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:32,054
So the alternative route was the direction, we took that direction from what was in the new contract.

1040
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:41,798
So prior to the contract being finalized, we thought we would go with the members from each school, and then we changed it.

1041
01:25:42,358 --> 01:25:47,641
So moving forward, I'm going to move forward to goal number two in the new goals.

1042
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:50,042
Perhaps we just implied this.

1043
01:25:55,808 --> 01:26:01,210
You know what, we did not put it in a goal, but that team is functioning.

1044
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:05,232
The team is comprised of six teachers and six administrators.

1045
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:07,493
I'm one of the administrators on that group.

1046
01:26:08,294 --> 01:26:11,255
The team is up and running, and we do have a plan.

1047
01:26:12,035 --> 01:26:15,157
We've actually met a lot, but we did not.

1048
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:17,938
Do you think that's necessary to be added at that point?

1049
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,221
I think we referenced the Professional Development Committee, and it is in the contract.

1050
01:26:24,642 --> 01:26:32,908
And as Bernadette said, prior to that being an entity in the contract, we had the language about having participation.

1051
01:26:33,369 --> 01:26:43,696
But now it's written in the contract, and it's kind of like what we did before is kind of null and void, because the contract kind of supersedes what was formally in that language.

1052
01:26:44,497 --> 01:26:48,960
We could put in, again, I think we did reference the Professional Development Committee.

1053
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,222
People are pretty much aware of it.

1054
01:26:51,262 --> 01:26:52,403
There are teachers serving.

1055
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:53,801
actively on that.

1056
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:59,025
We're planning our November 8th professional development day with a lot of teacher involvement.

1057
01:26:59,445 --> 01:27:06,891
Quite honestly, having a committee is nice, but it adds another layer of work because you have another group that you have to work with.

1058
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:11,634
We're meeting on Thursday, all the administrators and teacher facilitators.

1059
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,516
We have quite a group going on.

1060
01:27:13,616 --> 01:27:19,140
So the professional development committee has kind of replaced anything else that we had been doing to

1061
01:27:19,849 --> 01:27:22,551
solicit teacher involvement in professional development.

1062
01:27:22,931 --> 01:27:23,852
Okay.

1063
01:27:24,012 --> 01:27:26,033
That totally equals that.

1064
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:33,579
So on the next page, district priority goal four, section three,

1065
01:27:34,932 --> 01:27:45,204
It's stated, by the end of 15-16, the district will have fully developed two common assessments for content error, which aligns with requirements of educator evaluation.

1066
01:27:45,524 --> 01:27:48,948
And it says approach the goal for how we've met.

1067
01:27:49,989 --> 01:27:54,374
Common assessments have been developing in most of the areas, at grade level areas.

1068
01:27:55,188 --> 01:28:00,672
And we're in the process of finalizing assessments for hospital grades.

1069
01:28:01,512 --> 01:28:11,819
So I just want to know if those assessments will judge the programs that we purchased, like the journeys and the math program.

1070
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:17,433
Will it evaluate how far we've come because we purchased them?

1071
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:19,334
And I'd like to see some of that data.

1072
01:28:19,654 --> 01:28:23,937
So the intent of the common assessments is to show student growth.

1073
01:28:24,057 --> 01:28:27,799
So certainly those results for student growth will be available.

1074
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:37,465
The process by which we're going to go through is kind of gray right now because we're not sure what the state is going to require in terms of the DDM and its implementation.

1075
01:28:39,345 --> 01:28:47,616
So, for example, in any grade that has MCAS, that needs to be used as one of the measures of student impact.

1076
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,485
It is possible, I'm trying to remember some of the assessments.

1077
01:28:55,385 --> 01:28:58,728
There are a couple of assessments that are program-based.

1078
01:28:58,768 --> 01:28:59,629
They come from Journey.

1079
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:00,650
They come from Envisions.

1080
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:06,615
The intent was not to measure the effectiveness of the program, but rather the effect on student growth.

1081
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,157
So I will tell you that that is evolving.

1082
01:29:09,838 --> 01:29:16,464
Again, we feel like we're being pulled in different directions with what the state is requiring of the implementation of the DDMs.

1083
01:29:16,904 --> 01:29:19,366
I guess that's the closest I can get to an answer to you.

1084
01:29:21,868 --> 01:29:25,289
I know it takes about three years and I know our ELA program that we bought is a little bit more than three years now.

1085
01:29:25,309 --> 01:29:26,529
So I would like to know, as a committee member,

1086
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:45,684
you know, the progress and growth we've made because of that purchase and how it's worked out.

1087
01:29:45,784 --> 01:29:46,164
That's all.

1088
01:29:46,284 --> 01:29:47,345
So it's different from this?

1089
01:29:48,005 --> 01:29:52,447
Yeah, I think that such an evaluation of the program needs to occur.

1090
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:57,030
The intent of the common assessments is not to measure the program.

1091
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:04,514
But I think your suggestion, as I'm taking the suggestion, a need that we have is to measure the program is understood.

1092
01:30:04,534 --> 01:30:09,577
So I'd like to make a motion at this time that through the superintendent, we have a report of

1093
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:23,609
these programs and how well our children, how we're performing either way, with the value of those programs and how it's helped our children throughout that project.

1094
01:30:23,929 --> 01:30:30,233
If I could just add, the intent of the programs are to better support the curriculum.

1095
01:30:30,694 --> 01:30:34,316
Where you're going to see the results would be in the state assessments.

1096
01:30:34,556 --> 01:30:34,817
Okay.

1097
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:35,457
Okay.

1098
01:30:35,557 --> 01:30:39,780
Now, again, within each program, there are a lot of assessments that are built in.

1099
01:30:40,273 --> 01:30:42,214
along the way the teachers are using.

1100
01:30:42,834 --> 01:30:47,377
But, I mean, the reason why we put new programs in is to support the curriculum.

1101
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:49,258
So that's where you're going to see the results.

1102
01:30:49,718 --> 01:30:54,921
The DDMs or common assessments or whatever they're going to be called next week are a different entity.

1103
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:55,441
Okay.

1104
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:59,904
So we will get that when we get our results, which are due.

1105
01:31:01,398 --> 01:31:23,857
which were released at 535 which I'm going to talk about a little later on okay so moving forward to next year's goals I had a few so at least you know when you do a report that I actually read it I know we all do but district for priority goal

1106
01:31:25,098 --> 01:31:47,538
I just thought that there could be another goal on the district's mock goals to increase our citywide level, which I'm hoping we have good news this evening about anyway, in rating and to move to make all schools a level one.

1107
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:49,520
Could that be added there?

1108
01:31:51,446 --> 01:31:53,907
like a goal for our community.

1109
01:31:54,147 --> 01:31:56,168
And I just thought that that was the right place for that.

1110
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:09,174
OK, remember, the intent of these goals are to guide teachers in formulating their own goals.

1111
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:15,117
So the only way a teacher could really use that is the teacher would say that he or she is working

1112
01:32:15,638 --> 01:32:18,760
towards a level one priority.

1113
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:30,326
I think we see in this goal that we want to support the curriculum.

1114
01:32:30,346 --> 01:32:36,330
We want to make sure that we get continued improvement academically.

1115
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:42,133
Accountability is not necessarily always tied to academics.

1116
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:46,252
As we're going to learn tonight, there are other factors that go into accountability.

1117
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:53,933
So to say as an educational goal that someone is going to work towards making level one, I don't know that one individual person can do that.

1118
01:32:54,353 --> 01:32:59,014
And so to link this in and have teachers pull out from it, I think would be a little bit of a stretch.

1119
01:32:59,194 --> 01:33:04,955
I think that we all are committed to doing better whether it's moving from, you know, level three to level two to level one.

1120
01:33:04,995 --> 01:33:10,436
Level one is obviously the, you know, the gold standard that we all would like to be up there.

1121
01:33:11,449 --> 01:33:14,352
But it's more than just academic.

1122
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:28,247
Just on the next goal, priority goal five, item three, there is not a percentage listed as there was in the previous year.

1123
01:33:28,818 --> 01:33:41,402
So by June 2017, each school will implement a positive behavior intervention plan to promote learning and respectful interactions as evidenced by a reduction in student suspensions.

1124
01:33:41,962 --> 01:33:44,382
Last year's goal had a percentage of 20%.

1125
01:33:46,283 --> 01:33:53,225
I'd like to sit, had a goal for people to hit, like a number, like so it's quantifiable, right?

1126
01:33:54,327 --> 01:33:56,428
We, you know, we start out with SMART goals.

1127
01:33:56,468 --> 01:34:03,033
The very meaning of a SMART goal was measurable and numbers were obviously an important requirement.

1128
01:34:03,633 --> 01:34:05,534
The state has kind of gotten away from that.

1129
01:34:06,615 --> 01:34:18,463
The teacher's union is not too happy with having a teacher put, you know, quantify something within his or her own goals.

1130
01:34:18,883 --> 01:34:20,724
So we kind of didn't put that in there.

1131
01:34:20,744 --> 01:34:21,645
We could go back.

1132
01:34:22,402 --> 01:34:23,963
and add in a certain percentage.

1133
01:34:25,443 --> 01:34:26,704
I'm not sure if that's.

1134
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:29,205
So let me jump in on that one.

1135
01:34:29,785 --> 01:34:31,385
Every school has got a different reality.

1136
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:36,647
You would expect more suspensions at the high school and the middle schools than you would typically at the elementary schools.

1137
01:34:37,348 --> 01:34:39,228
So it can't really be system wide.

1138
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:44,550
It's really got to be looked at in terms of the specific school.

1139
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:49,192
And then the specific teachers are different than the specific school.

1140
01:34:49,272 --> 01:34:51,973
So teachers don't suspend youngsters.

1141
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,140
And these are teacher goals.

1142
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,701
These are evaluation of teachers.

1143
01:34:56,201 --> 01:35:02,823
So I think you're by putting percentages, we're giving them an unrealistic role to play because they don't really do that.

1144
01:35:03,463 --> 01:35:07,444
It's really done through the, through the office in conjunction with them.

1145
01:35:07,484 --> 01:35:08,864
They don't have total control of that.

1146
01:35:09,644 --> 01:35:20,407
So I think what you're going to see from us coming up next after this is system wide goals would have nothing to do with specifically the teacher goals, but rather what the school system is trying to do.

1147
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:25,448
And then you might find that as a more realistic percentage.

1148
01:35:27,328 --> 01:35:28,329
OK.

1149
01:35:28,509 --> 01:35:32,551
I just saw that in the previous year, and I was just curious why we weren't.

1150
01:35:34,451 --> 01:35:35,432
More of a refinement.

1151
01:35:35,632 --> 01:35:39,453
We changed most of the language of that entire one, too.

1152
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:46,476
And again, working with Kathy and Daglia, we've tried to talk more about positive behavior intervention supports.

1153
01:35:47,052 --> 01:35:49,374
versus looking at the negative suspension.

1154
01:35:49,394 --> 01:35:54,657
What can we do in a positive way that results in, you know, reduced suspension?

1155
01:35:54,777 --> 01:35:59,420
So we kind of made that goal more holistic and more positive in nature too.

1156
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:03,163
That's we kind of changed the whole nature of that one.

1157
01:36:04,484 --> 01:36:08,707
And my last one is district priority six.

1158
01:36:09,707 --> 01:36:16,592
Number two, educators deemed unsatisfactory are needing improvement in standards one and or two.

1159
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:22,481
on their formative or summative evaluation will participate in professional development offerings.

1160
01:36:23,762 --> 01:36:25,962
Contractually, is that possible?

1161
01:36:26,022 --> 01:36:27,843
Like, can we require that?

1162
01:36:27,983 --> 01:36:35,505
Because I read from previous, the explanation from previous year that you couldn't do that.

1163
01:36:36,285 --> 01:36:36,905
Well, we can.

1164
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:45,367
What we did with this goal, too, is that we looked at last year's and we said, gee, the language was only for educators deemed needing improvement.

1165
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:47,808
But they were the ones that are unsatisfactory.

1166
01:36:47,848 --> 01:36:50,210
So we expanded that to include them.

1167
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:57,955
So when an educator is in that category, they're usually put on a plan that they do by contract have to follow.

1168
01:36:58,415 --> 01:37:06,180
And that plan would include going to other classes and watching behavior being modeled.

1169
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:10,583
So yes, you can enforce it if they're on a plan that calls for that.

1170
01:37:10,623 --> 01:37:11,804
Can I just add something to that?

1171
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:23,136
The reason why we approached that goal last year, we could not enforce having a teacher who was having trouble in standards one, standards two.

1172
01:37:23,156 --> 01:37:27,458
We could not require them to go in another teacher's classroom, a veteran teacher who could model that.

1173
01:37:27,898 --> 01:37:35,382
We also could not require that model teacher to make a novice teacher go in.

1174
01:37:36,762 --> 01:37:41,864
That is what was not contractually, we couldn't contractually require that.

1175
01:37:42,525 --> 01:37:45,286
So for next year's goal, we've broadened it.

1176
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:50,148
So it includes the observation of model practice, but it also goes beyond that.

1177
01:37:50,468 --> 01:37:53,129
It extends into other PD offerings.

1178
01:37:53,709 --> 01:37:55,490
So we can require

1179
01:37:56,168 --> 01:38:11,015
people to participate in other PD in best practices, but what we couldn't do, again, is to have them sit in another teacher's classroom and then, even more importantly, have the veteran teacher have another teacher sit in their classroom.

1180
01:38:11,115 --> 01:38:20,939
We can suggest it, and I will tell you that most people do it, but I think we cross the line if we're going to require that.

1181
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:21,699
Okay.

1182
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,200
Thank you for the explanations.

1183
01:38:24,123 --> 01:38:25,603
I don't have to read the whole thing.

1184
01:38:25,623 --> 01:38:27,584
I can just kind of summarize

1185
01:38:51,519 --> 01:38:54,660
Basically, as you know, we're transitioning to school brains.

1186
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,081
Anything new takes time.

1187
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:00,322
And we really want to support our teachers.

1188
01:39:00,382 --> 01:39:03,363
We have a very good relationship with the union.

1189
01:39:03,423 --> 01:39:04,803
We meet on a monthly basis.

1190
01:39:04,823 --> 01:39:06,603
We have a joint labor management committee.

1191
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:13,205
There are several of us that sit on that, along with the president of the union and several members of the executive board.

1192
01:39:13,546 --> 01:39:15,186
And we work out problems.

1193
01:39:15,406 --> 01:39:18,387
And one of the things that came up is that teachers

1194
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:21,892
Although they felt, on the first day of school, we gave them training.

1195
01:39:21,932 --> 01:39:23,573
We gave them training, actually, in the spring.

1196
01:39:24,193 --> 01:39:27,234
But the first day of school, they had their own data, which was really important.

1197
01:39:27,555 --> 01:39:29,876
And they began to be able to really use the system.

1198
01:39:30,356 --> 01:39:31,796
And they're able to take attendance.

1199
01:39:31,856 --> 01:39:33,077
Everything went really well with that.

1200
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:34,357
And that was the most important thing.

1201
01:39:34,778 --> 01:39:39,680
School brains, what we have to think about is rolling it out in tiers.

1202
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:44,142
And so the first thing was very important for teachers the first day of school to be able to take attendance.

1203
01:39:44,642 --> 01:39:47,543
And they were all able to do that, because we had that training.

1204
01:39:47,945 --> 01:39:50,066
before the students came in that first day.

1205
01:39:50,846 --> 01:40:02,370
We heard from the union that teachers at the middle and high school level who used grade book were a little less comfortable with that particular aspect of school brains and they were looking for more training.

1206
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:13,995
Now last year what we did is we rolled this out, we decided that one of the best ways to support teachers was to have individual teachers in each building be the support assistant.

1207
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:17,496
So we actually gave them a stipend, we trained them,

1208
01:40:18,087 --> 01:40:22,028
and they're the individuals that would be the first line of support in a building.

1209
01:40:22,848 --> 01:40:25,129
Those people too felt they needed more support.

1210
01:40:25,549 --> 01:40:33,631
So what we did, we met with the School Brains representatives earlier this month, and we worked out a training session.

1211
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:46,774
So what's going to happen Wednesday afternoon is that we are going to have a training session for the building trainers and many of our administrators, because we obviously know they have to support this too,

1212
01:40:47,422 --> 01:40:48,563
on the use of gradebook.

1213
01:40:49,003 --> 01:40:51,765
And the school brains representatives will be there as well.

1214
01:40:52,305 --> 01:40:59,049
That's an early release day for middle and high school, so we're gonna have the training during that time.

1215
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:04,533
So now those individuals, hopefully on Wednesday, will be very confident in the use of gradebook.

1216
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:16,640
And on October 19th, which is a mandated early release day, as you know with the new contract, we gained back some of the early release days as mandated,

1217
01:41:17,248 --> 01:41:44,272
days for professional development, October 19 is one of those, and what we're having is a school-based, again, middle and high school, because elementary aren't using Gradebook, we're going to have the trainers, the school brains people, we're going to have the administrators who have been trained in the buildings with the teachers, and we're going to retrain them on Gradebook so that they leave that session confident to be able to use that.

1218
01:41:44,703 --> 01:41:48,126
So again, as we roll this out, we know that there are going to be little snags.

1219
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:54,271
We kind of are dealing with them as they come along and working out ways to get around them.

1220
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:58,975
Paul DeLavis stepped up, put a big part of taking a big role with this.

1221
01:41:59,035 --> 01:42:01,557
He is helping us to organize this training.

1222
01:42:01,597 --> 01:42:05,040
He's actually going to help deliver the training on Wednesday.

1223
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:13,587
So we feel that with that training on October 19th, we'll be able to get by that segment of school brains and move on to the next

1224
01:42:14,705 --> 01:42:16,690
phase of the training, whatever that brings.

1225
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,193
So any questions on that?

1226
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:18,393
Yes.

1227
01:42:19,796 --> 01:42:20,578
Mrs. Cuneo.

1228
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:21,018
Thank you.

1229
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:26,980
I know with any software program that especially when it rolls out, there's always going to be glitches.

1230
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:33,022
And I'm happy to hear that you have a lot of this in the planning session of it.

1231
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:44,284
What I have heard is, though, I know that what teachers put into the system and what secretaries are putting into the system and what certain administrators are putting into the system is all different.

1232
01:42:44,824 --> 01:42:51,646
So even though they have building trainers that they could go to sometimes, especially when it gets really busy,

1233
01:42:52,447 --> 01:42:58,854
We really can't pull certain teachers out that have, let's say, learned the program to go and help someone at that moment.

1234
01:42:59,996 --> 01:43:07,745
And I know that I've heard a lot of Mr. DeLaver and actually Mr. Tootin have been helping out tremendously.

1235
01:43:08,306 --> 01:43:11,409
But one question that did come up, speaking to a few people,

1236
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:40,683
Is it possible, maybe, if there's some type of hotline or something that, I know myself, we're actually, where I am, we're rolling out a totally different program, so we're piloting it, but I guess the question is, is there a hotline that you could actually be doing something, and at that moment, if you have that question, you could actually call someone and say, could you help me through this, because sometimes it's difficult, though, to go and grab someone in the building, and you're at a standstill,

1237
01:43:41,222 --> 01:43:42,563
because you can't get to the next step.

1238
01:43:43,143 --> 01:43:50,367
The individuals who are primarily in charge of the school brains are Jean Irwin, Curtis Tootin's assisting her with that.

1239
01:43:50,747 --> 01:43:52,208
Mr. DeLave has stepped up.

1240
01:43:52,288 --> 01:43:55,790
He's really good with technology, and he understands the system very well.

1241
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:06,936
So if a building trainer was unavailable or unable to answer a question, the next line of communication would be to Jean Irwin or to Curtis Tootin.

1242
01:44:06,956 --> 01:44:07,516
So they're there.

1243
01:44:07,536 --> 01:44:11,138
The hotline, the school brains people, quite honestly, have been very responsive.

1244
01:44:11,542 --> 01:44:16,284
Anytime they've had questions, they're right there because they're local people.

1245
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,525
The other thing, too, is that there's lots of tutorials.

1246
01:44:20,005 --> 01:44:23,187
School Brains doesn't just do these live trainings and that's it.

1247
01:44:24,527 --> 01:44:28,128
Teachers can access, you know, review trainings, but they've got to access them.

1248
01:44:28,269 --> 01:44:29,869
I mean, they're up there, they're available.

1249
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:37,452
Those are some of the topics we identified as issues with the School Brains representatives who came out and met us a couple of weeks ago.

1250
01:44:37,552 --> 01:44:39,373
So there are different layers of support.

1251
01:44:40,096 --> 01:44:49,218
The answers should be able to come either from the building person, and I understand they may not always be available, but through Jean, Curtis, and the School Brains people.

1252
01:44:49,638 --> 01:44:57,060
And there's this other program that you're saying that you could actually go into the School Brains system and actually look up the question that you might be having.

1253
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:02,281
Well, there are tutorials so that there'd be a way a person, let's say the person has a training on gradebook.

1254
01:45:02,321 --> 01:45:09,763
I know that sometimes, you know, you see something, you might be paying attention sometimes, but you maybe missed something.

1255
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:13,700
There's a place you can go online and get that instruction, review it.

1256
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,283
So there are ways that you just don't have to make sure you get everything in one session.

1257
01:45:18,863 --> 01:45:20,064
You can review it online.

1258
01:45:20,524 --> 01:45:20,724
OK.

1259
01:45:20,824 --> 01:45:20,944
OK.

1260
01:45:21,485 --> 01:45:21,905
Good to know.

1261
01:45:21,925 --> 01:45:22,265
Mrs. Craig?

1262
01:45:22,806 --> 01:45:22,966
Yep.

1263
01:45:23,346 --> 01:45:24,467
Oh, I have a question.

1264
01:45:25,107 --> 01:45:38,255
I was at the curriculum night last week, and Dr. Riccio and Dr. Perla mentioned that they're going to be giving the parents their IDs and, I guess, passwords.

1265
01:45:38,655 --> 01:45:40,516
the same night as the open house.

1266
01:45:41,177 --> 01:45:55,807
And a lot of parents, the night of the curriculum night, mentioned that they wanted to have the school brains maybe on a different night, because there would be too much going on the same night as the open house.

1267
01:45:56,248 --> 01:45:57,629
And it can be a little busy.

1268
01:45:58,089 --> 01:46:00,251
So I wanted to mention that.

1269
01:46:01,572 --> 01:46:06,035
If there's going to be plans to have maybe a couple different sessions for parents,

1270
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:14,836
who might need help or have questions when it's rolled out to the parents, because I don't think it's rolled out for parents right now.

1271
01:46:15,216 --> 01:46:15,816
Is that right?

1272
01:46:15,916 --> 01:46:18,518
Yeah, that's another segment of it.

1273
01:46:18,598 --> 01:46:25,143
I think that we have a meeting with our administrators, our regular meetings next Tuesday.

1274
01:46:25,163 --> 01:46:35,650
I think each principal will develop his or her own schedule for that, but we will address it with the group and make sure that parents are supported

1275
01:46:36,132 --> 01:46:39,094
by having the time and the meeting time at school to do that.

1276
01:46:39,554 --> 01:46:45,158
And if we need to have Gene and Curtis and even a school brains person to be there, we'll arrange for that.

1277
01:46:46,975 --> 01:46:47,575
Okay, thanks.

1278
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:51,077
I just didn't know if there'd be enough time for everybody to do the open house.

1279
01:46:51,097 --> 01:46:53,098
I'm not aware of the schedule, quite honestly.

1280
01:46:53,138 --> 01:46:54,139
Right, yeah.

1281
01:46:55,059 --> 01:46:56,960
Okay, we'll look forward to hearing about it, thanks.

1282
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:01,903
Point of information, I did forget about Jean Irwin, so I don't want you thinking that I didn't hear good things about her.

1283
01:47:02,003 --> 01:47:04,644
I did know that there were the three of them, I just forgot about her, so.

1284
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:05,124
Okay.

1285
01:47:08,186 --> 01:47:14,989
Motion on the floor to accept, report accepted and placed on file.

1286
01:47:15,009 --> 01:47:15,350
So moved.

1287
01:47:19,172 --> 01:47:21,453
Everybody who agrees say aye.

1288
01:47:21,813 --> 01:47:21,913
Aye.

1289
01:47:22,173 --> 01:47:22,313
Aye.

1290
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:23,814
Thank you.

1291
01:47:23,934 --> 01:47:25,695
Report on Minuteman project.

1292
01:47:28,116 --> 01:47:32,237
Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, just an update on what's going on in Minuteman.

1293
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:37,680
There was a district wide vote among the Minuteman communities.

1294
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:43,062
16 communities voted on September 20th.

1295
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:46,763
10% of the population in those 16 communities came out to vote.

1296
01:47:46,803 --> 01:47:47,644
Some communities only had 2%.

1297
01:47:48,871 --> 01:47:50,192
Some of the communities are withdrawing.

1298
01:47:50,872 --> 01:47:52,633
There were 16 communities in Minuteman.

1299
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:56,935
It's down to 10 now and by the end of this year.

1300
01:47:56,975 --> 01:48:00,976
And then Belmont looks like it will withdraw, so it'll bring it down to nine.

1301
01:48:02,797 --> 01:48:11,461
This gives you an idea of what's going on, but they will get to build their building, but they'll build it for a number that I don't believe they're going to fulfill.

1302
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:17,704
The one thing I want to bring to your attention is that our population is decreasing at Minuteman.

1303
01:48:18,542 --> 01:48:20,604
And I think within two years, we'll have no one there.

1304
01:48:21,424 --> 01:48:33,434
But should we have someone there, one of the provisions of the new regulations called for a capital fee, which we feel is an unfunded mandate, and we will contest with many of the communities that are on this back sheet.

1305
01:48:34,575 --> 01:48:39,919
But the commissioners put it out, and it gives you an idea of how many communities are involved.

1306
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:46,022
There's like 34 outside of the district communities, most of whom will object to that fee.

1307
01:48:46,723 --> 01:48:49,364
We think that they've underestimated the actual cost.

1308
01:48:49,404 --> 01:48:55,908
We think that Minuteman could cost a place like Arlington, New England, $30,000 to $40,000 per student.

1309
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:58,710
Going forward, I think it's absurd, but it is what it is.

1310
01:48:59,391 --> 01:49:00,791
And we think we'll be out of it, but

1311
01:49:02,315 --> 01:49:24,747
informed, and I want you to know that we will, with other communities that are out of district, be initiating appropriate legal action through the Division of Local Mandates, and then, if necessary, through the courts, to avoid any kind of possibility that a capital fee could actually come home to roost at some point should an individual come in.

1312
01:49:24,787 --> 01:49:26,228
We don't believe that's appropriate.

1313
01:49:26,948 --> 01:49:28,289
We don't have equity in the project.

1314
01:49:28,669 --> 01:49:30,310
We don't believe the number is appropriate.

1315
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:32,818
We believe that it's an overbuilt school.

1316
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:36,019
But nevertheless, it's in place and keep you posted.

1317
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:38,960
We think our vocational school is doing extremely well.

1318
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:50,362
And we think that in a couple of years, we won't have anyone going anywhere outside of our own school, except for possibly an agricultural school, which is beyond us unless you're prepared to buy a cow and a horse.

1319
01:49:51,302 --> 01:49:52,202
If you are, let me know.

1320
01:49:53,363 --> 01:49:55,583
We can look at that, but I don't think that's a good idea.

1321
01:49:56,703 --> 01:49:56,883
Okay?

1322
01:49:57,824 --> 01:49:58,324
Any questions?

1323
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,001
Report accepted, in place on file.

1324
01:50:04,141 --> 01:50:05,582
All those that approve, say aye.

1325
01:50:05,942 --> 01:50:06,202
Aye.

1326
01:50:06,422 --> 01:50:07,283
All those against?

1327
01:50:08,063 --> 01:50:08,783
Motion approved.

1328
01:50:09,864 --> 01:50:14,586
Next item, financial records, FY16, current year FY17.

1329
01:50:14,746 --> 01:50:24,471
Madam Chairperson, making her final appearance before the Method School Committee, Pat Villiers.

1330
01:50:26,632 --> 01:50:27,072
Good evening.

1331
01:50:28,548 --> 01:50:31,449
We'll start with FY16's wrap-up year-end summary.

1332
01:50:32,369 --> 01:50:42,013
You'll find attached the financial report, the final summary for the GL for the period of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

1333
01:50:42,893 --> 01:50:49,615
We completed the fiscal year as planned, ending the year carrying $100,145 in encumbrances.

1334
01:50:50,236 --> 01:50:53,337
These are expenses for which we did not have an invoice at closing.

1335
01:50:53,797 --> 01:50:56,738
However, the expenses are attributable to the FY16 year.

1336
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:00,398
Utility usage reports are attached.

1337
01:51:00,558 --> 01:51:06,101
As you can see, we did end the year at about 4% over last year in electricity cost.

1338
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:15,666
And we did end the year under on the natural gas as we planned by almost 24%, which was indicative of the nice warm winter we had.

1339
01:51:16,567 --> 01:51:17,687
Can't guarantee that this year.

1340
01:51:19,989 --> 01:51:30,431
The budget includes a city appropriation of $52,933,000, and $1.7 plan revenue was expended as follows, $52,933,000 general fund expenditures plus $1.5 for planned FY16 general fund expenditures, as well as $238,000 offset entry to school revolving accounts.

1341
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:35,393
You'll also find attached to your reports the year-to-year comparison budget versus actuals

1342
01:51:51,532 --> 01:51:53,173
Any questions on FY16?

1343
01:51:54,714 --> 01:51:55,334
Any questions?

1344
01:51:55,994 --> 01:51:57,595
Do we have to give any money back to the city?

1345
01:51:58,055 --> 01:51:58,196
No.

1346
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:02,958
I did have one quick question, or one quick note.

1347
01:52:03,218 --> 01:52:19,787
I noticed at the end of the year, the fiscal year 2016, that there were three areas in the budget that were more than 10% over their initial budget plan, and those areas were the high school, the middle school, and security.

1348
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,942
My request is that we keep an eye on these for this year and make sure that they stay within their project parameters.

1349
01:52:26,582 --> 01:52:27,882
Through you to the superintendent.

1350
01:52:28,502 --> 01:52:40,646
So one of the things you need to remember is that in this report, the way it's set up, the distribution of undistributed due to contract negotiations was moved after the fact.

1351
01:52:41,246 --> 01:52:43,927
So that when that gets moved, they're not over the top.

1352
01:52:43,967 --> 01:52:47,968
They just simply reflect that contract negotiations took place.

1353
01:52:48,583 --> 01:52:51,143
and that those contributions went over there.

1354
01:52:51,644 --> 01:52:52,924
So that's just the way it is.

1355
01:52:53,264 --> 01:53:01,025
That's the way we report it, so you see it in totality in the raw score rather than move the money around and then you just balance it out.

1356
01:53:01,725 --> 01:53:03,066
So we just show it to you the way it is.

1357
01:53:03,126 --> 01:53:09,347
But in a non-negotiated year, in a year where we're not negotiating a contract, those numbers have already been worked in.

1358
01:53:09,847 --> 01:53:15,068
So you won't see that this year, but you might see it in another negotiated year, okay?

1359
01:53:17,071 --> 01:53:18,852
Set the report place on file, Madam Chairman.

1360
01:53:19,653 --> 01:53:21,774
Those who accept say aye.

1361
01:53:22,034 --> 01:53:22,354
Aye.

1362
01:53:22,594 --> 01:53:24,215
Could I just ask one question?

1363
01:53:24,415 --> 01:53:24,815
I'm sorry.

1364
01:53:24,835 --> 01:53:26,516
I almost missed it.

1365
01:53:26,536 --> 01:53:26,797
Sorry.

1366
01:53:27,697 --> 01:53:29,138
Oh, Pat, I want to thank you for the report.

1367
01:53:29,518 --> 01:53:36,042
And I just wanted to ask just a couple of questions for the upcoming school year, you know, in terms of the transportation.

1368
01:53:36,062 --> 01:53:46,668
I know last year there was a planned field trip between the elementary school and the high school, and I almost missed the opportunity

1369
01:53:47,105 --> 01:53:49,447
to ask for the funding.

1370
01:53:49,907 --> 01:53:51,168
So I wanted to mention it now.

1371
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,689
I don't know if it's a good time.

1372
01:53:53,189 --> 01:53:57,252
But I wanted to mention that I did talk to Ms.

1373
01:53:57,292 --> 01:54:04,558
Lasky, and she was interested in doing another field trip between the elementary school and the vocational school, like the biotech.

1374
01:54:05,078 --> 01:54:07,420
She's going to be having another aquaponics.

1375
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,664
And I wanted to mention, I don't know if it's something that I should put on the agenda.

1376
01:54:12,924 --> 01:54:15,285
Because it would be something that we would be doing in the spring.

1377
01:54:17,013 --> 01:54:19,455
once they're all set with their program.

1378
01:54:19,915 --> 01:54:27,061
So that would be more appropriate for the current fiscal year, as opposed to the one that we just passed, because that year's over.

1379
01:54:27,301 --> 01:54:27,561
Right.

1380
01:54:27,581 --> 01:54:30,624
Now we're looking at this year's report to date.

1381
01:54:30,644 --> 01:54:30,724
Okay.

1382
01:54:32,728 --> 01:54:35,589
Okay, so okay, that's what I'll probably do.

1383
01:54:35,889 --> 01:54:36,569
We'll just accept 2016.

1384
01:54:36,809 --> 01:54:52,893
All those in favor of accepting the report and placing our file, we can move on to the next agenda item, which is the current year 2017, and we'll start with Mrs. Kretz's request.

1385
01:54:53,193 --> 01:55:02,575
I also wanted to mention that I wanted to make sure that it was extended to all the elementary schools who wanted to plan a field trip,

1386
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:17,503
The ideal grade seemed to be like the fourth grade or fifth grade level, because they could understand, and they were doing the science program very similar to the vocational biotech and engineering.

1387
01:55:18,224 --> 01:55:20,464
And they also went for a walk in the fells.

1388
01:55:20,764 --> 01:55:24,285
So they were old enough to understand in the same type of science program.

1389
01:55:25,265 --> 01:55:28,026
So I just wanted to make that mention.

1390
01:55:28,226 --> 01:55:32,207
I haven't heard from other elementary schools, but I think it was a great, great

1391
01:55:33,203 --> 01:55:34,304
and it was just wonderful.

1392
01:55:34,404 --> 01:55:38,627
I loved it and you know, I don't wanna forget and miss the opportunity, so I wanted to mention it.

1393
01:55:40,868 --> 01:55:41,628
And yep.

1394
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:43,689
Mr. Superintendent, would you like to?

1395
01:55:43,709 --> 01:55:46,291
So why don't we take that under advisement and see how we can do it, okay?

1396
01:55:46,311 --> 01:55:47,252
We'll get right back to you.

1397
01:55:47,492 --> 01:55:48,012
All right, thank you.

1398
01:55:48,032 --> 01:56:01,560
A motion on the floor to have the superintendent provide a report to the committee as to whether or not we can provide the elementary school children transportation for a field trip to our high school building.

1399
01:56:04,407 --> 01:56:05,728
by Mrs. Kretz, anyone?

1400
01:56:05,948 --> 01:56:06,328
Second.

1401
01:56:06,828 --> 01:56:08,428
Second by Mr. Skerry.

1402
01:56:08,809 --> 01:56:09,809
Motion to approve.

1403
01:56:10,869 --> 01:56:11,369
Aye.

1404
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:11,829
Aye.

1405
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:13,430
Aye.

1406
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:14,810
Motion approved.

1407
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:15,510
Thanks.

1408
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:18,671
I have one more question that's different.

1409
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:23,712
It has to do with the, and I know Pat, you, you helped answer the question.

1410
01:56:23,772 --> 01:56:26,613
It has to do with the MBTA, the S pass.

1411
01:56:27,293 --> 01:56:29,974
And I didn't know if there was,

1412
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:41,986
You know, if, you know, do we previously, you know, provide the middle schools with the S pass, like the MBTA S pass for students at the discounted rate?

1413
01:56:42,447 --> 01:56:51,552
I know I reached out to my niece who was, you know, when she was at Arlington in her middle school, she got the, you know, the discounted student pass.

1414
01:56:51,572 --> 01:56:58,776
So I didn't know if it was something that, you know, we did or we didn't do, and maybe some people are using it, you know, in addition to the high school.

1415
01:56:58,796 --> 01:57:00,617
Because I know we had the parent who was,

1416
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:04,402
asking if we did provide those passes.

1417
01:57:04,803 --> 01:57:11,568
And I just didn't know where that stood and if it was something that we were going to explore, getting those S passes for the students.

1418
01:57:12,188 --> 01:57:20,834
I did check around with the MBTA, and it is something that would have to go through the school system, not necessarily the MBTA.

1419
01:57:20,894 --> 01:57:24,697
But it would be something that would be managed between the school system.

1420
01:57:25,296 --> 01:57:27,297
you know, to, you know, to get those passes.

1421
01:57:27,577 --> 01:57:42,184
So I didn't know if it was something that we were going to pursue or maybe do like a survey to find out how many middle school parents would be interested in getting the pass, you know, to see if it was worthwhile to put forward for the next school year.

1422
01:57:43,604 --> 01:57:44,725
We have received emails.

1423
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:45,593
Yes.

1424
01:57:45,693 --> 01:57:56,835
And as I responded to, um, to both of your, all of your emails, I had several people, uh, we sell between three and 400 bus passes a month for the high school students to transport outside of the heights area.

1425
01:57:57,616 --> 01:58:02,477
And, um, we charge $30 a month for those passes of which we do not see any money.

1426
01:58:02,937 --> 01:58:03,657
We keep nothing.

1427
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:05,377
It all goes back to MBTA.

1428
01:58:06,037 --> 01:58:09,678
A few years ago, we did do the middle school passes as my understanding.

1429
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:12,412
We are taking it under consideration.

1430
01:58:12,972 --> 01:58:14,072
The need is very small.

1431
01:58:14,452 --> 01:58:18,433
I've literally had a handful of people ask for them only in the last two weeks.

1432
01:58:18,453 --> 01:58:22,754
And we're looking into whether or not we can do that and what it requires from us.

1433
01:58:23,195 --> 01:58:25,995
We don't have specialized MBTA equipment.

1434
01:58:26,455 --> 01:58:28,876
We do it all through our own computers and internet.

1435
01:58:29,396 --> 01:58:32,957
So it can be a little cumbersome because we're not using a Charlie card machine.

1436
01:58:33,757 --> 01:58:34,838
So we are looking into it.

1437
01:58:35,218 --> 01:58:38,159
And we should be able to get back to you in the next few days with a decision.

1438
01:58:38,459 --> 01:58:38,979
Perfect.

1439
01:58:39,059 --> 01:58:39,339
Thank you.

1440
01:58:40,258 --> 01:58:53,537
So there's a motion on the floor placed by Mrs. Kretz for a report from the superintendent as to a follow-up as to whether we can provide S passes to our middle school and any students attending Method Public Schools.

1441
01:58:54,258 --> 01:58:55,059
All those in favor?

1442
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:55,420
Aye.

1443
01:58:56,238 --> 01:58:57,299
I just had a question about it.

1444
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:57,979
Okay.

1445
01:58:58,579 --> 01:59:03,342
So the question was, I guess I didn't really understand one thing about the yes pass to the kids.

1446
01:59:04,082 --> 01:59:14,467
Um, can they get the physical pass and loaded at an MBTA station or do they, do we have to, do they have to bring us the money to load?

1447
01:59:14,967 --> 01:59:17,769
No, but they do have to be tracked and monitored by us.

1448
01:59:18,549 --> 01:59:20,250
So if they come and check out a card,

1449
01:59:20,876 --> 01:59:27,459
And if they lose the card, we are the person responsible for reactivating a new card and putting a stop on the old card.

1450
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:35,423
So if the card has any money at all left on it, and they come in and say it's lost, then we have to do the actual tracking, stopping, reinitiating.

1451
01:59:35,744 --> 01:59:37,064
So it is a cumbersome task.

1452
01:59:37,645 --> 01:59:38,445
And I have to tell you,

1453
01:59:38,878 --> 01:59:40,819
that our ratio of lost cards is quite high.

1454
01:59:43,021 --> 01:59:43,921
It's the population.

1455
01:59:45,622 --> 01:59:46,563
OK.

1456
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:46,803
Thanks.

1457
01:59:46,823 --> 01:59:50,926
So there's a motion on the board, second by Mr. Skerry.

1458
01:59:51,066 --> 01:59:52,327
All those in favor, say aye.

1459
01:59:52,667 --> 01:59:52,987
Aye.

1460
01:59:53,567 --> 01:59:54,228
All those against?

1461
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:55,749
Motion passes.

1462
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:58,951
Current fiscal year 2017 report.

1463
01:59:59,111 --> 02:00:00,492
All right.

1464
02:00:00,832 --> 02:00:03,654
Attached you'll find the summary financial report as of September 21.

1465
02:00:03,694 --> 02:00:07,977
10-month biweekly employees have received two checks since August 29.

1466
02:00:08,967 --> 02:00:19,669
While our 12-month employees have received six paychecks since July 1, most hiring has been completed, and new employees have finalized paperwork with a requisite Cori check and request for fingerprinting.

1467
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:27,531
Homeless, currently NPS provides educational programming to 18 homeless students, of which nine require transport.

1468
02:00:28,031 --> 02:00:30,712
All students requiring transport have these services in place.

1469
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:39,848
Online payments, the district continues the online payment system and this year has added the after school group to the FACS online payment system.

1470
02:00:40,549 --> 02:00:45,935
FACS provides families with the ease of their annual tuition divided by 10 equal monthly payments.

1471
02:00:46,796 --> 02:00:50,981
E-Community, a MCC product, handles fee-based programming online payments.

1472
02:00:52,122 --> 02:00:53,023
Special education.

1473
02:00:53,587 --> 02:00:56,949
Contracts and purchase orders are in process for all approved programming.

1474
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:06,396
FY 17 budget is initially established as 1.2 million general fund, 1 million idea grant funding, and the balance circuit breaker.

1475
02:01:07,017 --> 02:01:11,660
Additional encumbrance details provided at the close of the first quarter, which is right around the corner.

1476
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:15,923
Telephones, the VoIP system is established for the district.

1477
02:01:16,243 --> 02:01:20,546
Internal changes due to room moves and name changes are handled internally.

1478
02:01:20,967 --> 02:01:22,868
And to date, all changes have been completed.

1479
02:01:24,337 --> 02:01:28,439
Transportation MPS utilizes 18 buses running 2 a.m.

1480
02:01:28,459 --> 02:01:29,800
Routes and 2 p.m.

1481
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,840
Routes serving st.

1482
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,541
Joseph Catholic school st.

1483
02:01:32,581 --> 02:01:52,812
Raphael Catholic school That pick up at 230 stops routes have been reviewed for use and overcrowding we have made a few adjustments MPS k8 buildings and Eastern Bus Company are in the process of completing a manual student count that information will be used to update our trans finder system and

1484
02:01:53,207 --> 02:01:56,509
and provide us with the emergency list that we are really looking forward to.

1485
02:01:56,529 --> 02:02:07,197
I would also like to add that in response to the mayor's earlier report on the updated crossings, we added a stop to the route where the Brooks route goes by a high in Alston.

1486
02:02:08,138 --> 02:02:11,060
And we've made it so it's all right side pickup along that stretch.

1487
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:11,961
That's great.

1488
02:02:13,193 --> 02:02:33,975
Utilities the initial three months of the FY 17 budget year have been uneventful for utilities as In the past all buildings within district will be monitored and updates provided on a quarterly basis in Closing the first quarter of the school year is busy with grant closeouts and preparation to complete the state's end of year report FY 17 is progressing as expected

1489
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:39,262
And MPS will move forward with continued monitoring of the budget by my colleague, Ms.

1490
02:02:39,282 --> 02:02:39,762
Patterson.

1491
02:02:40,443 --> 02:02:43,304
I would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to serve Bedford.

1492
02:02:44,744 --> 02:02:45,145
Thank you.

1493
02:02:45,245 --> 02:02:46,045
Thank you, Pat.

1494
02:02:46,385 --> 02:02:47,145
Thank you.

1495
02:02:47,185 --> 02:02:47,746
Any questions?

1496
02:02:48,146 --> 02:02:49,026
Motion of approval.

1497
02:02:49,526 --> 02:02:49,867
Second.

1498
02:02:50,267 --> 02:02:52,448
I do have one question, or one comment.

1499
02:02:52,868 --> 02:02:58,230
Homeless transportation increased $50,000 in our budget for this year.

1500
02:02:58,390 --> 02:03:01,952
It's telling of the times that our families are going through.

1501
02:03:03,213 --> 02:03:06,856
I did speak with Representative Christine Barber about this yesterday.

1502
02:03:07,417 --> 02:03:17,526
There was an amendment in the state budget to set up a committee to track transportation and how we're paying for it as a commonwealth.

1503
02:03:17,987 --> 02:03:21,430
And I am hoping to be placed onto that committee.

1504
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:22,851
It hasn't been decided as of yet.

1505
02:03:24,788 --> 02:03:28,790
It's an increase in costs, and we have more and more homeless children in our districts.

1506
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:33,352
And I know how difficult it is to get rides for all of our children.

1507
02:03:33,392 --> 02:03:47,657
And I want to personally thank you for the work that you've done to make sure all our students have a ride to school and all the effort that you've put in, in transportation especially, because I know it's not generally something you would assume is your job.

1508
02:03:48,358 --> 02:03:53,940
And thank you for all your years of service and all the tremendous change you made in automating our school district.

1509
02:03:54,517 --> 02:04:06,525
in making things more easily understandable, and specifically, personally, teaching me how to read some of these papers and things, so I don't, while as a superintendent, owe so much.

1510
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:09,847
So, that's my own- Do I click Charter how to read this stuff?

1511
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:17,672
So now I figured out a few of my questions before I come here.

1512
02:04:17,872 --> 02:04:19,593
It was a little less stickies, but,

1513
02:04:20,561 --> 02:04:22,303
That's my only comment on tonight.

1514
02:04:22,383 --> 02:04:23,784
Christine, don't make that mistake.

1515
02:04:25,907 --> 02:04:26,708
And thank you again.

1516
02:04:26,728 --> 02:04:27,649
Thank you, Pat.

1517
02:04:28,129 --> 02:04:30,852
Motion is on the floor to accept and place the file.

1518
02:04:32,774 --> 02:04:34,076
To accept and place the file.

1519
02:04:35,017 --> 02:04:36,118
And all in favor?

1520
02:04:36,459 --> 02:04:36,779
Aye.

1521
02:04:36,939 --> 02:04:37,460
All against?

1522
02:04:39,222 --> 02:04:39,923
Motion passed.

1523
02:04:42,081 --> 02:04:51,268
negotiations and legal, oh, no, I'm jumping, report on 2016 MCAS Park test results and school accountability ratings.

1524
02:04:51,288 --> 02:04:54,190
So we're gonna call on our deputy superintendent to deliver this report.

1525
02:04:56,993 --> 02:04:57,653
Good or bad?

1526
02:04:59,334 --> 02:05:00,755
Hot off the presses, okay?

1527
02:05:00,816 --> 02:05:03,297
We just, you don't have these, so don't look for these in your package yet.

1528
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:05,919
Science.

1529
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,541
I'll take a three and a half ounce again.

1530
02:05:15,079 --> 02:05:21,482
So I think good is the overall word as we start to analyze all of this.

1531
02:05:22,283 --> 02:05:28,826
The information you have we couldn't give to you earlier because actually we just received it Thursday.

1532
02:05:29,326 --> 02:05:39,431
We had access to our scores on Thursday and again we started to analyze things as quickly as we could get things prepared.

1533
02:05:40,103 --> 02:05:43,365
All of this was embargoed until 5 o'clock this afternoon.

1534
02:05:43,425 --> 02:05:46,486
So this is why we can share it openly with you right now.

1535
02:05:47,307 --> 02:05:54,191
This is the first of what we anticipate to be several reports that we are going to give to the committee.

1536
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:59,393
As you know, there are a lot of different layers of analysis dealing with the state testing.

1537
02:05:59,914 --> 02:06:08,158
So we will, again, present what we have in terms of preliminary information in this report that we prepared for you with

1538
02:06:08,725 --> 02:06:12,086
Carolyn Joy, Nicole Chiesa, and Rocco Sieri.

1539
02:06:13,747 --> 02:06:28,591
Again, as you probably know, MCAS this past year was administered to just 10th graders in Medford in English and Mathematics, and it was the test, the only option for Science.

1540
02:06:29,531 --> 02:06:34,093
The Science MCAS exam is very different than the English and Mathematics.

1541
02:06:34,573 --> 02:06:37,254
The English and Mathematics MCAS is administered in grade 10,

1542
02:06:38,403 --> 02:06:47,426
It's kind of a test that's a cumulative test of what students have learned through the years up through grade 10, where the science high school test is different.

1543
02:06:47,946 --> 02:06:55,168
The science high school test a youngster takes after they complete a specific science course.

1544
02:06:55,789 --> 02:07:06,372
So what we try to encourage is that our ninth graders, most of whom take introductory physics, take the science MCAS introductory physics.

1545
02:07:06,967 --> 02:07:17,592
However, if a student doesn't take that, they can take the biology when they take the biology course, or they can take chemistry when they take the chemistry course.

1546
02:07:17,632 --> 02:07:23,494
So science MCAS is a little bit different, and it's been that way since its inception.

1547
02:07:24,555 --> 02:07:33,359
As you also know, we opted last year, we had a choice for the rest of the school district whether to take MCAS or to take PARCC.

1548
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,620
And we decided to take PARCC

1549
02:07:36,633 --> 02:07:43,679
We realized that the new MCAS 2.0 was coming quickly and that the old MCAS was not going to resemble that.

1550
02:07:43,899 --> 02:07:46,602
And the new test was going to be more park-like.

1551
02:07:47,162 --> 02:07:54,348
So we opted in grades three through eight in English and mathematics to have our youngsters be taking the park exam.

1552
02:07:55,730 --> 02:07:59,753
So what we have tonight are really two different reports.

1553
02:08:00,233 --> 02:08:02,035
One of them deals with accountability.

1554
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:08,753
All right, school and district accountability, and that again was embargoed until this afternoon.

1555
02:08:09,873 --> 02:08:15,396
And we're happy to report that we have moved up from a level three to a level two.

1556
02:08:16,056 --> 02:08:25,160
As you know, last year we had one school that was at level three, and because it takes just one, the entire district was into level three.

1557
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:28,341
That school has moved out of level three into level two.

1558
02:08:28,381 --> 02:08:29,582
We're quite happy to report.

1559
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:31,701
and the district is now level two.

1560
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:35,744
We'd like to be in level one, but again, we'll work towards that this coming year.

1561
02:08:39,267 --> 02:08:41,428
So, let's see, accountability.

1562
02:08:41,588 --> 02:08:42,569
How do they determine it?

1563
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:44,871
There are really two factors, and it's very complex.

1564
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:50,054
One of them is obviously student performance on the exams.

1565
02:08:50,635 --> 02:08:55,178
They give scores depending upon how students rate on the exams.

1566
02:08:55,861 --> 02:09:00,563
However, there's a second part of accountability rating, and that is your participation.

1567
02:09:00,983 --> 02:09:15,027
And this is where it gets a little bit tricky, because what they look for is a certain level of participation for the aggregate in the school, that's all the students, and then each subgroup that's reported out.

1568
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:22,930
Every year, they report out, they lower the number of students required to report out a subgroup.

1569
02:09:23,519 --> 02:09:32,727
It used to be 40, so in other words, you would not get a report on, let's say, special education unless you had 40 kids in the school.

1570
02:09:33,367 --> 02:09:36,450
They gradually over the years lowered it, so now it's 20.

1571
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:38,952
So the threshold for reporting out is now 20.

1572
02:09:39,933 --> 02:09:41,454
So that's what we're getting reports on.

1573
02:09:41,474 --> 02:09:48,580
So you get more and more subgroups reported out because more and more kids are making up 20 kids within that group.

1574
02:09:49,378 --> 02:09:57,079
So what happens with participation is that is factored into the whole accountability.

1575
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:05,021
So again, we basically have done well again with this meeting level two.

1576
02:10:05,481 --> 02:10:08,721
I wanted to share with you, we just got this just as we left this evening.

1577
02:10:09,461 --> 02:10:13,822
We were able to get the comparative accountability ratings of some of the districts.

1578
02:10:14,202 --> 02:10:18,723
We thought we'd like to share that with you because you might be interested in seeing how some

1579
02:10:19,547 --> 02:10:19,907
neighbors.

1580
02:10:20,087 --> 02:10:29,755
All right.

1581
02:10:29,775 --> 02:10:37,622
You can see once you get the sheet that, um, we're actually compared to neighbors doing quite well.

1582
02:10:37,642 --> 02:10:46,709
Um, Arlington, you see most of the accountability ratings are to, uh, Belmont is a one, but you have Arlington,

1583
02:10:47,425 --> 02:11:01,689
Burlington, Lexington, Linfield, Melrose, North Redding, Stoneham, Wakefield are all level two.

1584
02:11:02,249 --> 02:11:07,170
You will also see that other districts nearby, Somerville's a level three.

1585
02:11:08,311 --> 02:11:10,031
Malden's a level three.

1586
02:11:10,051 --> 02:11:13,512
All right, so those are a little bit lower than we are.

1587
02:11:14,432 --> 02:11:16,693
Again, many communities that are, you know,

1588
02:11:17,543 --> 02:11:22,605
demographically don't have the challenges that we have, are at level two.

1589
02:11:23,145 --> 02:11:27,646
So we feel that we're a pretty good company being able to hold to that level.

1590
02:11:28,086 --> 02:11:29,467
Point of information, Madam Chairman.

1591
02:11:30,307 --> 02:11:31,727
Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

1592
02:11:31,747 --> 02:11:37,089
If Salem's rated four, are they a prospect for receivership?

1593
02:11:37,929 --> 02:11:40,750
Salem actually moved from four to three.

1594
02:11:42,011 --> 02:11:43,231
So what you have here is 2015 and then 2016.

1595
02:11:43,291 --> 02:11:44,231
So you can see the movement.

1596
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:47,621
in communities.

1597
02:11:47,661 --> 02:11:56,304
So Salem actually kind of get itself out from under that four level because they were under scrutiny as a level four, but now they have progressed to level three.

1598
02:11:56,324 --> 02:11:57,504
All right.

1599
02:11:57,704 --> 02:12:03,426
See the Malden hasn't made any changes, but state pumps all kinds of money in there and it's nothing's happened.

1600
02:12:04,326 --> 02:12:05,126
What does that tell you?

1601
02:12:05,146 --> 02:12:12,889
Um, you know, you have, you, you have to work with the students that you have.

1602
02:12:12,989 --> 02:12:13,729
And I know that,

1603
02:12:14,449 --> 02:12:17,370
Every teacher in Malden probably works very, very hard with students.

1604
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:35,176
When you have ELL students, and I'm going to share with you what happened at the high school because it kind of highlights some of the problems that we have with this whole system, is that, you know, a place like Malden has a lot of ELL students, and those students are required to take the science test.

1605
02:12:35,236 --> 02:12:36,857
They're required to take the math test.

1606
02:12:37,317 --> 02:12:40,198
If they arrive the day before the test is administered,

1607
02:12:40,862 --> 02:12:46,005
So again, the only opt out they have is English, and that's only for one year.

1608
02:12:46,626 --> 02:12:51,549
So it's really, I mean, is it fair to these students for them to take this test?

1609
02:12:51,629 --> 02:12:51,849
No.

1610
02:12:52,589 --> 02:12:53,590
Are they required to?

1611
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:53,910
Yes.

1612
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:55,651
And therein lies the problem.

1613
02:12:55,691 --> 02:13:03,516
So I think what you're seeing in other communities, it's not that they're not spending their money wisely, or they're not following the curriculum, or their teachers aren't doing their jobs.

1614
02:13:03,796 --> 02:13:05,257
I think they all are doing that.

1615
02:13:05,357 --> 02:13:10,440
But the students that they're working with, sometimes the rules around who has to take the exam are not fair.

1616
02:13:11,143 --> 02:13:12,164
And I think we're seeing this.

1617
02:13:12,204 --> 02:13:17,727
So just to kind of share with you what happened at the high school, because high school is level two and it was level one.

1618
02:13:17,767 --> 02:13:18,828
And that's a concern for us.

1619
02:13:19,208 --> 02:13:20,669
But it's nothing to do with academics.

1620
02:13:21,049 --> 02:13:25,152
Because as we look at the scores of the MCAS scores, the high school did quite well.

1621
02:13:25,652 --> 02:13:31,096
In fact, in many cases, we moved a lot of kids into advanced from actually the lower levels.

1622
02:13:32,136 --> 02:13:34,678
What happened is the participation rate.

1623
02:13:35,098 --> 02:13:39,781
And it was only for one subgroup, okay, was the Latin Hispanic subgroup.

1624
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:44,612
And there were only 30, what, 32 kids in that subgroup.

1625
02:13:45,492 --> 02:13:47,652
And it had to do with the science test.

1626
02:13:48,693 --> 02:13:57,475
And what happened is because the smaller the sample you have of students, the more the statistics are going to be skewed by one or two students.

1627
02:13:58,195 --> 02:14:02,056
So we had three, four students who did not take that test.

1628
02:14:02,116 --> 02:14:08,757
And the reason they didn't take it is because they were ELL students and you can't take the science test

1629
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:12,622
unless you've taken the rigorous appropriate science course.

1630
02:14:13,162 --> 02:14:18,446
These ELL students, no way could they take introductory physics or biology the first year in this country.

1631
02:14:18,966 --> 02:14:27,451
So what we designed was a course called general science to give them science, but to build them up slowly so they could take the more rigorous courses.

1632
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:30,113
There is no general science MCAS.

1633
02:14:30,613 --> 02:14:36,557
Those students couldn't take the test even if they wanted to, okay, because they didn't take the appropriate course.

1634
02:14:36,917 --> 02:14:38,518
So what happened is that we

1635
02:14:39,192 --> 02:14:52,182
To be level one, you have to have a participation rate of 95%, which means that we have 32 kids, 30 kids would have had to take that test to get to the participation of 95%.

1636
02:14:52,222 --> 02:14:58,047
And again, we didn't have the kids taking the test, and that's what happened.

1637
02:14:58,087 --> 02:15:03,571
So we don't want to have the misconception that the high school academically declined.

1638
02:15:03,591 --> 02:15:04,132
It did not.

1639
02:15:04,172 --> 02:15:06,914
It actually, in many cases, made improvements.

1640
02:15:07,678 --> 02:15:09,800
This participation rate is very tricky.

1641
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:13,683
This is a subgroup, by the way, that was not reported out to us last year.

1642
02:15:14,283 --> 02:15:18,306
And this is a subgroup that tends to contain a lot of ELL students.

1643
02:15:18,967 --> 02:15:25,371
So, again, having no knowledge that this was a problem area, again, we need to pay attention.

1644
02:15:25,391 --> 02:15:36,680
We need to, as silly as it sounds, if we're going to try to reach for the goal, the level one, we have to put kids in courses

1645
02:15:37,408 --> 02:15:44,530
ELL kids in rigorous science courses, which I don't think is the right thing to do, and if we want them to take the exam.

1646
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:45,670
Otherwise, they can't take it.

1647
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:47,490
So it's a catch-22.

1648
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:51,431
It's a terrible situation that I don't know how we can work around.

1649
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:53,212
They're talking about changing accountability.

1650
02:15:53,672 --> 02:15:56,613
Let's hope they change it in that direction, because it's not fair to those kids.

1651
02:15:56,653 --> 02:15:59,633
So you might want to know that Boston Latin is level two.

1652
02:16:00,874 --> 02:16:01,534
Gives you an idea.

1653
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:03,654
It isn't an academic issue.

1654
02:16:03,995 --> 02:16:04,735
Participation.

1655
02:16:04,755 --> 02:16:05,995
It's a participation issue.

1656
02:16:06,686 --> 02:16:13,131
And we see it in Andover High School and a lot of other places that you would consider to be immune to this.

1657
02:16:13,491 --> 02:16:13,831
They're not.

1658
02:16:14,952 --> 02:16:17,114
This is a whole discussion that has to happen.

1659
02:16:17,954 --> 02:16:25,300
You may remember when AYP, annual adequate yearly progress, was the benchmark and everyone was going to be proficient by 2014.

1660
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:36,448
At some point around 2012, 80% of the schools couldn't make it, so they had to scratch it because it was an unrealistic target.

1661
02:16:37,325 --> 02:16:48,988
As long as you're going to set up some of these, these parameters that don't work for certain youngsters, you're going to have difficulty making it on the participation level or on the achievement level as well.

1662
02:16:49,468 --> 02:16:51,289
But this is what we're facing.

1663
02:16:51,329 --> 02:16:54,309
So there'll be some discussions at the state level about this.

1664
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:58,951
The new federal act ESSA gives the states more flexibility.

1665
02:16:58,991 --> 02:16:59,971
Let's see what they do with it.

1666
02:17:00,731 --> 02:17:03,952
Let's see how, what kind of discussion they have on that level.

1667
02:17:04,605 --> 02:17:10,589
Because obviously, if they don't have a discussion, you're going to see the same phenomenon as you saw with AYP.

1668
02:17:11,129 --> 02:17:13,211
There's going to be more and more districts that drop down.

1669
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:16,072
And that's not going to fly.

1670
02:17:17,393 --> 02:17:26,339
So I guess that comes down to, as a district, do you make an ELL kid suffer through a year of coursework that they can't understand at all?

1671
02:17:26,379 --> 02:17:30,122
Or do you put them in a more reasonable course where they can really learn something?

1672
02:17:30,262 --> 02:17:31,843
But then we run into this problem.

1673
02:17:32,570 --> 02:17:34,931
This is the catch 22 that we're dealing with.

1674
02:17:34,951 --> 02:17:36,771
But again, we are level two.

1675
02:17:37,132 --> 02:17:40,633
We'd like to be level one, but I think we've made progress on that.

1676
02:17:41,413 --> 02:17:44,054
And again, you have what our neighbors have done as well.

1677
02:17:44,454 --> 02:17:45,474
The state assessment.

1678
02:17:46,695 --> 02:17:56,778
The only comparisons we really can make right now would be with the MCAS, because we don't have data from PARC from last year to compare with the results last year.

1679
02:17:57,358 --> 02:17:59,619
So what the directors did is they prepared

1680
02:18:00,227 --> 02:18:03,429
Summaries, they did the highlights of the MCAS for grade 10.

1681
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:10,373
Because the science is grade 5, 8, and high school, Mr. Cieri did all three grade levels.

1682
02:18:10,433 --> 02:18:13,796
You can kind of read over the highlights, look at the data.

1683
02:18:14,116 --> 02:18:15,317
We have the data for you.

1684
02:18:15,897 --> 02:18:19,999
The park, because it's so new, we're still in the process of examining it.

1685
02:18:20,039 --> 02:18:23,902
We have numbers, but we're still trying to put some meaning to the numbers.

1686
02:18:24,602 --> 02:18:28,645
One of the things that you should know is that park is scored very differently.

1687
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,722
than MCAS, where MCAS has the four categories.

1688
02:18:32,702 --> 02:18:37,886
Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning, or Unsatisfactory.

1689
02:18:38,747 --> 02:18:43,590
The park is judged on a five point scale.

1690
02:18:44,190 --> 02:18:55,358
And so the designations are that somebody has exceeded expectations, met expectations, approximated expectations, partially met, and so on.

1691
02:18:55,438 --> 02:18:58,240
So it's a very, and we don't quite understand

1692
02:18:59,118 --> 02:19:00,158
all of the meaning behind that.

1693
02:19:00,178 --> 02:19:01,519
And that's what we're looking at next.

1694
02:19:01,639 --> 02:19:11,162
Now, we were told that there's not gonna be a state report in terms of how the students did statewide because some of the students still took MCAS.

1695
02:19:11,662 --> 02:19:17,744
So to do a comparison with state park results would leave out a lot of districts.

1696
02:19:18,184 --> 02:19:23,245
So we've been told, although I'm not sure that could change, that the state's not gonna give us a comparison figure.

1697
02:19:23,605 --> 02:19:25,726
So we may not even be able to say Medford did

1698
02:19:26,564 --> 02:19:34,051
So much better or so much worse in each category than the state, because we don't have that data right now, and we've been told we're not going to get it.

1699
02:19:34,111 --> 02:19:35,392
But we will be looking at that.

1700
02:19:35,952 --> 02:19:42,899
The student reports, all of them, MCAS and PARCC, will be arriving at our doorsteps in the next couple of days.

1701
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:47,042
Our plan is to get the results out to parents by the end of the week.

1702
02:19:47,603 --> 02:19:48,644
So that's kind of our plan.

1703
02:19:53,641 --> 02:20:01,962
Educators and teachers indicated the Department of Education, if the kids are having a problem with the science, why can't they take it in their native language?

1704
02:20:02,022 --> 02:20:05,343
It might give them a leg up so that they can further progress.

1705
02:20:07,083 --> 02:20:09,924
They used to have MCAS when it all started.

1706
02:20:10,024 --> 02:20:12,184
They used to have a Spanish version of it.

1707
02:20:12,664 --> 02:20:13,544
They did away with it.

1708
02:20:13,704 --> 02:20:14,805
This is for English and math.

1709
02:20:15,765 --> 02:20:22,386
They, the thinking with ELL is that, you know, these students have to be fully immersed in

1710
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:24,584
the language as soon as possible.

1711
02:20:24,604 --> 02:20:39,192
The testing though is, is it just bothersome because it's just like, you know, someone giving us a test in Arabic and we've only been here for, you know, it would be advantageous if they know there's a certain test that the kids can't pass.

1712
02:20:39,792 --> 02:20:44,355
Why not, you know, make it a little easier for them and then they can pick up speed along the way.

1713
02:20:45,596 --> 02:20:49,078
There's a, um, discussion between the house and the Senate.

1714
02:20:49,098 --> 02:20:49,498
They're both,

1715
02:20:50,126 --> 02:20:53,547
have different viewpoints on the bilingual or ELL laws.

1716
02:20:54,567 --> 02:20:58,588
Um, the Senate would like to change what the uns amendment did.

1717
02:20:58,688 --> 02:21:06,270
The house is still moving around on it a little bit and they haven't been able to reach a, uh, any kind of consensus.

1718
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:09,471
So there's a lot of ferment around this stuff right now.

1719
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:18,293
The other, the other thing I think that that becomes obvious to us is, is that, uh, these tests, you know,

1720
02:21:19,033 --> 02:21:26,736
Last year they tried to use something called the equity percentile to try to find some sort of crossover between MCAS and park.

1721
02:21:28,156 --> 02:21:35,019
We think it was a very full attempt to try and compare two very different tests and notice the state isn't going to do it this year.

1722
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:35,759
Right.

1723
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:44,742
Obviously somebody came to the same conclusion, even though, you know, last year we said to them, we don't think this works.

1724
02:21:45,603 --> 02:21:46,143
And, um,

1725
02:21:47,197 --> 02:21:57,079
I think they came to the conclusion that since they couldn't really compare all the districts, and we think to some degree that impacted our scores last year and impacted our rating last year.

1726
02:21:57,579 --> 02:21:59,799
That's just our thinking about it, but I can't prove it.

1727
02:21:59,879 --> 02:22:01,099
So, so be it.

1728
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:02,580
Mrs. Vanderhoof.

1729
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:09,121
Madam chair, since the results were just released this afternoon and school committee members have only received the preliminary report.

1730
02:22:09,501 --> 02:22:15,662
I think that with the information that was provided so far, um, by, uh, the deputy superintendent,

1731
02:22:16,279 --> 02:22:27,704
that at this point, it seems like it would be appropriate for us to move this to a subcommittee meeting when the rest of the analysis has been done.

1732
02:22:28,805 --> 02:22:32,266
So I'd make a motion to move it to the curriculum subcommittee meeting.

1733
02:22:34,047 --> 02:22:34,667
Second by?

1734
02:22:34,948 --> 02:22:37,369
Oh, could I just ask a question before we do that?

1735
02:22:38,589 --> 02:22:40,690
I had a question I was waiting to ask.

1736
02:22:41,571 --> 02:22:44,712
So I wanted to know, because I know the results are coming out this week.

1737
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:54,984
And so the parents or the students who are 10th graders, who are now juniors, they're going to get their results.

1738
02:22:55,064 --> 02:22:59,605
And they need to know if they have to take the retest as soon as possible.

1739
02:23:01,006 --> 02:23:06,628
How quickly is that information going to be made available to those parents and the students?

1740
02:23:07,628 --> 02:23:11,690
Because I know that there was prep work that was done, MCAS prep that's done.

1741
02:23:12,438 --> 02:23:14,880
And what are the plans for that?

1742
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:29,431
And are those students, if they have to take the retest, where the MCAS 2.0 isn't going to be out till next spring, the students have to take the retest coming up this November?

1743
02:23:29,451 --> 02:23:32,213
Because that's, I don't know the exact date, but it's November.

1744
02:23:32,854 --> 02:23:35,556
So what are the plans?

1745
02:23:35,596 --> 02:23:40,560
I mean, my son's a junior, and this is the big grade we're waiting for.

1746
02:23:41,042 --> 02:23:50,544
And I know there's a lot of other parents out there, so it's, you know, a lot of anxiety around that, you know, scoring and, you know, and where is the new test, you know?

1747
02:23:51,344 --> 02:23:51,564
Right.

1748
02:23:52,204 --> 02:24:00,426
The retest, first of all, would be the old MCAS test because the MCAS 2.0 is still in the developmental phases, okay?

1749
02:24:00,466 --> 02:24:01,346
So that's not ready.

1750
02:24:01,966 --> 02:24:05,787
I think they're very ambitious to think they're going to have it ready for the spring, but they're telling us they are.

1751
02:24:06,622 --> 02:24:08,303
The results will go home to parents.

1752
02:24:08,324 --> 02:24:16,070
As soon as we get those in tomorrow or the next day is when we've been told by the state, we'll get the principals to pick them up.

1753
02:24:16,871 --> 02:24:17,651
Labels are made.

1754
02:24:18,232 --> 02:24:19,353
Our goal is to ship them out.

1755
02:24:19,973 --> 02:24:24,237
If we get them on time this week, we're going to ship them out by Friday to everyone.

1756
02:24:24,337 --> 02:24:26,419
So people will know by next week.

1757
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:33,485
In terms of the plans to do the retest, again, this is just the high school level, obviously.

1758
02:24:34,083 --> 02:24:36,304
As you know, we don't have our academic support money.

1759
02:24:36,404 --> 02:24:37,385
They did away with the grant.

1760
02:24:37,785 --> 02:24:44,147
And the academic support grant used to support the MCAS prep, both for the 10th grade test and for the retest.

1761
02:24:44,588 --> 02:24:58,794
But I know that Mr. Blau and Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio are looking for ways to get those kids, whether we have to put some of the district money into this to get some tutors, we try to get those kids ready for that retest as soon as possible.

1762
02:24:58,814 --> 02:25:00,355
So they'll have a good month.

1763
02:25:01,853 --> 02:25:03,133
to be able to prep.

1764
02:25:03,253 --> 02:25:15,035
And I know the high school's already trying to be creative in finding ways we can use, find money to make sure these kids, because the MCAS academic support money was really very helpful.

1765
02:25:15,935 --> 02:25:16,315
It's gone.

1766
02:25:16,335 --> 02:25:20,976
And that's a concern, because that was a great program.

1767
02:25:21,036 --> 02:25:26,277
It was like a six-week program for the students who needed help with either math or the English.

1768
02:25:26,357 --> 02:25:30,938
And I don't know if I could make a motion that we

1769
02:25:31,398 --> 02:25:40,964
can make some budget money available for those students to get the prep and the assistance they need to help them so they can graduate.

1770
02:25:41,004 --> 02:25:46,627
Because this is a big deal, and students need the assistance.

1771
02:25:47,308 --> 02:25:49,029
Some of them struggle with testing.

1772
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:56,613
A lot of the strategies I know that the students learned was helpful, and the repetition.

1773
02:25:57,074 --> 02:25:58,895
And where there was a break over the summer,

1774
02:25:59,526 --> 02:26:04,128
You know, things are getting back into the swing of things.

1775
02:26:04,148 --> 02:26:08,169
I think it's definitely something that we need to make a priority for the students.

1776
02:26:09,349 --> 02:26:10,370
I will be with the high school.

1777
02:26:10,390 --> 02:26:16,412
As soon as we get the scores in and we see where we stand with the number of kids who have to take the retest, maybe we don't have anybody.

1778
02:26:16,452 --> 02:26:18,292
Maybe they all passed, which would be very nice.

1779
02:26:18,793 --> 02:26:22,094
But I'll meet with the high school staff next week.

1780
02:26:22,134 --> 02:26:22,934
We'll work something out.

1781
02:26:22,974 --> 02:26:25,395
There's usually not a huge number of kids.

1782
02:26:26,018 --> 02:26:29,880
So we'll find something that works, because we want them to get diplomas.

1783
02:26:32,321 --> 02:26:32,742
Thank you.

1784
02:26:32,962 --> 02:26:35,103
So there's currently two motions on the floor.

1785
02:26:35,143 --> 02:26:47,429
The first motion is to conduct an academic committee subcommittee meeting, where we can go over all testing results that were recently released.

1786
02:26:47,609 --> 02:26:48,590
Curriculum subcommittee.

1787
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:52,372
Curriculum subcommittee, sorry.

1788
02:26:52,472 --> 02:26:53,372
All those in favor?

1789
02:26:54,113 --> 02:26:54,193
Aye.

1790
02:26:56,437 --> 02:27:14,037
And we have a second motion by Mrs. Brents for the superintendent to provide us a cost report of implementing a six-week MCAS prep program, so that way, as quickly as possible, so we can help

1791
02:27:14,933 --> 02:27:16,094
all of our high school students.

1792
02:27:16,114 --> 02:27:18,715
I'm trying to assess how many students are involved.

1793
02:27:18,735 --> 02:27:20,096
Yeah, because we'll have to find out.

1794
02:27:20,316 --> 02:27:26,479
Do an assessment and a cost analysis of what you'd need from the school committee to be able to provide that program.

1795
02:27:26,519 --> 02:27:29,380
We'll get to that as soon as we get the results.

1796
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:30,781
Yes, exactly.

1797
02:27:31,641 --> 02:27:33,262
I need a second on that motion.

1798
02:27:33,402 --> 02:27:34,683
Second by Mrs. Cuneo.

1799
02:27:34,763 --> 02:27:36,083
All those in favor, say aye.

1800
02:27:36,183 --> 02:27:36,283
Aye.

1801
02:27:36,584 --> 02:27:37,264
All those opposed?

1802
02:27:37,884 --> 02:27:38,645
Motion passed.

1803
02:27:38,885 --> 02:27:41,206
Both motions have passed.

1804
02:27:41,666 --> 02:27:43,387
I need a motion to accept and approve

1805
02:27:46,041 --> 02:27:46,281
file.

1806
02:27:46,621 --> 02:27:48,342
Second.

1807
02:27:48,702 --> 02:27:49,543
All those in favor?

1808
02:27:49,963 --> 02:27:50,143
Aye.

1809
02:27:50,783 --> 02:27:51,524
All those opposed?

1810
02:27:52,284 --> 02:27:53,064
Motion carries.

1811
02:27:54,945 --> 02:27:59,827
Our next item is negotiations on legal matters.

1812
02:27:59,907 --> 02:28:01,508
There are none.

1813
02:28:02,169 --> 02:28:03,089
Old business.

1814
02:28:03,549 --> 02:28:07,711
We have selection of delegates for the MASC fall conference.

1815
02:28:08,311 --> 02:28:09,372
Mr. Superintendent.

1816
02:28:10,313 --> 02:28:14,536
just up to you to decide who you want to be the delegate on the, on the alternate to the conference.

1817
02:28:14,596 --> 02:28:17,017
At this point in time, we put it off from last meeting.

1818
02:28:17,057 --> 02:28:17,878
So we're on tonight.

1819
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:19,198
Mrs. Vanderclue.

1820
02:28:19,218 --> 02:28:22,380
Madam Chairman, I nominate Mrs. Vanderclue to be the alternate.

1821
02:28:25,082 --> 02:28:25,842
Mrs. Vanderclue.

1822
02:28:26,002 --> 02:28:27,884
Um, I accept the nomination.

1823
02:28:28,164 --> 02:28:31,586
And after discussion with Mr. Scurry, where he assures me, he will attend the meeting.

1824
02:28:31,606 --> 02:28:36,068
I nominate Mr. Scurry to be the delegate to the MAFC full conference.

1825
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:37,669
We have two nominations.

1826
02:28:37,689 --> 02:28:38,410
Do we have a second?

1827
02:28:39,683 --> 02:28:40,664
Do we need a second on that?

1828
02:28:41,605 --> 02:28:42,326
Oh, oh, okay.

1829
02:28:42,506 --> 02:28:42,946
I second.

1830
02:28:43,266 --> 02:28:45,208
Second by Mrs. Kretz.

1831
02:28:45,509 --> 02:28:46,329
All those in favor?

1832
02:28:46,489 --> 02:28:46,570
Aye.

1833
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:46,930
Aye.

1834
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:47,971
All those opposed?

1835
02:28:49,212 --> 02:28:49,993
Motion carried.

1836
02:28:50,033 --> 02:28:50,573
Roll call.

1837
02:28:51,534 --> 02:28:52,275
Roll call vote.

1838
02:28:53,476 --> 02:28:54,317
Mrs. Cuneo?

1839
02:28:54,357 --> 02:28:54,637
Yes.

1840
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,542
Mr. Benedetto?

1841
02:28:59,702 --> 02:28:59,982
Yes.

1842
02:29:00,062 --> 02:29:00,603
Mrs. Kretz?

1843
02:29:01,164 --> 02:29:01,404
Yes.

1844
02:29:01,464 --> 02:29:02,225
Mrs. Stone?

1845
02:29:02,405 --> 02:29:02,625
No.

1846
02:29:02,665 --> 02:29:03,005
Mr. Skerry?

1847
02:29:03,065 --> 02:29:03,406
Yes.

1848
02:29:03,646 --> 02:29:03,806
Ms.

1849
02:29:03,826 --> 02:29:04,387
Van de Kloot?

1850
02:29:04,447 --> 02:29:04,627
Yes.

1851
02:29:05,432 --> 02:29:16,295
So also on this report, we have a report from the superintendent on the cost involved in attending.

1852
02:29:18,256 --> 02:29:19,316
Mr. Superintendent?

1853
02:29:20,596 --> 02:29:24,678
So we gave you a report on the costs that are actually spelled out for you.

1854
02:29:24,878 --> 02:29:33,140
And if someone wanted to only go for one or two days, MASC indicated that we could talk to them about it, depending on what their numbers look like.

1855
02:29:38,122 --> 02:29:51,313
I just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote.

1856
02:29:51,353 --> 02:29:54,896
That's an important and very important piece of this conference.

1857
02:29:54,996 --> 02:30:01,202
It gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be seen and to be heard.

1858
02:30:03,055 --> 02:30:11,799
I'm not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less.

1859
02:30:12,379 --> 02:30:16,221
And I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members.

1860
02:30:16,881 --> 02:30:20,163
So I will inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.

1861
02:30:21,523 --> 02:30:22,364
Any other questions?

1862
02:30:23,624 --> 02:30:30,147
I'd like to make a motion at this time that the superintendent report back to the school committee, the total cost of all expenses.

1863
02:30:31,065 --> 02:30:32,706
with attending this conference.

1864
02:30:34,407 --> 02:30:35,147
I need a second.

1865
02:30:36,528 --> 02:30:37,048
I second.

1866
02:30:37,869 --> 02:30:38,709
Motion carried.

1867
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:41,150
All those in favor, say aye.

1868
02:30:41,170 --> 02:30:41,450
Aye.

1869
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:42,251
All those opposed?

1870
02:30:42,271 --> 02:30:44,972
Motion accepted.

1871
02:30:45,092 --> 02:30:48,074
Item approved to be placed on file.

1872
02:30:49,474 --> 02:30:50,295
All those in favor?

1873
02:30:50,575 --> 02:30:51,255
Aye.

1874
02:30:51,896 --> 02:30:52,816
That's accepted.

1875
02:30:53,376 --> 02:30:54,237
Communication?

1876
02:30:57,078 --> 02:30:57,378
None.

1877
02:30:58,779 --> 02:30:59,960
Oh, there is one.

1878
02:31:02,182 --> 02:31:06,224
I'm going to ask Mr. Skerry to read tonight's motion.

1879
02:31:07,384 --> 02:31:08,004
Mr. Skerry.

1880
02:31:18,289 --> 02:31:24,831
That the school committee extend its condolences to the family of Frank Andre, who passed away this week.

1881
02:31:25,992 --> 02:31:26,592
Frank's daughter,

1882
02:31:27,012 --> 02:31:29,214
Kara is a teacher in the special ed department.

1883
02:31:29,374 --> 02:31:32,117
Frank was very active in civic affairs in the community.

1884
02:31:32,917 --> 02:31:36,540
He had two great passions, horse racing and youth baseball.

1885
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:39,383
He was a little league coach in North Medford for many years.

1886
02:31:40,724 --> 02:31:44,247
Later years, he lived across the street from the park on Fulton Street.

1887
02:31:45,008 --> 02:31:49,792
And he was a 24-7 watchman and always had plenty of advice for the youngsters.

1888
02:31:50,821 --> 02:31:52,302
I consider Frank a good friend.

1889
02:31:52,382 --> 02:31:57,666
Frank would always call me and let me know what we're doing right here, what we're doing wrong, and how things should change.

1890
02:31:58,786 --> 02:32:04,430
Frank was also a candidate for this austere body in 1951 when my dad was serving.

1891
02:32:05,531 --> 02:32:06,452
He'll be sorely missed.

1892
02:32:06,972 --> 02:32:12,275
And again, our condolences go out to the Andre family, and I ask that we observe a moment of silence for Frank.

1893
02:32:12,315 --> 02:32:13,997
All those in favor?

1894
02:32:25,508 --> 02:32:27,090
Condolences to the family.

1895
02:32:27,671 --> 02:32:28,733
Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

1896
02:32:30,255 --> 02:32:32,358
That concludes our business for this evening.

1897
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:34,401
Meeting has been adjourned.

1898
02:32:35,823 --> 02:32:36,705
Motion to adjourn.
