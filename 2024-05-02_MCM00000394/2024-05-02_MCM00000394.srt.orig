00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:05,974
[SPEAKER_08]: 032 Committee of the Whole meeting Tuesday, July 25th, 2023 at 6pm is called to order.

2
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:09,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

4
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:21,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Six present, one absent.

5
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:24,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting is called to order.

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,806
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Tuesday, July 25th, 2023

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:47,073
[SPEAKER_08]: At 6pm in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom, the purpose of the meeting is to discuss citywide collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, organics, and recyclables awarded pursuant to a request for proposal number 23-0067, paper 23-032.

8
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:57,275
[SPEAKER_08]: The committee has invited DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and any additional representatives of the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to attend this meeting.

9
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,902
[SPEAKER_08]: For further information, aids, and accommodations, contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425.

10
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely yours, Nicole Morrell, Council President.

11
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:10,626
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Commissioner McGibbon and Director Hunt here to give us a presentation.

12
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get started, are there any questions from councilors?

13
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:22,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I will turn it over to you both.

14
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:26,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tap the mic just to turn it on?

15
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,218
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, sorry.

16
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It literally changes every week, so.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

18
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:42,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a relatively short presentation to give, and I'll turn it over to Alicia to start the presentation, and I'll take over at some point in the middle.

19
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:45,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, councillors.

20
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:50,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just, obviously you know about waste and recycling today in Medford.

21
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,632
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna recap RFP process that we went through, the RFP goals,

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,582
[SPEAKER_01]: the results and recommendations and what's ahead.

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:09,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be clear, I think that everybody is aware that the mayor needs the city council's approval to sign a 10-year contract.

24
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:16,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is on your city council agenda tonight, is the request to allow the signing of a 10-year contract.

25
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:22,859
[SPEAKER_01]: What our goal was was to provide you some information about what's in there, what's going on, what's the process here.

26
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:29,728
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you would feel more comfortable at that meeting and for us to have a little bit of time to actually discuss that now at this meeting.

27
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So I included this here just for completeness.

28
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:39,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

29
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know what we do for waste and recycling in Medford.

30
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:50,224
[SPEAKER_01]: We have weekly trash, every other week recycling, yard waste is 15 weeks plus one week of Christmas tree.

31
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:56,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently white goods are $26 for a curbside fee for pickup.

32
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:02,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents can have up to three bulky items picked up, collected every other week.

33
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:06,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And that costs the city about $25 an item.

34
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:14,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a very high rate of people calling and their item not being there when the waste management truck gets there.

35
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city still pays $25 an item.

36
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:23,508
[SPEAKER_01]: When that happens, we pay about $400,000 a year on that line.

37
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently residents can subscribe for the city recommended composting service.

38
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:30,051
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $99 a year.

39
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:36,874
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I just wanted to flag, this is a slide.

40
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:40,576
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not actually have this data for Medford or for the state.

41
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:48,199
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an EPA slide about the breakdown about what households are discarding annually.

42
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:54,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, 48% of what gets discarded is recyclable.

43
00:03:54,866 --> 00:04:01,348
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 15%, the orange, that's potentially reusable or recyclable.

44
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:11,010
[SPEAKER_01]: 12% is yard waste, yard trimmings, and 22% is food scraps, which really only leaves a small amount that truly, truly has to go in the garbage.

45
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:17,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Now things vary from area to area about what can actually be recycled, but this is the,

46
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: in a big picture.

47
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:30,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're also aware that we've been working on hauler regulations that we've had mandatory separation of recyclables since 1992.

48
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:45,859
[SPEAKER_01]: This meant the hauler regulation that we worked on will require permitted trash holders to provide recycling service so that they can't just pick up trash from say apartment buildings without also

49
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,062
[SPEAKER_01]: basically providing recycling for one bundled rate.

50
00:04:50,663 --> 00:05:00,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand from our Director of Board, at our last meeting about that, there was some question about our Board of Health regulations and that there were definitions that were different.

51
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:11,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand from our Director of Public Health that the Board of Health has actually voted and adjusted their regulations to be in line with what is proposed in front of the City Council.

52
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Councilor Kitt was there

53
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:19,897
[SPEAKER_01]: at that meeting, and I was not, so I couldn't speak to it any more than to say I know that that is in process.

54
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,720
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually, we feel like, an important step as part of this process.

55
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:32,306
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the RFP, last summer and fall, we had our Solid Waste Task Force, and we did community outreach.

56
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:37,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank the number of members of the task force who are actually on the Zoom tonight.

57
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw a couple of them before I started sharing my screen.

58
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:50,931
[SPEAKER_01]: We drafted and released an RFP over the winter, we received proposals this spring, and this summer we have been doing contract negotiations.

59
00:05:53,452 --> 00:06:09,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal of the RFP, controlling costs was number one, creating fairness and transparency regarding our service recipients, expanding our recycling and composting options, and providing services comparable to neighboring communities,

60
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,742
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm streamlining the transition of continuity of service without interruptions.

61
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:21,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to move Medford towards zero waste and decrease the multiple haulers in the business districts.

62
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm turning it over to you here.

63
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:27,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Asia.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing a great job in meeting our goals.

65
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:38,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's really important up until we started evaluating the RFP.

66
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those goals, you know, we weren't 100% sure if we were going to be able to reach them, but we're we're on track.

67
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's great news.

68
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,741
[SPEAKER_06]: The results of the RFP are

69
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:57,635
[SPEAKER_06]: They're summarized here, but in this is, you know, these are three important bullet points that I think are, we think that are quite important to share.

70
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:04,799
[SPEAKER_06]: If, for example, if we were to go to weekly recycling, we discovered that it would cost an approximate about a million dollars extra per year.

71
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,061
[SPEAKER_06]: The weekly food composting that we're heading towards is going to cost us about

72
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:11,755
[SPEAKER_06]: a million dollars per year.

73
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we move to every other week trash, we're going to save about a million dollars per year.

74
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:22,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're proposing to start that in year three to have a transition period.

75
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:32,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So just so everybody's clear, we're not recommending weekly recycling at this point, but we did want to understand what that would cost.

76
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason is because that minimal increases in materials recycled based off of analysis is that nasty he's done and others in national research.

77
00:07:51,565 --> 00:08:03,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So the weekly food scraps composting piece, you know, another thing that we've discussed in the past with you is trash has a lot of, today has a lot of food scraps in it.

78
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:04,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Food scraps are heavy.

79
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you remove the food scraps out of your trash, then your trash is lighter, you have less of it.

80
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:16,428
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't fester as quickly, it doesn't become a nuisance as quickly.

81
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:23,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the directions that we're headed here and that's what we've heard from the community and that's where we're headed.

82
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:35,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the transition piece I mentioned is important too, since we are realistic in the idea that we can't wave a magic wand and have the entire city start composting their food scraps all at once.

83
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question on number three about the every other week trash.

84
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

85
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:53,907
[SPEAKER_02]: If when we get to that third year and we realize it's not working, are we able to change it to go to a weekly thing?

86
00:08:53,948 --> 00:09:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: If we realize that when we start to maybe after six, seven months, it's not working out, are we able to?

87
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll be entering a contract with waste management and I think

88
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we'd have to have that discussion if it's not working and it's just had itself.

89
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, no one's picking up composting and it's not paying off the way we think.

90
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:16,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the every other week.

91
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would start in year three.

92
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

93
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we realize that maybe, you know, three or four or five months into it, it's not working.

94
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:24,168
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is yes.

95
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:27,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to be able to opt back into a weekly trash pickup?

96
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we would be able to do that.

97
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't be able to do that in the composting.

98
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would have to make some hard decisions at that time.

99
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have a significant budget impact.

100
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:48,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we literally could do composting and every week trash, but that would have a million dollar budget impact.

101
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:50,897
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't recommend that.

102
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question that same thing just as we started so if it.

103
00:09:57,635 --> 00:10:05,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to every other week trash would there be an option like right now if folks have a ton of recyclables they can go to the dpw yard is there an option there I'm like literally being very specific.

104
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:09,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a one year old I have lots of diapers like.

105
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:16,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Food, great, we can get the food out, that has saved us a ton, we already do composting, but something like that, not necessarily want around.

106
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:29,533
[SPEAKER_06]: The overflow bags wouldn't go away, and also an extra bin that you'd have to pay for wouldn't go away, so there would be options if you are generating more trash, but it would be a cost to the resident.

107
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:33,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but there would be no other way to remove the trash in that in-between week.

108
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:40,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm just saying, because right now, if I have a ton of recycling, I can go to the DPW yard and drop off that recycling before the next pickup.

109
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:50,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say we have not discussed an option that would... So we had actually conceptualized, could there be a way to do it?

110
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:56,271
[SPEAKER_01]: The difficulty would be the truck would run this route this week and that route that week.

111
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have a truck hit one person's house,

112
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,552
[SPEAKER_01]: would be really expensive.

113
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,495
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're not... Could someone... A drop-off location?

114
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:05,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

115
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's probably a slippery slope.

116
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:08,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a question.

117
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:11,301
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not currently contemplated a drop-off location.

118
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:15,466
[SPEAKER_01]: We have contemplated overflow bags that people could choose to purchase or

119
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:26,964
[SPEAKER_01]: an extra bin if you had, so I actually had a neighbor with two in diapers and he ordered an overflow bin that he used for the year that he had two children in diapers.

120
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:27,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah.

121
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

122
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, if I can.

123
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Councilor Scarpella, and then we'll go to Vice Mayor.

124
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so is the, thank you, through the Chair, is the food scrap pickup program, is that a weekly program?

125
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that would be a weekly program.

126
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

127
00:11:50,133 --> 00:12:00,921
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I'm really nervous about, especially this past week, I think that we've gotten so many phone calls and I'm sure that the Board of Health has gotten a lot of phone calls.

128
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:07,626
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing a huge uptick on the rat populations and what's happening with the rat problem in the community.

129
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:08,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that

130
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:31,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a couple of things that, as we're moving forward with this RFP and what the asks are, I find a few difficult, you know, concessions here and looking at not everybody, although we want everybody to recycle more, but having every two weeks, having a pickup of trash, I don't think that's,

131
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:43,775
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a real big problem considering right now when we're being asked to vote on this issue without really getting the true input from the whole community.

132
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:52,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is what we had an issue years ago when Mayor McGlynn put this program out.

133
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:55,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that I think that

134
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You really have to try to sell me on this because I, you know, the every other week trash in three years, unless we have a grasp on what's going on with the rat population and what we're doing here in the city with the rats.

135
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:12,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think that's, that's a dangerous situation.

136
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:22,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, and that's brings another question I had from a lot of people that did contact me about the food scrap and going with the composting that way.

137
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:32,962
[SPEAKER_03]: is one resident put it as, we're now having drive-through separate containers for our rats for their consumption.

138
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:42,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know the reason why we're doing this, but I think that a million dollars, if you look at the big picture,

139
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:59,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The problems were going to that are going to rise because of, you know, pick up once a week I think that, you know, not, not, not really thinking it through of what the process would be if there were, or there was needed to be drop offs, per se.

140
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, this is a good meeting.

141
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great meeting to get things rolling, but I can't see us voting on this tonight for the fact that here we are in end of July.

142
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:19,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the most part, most of the community hasn't heard about the process or what the RFP states.

143
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'll have more later, but thank you.

144
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

145
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:31,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be clear operationally about the procedure.

146
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:44,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, this is a 10 year contract and there's an option in the contract to move from weekly trash to every other week trash, and that reduces the annual payment by about a million dollars, plus or minus whatever the annual adjustments are.

147
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're choosing, we're making a plan to exercise that option in year three or in the contract that says we are going to exercise the option in year three.

148
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:56,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me answer that first and then I'll go back to the rats.

149
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:06,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually what is literally written in the contract and I had the, so our consultants are also on the line in case there's questions and we actually also have a representative from MassDEP on the line.

150
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:14,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is literally written in the contract is that there is an option to go to every other week trash

151
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be decided six months before July 1st, 2026.

152
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:26,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So six months before that, we have to decide if we're ready to move to every other week trash and it would have a budget impact.

153
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:32,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we would, that would need to be part of that, but no, it is not locked in stone that we have to.

154
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:41,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we said we are moving that way and we can see, so actually I was also gonna talk to sort of this phase in that we were talking about, but we're not ready.

155
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:42,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough adoption,

156
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:54,869
[SPEAKER_01]: we could say, let's push that back a year, let's stick one more year with weekly trash, we'll take the budget hit, and then switch to every other week trash the year after that.

157
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:07,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could say people aren't, so I think it would also be helpful to speak to the composting, but I do wanna actually just address the rats first, and then let's go back to the money, because Councilor Scarpelli asked about the rats first.

158
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:26,792
[SPEAKER_01]: We, the Board of Health has found that the toters, they're smaller with locks on them that are used for the composting, have been more successful in keeping out rats and raccoons than the large things that we have trash in.

159
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:39,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Where a raccoon can climb up, and we've had photos of it, I've seen it out my own window, and literally the raccoon can open a trash can, one of our waste management trash cans, and go in there and pull the trash out

160
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:44,927
[SPEAKER_01]: The toters for the compost have very simple locking lids in them.

161
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:49,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I could have, we have the one up in the hallway upstairs.

162
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:50,690
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have David go get that.

163
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind?

164
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I'm talking about?

165
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:56,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, David's one of the interns in our office who's been helping us with this.

166
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:06,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very easy for a human to use lock, but the rats and the raccoons have not figured out how to get that open.

167
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:20,535
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic on the composting bins is thick enough that we do not have examples of rats eating through the composting toters that have been in use in the city of Medford.

168
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,576
[SPEAKER_01]: There are buckets in some communities.

169
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:30,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Our board of health said no to the buckets because they did find that rats were eating through the lids of those buckets.

170
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:37,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why in Medford, if you were to subscribe to one of these companies, you're only allowed to get the toter that's per our board of health.

171
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:47,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe that moving, or we have found that moving the trash out of the garbage cans and into these toters actually helps with the rat problem.

172
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:52,210
[SPEAKER_01]: The other issue with rats is business, and we'll talk about that a little bit later as well.

173
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:56,033
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the way we wanted to address composting.

174
00:17:56,073 --> 00:18:02,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we have 1,200 households in Medford paying for weekly composting.

175
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, I'm gonna say, oh, I printed it.

176
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:09,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you use the lock?

177
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no one can see it because we're sharing screens.

178
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:12,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

179
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:14,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to turn off screen share for a minute.

180
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:18,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see this.

181
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:23,250
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really easy.

182
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:32,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So like anybody can when you push on this, you don't have to have good hand strength or anything to push.

183
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So even elderly, it's easy to push.

184
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:37,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we turn it, let's see if you can see there.

185
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:38,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Shane.

186
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,730
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't quite see, but there's a little lip on there.

187
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:49,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, this is what, and we do have this, it's actually up in the hallway upstairs.

188
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,257
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't mean to be advertising for any one company.

189
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:59,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the companies that do provide this service in Medford right now use the exact same toter from the same company.

190
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:03,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one is, this one is branded by one of the companies.

191
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:13,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is that we believe, hold on, when we did the survey, does it say the survey?

192
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it did.

193
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:21,518
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% said they would definitely, oh, well, that was actually the moving to every other week trash.

194
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:28,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually had a lot of people say they were interested, I could call it up if we wanted, in composting.

195
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:35,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, only 25% of the population said they were not interested in composting.

196
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,032
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was with no outreach, no education.

197
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:39,213
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the survey.

198
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people were in that, Alicia?

199
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be interested to know.

200
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:49,380
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey was about 850 people responded to it.

201
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

202
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

203
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually I realized I should go back to screen sharing.

204
00:19:56,206 --> 00:20:02,430
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

205
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:16,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did the RFP, we heard from several composting companies, and they felt strongly that what we should do is an opt-in program for the first couple of years and have people sign up.

206
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,166
[SPEAKER_01]: This is based on the model that Boston did.

207
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:29,049
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have an opt-in program where they have a cap on how many people can opt in in the first year, in the second year, and then in the third year.

208
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:37,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea would be, we believe that we could have 8,000 households sign up in year one, and then 12,000 in year two.

209
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:49,934
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 19,770 households on our waste program right now, so that then at that point in year three, we think we could roll in the rest of the households.

210
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:57,355
[SPEAKER_01]: If we found in year two that we were not at 12,000 households, that we were at 6,000 households composting,

211
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:06,541
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost companies would charge us a weekly rate per household rather than a rate for the whole city.

212
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:14,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ramp up our costs by only paying for the number of subscribers in year one and year two.

213
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:22,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like a critical mass point at which it's cheaper to pay for the whole city than per person because of the way math works.

214
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we would switch.

215
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:35,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this is what our, we would have real metrics to be able to have a good understanding if we were ready to switch to universal in year three.

216
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

217
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:48,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you be interested in moving to every other week trash collection if you had food scraps collection?

218
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And the online survey said 20,

219
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:55,350
[SPEAKER_01]: 21% said yes and 20% said maybe.

220
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we talked about it at the workshop, the numbers changed.

221
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:12,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 60% saying yes and 15% maybe, and at that point only 25 no, and that was actually just discussing the program during a workshop for the evening.

222
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:15,303
[SPEAKER_01]: That many changed their minds.

223
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:18,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

224
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:20,466
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

225
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:22,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to you, I was letting you.

226
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's fine.

227
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:31,939
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so I think Alicia went over this pretty well, and we also went over how this isn't set in stone.

228
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's not panning out with this plan, then we do have the option of changing how we do it.

229
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's important for everybody to know, right?

230
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:46,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we have anything else on this slide that we need to talk about.

231
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:46,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

232
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:59,728
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we want to bring to your attention is a piece of resident-like businesses and residents.

233
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:09,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you're a resident-like business, like a small business out there that generates enough trash that it's almost like a resident or even less, you'd be included in the program.

234
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:20,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you are a building with four or fewer units, you would be eligible for the weekly food scraps composting collection service as part of that collect the city's collection services.

235
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:25,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And that three-year approach is just a recommendation for now, like we said.

236
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,177
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I think we go to the next slide.

237
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So currently our budget is $7.6 million approximately.

238
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:46,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Years one through five, we're looking at 7.7 per year average and years six through 10, 8.7 per year average.

239
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:56,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are some numbers that we're working hard on to fit what we wanna do in a reasonable escalation

240
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,921
[SPEAKER_06]: based off of our current budget.

241
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:12,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not trying to, in other words, we're trying not to have the annual budget for waste collection increase, which is part of the cost goals.

242
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the things that we've achieved, we believe that the new system will be fair and transparent.

243
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:22,355
[SPEAKER_06]: The process thus far, fair and transparent.

244
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:31,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Food waste composting services is included and as Alicia mentioned, it builds off of experiences of other municipalities in areas such as Boston.

245
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:37,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We're targeting yard trimming compostings, April through December.

246
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we heard loud and clear is folks want more yard trimming pickup.

247
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the reality of it is that particular service is getting more expensive.

248
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are currently working with waste management to get those costs reasonable.

249
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the,

250
00:24:56,123 --> 00:25:04,569
[SPEAKER_06]: The ways we're doing that is contracting directly with a contractor and not having waste management sub it out.

251
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:07,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have some significant savings that way.

252
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:12,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So there very well may be a third contract associated with this.

253
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:20,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So one for trash and recyclables, one for food scraps composting, and one for yard waste composting.

254
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:33,428
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that we're going with waste management, insurance continuity, I think, you know, I know in my office, we're very used to working with waste management, the folks there and the processes that they have.

255
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:35,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a nice perk.

256
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:42,574
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other goals that we have is bringing the city towards zero waste.

257
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:51,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So we believe that this set of contracts would be taking a big giant step over the next decade towards zero waste.

258
00:25:53,313 --> 00:26:22,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things we haven't really mentioned quite yet is, you know, some of the, for example, the business districts and there are other situations in the city where we want to provide a way to get from having many, many toters out in the street to containerized situations that are better for things like rats, better at making the squares look nicer,

259
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that.

260
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working on a preferred hauler system, where there are rates that are pre negotiated, that that businesses can take advantage of.

261
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working very closely with Waste Management to work those rates out.

262
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically provide a discount.

263
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:46,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

264
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:51,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim, how many cities and towns actually do commercial trash for free?

265
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:53,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the norm.

266
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the norm.

267
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:59,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at some point, we're going to get up with making the commercial people pay.

268
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is about.

269
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is what exactly what this is about.

270
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't want to pull the rug out from under him, so to speak.

271
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying to provide a soft landing.

272
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to

273
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:15,468
[SPEAKER_06]: work a transition and the preferred holiday program is a critical piece of that.

274
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have pre negotiated rates that we can offer businesses that need to transition off a city system, would they would they be able to pick up the commercial crash in the evening, the commercial district so they don't have to leave it out all night.

275
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Things like that we can certainly work out.

276
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't.

277
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:40,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you know we've all driven to the square and we've seen crash blown all the place in boxes and stuff.

278
00:27:40,557 --> 00:27:40,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

279
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:41,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unsightly.

280
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:42,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

281
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:46,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is something that we're through this process into this contract we're trying to solve.

282
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to happen immediately.

283
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,781
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some work to do there.

284
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:55,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And an example of some work to do is space, space for dumpsters, space for collection.

285
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:57,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all businesses have enough space.

286
00:27:58,246 --> 00:28:15,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there will be some sharing, there will be some, potentially some space, some city-owned space set aside, like a parking space or two in a targeted area with a dumpster, as opposed to having the sort of bagged mess that you see today.

287
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:23,626
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think we can go to the next slide.

288
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's next?

289
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:40,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, as Alicia mentioned, we're negotiating, which is taking some serious amount of time between Alicia and myself, our consultants and waste management.

290
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:46,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've already 12 hours or something of negotiations, and we're continuing to do that.

291
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:50,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We're well on our way and things are looking great.

292
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:57,518
[SPEAKER_06]: The scope B contract that's mentioned here would be the food waste contract.

293
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:09,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's coming next because that negotiation is going to hinge upon where exactly we land with our scope A or trash and recycling contract.

294
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So they impact each other, it's all the same budget.

295
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:31,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would execute that in July, August 2023 fall winter 2023 was starting outreach, and that's going to be a big part of this as Alicia showed you, or discussed, once you educate people on how this will actually work and and.

296
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:39,670
[SPEAKER_06]: What it actually means, people start turning over to the side of food scrap composting.

297
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So we believe that will continue.

298
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:48,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the trend that in general we're headed as I think a larger community, not just Medford.

299
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,976
[SPEAKER_06]: July 1st, 2024, new contract begins, including food composting.

300
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:57,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, the hauler ordinance goes into effect.

301
00:29:57,758 --> 00:29:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's important for the preferred hauler program.

302
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:05,417
[SPEAKER_06]: July 1st, 2026, that is the target for every other week trash begins.

303
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:22,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully by that point, we have enough folks on the composting and we've done our job with education and outreach where folks are a lot more comfortable with the idea of their dry trash goods getting picked up

304
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:31,269
[SPEAKER_06]: every other week and the heavy food scraps and compostables getting picked up every week.

305
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the plan.

306
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think we can move on to the last slide.

307
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:41,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.

308
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:48,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We're open to questions and we, like Alicia said, we have our consultants on board and we have an SDEP here too.

309
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:52,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So answer whatever questions you have, try to.

310
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:53,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Carvilla.

311
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:54,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

312
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a couple of my opinions.

313
00:30:58,092 --> 00:31:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about the bulk items that we pick up for free.

314
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:01,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

315
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we cut that down to maybe to one?

316
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:07,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so honestly, I apologize.

317
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:09,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was one of the slides in here.

318
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the memo that we sent out to councilors.

319
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the plan, what we have strong recommendation from the haulers, they have found that when we charge residents for the bulk items, even a portion of the cost,

320
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:33,383
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is a dramatic drop in one, the number of items that they asked to have picked up, and two, the number of times they call, make an appointment, and then don't put their item out.

321
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:42,333
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that a number of those that we're being charged for are actually people not putting it out, calling a second time and putting it out then.

322
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They see a dramatic drop off.

323
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recommendation is that we split the cost.

324
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:49,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten them to keep the cost.

325
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:51,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now the city gets charged $25 an item.

326
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:55,651
[SPEAKER_01]: They are willing to go up to just $26 an item.

327
00:31:56,011 --> 00:32:03,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And the recommendation is that we share the cost with the residents and waste management would do the billing.

328
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would actually, a resident calls, tries to schedule it.

329
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Waste management would take their credit card number for

330
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:15,624
[SPEAKER_01]: A number we choose, I think we're recommending somewhere between $13 and $15 an item, and then they put that item out.

331
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:26,000
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll find that they think that can actually drop our $400,000 down much lower under $100,000 for bulk items.

332
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:37,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe if you give them one for free and in charge for the other two, you know, the $13,000 nominal fee, I think that's more than, well, it's something that people put it all, then people come by at night and pick it up.

333
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens a lot of times too.

334
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It does happen that they get picked up by other people.

335
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:46,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut that down to maybe one for free

336
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:51,630
[SPEAKER_02]: and the nominal fee for everything else after that, I think we can live with that.

337
00:32:51,771 --> 00:33:01,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We also find that people are dramatically incentivized to try putting it out on everything is free or to giving it away or donating it if there is a small charge associated with it.

338
00:33:02,017 --> 00:33:07,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be clear, this would be every single, there'd be no free one, it would be everything's 13 bucks a resident?

339
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,403
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what our recommendation is from this, this is to recommend for everything.

340
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And white goods is staying at

341
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been $26 an item, it stays at $26 an item.

342
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:19,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's for the white goods.

343
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:21,295
[SPEAKER_01]: That's white goods.

344
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:22,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the bulk items.

345
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:23,515
[SPEAKER_01]: For the bulk items, yes.

346
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:26,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe if you give just one bulk item per year.

347
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:27,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying none.

348
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:29,077
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying all the bulk items would be 13.

349
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give any bulk items?

350
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:35,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the recommendation, particularly in best practice from DEP.

351
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also simpler for people to include a nominal fee.

352
00:33:41,273 --> 00:34:08,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we go on to the every other week pickup, I'd like to see something at the DBW similar to like we have with the cardboard, because I know myself, I can, there's probably times, maybe around the holidays and stuff like that where people have a lot of trash, have a receptacle down there that people could buy the bag and,

353
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:10,485
[SPEAKER_02]: and bring it down there.

354
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:25,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the few times a year that your barrel does get full, I think that'd be, that'd probably save a lot of heartache for a lot of people rather than, you know, let the stuff pile up all over the place and, you know, just drop the bag down.

355
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:30,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have it open on a Saturday or so, a Monday to Friday, just to make sure there's someone there.

356
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:35,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So non-residents don't put stuff there, but everything that goes in there must be in the bag that we provide.

357
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we'll have to, and actually,

358
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:42,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the light.

359
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:50,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like, um, sorry, because that also reminded me it's something that we didn't put into our slides, but something else that we have negotiated in this contract with waste management.

360
00:34:51,181 --> 00:35:00,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for interrupting your list is a twice a year drop off day where they would organize it, they would have all the vendors there.

361
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:27,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you normally have to pay $25 for a white good, you would still have to pay $25 for a white good and why you would bring it, I don't know, but we would have all the hard to recycle items, all the fabric, all the, so we'll continue to have textile pickup, but for them to organize like a hazardous waste and paint and electronics recycling and textile and have everything there in one place, but not organized by our staff.

362
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:29,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Our staff would be there to keep an eye on things

363
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:34,666
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wouldn't have to set all of that up, that they would set it up and run it for us twice a year.

364
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with the yard waste.

365
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:45,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we pick it up certain times of the year, but the leaves continue to come after those couple of weeks.

366
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:55,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So if maybe at some point they could provide a dumpster or some type of compactor where people can bring the yard waste down to the DPW yard.

367
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:56,753
[SPEAKER_02]: on their own.

368
00:35:56,953 --> 00:36:14,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're looking at with this contract is approximately April through December right now we end in November and that's a problem for people, but to have more pickups into December, and then in January, and one of the things that I'm very interested in is they're interested in doing in every other week.

369
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:20,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So your yard waste would be picked up on the opposite week of your recycling, so that you would know the schedule.

370
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:23,062
[SPEAKER_01]: They would do half the city each week.

371
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:31,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll also cut down on the times that there's totally overwhelmed and don't get to your house for two more days by subcontracting to another company we're hoping.

372
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:40,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, they've said they would like, they're happy for us to contract directly with Save That Stuff for that, that pickup.

373
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:48,778
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea being that it could be, if we did 20 weeks, it would be every other week from April through late December plus one,

374
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:54,525
[SPEAKER_01]: two-week window in January where half the city one week and half the city the other for the Christmas trees.

375
00:36:55,886 --> 00:37:00,888
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to negotiate with Save That Stuff if that January pickup could be more than Christmas trees.

376
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:05,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had another bag of yard waste, could you put that with your Christmas tree?

377
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:13,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have to meet with them and discuss that with them, but this way would be a lot easier for people to remember when their pickup is.

378
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:16,995
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 weeks is recommended by DEP as the

379
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:19,517
[SPEAKER_01]: best practice.

380
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:28,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at potentially 16 weeks for a couple of years simply because of the cost difference between 16 weeks and 20 weeks for the city.

381
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,841
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's currently part of the negotiation we're doing.

382
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:41,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's what the case it, I think it would be better would it be beneficial to have a compactor at the city yet so people can bring this stuff down there.

383
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially, I think that's on the table.

384
00:37:45,107 --> 00:38:07,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the way I think I want to approach this is if we change the program schedule and number of times, push it later in the year, increase the number of times, see how many problems that solves and what problems are left, and then explore things like that, keep it on the table, you know, and have really the same response for trash too.

385
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:12,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we're at the cusp of year three, what's the feedback?

386
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:14,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we ready for every other week trash?

387
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:18,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we implement, what are the problems that we're seeing?

388
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:23,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we need to be ready to have another location for situations like diapers, drop off location?

389
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I think is still all on the table.

390
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:30,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my mind, those are problems that we haven't seen yet.

391
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just reluctant to solve problems that we don't know about,

392
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:46,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can foresee so I want to be prepared for those problems, but I think having this discussion is helpful because, for example, the the diaper situation that President morale brought up that's a very good.

393
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,883
[SPEAKER_06]: scenario where diapers don't go in food scrap.

394
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you have a small child, I know this too, you generate a lot of diapers.

395
00:38:54,726 --> 00:39:00,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe there's an option where you can bring them down to the city yard and there's a dumpster for that.

396
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:03,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think those options are still on the table.

397
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:08,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, I wanna make sure that we understand what the problems are before we try to solve them.

398
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

399
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

400
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:19,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you president Brown, thank you so much, both of you for being here, running us through it.

401
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,008
[SPEAKER_07]: In advance of our regular meeting tonight.

402
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:31,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a member of the solid waste task force so I've talked about many of these issues that nauseam with you before and came into this meeting, you know,

403
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:36,889
[SPEAKER_07]: predisposed towards the results of this negotiation process.

404
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:40,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really heartening to see, or the pending results of the RFP process.

405
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:52,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really heartening to see that so many of the goals that we talked about on the task force are seemingly coming to bear fruit through the negotiations.

406
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:55,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to see these sort of

407
00:39:56,473 --> 00:40:12,144
[SPEAKER_07]: ordinance revision and your process, talking with various callers and tailoring the RFP I think that it's resulting in a couple scenarios that are really aligned with our short term and long term goals it makes me feel very confident about the 10 year contract scenario.

408
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:22,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think for folks watching, I want to restate that what we're talking about specifically is kind of a top level issue.

409
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:24,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Just are we comfortable?

410
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,212
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the conditions under which we'd be comfortable entering into a long contract, a 10-year contract?

411
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:32,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a lot of small considerations within that.

412
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:40,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Composting, bringing in pet issues, diaper issues, kind of contingencies for households and businesses that have different types of needs.

413
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:48,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what we've seen so far shows that this is a pretty flexible scenario.

414
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:59,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of opportunities for outreach, lots of points along the way where we could say, are we ready to, for example, scale up for 7,000 more households doing composting?

415
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:02,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we ready to transition to every other week trash pickup?

416
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:09,446
[SPEAKER_07]: and lots of runway for getting businesses on board and making sure that residents have the information that they need.

417
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, you know, I think that composting is maybe the best, like clearest example of this saying, you know, food scraps are an issue regardless of the container that they're in and composting actually presents, if we do it right, an opportunity to have rats be less of an issue because the composting buckets are actually more secure against rats than what we're currently working with.

418
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:32,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a really powerful thing to have the opportunity to communicate to the city.

419
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:37,731
[SPEAKER_07]: because this is an issue that every household cares a lot about.

420
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:43,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody wants rats in their yard and this is actually an opportunity to make that problem better.

421
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:51,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for the months of work leading up to this discussion.

422
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:53,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

423
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:53,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

424
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:55,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

425
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your presentation and thank you for your hard work negotiating on this.

426
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:06,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really encouraged by what I hear about bulk items because I do think that we need to start pricing things.

427
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:15,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at that the cost more and more close to the cost that we're paying as a city, that each, that all of our taxpayers are paying.

428
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:27,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I am also encouraged to hear us think about how we're gonna structure the business district trash collection and all of that and the plan for that as well.

429
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very much encouraged by how committed we are to weekly recycling and composting, which is not only good for the environment, but I think is a very clear equity issue in the city as well, especially with the composting part, where a lot of families who, they either, they want to be recycling more, composting more, a lot of folks

430
00:42:53,373 --> 00:43:10,342
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know about the DPW yard, they don't know about the composting programs that we have as a city, and some folks, they maybe don't make, they're in that golden zone where they can't really afford the composting program, but they don't qualify for help.

431
00:43:11,263 --> 00:43:16,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm very encouraged by this because I think this levels out the playing field for folks.

432
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:25,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy that there's been a lot of thought about rodents and about how we're going to deal with rodents.

433
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:41,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councillor Collins makes a really good point that by shifting, hopefully, our food scraps to composting bins, we can reduce the likelihood of rodents running around and opening trash cans because the smaller bins are harder to open.

434
00:43:42,701 --> 00:44:01,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if there was a plan to work with the Board of Health to monitor rat presences like reports, things like that before and after we make the switch just to see if our hypotheses are confirmed.

435
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can speak to the Board of Health about that.

436
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:06,815
[SPEAKER_01]: My main

437
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:14,232
[SPEAKER_01]: caveat is that there are a lot of things that are impacting the environment that are impacting the rat population.

438
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:20,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And to say that it was just because of compost bins would be like a very slippery slope.

439
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:27,819
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly, I do believe that they monitor a number of locations already, particularly on public property.

440
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna over speak about what I think they're doing.

441
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:35,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that they have expressed to me an interest in seeing

442
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:40,568
[SPEAKER_01]: things even out of dumpsters and into more secure bins like compost bins.

443
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:56,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally had a conversation with waste management today about writing into the contract that any dumpsters that they provide under it would be kept in good condition, and we use the word rat proof as part of our paragraph of description, and they were like,

444
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:59,083
[SPEAKER_01]: you cannot make a dumpster rat proof.

445
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:05,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we can make sure there are no holes and dents and we'll put some language together that we're comfortable with.

446
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:06,109
[SPEAKER_01]: We can say there's a lid.

447
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,152
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, but there is no such thing as a rat proof dumpster.

448
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:12,154
[SPEAKER_01]: That is literally the conversation we had today with them.

449
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:19,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm gonna take that back to the board of health and say, is there like, you know, do I push them more on this?

450
00:45:19,221 --> 00:45:21,983
[SPEAKER_01]: What language would you like to have in this for that?

451
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:24,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just sort of share that, that it's,

452
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:25,937
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an issue.

453
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:34,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly believe that some of our problem is most of our squares, the way we do trash pickup, are piles of garbage bags.

454
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:43,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And in at least Haynes Square, I know businesses put them out on Sunday for pickup on Tuesday, or put them out on Sunday.

455
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,746
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be putting them out Saturday night.

456
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:52,869
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I'm there at one o'clock Sunday afternoon and there are trash bags everywhere, that must be for Monday morning pickup, right?

457
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:54,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not okay.

458
00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:03,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something that we are writing into the contract that they'll work with us to toterize, put them in toters or dumpsters to get them out of plastic bags on the street.

459
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

460
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:15,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a great point that even if we collect that information, it might not be, we can't really get for one-to-one on that.

461
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's very helpful.

462
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask a quick question about the phasing in program for composting, which I do think is very fiscally sensible, makes sense.

463
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:42,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but I was wondering if perhaps maybe we get to a point in year two where let's say 10,000 houses have signed up, we have maybe 9,000 who haven't, and we're preparing to switch.

464
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Is, well let's say the 9000 or even if we max it out and we do 12,000 and there's 7000 left.

465
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,932
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm just afraid of a situation where those 7000 haven't had a chance to experience.

466
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:18,963
[SPEAKER_05]: the fact that they don't need that weekly pickup of trash and that perhaps giving them the opportunity to do it would basically help them, like give them the experience of sorting trash a different way.

467
00:47:20,383 --> 00:47:27,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I do think the current plan that you have is fiscally sensible, but I was wondering about that situation and if there was any flexibility there.

468
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:37,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we believe so we sat down with three different composting companies and talk through these issues their thoughts, and to be clear, they all there.

469
00:47:38,537 --> 00:47:49,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discussion that we're going to have next with the composting companies, but we've had preliminary conversations, the interviewers is aggressive outreach and aggressive getting people to sign up for this.

470
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:57,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is absolutely part of what we're looking for in the composting companies is one that will do this in a very robust manner.

471
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:07,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a belief that some people will not compost until you literally take away their every other week trash.

472
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, dang, I don't like having my trash sit here for an extra week.

473
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:19,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say to them, well, you know, if you put it in that bin, the compost bin, we'd take it away every week.

474
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:24,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's actually that act that will get people to start composting.

475
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:34,454
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is a window, a group of people who wouldn't do it unless we took away their every week trash service.

476
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:45,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did say it like a takeaway because my hope is at that point, we'll have three quarters of the community already composting.

477
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:47,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have peer support for it.

478
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:56,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if three quarters of the people on your street are already doing it, then you have people everywhere who can say, just put it in here.

479
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:57,073
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I do it.

480
00:48:57,113 --> 00:48:58,114
[SPEAKER_01]: This works for me.

481
00:48:58,154 --> 00:48:59,896
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not that hard.

482
00:49:00,557 --> 00:49:05,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll make it easier for that last group to sort of get the hang of it.

483
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:14,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's exciting that I think what's exciting about this is the grassroots aspect of it, where I can, I imagine neighbors will be telling each other.

484
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:27,079
[SPEAKER_05]: This will create some community conversations about how they're sorting their trash which I think will raise public consciousness about what's good for the environment and what's good

485
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:28,840
[SPEAKER_05]: fiscally for the city as well.

486
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:36,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that we theoretically have the option to opt back in.

487
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:45,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a huge question for the future, but I am pretty happy with what you guys have set out.

488
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:52,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think it's really important to underscore how much more expensive it would be

489
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,395
[SPEAKER_05]: to have weekly trash pickups.

490
00:49:54,975 --> 00:50:10,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a cost, not just theoretically to the city, that's a real cost to taxpayers and to the budget and the other city services that we would need to reevaluate if we were to keep that.

491
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:12,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You already touched on education.

492
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:15,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering what the general plans were.

493
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:21,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess with composting, it sounds like we're expecting the composting company to do a lot of outreach.

494
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:29,259
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies, so one of the ideas that we heard, so we got ideas from sort of both, sorry, three companies.

495
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:37,764
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ideas that one of the companies was very robust about was that they would organize actually grassroots campaigning.

496
00:50:38,225 --> 00:50:51,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they described it to me was a political campaign where they had, this is your neighborhood, here's the list of households, you go door to door and talk to them about composting and that they would solicit

497
00:50:52,245 --> 00:51:01,760
[SPEAKER_01]: their current subscribers to be neighborhood captains and to go out and volunteer to help recruit other people to do it.

498
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my experience, not everybody has time and interest.

499
00:51:05,324 --> 00:51:14,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people who are currently paying for composting it do it for a reason, and they are much more likely to say yes I would volunteer to go knock on my neighbor's doors and talk about it.

500
00:51:14,835 --> 00:51:20,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the things that they would organize as opposed to our staff organizing it, which was, I like that a lot.

501
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:21,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

502
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:31,652
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone behind the rail can attest to the power of door-to-door canvassing, and we're going out that way.

503
00:51:31,732 --> 00:51:33,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm encouraged by that.

504
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:43,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's so many other considerations that with different companies that you'll have to choose from, or that you have options to choose from, but that does sound encouraging.

505
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:49,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we'll have more conversations in the future about how to do that outreach, but I am encouraged.

506
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

507
00:51:56,499 --> 00:52:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think something to note too is we're talking about year one starting next July one, right?

508
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have all of this year and year one and year two, and everyone will, you know, there's already mail that goes out every year to everybody.

509
00:52:08,928 --> 00:52:12,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we keep our green book handy at all.

510
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, right there.

511
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:13,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there.

512
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: He keeps it right in his jacket pocket, the commissioner does.

513
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:29,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So there'll be lots of opportunity for everybody to have had a chance to take part in this program.

514
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:34,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know in my household, the initial reaction was concern.

515
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:50,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a little bit of discussion and Googling and research was maybe this makes a lot of sense and may actually be better, not just for the environment and for the city or for the city budget, but even for just being at home and not having food waste

516
00:52:52,092 --> 00:52:57,476
[SPEAKER_04]: in an open, not open, but easy enough for a rat or a raccoon to open container.

517
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple of quick questions around the bins.

518
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be the same size of bins for trash and recycling for the next contract?

519
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:08,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

520
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:08,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

521
00:53:08,883 --> 00:53:09,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

522
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:12,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And are they planning to keep the same bins that we have now?

523
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:20,910
[SPEAKER_01]: We had asked them to budget for replacements as bins started to fail.

524
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:21,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

525
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:27,513
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're expecting like the vehicles will be able to pick up the same bins.

526
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no plan to mass change out the bins.

527
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Vehicles would pick, there's no need to change the bins unless somebody's been as failing.

528
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:43,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, if somebody's been as failing now as broken wheels or whatever, they should be contacting waste management or the CPW.

529
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:44,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look right in here.

530
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:47,744
[SPEAKER_01]: contact DPW for a replacement then.

531
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:48,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

532
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be in touch.

533
00:53:50,746 --> 00:53:52,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens all the time.

534
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:55,710
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more things on the budget.

535
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:06,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So budget impact over the next 10 years, I saw 3.5 to 6% average, depending on the elements within the scope.

536
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that about the same as it is under the current contract?

537
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:12,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how much we've been growing every year under the existing contract or is it more?

538
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:18,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the last, the last jump we saw was about 5%, a little over 5%.

539
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:26,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was, I forget exactly which years, but there was a flat year, a couple of years ago where we didn't have any growth in that line.

540
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:34,880
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but that's one of the things we're working with finance with what is a reasonable growth from year to year.

541
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we're looking hard at that.

542
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:39,385
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big piece of the negotiations.

543
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:48,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I said, about, I think it was like 5.2 when I calculated it out the last time we grew, which was from, I wanna say 22 to 23.

544
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:50,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

545
00:54:50,828 --> 00:55:14,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw you gave us in the memo or the, uh, the strategy zero folks in the memo gave us a average over the first five years average over the second five years, if it would be possible to give an estimate for all 10 years, instead of the averages and the like, just, you know, 7.6, 7.7, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2, 8.6, just to kind of see it year over year, since that's how we, you know, that's how I'm thinking about the budget anyway.

546
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I mean.

547
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still figuring that out.

548
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still in the throes of that particular negotiation.

549
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:28,965
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working, we're pretty far down the road, but I think that's gonna come later.

550
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:32,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your hands around the big scope, but the specific increments.

551
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:34,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Year to year to year for the next 10 years.

552
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:35,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

553
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:36,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

554
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:44,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

555
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:56,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point out again, and you know, everyone can shoot arrows at me if they want 3.5 to 6% is more than two and a half percent.

556
00:55:57,398 --> 00:56:04,765
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another cost driver that is increasing faster than the state allows us to increase the property tax levy without an override.

557
00:56:05,854 --> 00:56:08,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there will be an impact on the DPW budget?

558
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:11,058
[SPEAKER_04]: This is half of the DPW budget, this contract alone.

559
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:18,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there'll be an impact on the other half of the DPW budget as this line item increases faster than the tax base increases?

560
00:56:19,524 --> 00:56:20,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Not if I can help it.

561
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:25,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the mayor is aware of this as well.

562
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously we've been discussing this with the mayor and she's aware of that piece of it.

563
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:36,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth mentioning to that some of these are some of the costs are out of our control fuel, for example.

564
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:45,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say that the biggest one of the biggest factors in my budget is fuel to fuel goes up higher than two and a half percent.

565
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:46,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

566
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

567
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So every year we receive an effective cut because we have we buy all the fuel for the whole city.

568
00:56:54,223 --> 00:56:54,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

569
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:56,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a bigger growth of two and a half percent.

570
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:57,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

571
00:56:57,724 --> 00:57:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So your point is well taken and your point sinks deep in me.

572
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:03,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate it.

573
00:57:03,268 --> 00:57:26,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you and I hope many others, cause it's just, I know, I think the more and more and more we talk about how many pieces of the city budget are increasing at rate faster than the tax levy is increasing and how that means, you know, less money for maybe sidewalk repairs or less money for the forestry and tree planting and stump removal, or less money for all the things that people are really,

574
00:57:27,684 --> 00:57:28,806
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned about in the city.

575
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:38,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because we have these large major cost drivers that are increasing faster than two and a half percent and their limits in the city on the city by state law of property proposition two and a half.

576
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:42,664
[SPEAKER_04]: They can only be overridden by an override.

577
00:57:45,090 --> 00:58:07,172
[SPEAKER_04]: One last question on the budget, are there any program elements in here that could potentially limit cost growth and these are just like totally out of the blue I don't you know I don't pretend to be in the weeds, the way that you guys have been in these negotiations, but like if everybody composted a ton and suddenly the solid waste like trash volume was a lot lower than.

578
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,173
[SPEAKER_04]: expected, would that affect the cost to the city?

579
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:20,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Or another thought was like, if all the recycling came in, and it was all like, right, and no one was putting stuff in the recycling that was wrong with that reduced cost to the city?

580
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:26,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say this, the recycling, yes to both, but the recycling would be a little bit different.

581
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:28,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, we're paying for the weight of the trash.

582
00:58:28,723 --> 00:58:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, to dispose of that's passed through costs again.

583
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:31,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

584
00:58:32,044 --> 00:58:33,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another cost we don't have a lot of control over.

585
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:36,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as far as recyclables go, there's a formula

586
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:43,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can sell our recyclables on the market, we actually get a credit.

587
00:58:43,847 --> 00:58:50,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the market is healthy and folks are buying plastic, then we would actually get a credit.

588
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:53,094
[SPEAKER_06]: If it happens the other way around, we end up paying more.

589
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: If it can't be sold, then obviously then that is a cost that we have to pay.

590
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:01,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully that answers your question.

591
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think, yeah, just kind of going to the point of maybe some of the education here.

592
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:06,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we already tried to do it.

593
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:13,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the reasons we're going down this road is to try to get a little bit more incentive money from the SDP to maybe do a little bit more education as well.

594
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But just letting folks know, right, like, there are ways that our behaviors, either through education or behavior change, whichever way you want to look at it, right, the city doing the education or residents adjusting their behaviors, there are ways that we can all pitch in a little bit to maybe help keep the cost down on this cost driver.

595
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,111
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think we all want to do.

596
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Reduce, reuse, recycle.

597
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:36,514
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is reduce.

598
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:36,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

599
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:38,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're in that order for a reason.

600
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:38,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

601
00:59:38,735 --> 00:59:42,798
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we all reduce, then we're paying less as a city for the weight of the trash that we're disposing.

602
00:59:42,898 --> 00:59:43,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

603
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:59,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think too, just the education point of piece of reduce could mean composting and just taking that food waste out of trash where it then, and we can talk about all the waste impacts of how it's unproductive and where if it's composted, maybe it is for productive use, but that's a great way to reduce

604
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: the stuff that's going into landfill and reduce the cost to the city and the taxpayer of the waste.

605
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:10,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also if I could just, will you both, you both are staying for the regular meeting?

606
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:10,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

607
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:12,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just because we're, we're over time this meeting.

608
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:17,297
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, any final words and then we'll go continue the conversation in the regular meeting.

609
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:23,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to put on there that we actually built that into financially into the model that we're looking at right now.

610
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:27,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pay per ton for trash.

611
01:00:27,486 --> 01:00:29,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pay per household for pickup.

612
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,118
[SPEAKER_01]: but then we pay for the weight of the trash.

613
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:34,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't throw away water bottles full of water.

614
01:00:34,781 --> 01:00:38,524
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the most wasteful thing you can do and cost the city a bajillion dollars.

615
01:00:39,184 --> 01:00:46,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, the composting model is per household with the weight of it is built in there.

616
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:52,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you compost more or less, we don't pay a different amount for your household.

617
01:00:53,114 --> 01:00:57,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more that's heavy wet weight food, if you put that in your compost bin,

618
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:04,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally saves the city money because we're not paying per pound for anything that goes into the compost bin.

619
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:10,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who would like to sign up for the composting now, our preferred vendor at the moment is Garbage to Garden, and you can sign up.

620
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:19,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to their website and you put in a Medford's address, you will get the Medford rate, which is $99 a year right now, but you can pay monthly.

621
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:21,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, I'm done, thank you.

622
01:01:22,186 --> 01:01:22,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

623
01:01:23,627 --> 01:01:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions, we can move it.

624
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:29,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Castagnetti, I see you, if you could join us in the regular meeting, we will get to your question.

625
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:31,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn.

626
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:37,391
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of vices and mayors to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk.

627
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:40,771
[SPEAKER_08]: George already dropped off.

628
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:41,912
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

629
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:42,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

630
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

631
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:44,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes, meeting is adjourned.

632
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:46,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We will take this up again in the regular meeting.
