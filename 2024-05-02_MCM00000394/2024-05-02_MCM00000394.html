    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=9.176">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=11.057">Six</a>  present, one absent.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=21.423">Meeting</a>  is called to order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=24.424">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Tuesday, July 25th, 2023 <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=29.49">At</a>  6pm in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom, the purpose of the meeting is to discuss citywide collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, organics, and recyclables awarded pursuant to a request for proposal number 23-0067, paper 23-032. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=47.533">The</a>  committee has invited DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and any additional representatives of the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to attend this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=57.659">For</a>  further information, aids, and accommodations, contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=63.402">Sincerely</a>  yours, Nicole Morell, Council President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=66.064">We</a>  have Commissioner McGibbon and Director Hunt here to give us a presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=71.407">Before</a>  we get started, are there any questions from councilors? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=75.569">Seeing</a>  none, I will turn it over to you both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=85.715">Can</a>  you tap the mic just to turn it on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=88.338">There</a>  you go, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=89.599">It</a>  literally changes every week, so.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=93.12">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=94.481">We</a>  have a relatively short presentation to give, and I'll turn it over to Alicia to start the presentation, and I'll take over at some point in the middle.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=104.726">Good</a>  evening, councillors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=106.947">So</a>  we just, obviously you know about waste and recycling today in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=110.909">We're</a>  gonna recap RFP process that we went through, the RFP goals, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=117.16">the</a>  results and recommendations and what's ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=120.062">And</a>  to be clear, I think that everybody is aware that the mayor needs the city council's approval to sign a 10-year contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=129.969">And</a>  that is on your city council agenda tonight, is the request to allow the signing of a 10-year contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=137.275">What</a>  our goal was was to provide you some information about what's in there, what's going on, what's the process here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=143.383">so</a>  that you would feel more comfortable at that meeting and for us to have a little bit of time to actually discuss that now at this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=151.67">So</a>  I included this here just for completeness. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=154.772">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=159.416">You</a>  all know what we do for waste and recycling in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=163.839">We</a>  have weekly trash, every other week recycling, yard waste is 15 weeks plus one week of Christmas tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=171.862">Currently</a>  white goods are $26 for a curbside fee for pickup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=177.143">Residents</a>  can have up to three bulky items picked up, collected every other week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=183.664">And</a>  that costs the city about $25 an item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=186.665">We</a>  actually have a very high rate of people calling and their item not being there when the waste management truck gets there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=195.246">And</a>  the city still pays $25 an item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=198.386">When</a>  that happens, we pay about $400,000 a year on that line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=204.549">And</a>  currently residents can subscribe for the city recommended composting service. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=208.971">It's</a>  $99 a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=212.032">One</a>  of the things that I just wanted to flag, this is a slide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=216.954">We</a>  do not actually have this data for Medford or for the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=220.636">This</a>  is an EPA slide about the breakdown about what households are discarding annually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=228.784">And</a>  as you can see, 48% of what gets discarded is recyclable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=234.866">There's</a>  15%, the orange, that's potentially reusable or recyclable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=241.368">12%</a>  is yard waste, yard trimmings, and 22% is food scraps, which really only leaves a small amount that truly, truly has to go in the garbage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=252.471">Now</a>  things vary from area to area about what can actually be recycled, but this is the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=258.022">in</a>  a big picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=260.003">So</a>  you're also aware that we've been working on hauler regulations that we've had mandatory separation of recyclables since 1992. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=271.71">This</a>  meant the hauler regulation that we worked on will require permitted trash holders to provide recycling service so that they can't just pick up trash from say apartment buildings without also <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=286.98">basically</a>  providing recycling for one bundled rate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=290.663">I</a>  do understand from our Director of Board, at our last meeting about that, there was some question about our Board of Health regulations and that there were definitions that were different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=300.929">I</a>  understand from our Director of Public Health that the Board of Health has actually voted and adjusted their regulations to be in line with what is proposed in front of the City Council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=311.136">And</a>  I know Councilor Kitt was there <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=314.353">at</a>  that meeting, and I was not, so I couldn't speak to it any more than to say I know that that is in process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=320.658">That</a>  is actually, we feel like, an important step as part of this process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=326.161">So</a>  for the RFP, last summer and fall, we had our Solid Waste Task Force, and we did community outreach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=332.406">I'd</a>  like to thank the number of members of the task force who are actually on the Zoom tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=337.709">Saw</a>  a couple of them before I started sharing my screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=341.389">We</a>  drafted and released an RFP over the winter, we received proposals this spring, and this summer we have been doing contract negotiations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=353.452">So</a>  the goal of the RFP, controlling costs was number one, creating fairness and transparency regarding our service recipients, expanding our recycling and composting options, and providing services comparable to neighboring communities, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=370.459">I'm</a>  streamlining the transition of continuity of service without interruptions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=375.303">We</a>  wanted to move Medford towards zero waste and decrease the multiple haulers in the business districts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=383.528">So</a>  I think I'm turning it over to you here.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=387.139">Thank</a>  you, Asia. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=388.4">So</a>  we're doing a great job in meeting our goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=392.965">So</a>  I think that's really important up until we started evaluating the RFP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=399.05">Some</a>  of those goals, you know, we weren't 100% sure if we were going to be able to reach them, but we're we're on track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=405.356">So</a>  that's great news. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=407.498">The</a>  results of the RFP are <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=410.912">They're</a>  summarized here, but in this is, you know, these are three important bullet points that I think are, we think that are quite important to share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=417.655">If,</a>  for example, if we were to go to weekly recycling, we discovered that it would cost an approximate about a million dollars extra per year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=425.479">The</a>  weekly food composting that we're heading towards is going to cost us about <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=430.594">a</a>  million dollars per year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=432.436">And</a>  if we move to every other week trash, we're going to save about a million dollars per year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=437.961">And</a>  we're proposing to start that in year three to have a transition period. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=445.969">So</a>  just so everybody's clear, we're not recommending weekly recycling at this point, but we did want to understand what that would cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=456.241">The</a>  reason is because that minimal increases in materials recycled based off of analysis is that nasty he's done and others in national research. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=471.565">So</a>  the weekly food scraps composting piece, you know, another thing that we've discussed in the past with you is trash has a lot of, today has a lot of food scraps in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=484.018">Food</a>  scraps are heavy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=485.36">So</a>  when you remove the food scraps out of your trash, then your trash is lighter, you have less of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=491.566">it</a>  doesn't fester as quickly, it doesn't become a nuisance as quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=497.169">So</a>  that's one of the directions that we're headed here and that's what we've heard from the community and that's where we're headed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=504.352">And</a>  then the transition piece I mentioned is important too, since we are realistic in the idea that we can't wave a magic wand and have the entire city start composting their food scraps all at once.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=519.556">I</a>  have a question on number three about the every other week trash. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=524.4">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=525.701">If</a>  when we get to that third year and we realize it's not working, are we able to change it to go to a weekly thing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=533.948">If</a>  we realize that when we start to maybe after six, seven months, it's not working out, are we able to?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=541.634">Well,</a>  we'll be entering a contract with waste management and I think <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=546.062">you</a>  know, we'd have to have that discussion if it's not working and it's just had itself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=549.943">And,</a>  you know, no one's picking up composting and it's not paying off the way we think.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=555.045">I'm</a>  talking about the every other week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=556.626">Well,</a>  that would start in year three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=557.706">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=558.166">So</a>  if we realize that maybe, you know, three or four or five months into it, it's not working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=563.588">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=564.248">Are</a>  we going to be able to opt back into a weekly trash pickup?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=567.369">Yes,</a>  we would be able to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=569.43">We</a>  wouldn't be able to do that in the composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=573.611">So</a>  we would have to make some hard decisions at that time.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=576.768">It</a>  would have a significant budget impact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=578.97">Yes,</a>  we literally could do composting and every week trash, but that would have a million dollar budget impact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=588.736">We</a>  don't recommend that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=593.519">I</a>  have a question that same thing just as we started so if it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=597.635">Going</a>  to every other week trash would there be an option like right now if folks have a ton of recyclables they can go to the dpw yard is there an option there I'm like literally being very specific. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=606.804">I</a>  have a one year old I have lots of diapers like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=609.717">Food,</a>  great, we can get the food out, that has saved us a ton, we already do composting, but something like that, not necessarily want around.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=617.003">The</a>  overflow bags wouldn't go away, and also an extra bin that you'd have to pay for wouldn't go away, so there would be options if you are generating more trash, but it would be a cost to the resident.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=629.753">Right,</a>  but there would be no other way to remove the trash in that in-between week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=635.718">Like</a>  I'm just saying, because right now, if I have a ton of recycling, I can go to the DPW yard and drop off that recycling before the next pickup.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=642.222">Yeah,</a>  I would say we have not discussed an option that would... So we had actually conceptualized, could there be a way to do it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=650.588">The</a>  difficulty would be the truck would run this route this week and that route that week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=656.551">So</a>  to have a truck hit one person's house, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=659.208">would</a>  be really expensive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=662.572">That's</a>  what we're not... Could someone... A drop-off location? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=665.515">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=665.915">And</a>  I know it's probably a slippery slope. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=667.597">It's</a>  just a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=668.538">We</a>  have not currently contemplated a drop-off location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=671.441">We</a>  have contemplated overflow bags that people could choose to purchase or <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=676.194">an</a>  extra bin if you had, so I actually had a neighbor with two in diapers and he ordered an overflow bin that he used for the year that he had two children in diapers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=687.405">Okay,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=687.985">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=689.607">Madam</a>  President, if I can.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=692.449">Oh,</a>  Councilor Scarpella, and then we'll go to Vice Mayor.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=695.192">Right,</a>  so is the, thank you, through the Chair, is the food scrap pickup program, is that a weekly program?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=704.068">Yes,</a>  that would be a weekly program.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=707.111">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=710.133">One</a>  thing that I'm really nervous about, especially this past week, I think that we've gotten so many phone calls and I'm sure that the Board of Health has gotten a lot of phone calls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=720.961">We're</a>  seeing a huge uptick on the rat populations and what's happening with the rat problem in the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=727.766">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=729.962">You</a>  know, a couple of things that, as we're moving forward with this RFP and what the asks are, I find a few difficult, you know, concessions here and looking at not everybody, although we want everybody to recycle more, but having every two weeks, having a pickup of trash, I don't think that's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=752.968">that's</a>  a real big problem considering right now when we're being asked to vote on this issue without really getting the true input from the whole community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=763.816">I</a>  think this is what we had an issue years ago when Mayor McGlynn put this program out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=772.762">So</a>  I think that I think that <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=777.605">You</a>  really have to try to sell me on this because I, you know, the every other week trash in three years, unless we have a grasp on what's going on with the rat population and what we're doing here in the city with the rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=789.993">Uh,</a>  I think that's, that's a dangerous situation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=793.194">Um,</a>  so, uh, and that's brings another question I had from a lot of people that did contact me about the food scrap and going with the composting that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=803.093">is</a>  one resident put it as, we're now having drive-through separate containers for our rats for their consumption. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=813.042">So</a>  I know the reason why we're doing this, but I think that a million dollars, if you look at the big picture, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=824.492">The</a>  problems were going to that are going to rise because of, you know, pick up once a week I think that, you know, not, not, not really thinking it through of what the process would be if there were, or there was needed to be drop offs, per se. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=841.819">I</a>  don't know, this is a good meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=845.283">This</a>  is a great meeting to get things rolling, but I can't see us voting on this tonight for the fact that here we are in end of July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=852.931">And</a>  for the most part, most of the community hasn't heard about the process or what the RFP states. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=859.659">So</a>  again, I'll have more later, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=865.142">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=868.204">Just</a>  to be clear operationally about the procedure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=872.985">Essentially,</a>  this is a 10 year contract and there's an option in the contract to move from weekly trash to every other week trash, and that reduces the annual payment by about a million dollars, plus or minus whatever the annual adjustments are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=885.559">And</a>  we're choosing, we're making a plan to exercise that option in year three or in the contract that says we are going to exercise the option in year three.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=892.843">So</a>  let me answer that first and then I'll go back to the rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=896.506">So</a>  actually what is literally written in the contract and I had the, so our consultants are also on the line in case there's questions and we actually also have a representative from MassDEP on the line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=908.473">So</a>  what is literally written in the contract is that there is an option to go to every other week trash <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=914.409">that</a>  can be decided six months before July 1st, 2026. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=919.272">So</a>  six months before that, we have to decide if we're ready to move to every other week trash and it would have a budget impact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=926.175">And</a>  so that's where we would, that would need to be part of that, but no, it is not locked in stone that we have to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=932.498">And</a>  if we said we are moving that way and we can see, so actually I was also gonna talk to sort of this phase in that we were talking about, but we're not ready. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=941.703">We</a>  don't have enough adoption, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=943.505">we</a>  could say, let's push that back a year, let's stick one more year with weekly trash, we'll take the budget hit, and then switch to every other week trash the year after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=955.389">Or</a>  we could say people aren't, so I think it would also be helpful to speak to the composting, but I do wanna actually just address the rats first, and then let's go back to the money, because Councilor Scarpelli asked about the rats first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=969.765">We,</a>  the Board of Health has found that the toters, they're smaller with locks on them that are used for the composting, have been more successful in keeping out rats and raccoons than the large things that we have trash in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=987.232">Where</a>  a raccoon can climb up, and we've had photos of it, I've seen it out my own window, and literally the raccoon can open a trash can, one of our waste management trash cans, and go in there and pull the trash out <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1000.065">The</a>  toters for the compost have very simple locking lids in them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1005.327">And</a>  actually I could have, we have the one up in the hallway upstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1009.349">We</a>  could have David go get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1011.15">Do</a>  you mind? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1011.59">Do</a>  you know what I'm talking about? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1013.191">Sorry,</a>  David's one of the interns in our office who's been helping us with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1018.733">It</a>  has a very easy for a human to use lock, but the rats and the raccoons have not figured out how to get that open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1028.771">plastic</a>  on the composting bins is thick enough that we do not have examples of rats eating through the composting toters that have been in use in the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1041.575">There</a>  are buckets in some communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1044.076">Our</a>  board of health said no to the buckets because they did find that rats were eating through the lids of those buckets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1051.379">So</a>  that's why in Medford, if you were to subscribe to one of these companies, you're only allowed to get the toter that's per our board of health. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1058.379">So</a>  we believe that moving, or we have found that moving the trash out of the garbage cans and into these toters actually helps with the rat problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1068.047">The</a>  other issue with rats is business, and we'll talk about that a little bit later as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1073.591">But</a>  some of the way we wanted to address composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1076.073">So</a>  right now we have 1,200 households in Medford paying for weekly composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1083.299">We</a>  had, I'm gonna say, oh, I printed it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1088.722">Did</a>  you use the lock? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1090.503">Oh,</a>  no one can see it because we're sharing screens.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1091.964">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1092.144">I'm</a>  going to have to turn off screen share for a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1096.706">And</a>  then you can see this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1098.787">This</a>  is a really easy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1104.27">So</a>  like anybody can when you push on this, you don't have to have good hand strength or anything to push. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1112.575">So</a>  even elderly, it's easy to push. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1114.766">And</a>  if we turn it, let's see if you can see there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1117.848">Thank</a>  you, Shane.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1119.789">You</a>  can't quite see, but there's a little lip on there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1124.872">So</a>  this is, this is what, and we do have this, it's actually up in the hallway upstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1129.995">We</a>  don't mean to be advertising for any one company. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1132.697">Both</a>  the companies that do provide this service in Medford right now use the exact same toter from the same company. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1140.742">It's</a>  just one is, this one is branded by one of the companies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1146.068">So</a>  the idea is that we believe, hold on, when we did the survey, does it say the survey? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1153.593">I</a>  thought it did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1156.975">20%</a>  said they would definitely, oh, well, that was actually the moving to every other week trash. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1163.239">So</a>  we actually had a lot of people say they were interested, I could call it up if we wanted, in composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1169.483">And</a>  a lot of people, only 25% of the population said they were not interested in composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1175.83">and</a>  that was with no outreach, no education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1178.072">It</a>  was just the survey.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1179.233">How</a>  many people were in that, Alicia? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1182.715">I'd</a>  be interested to know.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1185.898">The</a>  survey was about 850 people responded to it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1189.4">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1191.062">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1193.684">So</a>  actually I realized I should go back to screen sharing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1196.206">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1203.962">So</a>  when we did the RFP, we heard from several composting companies, and they felt strongly that what we should do is an opt-in program for the first couple of years and have people sign up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1216.125">This</a>  is based on the model that Boston did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1219.646">So</a>  they have an opt-in program where they have a cap on how many people can opt in in the first year, in the second year, and then in the third year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1229.61">So</a>  this idea would be, we believe that we could have 8,000 households sign up in year one, and then 12,000 in year two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1238.632">We</a>  have 19,770 households on our waste program right now, so that then at that point in year three, we think we could roll in the rest of the households. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1250.454">If</a>  we found in year two that we were not at 12,000 households, that we were at 6,000 households composting, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1257.835">the</a>  compost companies would charge us a weekly rate per household rather than a rate for the whole city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1267.062">So</a>  we ramp up our costs by only paying for the number of subscribers in year one and year two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1275.108">And</a>  there's like a critical mass point at which it's cheaper to pay for the whole city than per person because of the way math works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1284.433">So</a>  that's where we would switch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1286.213">So</a>  that this is what our, we would have real metrics to be able to have a good understanding if we were ready to switch to universal in year three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1296.995">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1302.136">So</a>  would you be interested in moving to every other week trash collection if you had food scraps collection? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1308.977">And</a>  the online survey said 20, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1312.408">21%</a>  said yes and 20% said maybe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1315.37">And</a>  then after we talked about it at the workshop, the numbers changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1320.914">So</a>  we had 60% saying yes and 15% maybe, and at that point only 25 no, and that was actually just discussing the program during a workshop for the evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1333.902">That</a>  many changed their minds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1338.125">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1340.266">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1341.732">Go</a>  back to you, I was letting you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1343.033">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1344.154">All</a>  right, so I think Alicia went over this pretty well, and we also went over how this isn't set in stone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1352.079">So</a>  if it's not panning out with this plan, then we do have the option of changing how we do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1359.163">So</a>  I think that's important for everybody to know, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1362.045">Let's</a>  see if we have anything else on this slide that we need to talk about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1366.888">So...</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1372.282">One</a>  of the things that we want to bring to your attention is a piece of resident-like businesses and residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1379.928">So,</a>  you know, if you're a resident-like business, like a small business out there that generates enough trash that it's almost like a resident or even less, you'd be included in the program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1391.317">And</a>  then if you are a building with four or fewer units, you would be eligible for the weekly food scraps composting collection service as part of that collect the city's collection services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1402.617">And</a>  that three-year approach is just a recommendation for now, like we said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1405.587">All</a>  right, I think we go to the next slide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1413.3">So</a>  currently our budget is $7.6 million approximately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1418.825">Years</a>  one through five, we're looking at 7.7 per year average and years six through 10, 8.7 per year average. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1427.552">So</a>  those are some numbers that we're working hard on to fit what we wanna do in a reasonable escalation <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1437.52">based</a>  off of our current budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1439.541">So</a>  we're not trying to, in other words, we're trying not to have the annual budget for waste collection increase, which is part of the cost goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1455.07">So</a>  some of the things that we've achieved, we believe that the new system will be fair and transparent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1459.713">The</a>  process thus far, fair and transparent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1463.164">Food</a>  waste composting services is included and as Alicia mentioned, it builds off of experiences of other municipalities in areas such as Boston. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1472.898">We're</a>  targeting yard trimming compostings, April through December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1477.559">One</a>  thing we heard loud and clear is folks want more yard trimming pickup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1483.1">So,</a>  you know, the reality of it is that particular service is getting more expensive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1487.081">So</a>  we are currently working with waste management to get those costs reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1494.563">And</a>  one of the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1496.123">The</a>  ways we're doing that is contracting directly with a contractor and not having waste management sub it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1505.009">So</a>  we do have some significant savings that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1507.711">So</a>  there very well may be a third contract associated with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1512.494">So</a>  one for trash and recyclables, one for food scraps composting, and one for yard waste composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1522.581">The</a>  fact that we're going with waste management, insurance continuity, I think, you know, I know in my office, we're very used to working with waste management, the folks there and the processes that they have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1533.848">So</a>  that's a nice perk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1539.552">One</a>  of the other goals that we have is bringing the city towards zero waste. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1542.674">So</a>  we believe that this set of contracts would be taking a big giant step over the next decade towards zero waste. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1553.313">And</a>  one of the things we haven't really mentioned quite yet is, you know, some of the, for example, the business districts and there are other situations in the city where we want to provide a way to get from having many, many toters out in the street to containerized situations that are better for things like rats, better at making the squares look nicer, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1582.965">things</a>  like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1584.346">So</a>  we're working on a preferred hauler system, where there are rates that are pre negotiated, that that businesses can take advantage of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1596.855">So</a>  we're working very closely with Waste Management to work those rates out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1601.018">So</a>  basically provide a discount.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1603.699">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1606.161">Tim,</a>  how many cities and towns actually do commercial trash for free? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1612.917">It's</a>  not the norm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1613.978">That's</a>  not the norm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1614.719">I</a>  mean, at some point, we're going to get up with making the commercial people pay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1619.782">That's</a>  what this is about.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1621.664">Yes,</a>  that is what exactly what this is about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1623.525">But</a>  we don't want to pull the rug out from under him, so to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1626.908">So</a>  we're trying to provide a soft landing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1628.629">We're</a>  trying to <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1630.405">work</a>  a transition and the preferred holiday program is a critical piece of that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1635.568">So</a>  we have pre negotiated rates that we can offer businesses that need to transition off a city system, would they would they be able to pick up the commercial crash in the evening, the commercial district so they don't have to leave it out all night.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1652.454">Things</a>  like that we can certainly work out.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1654.635">We</a>  haven't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1655.115">I'm</a>  sure you know we've all driven to the square and we've seen crash blown all the place in boxes and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1660.557">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1660.977">It's</a>  very unsightly.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1662.378">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1662.658">And</a>  that is something that we're through this process into this contract we're trying to solve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1666.879">It's</a>  not going to happen immediately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1668.62">There</a>  is some work to do there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1670.081">And</a>  an example of some work to do is space, space for dumpsters, space for collection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1675.605">Not</a>  all businesses have enough space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1678.246">So,</a>  you know, there will be some sharing, there will be some, potentially some space, some city-owned space set aside, like a parking space or two in a targeted area with a dumpster, as opposed to having the sort of bagged mess that you see today.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1701.965">All</a>  right, I think we can go to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1708.531">So</a>  what's next? <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1710.352">So</a>  right now, as Alicia mentioned, we're negotiating, which is taking some serious amount of time between Alicia and myself, our consultants and waste management. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1720.921">So</a>  we've already 12 hours or something of negotiations, and we're continuing to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1728.115">We're</a>  well on our way and things are looking great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1730.996">The</a>  scope B contract that's mentioned here would be the food waste contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1737.858">Now</a>  that's coming next because that negotiation is going to hinge upon where exactly we land with our scope A or trash and recycling contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1750.242">So</a>  they impact each other, it's all the same budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1754.97">So</a>  we would execute that in July, August 2023 fall winter 2023 was starting outreach, and that's going to be a big part of this as Alicia showed you, or discussed, once you educate people on how this will actually work and and. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1772.506">What</a>  it actually means, people start turning over to the side of food scrap composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1780.39">So</a>  we believe that will continue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1783.191">It</a>  is the trend that in general we're headed as I think a larger community, not just Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1789.654">July</a>  1st, 2024, new contract begins, including food composting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1794.397">And</a>  at the same time, the hauler ordinance goes into effect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1797.758">And</a>  that's important for the preferred hauler program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1800.715">July</a>  1st, 2026, that is the target for every other week trash begins. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1805.657">So</a>  hopefully by that point, we have enough folks on the composting and we've done our job with education and outreach where folks are a lot more comfortable with the idea of their dry trash goods getting picked up <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1822.905">every</a>  other week and the heavy food scraps and compostables getting picked up every week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1832.15">So</a>  that's the plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1835.692">And</a>  then I think we can move on to the last slide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1840.414">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1843.395">We're</a>  open to questions and we, like Alicia said, we have our consultants on board and we have an SDEP here too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1848.918">So</a>  answer whatever questions you have, try to.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1852.791">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1853.971">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1854.591">So</a>  just a couple of my opinions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1858.092">You</a>  talked about the bulk items that we pick up for free. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1861.793">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1861.993">Why</a>  don't we cut that down to maybe to one?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1863.973">Oh,</a>  so honestly, I apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1867.794">I</a>  thought that was one of the slides in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1869.614">It</a>  was in the memo that we sent out to councilors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1873.115">So</a>  part of the plan, what we have strong recommendation from the haulers, they have found that when we charge residents for the bulk items, even a portion of the cost, <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1882.872">that</a>  there is a dramatic drop in one, the number of items that they asked to have picked up, and two, the number of times they call, make an appointment, and then don't put their item out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1893.724">We</a>  believe that a number of those that we're being charged for are actually people not putting it out, calling a second time and putting it out then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1902.693">They</a>  see a dramatic drop off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1904.702">And</a>  so the recommendation is that we split the cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1907.504">We've</a>  gotten them to keep the cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1909.226">Right</a>  now the city gets charged $25 an item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1912.448">They</a>  are willing to go up to just $26 an item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1916.011">And</a>  the recommendation is that we share the cost with the residents and waste management would do the billing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1923.798">So</a>  they would actually, a resident calls, tries to schedule it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1927.321">Waste</a>  management would take their credit card number for <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1930.338">A</a>  number we choose, I think we're recommending somewhere between $13 and $15 an item, and then they put that item out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1938.114">and</a>  they'll find that they think that can actually drop our $400,000 down much lower under $100,000 for bulk items.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1946.16">So</a>  maybe if you give them one for free and in charge for the other two, you know, the $13,000 nominal fee, I think that's more than, well, it's something that people put it all, then people come by at night and pick it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1958.35">And</a>  that's what happens a lot of times too.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1961.693">It</a>  does happen that they get picked up by other people.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1964.575">If</a>  you cut that down to maybe one for free <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1967.628">and</a>  the nominal fee for everything else after that, I think we can live with that.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/07-25-23-committee-of-the-whole&start=1971.771">We</a>  also find that people are dramatically incentivized to try putting it out on everything is free or to giving it away or donating it if there is a small charge associated with it.</p>
