    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=50.502s">to</a>  take papers 1602, 16021, 16022, 16023. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=59.404s">All</a>  papers are eligible for their third reading relative to the reorganization of the administrative offices.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=65.545s">On</a>  the motion for suspension of the rules to take the aforementioned papers off the table for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=79.471s">I'm</a>  sorry, 16-020, amendment of article four, officers and employees, division four, city solicitor, was tabled for its introduction on the 12th, past first reading, January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=97.357s">and</a>  advertised its second reading January 28th eligible tonight for its third and final reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=103.779s">This</a>  is on, uh, the reestablishment of the, uh, time tenure, uh, an appointment of the, uh, city solicitor chair weights motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=114.821s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, I think this, uh, matter that the S the mayor's put forward is relatively cut and dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=120.563s">What</a>  this matter does is, uh, it gives the city solicitor a two year appointment code terminus with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=125.609s">The</a>  paper's been through its first two readings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=128.05s">If</a>  there's anybody in the audience that would like to speak, I think we should give them the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=130.772s">And</a>  if any of the councillors want to speak on it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=132.973s">But</a>  I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=134.874s">A</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=137.735s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=140.597s">Is</a>  it a matter for a roll call? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=141.817s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=150.489s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=151.49s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=154.23s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=155.731s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=157.231s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=157.591s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=157.951s">With</a>  a vote of seven, the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=159.232s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=159.472s">The</a>  negative motion is ordered 16-zero to one amendment to vitals for officers and employees division for a chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=171.756s">This</a>  came before us pertinent to the creation of the position of chief of staff in the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=180.14s">It</a>  came before us on January 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=182.542s">It</a>  was tabled on January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=185.924s">After</a>  explanation, it passed the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=188.586s">On</a>  January 28th, it was advertised as its second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=192.449s">It</a>  is now tonight eligible for its third and final reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=196.112s">Chair</a>  awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=197.573s">Mr.</a>  President, again, this piece of legislation would create the position chief of staff and reorganize the administrative office. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=203.557s">It's</a>  been through its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=204.818s">We</a>  had some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=205.839s">If</a>  the questions were answered, I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=208.365s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Vice-President Hunko Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=212.726s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=214.246s">With</a>  regards to this question, I believe we asked for just an update with regards to, I think a couple of us did some research on numbers for chief of staffs in the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=224.748s">And</a>  the 106,000 is kind of something that stuck out for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=229.669s">That's</a>  almost as close to what the mayor's making. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=232.349s">So</a>  we did ask for a communication back from the mayor with regards to, you know, why this, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=237.857s">this</a>  position was being funded so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=240.858s">And</a>  then you have a, you know, chief procurement officer slash budget budget director taken on two jobs that is making about the same, if not a little less than the chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=249.401s">So</a>  I just would like to get an answer on that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=253.983s">I</a>  think we had a explanation of councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=257.084s">Um,</a>  with all due respect to the Councilor, Mr. President, if she feels as though the position's overpaid, this is a piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=261.625s">She</a>  can't amend the piece of legislation while it's on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=264.506s">Um,</a>  we've discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=265.867s">I</a>  think that it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=266.909s">It's</a>  a good position, it's a necessary position, it's a required position, Mr. President, and I support the matter wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=273.692s">No,</a>  I'm glad he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=276.133s">Not</a>  that I don't support the position or the reorganization, I just think the 106,000, as do many people, believe that might be a little bit high for a position like this in a city like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=288.399s">We're</a>  just looking for some explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=289.76s">Will</a>  this person be working more than 40 hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=293.582s">We</a>  did get the job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=295.002s">I</a>  think one of the job descriptions, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=296.778s">was</a>  that that person would be in front of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=300.08s">We</a>  have yet to see that person at a council meeting or even a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=304.764s">So,</a>  you know, what exactly is the reasoning for the hundred? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=309.567s">It's</a>  such an exorbitant amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=312.869s">Again,</a>  when we have people taking on double jobs and making less than that, I just don't see, I just would like some clarification on that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=320.755s">Well,</a>  maybe a point of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=325.874s">Just</a>  so I'm clearing up a question myself, but I believe it was Chief of Staff slash Personnel Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=333.196s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=333.496s">So</a>  it's two jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=334.677s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=335.157s">Okay,</a>  that's all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=336.858s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=337.718s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=339.859s">Maybe</a>  some light can be shed on this matter by the Director of Budget and Personnel, Director of Budget, Pro Tempore, who's with us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=359.792s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=359.992s">Miller,</a>  bonsoir. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=365.938s">The</a>  question from the councilor was an inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=369.641s">I</a>  don't know if it was answered or even formally requested by way of resolution, but regarding the level of salary for the chief of staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=381.732s">which</a>  encompasses chief of staff and policy for the mayor, as well as, uh, matters of personnel management. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=389.337s">Um,</a>  uh, question the Councilor had was that, uh, she felt that, uh, the salary was high.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=398.242s">Um,</a>  the position is director of personnel and director of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=402.845s">And,</a>  um, I did not get a resolution regarding a salary comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=409.269s">I</a>  do not know if the mayor's office, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=411.855s">receive</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=412.596s">We</a>  answered the questions that we did receive, and I do not know what the comparison would be standing right here right now.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=425.485s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=426.005s">Well,</a>  we have a motion for approval that has been seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=430.529s">Did</a>  Councilor Falco wish to speak on this matter?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=432.85s">No,</a>  actually Mr. Scarpelli made the point that I was going to make basically that it is two positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=438.372s">I</a>  think that probably justifies the salary, just like the, uh, the new, um, procurement position. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=444.415s">That's</a>  two positions as well that one person is taking off. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=448.498s">So</a>  that's why I think that's the justification for the higher cell. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=452.8s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=453.64s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=457.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=457.483s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=457.763s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=458.043s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=503.796s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, this was a reorganization of the administrative office. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=506.957s">I</a>  would establish a chief procurement officer and also allow the chief procurement officer to continue in her role as a budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=513.199s">I</a>  move for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=514.579s">Support</a>  the paper.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=574.141s">The</a>  other one regarding the vacation time was already passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=578.063s">So</a>  the chair awaits a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=579.904s">Mr.</a>  President, this was a paper that would assign employee payment classifications for the positions that we just created. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=586.988s">Mr.</a>  President move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=663.182s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=665.564s">I</a>  would like to see if we could get the minutes, if minutes are being taken for all the public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=671.569s">I</a>  know there's been meetings with regards to recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=673.811s">I</a>  know there's been meetings with regards to Haines Square that was held at the Roberts Elementary School last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=679.856s">I</a>  also know that you're chairing a bunch of meetings yourself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=684.3s">It</a>  seems like this, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=686.04s">three</a>  or four meetings going on per week, which I want to commend the mayor for doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=690.121s">I</a>  think it's great to get community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=692.762s">I</a>  think it's something that the councils always ask for more community input or business input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=698.664s">I</a>  know in the past we've asked for more public input before the parking meters and before waste management contract was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=706.706s">So</a>  it's definitely something that I think is a positive step. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=709.563s">It's</a>  just something that obviously we can't all make, all seven of us councillors can't make every single meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=716.045s">I</a>  myself, it is tough, you know, so I would like to see what's going on, what our constituents are asking for, the concerns, interests of, you know, everybody that's attending those meetings and see how detailed the minutes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=731.49s">Either</a>  way, whether they're detailed or not, it still would be very helpful for us making our votes going forward and, you know, figuring out <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=739.908s">Tonight</a>  we had a meeting with regards to goals at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=742.85s">So</a>  it would help us to further that discussion on goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=746.793s">And,</a>  you know, it's always good to get public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=750.215s">So,</a>  you know, the e-mails and phone calls we do get are very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=754.318s">But</a>  if there's, you know, a number of people going to each of these meetings making a number of recommendations, I would love to be able to digest it all, have it in Friday's packet, you know, after each week so that we can, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=767.394s">keep</a>  them together and figure out how we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=770.696s">So</a>  I request that if there is minutes, if they could be forwarded to us on a weekly or biweekly basis so that we can gather that information and move accordingly.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=856.043s">I</a>  know this is a very emotional issue as a parent, but tomorrow night there's going to be a meeting at Medford High School regarding this here with the superintendent, the chief of police, the Medford School Committee, who are the people that are responsible for all the policies and procedures regarding the school security. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=873.109s">And</a>  I think it's, I would like to make a motion at table because I think it's important that they have their meeting first <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=878.648s">before</a>  we go down the road of speculating and debating about what happened, how it should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=883.45s">There</a>  are protocols in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=885.211s">And</a>  I think that we should hear from the school administration before we go down the road of debating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=892.555s">I'd</a>  like to hear them first and hear exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=895.036s">I</a>  am motioning to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=896.037s">Motion</a>  to table is undebatable.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=898.518s">I</a>  would ask him to withdraw so that I could speak on the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=902.9s">There's</a>  a lot of people that have been complaining to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=905.722s">And</a>  I think it does need to be discussed publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=909.022s">It's</a>  being thrown out that, you know, no discussion hasn't made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=912.404s">I'm</a>  very happy that there's a meeting tomorrow, but there are people here to speak on it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=916.786s">And</a>  people have asked me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=919.187s">I</a>  think it's a disservice to the city to not publicly broadcast.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=926.69s">All</a>  those in favor, say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=932.112s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=934.313s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=956.403s">You're</a>  withdrawing your motion, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=957.623s">I'm</a>  withdrawing my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=958.404s">Point</a>  of information, Vice President-Elect O'Connor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=961.126s">I</a>  think, as one Councilor, I was getting the complaints two weeks ago, the day after this happened, and I went a whole week without saying a word because I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=972.097s">should</a>  have been brought up by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=974.038s">It</a>  was not, and people were on me to bring it up, and I don't disagree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=978.82s">I</a>  think people need to be able to hear what we have to say about it, what the school committee has to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=983.841s">We're</a>  the ones that decide on the budget in June and decide whether or not the safety budget is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=990.304s">There's</a>  a reason why we should be able to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=994.645s">People</a>  are here tonight, and I just feel like it's definitely needed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1002.662s">To</a>  take point of clarification, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1005.784s">Has</a>  there been any communication between the administration of the school department and the council to date, prior to the filing of the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1012.608s">I'm</a>  not in possession of anything.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1025.939s">Thank</a>  you and I appreciate Councilor, I understand where Councilor Falco is coming from and I appreciate the withdrawal of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1035.002s">I</a>  learned about this bomb threat through Patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1041.605s">I</a>  read it online and as a parent, I didn't even think of it as a parent, I actually called my mother who works for the school system and said, did you know there was a bomb threat three days ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1051.128s">Yeah,</a>  I found out after the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1053.629s">So</a>  I had my mother in the building <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1056.73s">with</a>  a potential bomb threat, whether or not it was low or no threat, you know, I was concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1062.895s">And</a>  then I thought, after I started getting the complaints, I thought, you know, I have one child in the school system, soon going to have two, and then eventually have three. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1073.323s">And</a>  whether or not it was a threat or no threat, I truly believe, and I think it's where a lot of people are coming from, I think that as a parent, I think I should be given the choice <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1084.29s">And</a>  I think a lot of parents do believe the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1086.351s">They</a>  should be given the choice because it's not something that happens every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1089.432s">This</a>  is actually the first threat of something like this that I've heard of happening ever in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1095.475s">So</a>  I think parents are looking for me to come out and say they should have been notified whether that was through a phone call or some type of communication rather than after the children left school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1108.221s">And</a>  I think that's important to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1109.622s">I</a>  think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1110.482s">I</a>  have the right to voice my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1113.165s">And</a>  that is my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1114.225s">Parents</a>  should have been notified in a non-emergency fashion, but a phone call should have went out and said, this is the situation, this is what we're dealing with, and we just want to let you know, there's nothing to be concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1130.371s">But,</a>  and parents, I have a number of parents that have called me upset, saying they would have, even though it was low threat or no threat, parents would have went and picked up their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1141.415s">I</a>  know it's happening all over the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1143.076s">It's</a>  unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1144.096s">It's</a>  something that was completely out of control, out of Medford's control. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1148.338s">I</a>  don't think Medford did any, you know, there's nothing Medford, City of Medford could have done except probably better communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1154.86s">So</a>  I'm very glad it's being addressed tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1157.281s">And</a>  maybe one of the reasons it is being addressed tomorrow night and not last week is because we did put the resolution on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1163.504s">You</a>  know, we are going to talk about it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1165.424s">So</a>  I think that it needed to be put on and I think people need <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1169.917s">and</a>  avenues to be able to speak and give their opinions on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1173.198s">And</a>  obviously, that's going to be in a lengthy meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1175.839s">But</a>  if people want to voice their opinions now, or people looking to other politicians, not just the school committee, to speak out on it, then that's our prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1183.442s">And</a>  I think it was wrong the way it was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1186.204s">And</a>  I hope that new policies are put in place after tomorrow night.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1261.079s">How</a>  dare they not give us the option of deciding what to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1266.601s">And</a>  loco parentis, from a legal perspective, does not mean they get to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1271.343s">And</a>  they could be challenged on that, and we're thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1275.404s">It's</a>  very distressing to know we've had three children in the school system, currently one in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1284.326s">to</a>  know that he's sitting there hoping they got it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1287.669s">If</a>  we wanted to take him home, that should be our option. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1291.912s">Let</a>  us tell you a little story. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1293.313s">We</a>  came in to have a meeting with one of the personnel on the third floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1298.517s">There's</a>  an elderly gentleman who sits at the front desk of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1302.821s">Very</a>  nice gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1304.402s">He</a>  gives you a pass, and you walk up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1307.864s">Doesn't</a>  ask for ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1309.145s">You</a>  could be anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1310.467s">Off</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1312.352s">We've</a>  seen him before, so he knows us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1315.192s">On</a>  our way out, this gentleman was traversing down toward Mr. Belson's area, I guess to go to the men's room. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1322.634s">There</a>  was nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1325.534s">Anyone</a>  could have walked in that high school, and anyone could have done damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1330.115s">That</a>  needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1331.895s">So</a>  when they tell us they looked at the videos, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1335.956s">That's</a>  the extent of determining whether or not somebody was doing some harm in a school that size? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1341.277s">It's</a>  unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1343.22s">And</a>  I think it is your jurisdiction, because one, you approved the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1346.882s">Two,</a>  as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1348.023s">Cain</a>  pointed out, the school committee did nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1350.924s">They</a>  didn't even raise the issue, and it is something they should be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1355.727s">So</a>  I'm just going to say I think it's unconscionable we weren't called. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1359.049s">I</a>  think we should be given that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1361.311s">And</a>  I think it would be a sad day if you folks did not act on this, if you determine after that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1369.514s">that</a>  proper steps have not been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1371.715s">Remember,</a>  the resolution itself says parents may decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1376.157s">That's</a>  what we're here about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1377.297s">We're</a>  not here to question the police or to question Mr. Belson or Dr. Perrella, whom we have trust in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1384.02s">We're</a>  here to say we wrote a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1388.201s">Do</a>  you have anything else to add?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1390.442s">Just</a>  the fact that I support everything you said and that absolutely <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1394.945s">People</a>  need to be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1396.546s">You</a>  can't make any decision without being informed, period.</p>

    <p>[2pAQFYhyG5g_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1401.189s">Thank</a>  you for hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1402.369s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1416.637s">The</a>  chair recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1419.339s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1421.04s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1422.158s">Thank</a>  you, good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1422.898s">Jay</a>  Spaulding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1426.239s">As</a>  a former teacher in a public school district where we had bomb threats and active weapon reuse and a student was shot on property, I know that this issue is terrifying to both <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1452.202s">teachers,</a>  staff, students, parents, administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1455.929s">And</a>  I understand the desire to have this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1463.885s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1466.75s">School</a>  policy regarding safety and security is something that we cannot address here at City Council because the people who have the, in my opinion, the expertise, the knowledge on creating safety plans and security plans are not in this room tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1486.528s">In</a>  this room are parents who are scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1489.715s">in</a>  this room are citizens who work in various areas of both city involvement and private industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1500.884s">But</a>  the chief of police, the superintendent of the school, the principal of the high school, they're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1508.71s">Tomorrow</a>  night, as Councilor Falco said, a serious conversation <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1515.82s">where</a>  things can be addressed will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1519.222s">I</a>  will state as a former teacher that the worst thing, in my opinion, one can do during an active, whether it be an active weaponry incident, an injured student, or a bomb threat, is to have <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1539.271s">Parents</a>  show up on site and try to remove their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1544.414s">That</a>  is a great way to cause chaos, to increase injury, and to cause further damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1554.06s">Whether</a>  the bomb, whether the threat is real or not, the rush of parents to remove students from a building because they're making a decision based on emotion, and I understand that emotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1566.928s">I've</a>  worked in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1568.811s">at</a>  those times, and I would like to leave myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1573.213s">That's</a>  chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1574.294s">That</a>  further endangers everyone in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1578.376s">And</a>  in my opinion, again, having lived through this, the reason that staff, students, teachers are not informed right away or even that day is, again, chaos theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1591.097s">We</a>  don't want people running through the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1593.699s">We</a>  don't want teachers saying, screw this, you guys, I'm out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1597.803s">Good</a>  luck, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1599.184s">I</a>  don't wanna die. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1602.326s">That's</a>  the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1604.668s">So</a>  I am disappointed that this has to come before city council tonight when the issue is coming tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1611.234s">I</a>  think it honestly is a waste of time when we can address this tomorrow with the actual stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1617.219s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1622.085s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1622.646s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1623.106s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1625.529s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1626.691s">I'm</a>  Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1629.975s">Uh,</a>  I too am a former educator in, in, in Massachusetts and, uh, there are definite ways and orderly in, in, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1640.175s">constructive</a>  way for parents to come in and retrieve their kids can happen without it breaking down into chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1647.416s">Uh,</a>  you know, school could be put on lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1650.057s">Everybody</a>  stays in their room. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1651.717s">And</a>  as parents showed up, you know, they're notified where their kids, uh, they communicate and they get them out in an orderly fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1658.538s">Now</a>  I went to, uh, chief Sacco of the method. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1661.979s">Police</a>  holds a informational town hall meeting every first Wednesday of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1668.202s">And</a>  this was the main topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1671.204s">The</a>  police got this threat and the threat was an automated robotic threat to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1678.928s">So</a>  that was one of the things that they used to determine the legitimacy of the threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1685.651s">It</a>  came at a very inopportune time around 10 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1689.693s">The</a>  police did go through the school and make a search. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1693.575s">But</a>  some of the things that they brought up that I think makes it pertinent for this council to talk about was that something like half of the cameras in the school don't work, not every single door is locked and being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1713.879s">Another</a>  thing to consider is that it wasn't the police <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1721.237s">department's</a>  decision to put out the information about this bomb threat at six 30 at night, uh, hours after it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1730.761s">Uh,</a>  uh, I believe that was on, uh, the superintendent of schools, his decision, uh, and, uh, going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1740.245s">I,</a>  as you do consider the budget budget in, in June in, in the police department that we have, I mean, there's Metro police officer, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1749.266s">that</a>  was up there on duty that day also has two kids in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1754.047s">So</a>  they did sweep the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1757.068s">They</a>  did do a search. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1758.668s">I</a>  don't know the full extent of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1760.348s">And</a>  they did pass on the information of the call to the state police to try to track where this robotic call came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1768.93s">But</a>  in considering the budget in June with our police department, I think it would be pertinent to do what you can to get <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1779.312s">uh,</a>  uh, enough police officers on, on the method police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1783.915s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1785.756s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Capucci.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1788.017s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1788.538s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1788.938s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1791.319s">Hi,</a>  my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1792.88s">I</a>  live at 281 Park street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1795.382s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1796.269s">I</a>  heard about this bomb threat online as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1798.451s">I</a>  have a student in the Roberts Elementary, but I pretty much get all of my information about the school online because my school doesn't notify. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1807.297s">I</a>  know other schools call for snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1810.899s">So</a>  this call coming in at 630 for a bomb threat is no surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1816.063s">There's</a>  no clear policy in how schools are supposed to notify parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1821.753s">I</a>  thought this was possibly the PR person's job to kind of unify us because at my school, we've had power outages, we've had heat being out, we've had issues where they can't clean things because there's no hot water, there's no parent notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1838.465s">Somebody</a>  needs to unify this because everyone should know. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1842.088s">We</a>  had the lockdown drill at my school and nobody notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1845.55s">We</a>  had children having anxiety attacks because their parents couldn't prep them for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1850.294s">This</a>  is just a larger issue that we need as parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1854.9s">When</a>  I drop my child off at the school, I don't give up my parental rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1859.305s">I</a>  found out about the power outage last year because I was volunteering in the school building and had to cancel a program for 100 children with less than two hours, walked in the school and found out they had no power. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1870.424s">So</a>  something needs to be done on a systematic level of notifying parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1876.608s">We're</a>  still the parent, and I need to know what's going on for my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1880.25s">I</a>  don't want her to come home and give me this wild story of we had no heat and had to wear our winter coats, because I don't know to believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1887.494s">School</a>  didn't tell me that, so it's probably not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1890.635s">So</a>  I think it's bigger than just bomb threat, and we really need to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1894.798s">It's</a>  a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1896.099s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1899.028s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1899.608s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1903.27s">Vice</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1904.231s">I'm</a>  sorry, I took over. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1907.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1909.233s">Again,</a>  I understand why this is put forth, but again, like my fellow colleague, as a former school committee member, these are issues we've vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1918.218s">And</a>  this is why it's important that we let the due diligence of our elected officials present what needs to be presented tomorrow evening, because it is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1928.023s">These,</a>  as a school committee member, we can list out a litany of answers to all these questions, but it's the job of the school committee to inform everybody tomorrow at their meeting that then would be processed through us, and then we could have that next discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1947.851s">But</a>  I think right now, putting the cart ahead of the horse, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1951.232s">I</a>  understand the questions that you have, the parents have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1953.994s">I</a>  got the same calls and one of the biggest questions was the notification issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1958.416s">Well,</a>  there's a lot of security issues when and why notifications have to be given. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1964.66s">So</a>  that's not for me to tell you that right now, that's for the chief of police and the superintendent to talk tomorrow because I have questions too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1972.645s">I</a>  have questions about the presentation of the PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1978.012s">and</a>  PR person, and when that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1980.474s">But</a>  again, we want to make sure that we're not, you know, putting our school base in a frenzy right now until we really know what has transpired. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1994.084s">So</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1996.065s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2001.669s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2002.61s">I</a>  want to thank my consular colleague, Mr. Scarpelli, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2007.805s">The</a>  point that I was trying to make earlier was basically that we should hear from the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2014.047s">They</a>  can give everyone the rundown as to what happened, what time it happened, why they made the decisions they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2020.289s">If</a>  we're gonna comment on things tonight, it's purely speculation, and that is not safe for anything or anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2027.571s">So</a>  therefore, the important thing is, if you have questions, I think, please, I urge everyone, go to Medford High School tomorrow night, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2036.107s">at</a>  the library, seven o'clock PM, the superintendent's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2039.968s">The</a>  chief of police is going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2041.809s">All</a>  of the decision makers are going to be in the room and they will be able to go right through the timeline as to what happened and when and why they made the decisions they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2049.391s">And</a>  that's what I was trying to put point, uh, put across. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2053.012s">I</a>  mean, I am a parent of three children in the method public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2056.472s">I</a>  mean, I completely understand, um, you know, the notification issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2060.233s">I</a>  mean, I have the same concerns, but I think that the administration should at least give us the information so we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2066.212s">make</a>  decisions and ask good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2068.113s">So</a>  that's the point I was trying to get across. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2070.215s">Uh,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2076.179s">Chair</a>  recognizes the citizen Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2080.122s">Uh,</a>  thank, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2081.763s">I</a>  want to thank a council longer current for putting this on the agenda for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2087.087s">Um,</a>  you know, it was mentioned, I think that this is the first time this has happened in the city and by far that's, this is not the first time there's been, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2095.088s">a</a>  threat of this nature in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2100.031s">But</a>  needless to say, I think Councilor Falco just mentioned about speculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2104.213s">The</a>  reason why there's speculation is because there's no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2109.055s">And</a>  I think that's the main concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2110.836s">I</a>  have two children in the public schools, and when I received the call that night, the first thing that came to my mind was, geez, I would have liked to have a little more information, and maybe I would have liked to have it a little sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2123.132s">And</a>  I realize it's a delicate balance because you don't want to create pandemonium. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2127.555s">How</a>  do you release, you know, if the high school wants to release 800 kids, how do you release them? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2132.039s">And</a>  how do you go on to do it in a safe manner? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2134.7s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2136.041s">And</a>  I think these are the issues that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2139.044s">But</a>  if there's a policy in place, why does it take eight days or tomorrow's nine days? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2144.748s">Why</a>  does it take nine days to say this is our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2148.444s">This</a>  is what we implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2149.925s">This</a>  is what we found out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2151.426s">It</a>  shouldn't take that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2153.008s">And</a>  I think that's the concern that I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2156.03s">And</a>  then as a parent, when they tell me part of the reasoning why they consider this a low threat was they went through 18 hours of videotape. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2165.838s">You</a>  know, anyone that goes up to the high school and the gentleman that spoke is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2170.722s">If</a>  you had to go up and bring your student a book, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2174.255s">say</a>  they forgot a book, they used to have you just sign a sheet of paper and you'd go bring the book to the main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2181.341s">So</a>  they'd let you into the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2182.882s">Just</a>  recently I was up there and now they are asking for ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2186.646s">They've</a>  changed their policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2187.987s">So</a>  the policy before was just sign a sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2190.889s">You</a>  could sign a John Lennon and walk in because really there's no check and balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2196.694s">The</a>  second point I'd like to make too is that high school is open constantly <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2201.515s">Saturday</a>  and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2203.636s">Hundreds</a>  of people going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2205.137s">I</a>  go out myself, Saturday night, and watch my son play basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2208.838s">Every</a>  door up in the gymnasium is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2211.299s">It's</a>  a free for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2213.08s">There's</a>  not one security person up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2215.861s">There's</a>  not one security person going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2218.062s">So</a>  the public schools really have to take, you know, I'm not sure who's looking at 18 hours of videotape. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2224.024s">But</a>  first of all, the back of the school, it's pitch dark out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2227.166s">So</a>  I'm not sure what you're going to see with those cameras in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2231.062s">And</a>  secondly, the whole school's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2233.404s">We</a>  have the Japanese program that's been up there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2237.546s">And</a>  the city of Medford makes a fair amount of money for renting out almost the entire high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2242.229s">But</a>  there's thousands of people that literally have been up and watched the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2247.232s">They</a>  take over all the classrooms in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2249.854s">They</a>  have other classrooms that are under lock and key. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2252.396s">They</a>  come in with wheelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2253.957s">And</a>  we don't know what they're bringing into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2256.738s">And</a>  these are the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2257.859s">And</a>  I'm not saying that this program's a bad program. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2261.011s">I'm</a>  just saying, how do you keep a sense of security when the building is open to everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2269.958s">There's</a>  really no security up there, especially after hours and on weekends, which is a real concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2277.643s">And</a>  I hope it's addressed tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2279.505s">But</a>  I think the issue that I've been hearing from parents is not whether or not they wanted to pull their children out was the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2287.611s">Be</a>  open and upfront with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2289.853s">And</a>  it shouldn't take eight days to figure out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2293.756s">And</a>  if there was a breach in policy or the policy wasn't followed, let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2299.921s">That's</a>  how we improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2305.245s">This</a>  is how you improve upon policy and regulations when something like this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2311.17s">And</a>  to just brush it under the rug and then come up with a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2315.574s">You</a>  know, I've been calling for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2318.038s">for</a>  a public safety summit, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2321.619s">And</a>  it's not just on the city side, it's in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2324.38s">It's</a>  to bring the police department, the fire chief in, the mayor, the council, and anyone else that wants to be part of it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2331.962s">And</a>  for two years, I just called for another one recently, that this council voted unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2337.004s">We</a>  have got no response at all regarding a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2342.192s">It's</a>  almost like people in this community don't want to discuss what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2346.953s">They</a>  don't want to discuss the robberies that are happening in our local drug stores almost daily, the bank robberies, an incident like this at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2355.895s">And</a>  the list goes on and on and on, drug activity on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2360.236s">And</a>  we've been asking, Mr. President, to get together, like any good community would, and discuss some of our shortfalls and maybe why we're seeing an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2370.451s">in</a>  this particular activity in our community, and what we can do better to provide security. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2376.654s">You</a>  know, so I'm glad that this was discussed tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2381.556s">We're</a>  not talking out of school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2383.396s">We're</a>  not letting any secrets out about safety at the high school, you know, ways someone could breach the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2389.859s">We're</a>  saying that we believe there's a concern, and the concern has to be addressed in a much quicker fashion, so speculation <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2397.452s">doesn't</a>  get out there, and people start thinking, oh, my God, what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2403.573s">So</a>  we hired a $90,000 PR person. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2410.035s">I</a>  didn't see one communication from that PR person. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2414.135s">Not</a>  one communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2417.576s">If</a>  you can't address an issue of this nature, what are they addressing? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2423.237s">Honestly,</a>  I don't know what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2427.413s">This</a>  is a concern that parents should be upset about. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2432.156s">And</a>  maybe this is not the best forum, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2434.677s">We're</a>  an open forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2435.857s">People</a>  can come up to the podium and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2438.619s">And</a>  the day we start censoring what can be said at that podium, you might as well close the light and lock the door here at City Hall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2448.624s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Longo for bringing this important issue up.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2455.482s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2457.103s">Just</a>  to clarify, I believe that this council, not to censor anybody, but the idea of systematically going through and understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2468.131s">Now</a>  tomorrow evening, I'll be there and I will ask those questions about communication and the protocol that my fellow councilmen and myself helped write and understand why that wasn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2482.822s">And</a>  then bring that forward <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2484.807s">in</a>  the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2486.188s">But</a>  what I think that at least this council's — this council's questioned issues are — Point of information, Mr. President.</p>
