00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:25,439

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,400

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,100
Present.

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,841
Seven members present, nine none absent.

18
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,441
Please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:38,219
She recognizes Councillor Nye for suspension of the rules.

20
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:51,342
to take papers 1602, 16021, 16022, 16023.

21
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:04,705
All papers are eligible for their third reading relative to the reorganization of the administrative offices.

22
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:13,027
On the motion for suspension of the rules to take the aforementioned papers off the table for approval, all those in favor?

23
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:14,587
Opposed?

24
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:14,627
16-021.

25
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:36,067
I'm sorry, 16-020, amendment of article four, officers and employees, division four, city solicitor, was tabled for its introduction on the 12th, past first reading, January 19th.

26
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:43,339
and advertised its second reading January 28th eligible tonight for its third and final reading.

27
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:54,401
This is on, uh, the reestablishment of the, uh, time tenure, uh, an appointment of the, uh, city solicitor chair weights motion.

28
00:01:54,821 --> 00:02:00,483
Um, Mr. President, I think this, uh, matter that the S the mayor's put forward is relatively cut and dry.

29
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:04,944
What this matter does is, uh, it gives the city solicitor a two year appointment code terminus with the administration.

30
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,730
The paper's been through its first two readings, Mr. President.

31
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,652
If there's anybody in the audience that would like to speak, I think we should give them the opportunity.

32
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,933
And if any of the councillors want to speak on it, so be it.

33
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,273
But I'd move for approval.

34
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,495
A motion for approval by Councillor Knight.

35
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,236
Seconded by Councillor Caviello.

36
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:21,757
Is it a matter for a roll call?

37
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:22,938
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

38
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:30,789
Yes.

39
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,870
Yes.

40
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,550
Yes.

41
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,191
Yes.

42
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:37,531
Yes.

43
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:37,891
Yes.

44
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,192
With a vote of seven, the affirmative.

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,432
None.

46
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:51,135
The negative motion is ordered 16 dash zero to one amendment to vitals for officers and employees division for a chief of staff.

47
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:59,258
This came before us pertinent to the creation of the position of chief of staff in the administration.

48
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,102
It came before us on January 12th.

49
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,044
It was tabled on January 19th.

50
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,026
After explanation, it passed the first reading.

51
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:11,969
On January 28th, it was advertised as its second reading.

52
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,032
It is now tonight eligible for its third and final reading.

53
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,012
Chair awaits a motion.

54
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:23,417
Mr. President, again, this piece of legislation would create the position chief of staff and reorganize the administrative office.

55
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:24,778
It's been through its first reading.

56
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:25,598
We had some questions.

57
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,840
If the questions were answered, I'd move for approval.

58
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:32,426
On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Vice-President Hunko Kern.

59
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,206
Thank you, President De La Russo.

60
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:44,628
With regards to this question, I believe we asked for just an update with regards to, I think a couple of us did some research on numbers for chief of staffs in the surrounding communities.

61
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:49,449
And the 106,000 is kind of something that stuck out for me.

62
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,849
That's almost as close to what the mayor's making.

63
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:57,410
So we did ask for a communication back from the mayor with regards to, you know, why this,

64
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:00,318
this position was being funded so high.

65
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:09,341
And then you have a, you know, chief procurement officer slash budget budget director taken on two jobs that is making about the same, if not a little less than the chief of staff.

66
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:12,082
So I just would like to get an answer on that.

67
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:16,644
I think we had a explanation of councilor Knight.

68
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:21,605
Um, with all due respect to the counselor, Mr. President, if she feels as though the position's overpaid, this is a piece of legislation.

69
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,846
She can't amend the piece of legislation while it's on the floor.

70
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:25,827
Um, we've discussed it.

71
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:26,547
I think that it's a,

72
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:31,271
It's a good position, it's a necessary position, it's a required position, Mr. President, and I support the matter wholeheartedly.

73
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:34,693
No, I'm glad he does.

74
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:47,859
Not that I don't support the position or the reorganization, I just think the 106,000, as do many people, believe that might be a little bit high for a position like this in a city like this.

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,740
We're just looking for some explanation.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,401
Will this person be working more than 40 hours?

77
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:54,942
We did get the job description.

78
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,243
I think one of the job descriptions,

79
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,300
was that that person would be in front of the city council.

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,643
We have yet to see that person at a council meeting or even a committee of the whole meeting.

81
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:09,547
So, you know, what exactly is the reasoning for the hundred?

82
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,889
It's such an exorbitant amount of money.

83
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:20,435
Again, when we have people taking on double jobs and making less than that, I just don't see, I just would like some clarification on that.

84
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:24,958
Well, maybe a point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

85
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:32,556
Just so I'm clearing up a question myself, but I believe it was Chief of Staff slash Personnel Director.

86
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:33,476
Correct.

87
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,437
So it's two jobs.

88
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:35,037
Correct.

89
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,838
Okay, that's all.

90
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:37,118
Thank you.

91
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:38,878
Thank you, Councillor.

92
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:50,302
Maybe some light can be shed on this matter by the Director of Budget and Personnel, Director of Budget, Pro Tempore, who's with us right now.

93
00:05:59,792 --> 00:05:59,972
Ms.

94
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:05,277
Miller, bonsoir.

95
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:09,101
The question from the councilor was an inquiry.

96
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:21,232
I don't know if it was answered or even formally requested by way of resolution, but regarding the level of salary for the chief of staff,

97
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:28,696
which encompasses chief of staff and policy for the mayor, as well as, uh, matters of personnel management.

98
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:37,001
Um, uh, question the counselor had was that, uh, she felt that, uh, the salary was high.

99
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:42,485
Um, the position is director of personnel and director of policy.

100
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:49,109
And, um, I did not get a resolution regarding a salary comparison.

101
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:50,990
I do not know if the mayor's office,

102
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:52,516
receive that.

103
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:58,920
We answered the questions that we did receive, and I do not know what the comparison would be standing right here right now.

104
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:05,785
Thank you.

105
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:10,208
Well, we have a motion for approval that has been seconded by Councilor Caviello.

106
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,350
Did Councilor Falco wish to speak on this matter?

107
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,754
No, actually Mr. Scarpelli made the point that I was going to make basically that it is two positions.

108
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:24,375
I think that probably justifies the salary, just like the, uh, the new, um, procurement position.

109
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,338
That's two positions as well that one person is taking off.

110
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:31,739
So that's why I think that's the justification for the higher cell.

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Thank you.

112
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,702
On the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

113
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:37,463
Yes.

114
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:37,703
Yes.

115
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:37,963
No.

116
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:38,223
Yes.

117
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:52,757
Yes, with a vote of 6 in the affirmative, 1 in the negative, the matter is ordered.

118
00:07:52,777 --> 00:08:02,282
16-022, amendment to Article 5, Finance Division 2, Chief Procurement Officer.

119
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:06,284
The matter appeared before us on January 12th and was tabled.

120
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,646
On January 19th, it passed its first reading.

121
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:14,169
It was advertised on the 28th for a second reading.

122
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:19,915
and is before us for a third and final reading tonight.

123
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:23,176
Chair awaits motion.

124
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:26,677
Again, Mr. President, this was a reorganization of the administrative office.

125
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:32,578
I would establish a chief procurement officer and also allow the chief procurement officer to continue in her role as a budget director.

126
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,539
I move for approval, Mr. President.

127
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:35,099
Support the paper.

128
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,541
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

129
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,114
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

130
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:46,416
Yes.

131
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:46,516
Yes.

132
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:03,744
Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion is ordered.

133
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:24,377
16-023, Amendment of Chapter 66, Personnel, Article 2, Non-Union Compensation, appeared before us on January 12th, tabled January 19th, past first reading, January 28th, as advertised for second reading, now before us for action.

134
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,218
This was on...

135
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:32,260
Establishing the personnel classifications, I believe in the position.

136
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,780
That's what it was, the classifications.

137
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,643
The other one regarding the vacation time was already passed.

138
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,463
So the chair awaits a motion.

139
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:46,948
Mr. President, this was a paper that would assign employee payment classifications for the positions that we just created.

140
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:48,949
Mr. President move for approval.

141
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,251
Motion for approval by counselor Knight, uh, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

142
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,733
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

143
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,815
Yes.

144
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:04,256
Yes.

145
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,918
Yes.

146
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:09,278
Yes.

147
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:10,939
Yes.

148
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,240
With a vote of 70 affirmative, none in the negative.

149
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,421
Uh, the motion is ordered.

150
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,323
Congratulations, Mr. Solicitor.

151
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,364
Uh, yes, Mr. President, members of the council.

152
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,424
I just wanted to thank you.

153
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,306
I'm very happy that it went through all of its three readings.

154
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,967
I thought that that was good government and, uh,

155
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,067
just wanted to say thank you to the council.

156
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,208
Thank you.

157
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:33,908
Thank you.

158
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,349
Thank you as well.

159
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,450
Motion to revert to regular order of business.

160
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,471
Mr. President on the motion of council night to revert back to the regular order of business.

161
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:57,473
All those in favor, all those opposed carry 16 dash zero 62 offered by vice president Lungo Kern be resolved that the administration provide this metric city council

162
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:01,840
with the minutes from each of the public meetings being held.

163
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:02,941
Madam Vice President.

164
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:04,463
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

165
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:11,108
I would like to see if we could get the minutes, if minutes are being taken for all the public meetings.

166
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,771
I know there's been meetings with regards to recreation.

167
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:19,336
I know there's been meetings with regards to Haines Square that was held at the Roberts Elementary School last week.

168
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:23,099
I also know that you're chairing a bunch of meetings yourself, Mr. President.

169
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,301
It seems like this,

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,081
three or four meetings going on per week, which I want to commend the mayor for doing.

171
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,502
I think it's great to get community input.

172
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:37,664
I think it's something that the councils always ask for more community input or business input.

173
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:46,266
I know in the past we've asked for more public input before the parking meters and before waste management contract was signed.

174
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,247
So it's definitely something that I think is a positive step.

175
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:56,025
It's just something that obviously we can't all make, all seven of us councillors can't make every single meeting.

176
00:11:56,045 --> 00:12:10,990
I myself, it is tough, you know, so I would like to see what's going on, what our constituents are asking for, the concerns, interests of, you know, everybody that's attending those meetings and see how detailed the minutes are.

177
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:19,433
Either way, whether they're detailed or not, it still would be very helpful for us making our votes going forward and, you know, figuring out

178
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,750
Tonight we had a meeting with regards to goals at 6 p.m.

179
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,513
So it would help us to further that discussion on goals.

180
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:30,095
And, you know, it's always good to get public input.

181
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,878
So, you know, the e-mails and phone calls we do get are very helpful.

182
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:46,687
But if there's, you know, a number of people going to each of these meetings making a number of recommendations, I would love to be able to digest it all, have it in Friday's packet, you know, after each week so that we can, you know,

183
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:50,216
keep them together and figure out how we're going to move forward.

184
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:59,821
So I request that if there is minutes, if they could be forwarded to us on a weekly or biweekly basis so that we can gather that information and move accordingly.

185
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:06,184
For your information, Madam Vice President, they are all smartly posted on the city's webpage.

186
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:08,186
Already?

187
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:09,506
Progress.

188
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:12,748
About how long does it take to post?

189
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:13,589
I don't know.

190
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:14,589
Oh, I haven't seen them.

191
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:17,297
There.

192
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:17,918
They're on there.

193
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:18,338
Nice.

194
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,561
Councilor Scott.

195
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,202
Thank you.

196
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,024
It's my question, Mr. President.

197
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:23,885
Thank you.

198
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:28,289
So on the motion for approval by vice president, all those in favor.

199
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,172
I'm just all those opposed.

200
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:32,494
I'd love a coffee.

201
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:33,715
Congratulations.

202
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,720
16 dash zero 63 offered by vice president Lungo Kern.

203
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,721
Whereas,

204
00:13:39,294 --> 00:14:08,653
In light of the recent bomb threat at Medford High School and the numerous complaints from parents who were not notified until after the school day ended, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee look into their policies and procedures, and if it happens in the future, that the school department alert parents immediately, even if it's deemed to be no slash low threat, so that each parent may decide whether or not they want their child to complete the day

205
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,182
Chair recognizes Vice President Mungo Kern.

206
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:12,542
Thank you, President.

207
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:13,102
Councilor Falco.

208
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:14,823
Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:32,569
I know this is a very emotional issue as a parent, but tomorrow night there's going to be a meeting at Medford High School regarding this here with the superintendent, the chief of police, the Medford School Committee, who are the people that are responsible for all the policies and procedures regarding the school security.

210
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:37,911
And I think it's, I would like to make a motion at table because I think it's important that they have their meeting first

211
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:43,430
before we go down the road of speculating and debating about what happened, how it should happen.

212
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,771
There are protocols in place.

213
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:52,515
And I think that we should hear from the school administration before we go down the road of debating this.

214
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,836
I'd like to hear them first and hear exactly what happened.

215
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:55,997
I am motioning to table.

216
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,498
Motion to table is undebatable.

217
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:02,880
I would ask him to withdraw so that I could speak on the resolution.

218
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,702
There's a lot of people that have been complaining to me.

219
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:08,343
And I think it does need to be discussed publicly.

220
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:12,344
It's being thrown out that, you know, no discussion hasn't made.

221
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:16,726
I'm very happy that there's a meeting tomorrow, but there are people here to speak on it tonight.

222
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:19,007
And people have asked me.

223
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:26,490
I think it's a disservice to the city to not publicly broadcast.

224
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,451
All those in favor, say aye.

225
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:32,633
Mr. President.

226
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,134
Councillor Falco.

227
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:37,575
If we could reverse the tape.

228
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:54,161
I'll reverse the table to hear from the resident, but I firmly believe that this here should be addressed by the school system before we address, this is not our jurisdiction, really.

229
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,383
I mean, the way I look at it.

230
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,603
You're withdrawing your motion, Councilor.

231
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,184
I'm withdrawing my motion.

232
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,685
Point of information, Vice President-Elect O'Connor.

233
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:11,232
I think, as one Councilor, I was getting the complaints two weeks ago, the day after this happened, and I went a whole week without saying a word because I agree.

234
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,618
should have been brought up by the school committee.

235
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:18,419
It was not, and people were on me to bring it up, and I don't disagree with them.

236
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,481
I think people need to be able to hear what we have to say about it, what the school committee has to say about it.

237
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:30,284
We're the ones that decide on the budget in June and decide whether or not the safety budget is enough.

238
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,945
There's a reason why we should be able to talk about it.

239
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:38,507
People are here tonight, and I just feel like it's definitely needed.

240
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:45,464
To take point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

241
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:51,167
Has there been any communication between the administration of the school department and the council to date, prior to the filing of the resolution?

242
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,968
I'm not in possession of anything.

243
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,312
The motion for tabling has been withdrawn.

244
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:05,535
The chair recognizes the presenter of the motion, Vice President Lungo Kern.

245
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:12,401
Thank you and I appreciate Councilor, I understand where Councilor Falco is coming from and I appreciate the withdrawal of the motion.

246
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:21,145
I learned about this bomb threat through Patch.

247
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:30,608
I read it online and as a parent, I didn't even think of it as a parent, I actually called my mother who works for the school system and said, did you know there was a bomb threat three days ago?

248
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,989
Yeah, I found out after the end of the day.

249
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,190
So I had my mother in the building

250
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,954
with a potential bomb threat, whether or not it was low or no threat, you know, I was concerned.

251
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:52,463
And then I thought, after I started getting the complaints, I thought, you know, I have one child in the school system, soon going to have two, and then eventually have three.

252
00:17:53,323 --> 00:18:03,652
And whether or not it was a threat or no threat, I truly believe, and I think it's where a lot of people are coming from, I think that as a parent, I think I should be given the choice

253
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,331
And I think a lot of parents do believe the same thing.

254
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,412
They should be given the choice because it's not something that happens every day.

255
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:14,935
This is actually the first threat of something like this that I've heard of happening ever in the Medford Public Schools.

256
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:27,861
So I think parents are looking for me to come out and say they should have been notified whether that was through a phone call or some type of communication rather than after the children left school.

257
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:29,582
And I think that's important to say.

258
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:30,402
I think it's important.

259
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:32,263
I have the right to voice my opinion.

260
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,165
And that is my opinion.

261
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:50,071
Parents should have been notified in a non-emergency fashion, but a phone call should have went out and said, this is the situation, this is what we're dealing with, and we just want to let you know, there's nothing to be concerned about.

262
00:18:50,371 --> 00:19:00,394
But, and parents, I have a number of parents that have called me upset, saying they would have, even though it was low threat or no threat, parents would have went and picked up their children.

263
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:02,996
I know it's happening all over the state.

264
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:03,896
It's unfortunate.

265
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:08,298
It's something that was completely out of control, out of Medford's control.

266
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:14,800
I don't think Medford did any, you know, there's nothing Medford, City of Medford could have done except probably better communication.

267
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,801
So I'm very glad it's being addressed tomorrow night.

268
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:22,743
And maybe one of the reasons it is being addressed tomorrow night and not last week is because we did put the resolution on.

269
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:24,924
You know, we are going to talk about it tonight.

270
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:29,186
So I think that it needed to be put on and I think people need

271
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,678
and avenues to be able to speak and give their opinions on it.

272
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:35,719
And obviously, that's going to be in a lengthy meeting tomorrow night.

273
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:43,402
But if people want to voice their opinions now, or people looking to other politicians, not just the school committee, to speak out on it, then that's our prerogative.

274
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:46,164
And I think it was wrong the way it was handled.

275
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:50,365
And I hope that new policies are put in place after tomorrow night.

276
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:56,908
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

277
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:04,535
On the motion, you wish to present yourself, welcome.

278
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,697
Please state your name and address for the record.

279
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,099
Robert Candy, 128 Grant Avenue, Medford.

280
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,001
Monique DeVos, 128 Grant Avenue, Medford.

281
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:14,621
Thank you.

282
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:15,902
You may speak one at a time.

283
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:16,662
Thank you.

284
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:20,685
Well, Councillor, thank you for the motion.

285
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:24,547
And Councillor Falco, thank you for withdrawing it for the time being.

286
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:30,349
I don't think either of us is in any way opposed to the meeting itself or to working things out.

287
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,732
There's been zero information other than what was in the transcript.

288
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,874
To our knowledge, the bomb threat occurred somewhere around 9 a.m.

289
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,295
when kids were in school.

290
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,997
Neither the kids nor the teachers knew about it, to our knowledge as well.

291
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:54,422
We don't know if any sweep was done or conducted, and in that regard, we trust the police and we trust that the school

292
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,438
has our children's best interests in mind.

293
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,739
That said, how dare they not call us?

294
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:06,481
How dare they not give us the option of deciding what to do?

295
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:10,662
And loco parentis, from a legal perspective, does not mean they get to make that decision.

296
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,803
And they could be challenged on that, and we're thinking about that.

297
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:22,126
It's very distressing to know we've had three children in the school system, currently one in high school.

298
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,508
to know that he's sitting there hoping they got it right.

299
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,571
If we wanted to take him home, that should be our option.

300
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:33,253
Let us tell you a little story.

301
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:37,656
We came in to have a meeting with one of the personnel on the third floor.

302
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:42,420
There's an elderly gentleman who sits at the front desk of the high school.

303
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:43,741
Very nice gentleman.

304
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,704
He gives you a pass, and you walk up.

305
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:48,865
Doesn't ask for ID.

306
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:50,046
You could be anybody.

307
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:50,867
Off you go.

308
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,152
We've seen him before, so he knows us.

309
00:21:55,192 --> 00:22:02,114
On our way out, this gentleman was traversing down toward Mr. Belson's area, I guess to go to the men's room.

310
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,514
There was nobody there.

311
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,235
Anyone could have walked in that high school, and anyone could have done damage.

312
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:11,075
That needs to change.

313
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,736
So when they tell us they looked at the videos, really?

314
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:20,957
That's the extent of determining whether or not somebody was doing some harm in a school that size?

315
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,057
It's unconscionable.

316
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,182
And I think it is your jurisdiction, because one, you approved the budget.

317
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,003
Two, as Ms.

318
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,784
Cain pointed out, the school committee did nothing.

319
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:34,667
They didn't even raise the issue, and it is something they should be talking about.

320
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:38,709
So I'm just going to say I think it's unconscionable we weren't called.

321
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,850
I think we should be given that opportunity.

322
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:48,575
And I think it would be a sad day if you folks did not act on this, if you determine after that meeting.

323
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:51,235
that proper steps have not been taken.

324
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:56,037
Remember, the resolution itself says parents may decide.

325
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,217
That's what we're here about.

326
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:03,280
We're not here to question the police or to question Mr. Belson or Dr. Perrella, whom we have trust in.

327
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,281
We're here to say we wrote a call.

328
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,402
Do you have anything else to add?

329
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,904
Just the fact that I support everything you said and that absolutely

330
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,046
People need to be informed.

331
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:19,348
You can't make any decision without being informed, period.

332
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,089
Thank you for hearing us.

333
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,770
Thank you for being here tonight.

334
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:30,494
Chair recognizes Councillor Falco.

335
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:32,555
I can wait.

336
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:34,076
I can wait.

337
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:38,879
The chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

338
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,000
Please state your name and address for the record.

339
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,340
Welcome.

340
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:42,858
Thank you, good evening.

341
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:45,199
Jay Spaulding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway.

342
00:23:46,239 --> 00:24:11,068
As a former teacher in a public school district where we had bomb threats and active weapon reuse and a student was shot on property, I know that this issue is terrifying to both

343
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:15,909
teachers, staff, students, parents, administration.

344
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:23,624
And I understand the desire to have this resolution.

345
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:24,285
However,

346
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:45,287
School policy regarding safety and security is something that we cannot address here at City Council because the people who have the, in my opinion, the expertise, the knowledge on creating safety plans and security plans are not in this room tonight.

347
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,970
In this room are parents who are scared.

348
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:59,723
in this room are citizens who work in various areas of both city involvement and private industry.

349
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:08,049
But the chief of police, the superintendent of the school, the principal of the high school, they're not here.

350
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:15,135
Tomorrow night, as Councilor Falco said, a serious conversation

351
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,661
where things can be addressed will happen.

352
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:38,091
I will state as a former teacher that the worst thing, in my opinion, one can do during an active, whether it be an active weaponry incident, an injured student, or a bomb threat, is to have

353
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,594
Parents show up on site and try to remove their child.

354
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:52,459
That is a great way to cause chaos, to increase injury, and to cause further damage.

355
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:06,508
Whether the bomb, whether the threat is real or not, the rush of parents to remove students from a building because they're making a decision based on emotion, and I understand that emotion.

356
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:08,129
I've worked in those buildings.

357
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:10,812
at those times, and I would like to leave myself.

358
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:14,014
That's chaos.

359
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:18,356
That further endangers everyone in the building.

360
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:30,202
And in my opinion, again, having lived through this, the reason that staff, students, teachers are not informed right away or even that day is, again, chaos theory.

361
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:33,639
We don't want people running through the hallways.

362
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:37,262
We don't want teachers saying, screw this, you guys, I'm out.

363
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:38,643
Good luck, kids.

364
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:39,944
I don't wanna die.

365
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:44,168
That's the reality of the situation.

366
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:51,194
So I am disappointed that this has to come before city council tonight when the issue is coming tomorrow.

367
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:56,798
I think it honestly is a waste of time when we can address this tomorrow with the actual stakeholders.

368
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:57,499
Thank you.

369
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:02,606
Good evening.

370
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:03,046
Welcome.

371
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:05,169
Please state your name and address for the record.

372
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,591
Thank you, Mr. President.

373
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,234
I'm Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

374
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:19,507
Uh, I too am a former educator in, in, in Massachusetts and, uh, there are definite ways and orderly in, in,

375
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:26,736
constructive way for parents to come in and retrieve their kids can happen without it breaking down into chaos.

376
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,657
Uh, you know, school could be put on lockdown.

377
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,237
Everybody stays in their room.

378
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:37,958
And as parents showed up, you know, they're notified where their kids, uh, they communicate and they get them out in an orderly fashion.

379
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,959
Now I went to, uh, chief Sacco of the method.

380
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:47,620
Police holds a informational town hall meeting every first Wednesday of the month.

381
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:49,823
And this was the main topic.

382
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:58,427
The police got this threat and the threat was an automated robotic threat to the school.

383
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:04,170
So that was one of the things that they used to determine the legitimacy of the threat.

384
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,633
It came at a very inopportune time around 10 in the morning.

385
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:13,055
The police did go through the school and make a search.

386
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:31,178
But some of the things that they brought up that I think makes it pertinent for this council to talk about was that something like half of the cameras in the school don't work, not every single door is locked and being looked at.

387
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:40,060
Another thing to consider is that it wasn't the police

388
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:50,081
department's decision to put out the information about this bomb threat at six 30 at night, uh, hours after it happened.

389
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:59,824
Uh, uh, I believe that was on, uh, the superintendent of schools, his decision, uh, and, uh, going forward.

390
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:08,788
I, as you do consider the budget budget in, in June in, in the police department that we have, I mean, there's Metro police officer,

391
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:13,847
that was up there on duty that day also has two kids in the school.

392
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:17,028
So they did sweep the school.

393
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,108
They did do a search.

394
00:29:18,668 --> 00:29:20,168
I don't know the full extent of that.

395
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:28,490
And they did pass on the information of the call to the state police to try to track where this robotic call came from.

396
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:38,432
But in considering the budget in June with our police department, I think it would be pertinent to do what you can to get

397
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:43,655
uh, uh, enough police officers on, on the method police force.

398
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,875
Thank you, Mr. President.

399
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:46,817
Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

400
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:48,498
Good evening.

401
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:48,878
Welcome.

402
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,719
Please state your name and address for the record.

403
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,780
Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

404
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,321
I live at 281 Park street.

405
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:55,422
Um,

406
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,391
I heard about this bomb threat online as well.

407
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:07,277
I have a student in the Roberts Elementary, but I pretty much get all of my information about the school online because my school doesn't notify.

408
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:10,439
I know other schools call for snow days.

409
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:16,023
So this call coming in at 630 for a bomb threat is no surprise.

410
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:20,486
There's no clear policy in how schools are supposed to notify parents.

411
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:37,945
I thought this was possibly the PR person's job to kind of unify us because at my school, we've had power outages, we've had heat being out, we've had issues where they can't clean things because there's no hot water, there's no parent notification.

412
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,667
Somebody needs to unify this because everyone should know.

413
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:45,510
We had the lockdown drill at my school and nobody notified.

414
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,253
We had children having anxiety attacks because their parents couldn't prep them for this.

415
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:54,539
This is just a larger issue that we need as parents.

416
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,884
When I drop my child off at the school, I don't give up my parental rights.

417
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:09,877
I found out about the power outage last year because I was volunteering in the school building and had to cancel a program for 100 children with less than two hours, walked in the school and found out they had no power.

418
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:16,327
So something needs to be done on a systematic level of notifying parents.

419
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,130
We're still the parent, and I need to know what's going on for my child.

420
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,374
I don't want her to come home and give me this wild story of we had no heat and had to wear our winter coats, because I don't know to believe that.

421
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:30,035
School didn't tell me that, so it's probably not true.

422
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,518
So I think it's bigger than just bomb threat, and we really need to think about that.

423
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:35,638
It's a bigger issue.

424
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:36,379
Thank you.

425
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:39,348
Thank you.

426
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:42,710
Chair recognizes Vice President Scarpelli.

427
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,751
Vice President.

428
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,531
I'm sorry, I took over.

429
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:47,933
Thank you.

430
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:58,198
Again, I understand why this is put forth, but again, like my fellow colleague, as a former school committee member, these are issues we've vetted.

431
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:07,343
And this is why it's important that we let the due diligence of our elected officials present what needs to be presented tomorrow evening, because it is important.

432
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:27,151
These, as a school committee member, we can list out a litany of answers to all these questions, but it's the job of the school committee to inform everybody tomorrow at their meeting that then would be processed through us, and then we could have that next discussion.

433
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:30,612
But I think right now, putting the cart ahead of the horse,

434
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,573
I understand the questions that you have, the parents have.

435
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,916
I got the same calls and one of the biggest questions was the notification issue.

436
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:44,140
Well, there's a lot of security issues when and why notifications have to be given.

437
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:52,425
So that's not for me to tell you that right now, that's for the chief of police and the superintendent to talk tomorrow because I have questions too.

438
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:57,448
I have questions about the presentation of the PR.

439
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:00,074
and PR person, and when that was done.

440
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:13,423
But again, we want to make sure that we're not, you know, putting our school base in a frenzy right now until we really know what has transpired.

441
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,005
So I think that's very important.

442
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:18,407
So thank you.

443
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:22,590
Thank you, Mr. President.

444
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,893
I want to thank my consular colleague, Mr. Scott Pelley, as well.

445
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:33,507
The point that I was trying to make earlier was basically that we should hear from the school administration.

446
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:40,269
They can give everyone the rundown as to what happened, what time it happened, why they made the decisions they made.

447
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:47,111
If we're gonna comment on things tonight, it's purely speculation, and that is not safe for anything or anyone.

448
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:55,194
So therefore, the important thing is, if you have questions, I think, please, I urge everyone, go to Medford High School tomorrow night,

449
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:59,348
at the library, seven o'clock PM, the superintendent's going to be there.

450
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:01,568
The chief of police is going to be there.

451
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:08,710
All of the decision makers are going to be in the room and they will be able to go right through the timeline as to what happened and when and why they made the decisions they made.

452
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,811
And that's what I was trying to put point, uh, put across.

453
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:16,212
I mean, I am a parent of three children in the method public schools.

454
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,093
I mean, I completely understand, um, you know, the notification issue.

455
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:25,735
I mean, I have the same concerns, but I think that the administration should at least give us the information so we can,

456
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:27,813
make decisions and ask good questions.

457
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:29,634
So that's the point I was trying to get across.

458
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:33,817
Uh, thank you.

459
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,521
Chair recognizes the citizen council marks.

460
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,703
Uh, thank, thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:46,346
I want to thank a council longer current for putting this on the agenda for tonight.

462
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:54,692
Um, you know, it was mentioned, I think that this is the first time this has happened in the city and by far that's, this is not the first time there's been,

463
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:59,670
a threat of this nature in the Memphis Public Schools.

464
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,793
But needless to say, I think Councilor Falco just mentioned about speculation.

465
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:07,995
The reason why there's speculation is because there's no communication.

466
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:10,796
And I think that's the main concern.

467
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:22,242
I have two children in the public schools, and when I received the call that night, the first thing that came to my mind was, geez, I would have liked to have a little more information, and maybe I would have liked to have it a little sooner.

468
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:27,235
And I realize it's a delicate balance because you don't want to create pandemonium.

469
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:31,618
How do you release, you know, if the high school wants to release 800 kids, how do you release them?

470
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,380
And how do you go on to do it in a safe manner?

471
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,541
I understand that.

472
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,623
And I think these are the issues that need to be discussed.

473
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:44,307
But if there's a policy in place, why does it take eight days or tomorrow's nine days?

474
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:47,930
Why does it take nine days to say this is our policy?

475
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,665
This is what we implemented.

476
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,026
This is what we found out.

477
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:52,607
It shouldn't take that long.

478
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,610
And I think that's the concern that I'm hearing.

479
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:04,597
And then as a parent, when they tell me part of the reasoning why they consider this a low threat was they went through 18 hours of videotape.

480
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,361
You know, anyone that goes up to the high school and the gentleman that spoke is right.

481
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:13,765
If you had to go up and bring your student a book,

482
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:21,001
say they forgot a book, they used to have you just sign a sheet of paper and you'd go bring the book to the main office.

483
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:22,482
So they'd let you into the school.

484
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:26,205
Just recently I was up there and now they are asking for ID.

485
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:27,947
They've changed their policy.

486
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:30,329
So the policy before was just sign a sheet.

487
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:35,894
You could sign a John Lennon and walk in because really there's no check and balance.

488
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:41,058
The second point I'd like to make too is that high school is open constantly

489
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:42,776
Saturday and Sunday.

490
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,057
Hundreds of people going in there.

491
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:48,278
I go out myself, Saturday night, and watch my son play basketball.

492
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:50,979
Every door up in the gymnasium is open.

493
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,219
It's a free for all.

494
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,281
There's not one security person up there.

495
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,022
There's not one security person going on.

496
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:03,624
So the public schools really have to take, you know, I'm not sure who's looking at 18 hours of videotape.

497
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:07,146
But first of all, the back of the school, it's pitch dark out there.

498
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,407
So I'm not sure what you're going to see with those cameras in the back.

499
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,963
And secondly, the whole school's open.

500
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:17,106
We have the Japanese program that's been up there for a number of years.

501
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:21,769
And the city of Method makes a fair amount of money for renting out almost the entire high school.

502
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:27,152
But there's thousands of people that literally have been up and watched the program.

503
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:29,554
They take over all the classrooms in the high school.

504
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:32,096
They have other classrooms that are under lock and key.

505
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:33,877
They come in with wheelers.

506
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:36,098
And we don't know what they're bringing into the building.

507
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:37,799
And these are the things.

508
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,661
And I'm not saying that this program's a bad program.

509
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:48,677
I'm just saying, how do you keep a sense of security when the building is open to everyone?

510
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:57,123
There's really no security up there, especially after hours and on weekends, which is a real concern of mine.

511
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,465
And I hope it's addressed tomorrow.

512
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:07,191
But I think the issue that I've been hearing from parents is not whether or not they wanted to pull their children out was the lack of communication.

513
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:09,092
Be open and upfront with people.

514
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:13,236
And it shouldn't take eight days to figure out what's going on.

515
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:19,041
And if there was a breach in policy or the policy wasn't followed, let us know.

516
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,503
That's how we improve.

517
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:30,710
This is how you improve upon policy and regulations when something like this happens.

518
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,273
And to just brush it under the rug and then come up with a meeting.

519
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,035
You know, I've been calling for two years.

520
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:41,359
for a public safety summit, Mr. President, in this community.

521
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,080
And it's not just on the city side, it's in general.

522
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:51,682
It's to bring the police department, the fire chief in, the mayor, the council, and anyone else that wants to be part of it, Mr. President.

523
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:56,664
And for two years, I just called for another one recently, that this council voted unanimously.

524
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:01,085
We have got no response at all regarding a public safety summit.

525
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:06,593
It's almost like people in this community don't want to discuss what's happening in the community.

526
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:15,575
They don't want to discuss the robberies that are happening in our local drug stores almost daily, the bank robberies, an incident like this at the high school.

527
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,696
And the list goes on and on and on, drug activity on our streets.

528
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:29,678
And we've been asking, Mr. President, to get together, like any good community would, and discuss some of our shortfalls and maybe why we're seeing an increase

529
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:35,313
in this particular activity in our community, and what we can do better to provide security.

530
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:40,795
You know, so I'm glad that this was discussed tonight.

531
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,136
We're not talking out of school now.

532
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:49,539
We're not letting any secrets out about safety at the high school, you know, ways someone could breach the high school.

533
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:57,062
We're saying that we believe there's a concern, and the concern has to be addressed in a much quicker fashion, so speculation

534
00:39:57,452 --> 00:40:02,373
doesn't get out there, and people start thinking, oh, my God, what's happening?

535
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:09,314
So we hired a $90,000 PR person.

536
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:09,314
$90,000.

537
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,675
I didn't see one communication from that PR person.

538
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:15,276
Not one communication.

539
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:21,917
If you can't address an issue of this nature, what are they addressing?

540
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:25,858
Honestly, I don't know what's going on, Mr. President.

541
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:31,775
This is a concern that parents should be upset about.

542
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,137
And maybe this is not the best forum, but guess what?

543
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:35,557
We're an open forum.

544
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:38,039
People can come up to the podium and speak.

545
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:45,182
And the day we start censoring what can be said at that podium, you might as well close the light and lock the door here at City Hall, Mr. President.

546
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:52,726
I just want to thank Councilor Longo for bringing this important issue up.

547
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:57,083
Point of information, Councilor Scarpello.

548
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:07,551
Just to clarify, I believe that this council, not to censor anybody, but the idea of systematically going through and understanding.

549
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:22,502
Now tomorrow evening, I'll be there and I will ask those questions about communication and the protocol that my fellow councilmen and myself helped write and understand why that wasn't done.

550
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:24,463
And then bring that forward

551
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:25,628
in the following week.

552
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:31,711
But what I think that at least this council's — this council's questioned issues are — Point of information, Mr. President.

553
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,572
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

554
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:35,754
I'm coming to the — I'm sorry.

555
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:36,234
There you are.

556
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,856
Counselor Scott Pillow just mentioned that the protocol wasn't done.

557
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:40,597
How do you know — No, I'm sorry.

558
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:41,998
I misspoke then.

559
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,400
Understanding if the protocol wasn't followed through, we'll know tomorrow when we ask that.

560
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,282
But why does it take eight days to figure that out?

561
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:49,542
Well, that's what I'll ask tomorrow.

562
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:51,784
Thank you.

563
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:53,545
You've both made your points of information.

564
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:56,038
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

565
00:41:56,398 --> 00:41:56,938
Thank you.

566
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:59,960
And this is the point I guess I was getting at before.

567
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:13,565
I feel like we're speculating as to what happened and when, and I'm not trying to censor anyone, but what I'm trying to say is I think it's best that we have the decision makers present so they can, so they can be asked the questions by the people.

568
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:18,328
People have questions, but there's no one here at this meeting that can answer any of the questions.

569
00:42:18,908 --> 00:42:19,748
That's what I'm saying.

570
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:23,810
There's, I mean, to me, I understand the concerns about communication,

571
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,599
I'm completely on board with that.

572
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:32,141
But there is no one here tonight that can answer any questions with regard to what happened, when, and what they did, and why.

573
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:35,742
And those are the key questions that need to be answered tomorrow night.

574
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:39,884
Once again, Medford High School, 7 PM, the library at Medford High School.

575
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:45,005
And I believe all the questions will be answered and everyone that should attend.

576
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:46,666
Thank you.

577
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,327
The chair recognizes the citizen.

578
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:54,317
At the podium, please state your name and address for the record.

579
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:54,698
Welcome.

580
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:55,839
Thank you, City Council.

581
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,302
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

582
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:00,863
I'm going to defend Medford a little.

583
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:08,511
My first night at WinCam, Winchester Community Access TV, they asked me to videotape the basketball, which I obliged.

584
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:09,792
I love helping out.

585
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:15,737
No one knew who I was except for the TV station, and I'm an older person myself.

586
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,782
Anyone could have walked into that high school as well.

587
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:24,905
I was the videographer, as you may know, for Winthrop, for the football, for the hockey.

588
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:27,387
Again, I'm watching that anyone could have entered.

589
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:31,610
So this is a problem across the Commonwealth, maybe across the country.

590
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,953
With all these shootings, with crackpots everywhere, our safety is at risk.

591
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:38,255
Now, this is a great forum for this.

592
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,136
So I thank Councilor Lungo Kern.

593
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:41,597
I thank Michael Marks.

594
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:51,130
You make this is the people's forum, and we have a really good city solicitor here who has said in the past he would find censorship repugnant.

595
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:57,492
So many times this microphone shuts off on us for this reason or that reason, but it's not fair because this is a public forum.

596
00:43:57,912 --> 00:44:01,773
The first individual and the woman who came up here, very, very good points.

597
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:10,155
I take issue with the second individual who works for the Disability Commission, who has said to me personally, they want to have

598
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:14,609
openness, they want to be able to speak freely.

599
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:18,712
But then that individual is up here tonight saying, we shouldn't be talking about this.

600
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:20,013
I don't get the hypocrisy.

601
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:25,057
We need to have an open forum here at the Medford City Council, especially with two new councilors.

602
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:26,278
It's a new year.

603
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,563
The bomb threat, I've heard all sorts of rumors that there was a bomb threat prior to the election.

604
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:36,487
We know that there were problems prior to the election with theft at the McGlynn School, yet

605
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:44,488
Somehow, it only got on the news station that had their investigative reporter emceeing the great debate.

606
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:46,209
It only got on after the election.

607
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:53,195
We know that one of the city council was in the Boston Globe, Front Page, one of the new city councils that was a school committee person.

608
00:44:53,515 --> 00:45:11,729
There's this lack of transparency in Medford that the rest of the world gets to read about, but the voters don't even know there's something on the back of a ballot because, gee, I got an email because of Barry Clemente's new 9-1-1 call saying that there's going to be an election.

609
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:21,396
But there was nothing about question one on the ConnectCTY reverse 9-1-1 system before a very important election, a historic election.

610
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:22,797
This is the People's Forum.

611
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:34,946
This issue has to be brought to the attention of the public because as the city solicitor can confirm, I've been asking about this in public records requests for months now, months now.

612
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:40,150
So it's insane to have no one discussing this at the People's Forum.

613
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:40,910
Thank you.

614
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:45,114
Thank you.

615
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:47,055
Good evening.

616
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:47,991
Welcome.

617
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:49,171
Please state your name and address.

618
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:50,111
My name is Robert Pantor.

619
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:51,312
I live at Zero Summit, Rome.

620
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:54,732
I'm a member of the Sarkis party that's deliberating here tonight.

621
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:59,053
On the outside, I'd like to thank my colleague, um, strike that council Longo Kern.

622
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:05,374
I would consider a colleague forever because I think she's doing what she's supposed to be doing and that's the people's work.

623
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:10,735
You know, you folks are sitting here as counselors like I did for, for many years.

624
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:13,316
Your most important job is to protect,

625
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:17,975
to protect the students, the children of this community, because that's what our budget's all about.

626
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:20,196
That's what our school department budget's all about.

627
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,117
And that's what public safety is all about.

628
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:26,018
Sure, there's adults and there's businesses to be concerned about, but it's the children.

629
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:29,060
That's what we're trying to do here is educate our children.

630
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,761
And how do we educate our children?

631
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:33,182
By teaching the difference between what is right and what is wrong.

632
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:40,705
And as they grow up to be youngsters and teenagers and adults, that's supposed to transcend into their everyday working operation.

633
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:44,773
We've just had three incidences take place here in this community.

634
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:49,696
One that took place in November, where there was a bomb threat, allegedly a bomb threat.

635
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:56,039
Medford police went to the high school, and their dog sniffing dogs were not allowed into the building.

636
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:58,140
That didn't even find a response.

637
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:11,027
Then you had the incident five days before the election this past November, where at the McGlynn School, somebody broke into the school, ransacked through, I believe, eight teachers' bags, and you didn't hear about that until five days later.

638
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:17,606
And now you have this incident that took place most recently, and as Councilor Moxley alluded to, eight days after the fact.

639
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:26,649
You have a responsibility because when you do that budget each and every year, you're being led to believe by the school department and the school committee that everything is going properly.

640
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:33,212
You have a superintendent of schools whose primary responsibility, over and beyond educating the kids first,

641
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:38,479
is the safety of those kids in every single building that they are in here in the city of Medford.

642
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:43,061
And that safety cannot be transcended by waiting days and days and days.

643
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:49,243
Now I understand what Councilor Falco was leading to, that tomorrow night there's a meeting, but there is a yes answer to this meeting tonight.

644
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:57,746
And the yes answer to this meeting is to let anybody who wants to talk about it come up, and the answer would be yes, allowing them to talk and speak about it.

645
00:47:57,986 --> 00:47:59,507
Because if they can't make it tomorrow night,

646
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:03,911
becomes informational for those who didn't know about it to be at the meeting tomorrow night.

647
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:12,237
But more importantly, it's the public safety that really has not been addressed by the at-present school administration.

648
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:19,723
And if you said, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Palacio, the two of you put together some kind of a program and the protocol hasn't been met,

649
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:20,858
then so be it.

650
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:24,961
Then somebody has to be held accountable and maybe their job should be put on the line.

651
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:36,290
Because if it was their kid and their child was threatened with a bomb in the school and they weren't told about it until six or seven hours after the fact on a robocall, that doesn't satisfy or suffice the purpose.

652
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:42,495
On January 18th, you had Groton, Ayers, Arlington, Tewksbury, Taunton,

653
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:48,193
Salisbury, Weymouth, Newton, Brighton, Boston, Swampscott, Lexington Minuteman.

654
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,074
A bomb threat was over there.

655
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:52,135
Two things took place over there.

656
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,836
They either evacuated the building or there was a lockdown.

657
00:48:55,476 --> 00:48:56,857
What's the difference between the two?

658
00:48:57,197 --> 00:48:58,117
Needs to be explained.

659
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:02,739
Does a lockdown complete the service of saying that the school is safe or not?

660
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,319
I don't know.

661
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:12,043
But this forum, this is the only forum that you have this opportunity to let the people come and have their opportunity to speak.

662
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:13,718
about what is happening.

663
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:18,942
Now we talk about transparency and the public relations person.

664
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:21,043
Where has all that been going?

665
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:23,585
Where's the public relations coming out on this?

666
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:34,032
And if it truly has been eight days after the fact, why are you having a meeting eight days after the fact if in fact the consultation took place between the school administration

667
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:41,477
the state police, and the area surrounding police departments to find out the protocol, whether it's high level, low level, or no level.

668
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:43,658
Who are they to make that decision?

669
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:57,443
The school committee, the school department should have some type of an ember alert that addresses itself, like they do when they come out to mass, when a child disappears, or a senior citizen is missing, or a person in general is missing, for whatever the reasons might be.

670
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,023
You know, we're living in a day and age today that is not the same as 1950, 60, 70.

671
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:05,149
It's not even the same as it was five years ago.

672
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:07,451
We're living in a world that's talentious.

673
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:09,033
It's crazy with people.

674
00:50:09,454 --> 00:50:14,981
And it has a deep concern that everyone's child that goes to a school should be considered to be safe.

675
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:16,482
and in a safe place.

676
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:22,984
But when you're talking about something like this tonight, it's not in a safe place because the protocols weren't met.

677
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,505
And if the protocols aren't being met, then there is something wrong.

678
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:27,966
There's a breakdown in the system.

679
00:50:28,346 --> 00:50:30,427
That's why we're paying a superintendent in excess of $160,000.

680
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:34,929
You have two assistant superintendents, well in excess of $120,000.

681
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:42,792
They have a responsibility to this community, whether it's your kids, my kids, grandchildren, or someone else's children.

682
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:52,514
And that's to ensure that when they go to that school, barring any unforeseen circumstance, and if something were to happen, the parent should be advised ASAP.

683
00:50:53,074 --> 00:50:58,935
I wouldn't want a superintendent or a teacher to say whether they make the decision whether my child should be there or not.

684
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:00,456
It's kind of like interesting.

685
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:10,698
If you follow the whole idea about testing and MCAS and everything else and Common Core and draw the correlation to it, if the child or the parent doesn't want the kid to take it, they can opt out.

686
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:18,972
magnify that to a bomb threat in a building and not tell the parent for eight hours after the fact.

687
00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:20,753
There is no correlation.

688
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:23,034
There is no justice to this whole thing.

689
00:51:23,475 --> 00:51:33,039
And whatever comes out of this meeting tomorrow night, I hope it just proves one thing that those who were responsible, who didn't do their job are charged for not doing their job.

690
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:33,740
They're replaced.

691
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,842
And we have a system in place that you don't have to have this type of a conversation.

692
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:47,469
I applaud you, Councilor Longo, for bringing this forward because this gets to the very heart of the citizens of Medford, its children, its core, its future for tomorrow.

693
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,150
Thank you.

694
00:51:52,994 --> 00:51:57,858
On the motion of Councilor Knight that the paper be received and placed on file, Vice President Longo-Kern.

695
00:51:57,998 --> 00:51:58,358
Thank you.

696
00:51:58,398 --> 00:52:00,139
I'd ask that the paper be voted on.

697
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,364
I think it's something that can be discussed tomorrow night.

698
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:07,045
I'm making a recommendation.

699
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:13,454
It truly, and I feel bad, a lot of counselors, a couple counselors are upset that it's been even brought up.

700
00:52:13,974 --> 00:52:19,478
But at the same time, it truly is coming from the fact that the complaints are real.

701
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,201
They're coming from parents who wish they knew and wish they knew sooner.

702
00:52:24,882 --> 00:52:29,945
And I try to always put myself in somebody's shoes when I get a complaint, and this time I actually can.

703
00:52:30,546 --> 00:52:36,690
And I would be irate if there was a bomb threat at my child's school and I didn't know about it immediately.

704
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:37,832
I'd be irate.

705
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,012
So I understand where they're coming from.

706
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:46,334
And I think parents should be notified, even if the first words that come out of a robocall are, there is no threat.

707
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:51,034
But parents have that right, and they should have that right.

708
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:56,375
And I'm making that recommendation to the higher-ups, which would be the school committee on this situation.

709
00:52:57,115 --> 00:52:58,156
And I agree with Ms.

710
00:52:58,176 --> 00:52:58,716
Rodriguez.

711
00:52:58,996 --> 00:53:00,996
There's just a lack of communication.

712
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:02,516
And we do need some uniformity.

713
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:05,717
I know some schools do it right, and others don't.

714
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:12,212
things that need to be improved upon and stepped up, and obviously security is one of them.

715
00:53:12,312 --> 00:53:23,201
So I'd ask that the resolution be voted upon tonight, just making a recommendation to the school committee, superintendent, that if anything like this happens again, that parents are notified.

716
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:25,343
There's a motion already on the floor.

717
00:53:25,684 --> 00:53:26,304
Councillor Knight.

718
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:32,850
Mr. President, until I go to that meeting tomorrow night and find out exactly what happened and where the failings were and where the system failed,

719
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:38,375
the students and the residents of the city, I don't feel comfortable making any recommendation as to a course of action.

720
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:40,776
Therefore, I'm not going to be withdrawing my motion.

721
00:53:42,756 --> 00:53:45,317
Well, we have two contravening motions here.

722
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:46,618
So the first motion is before us.

723
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:51,379
I'd be happy to withdraw my motion if the council would be willing to table the matter until the meeting can take place tomorrow.

724
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:53,840
Does the council wish to table the matter?

725
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:02,203
No, I'm actually making a recommendation that hopefully the school committee will get by tomorrow night that, you know, something should, protocols should be in place so

726
00:54:02,512 --> 00:54:07,873
There's better communication with parents, especially on such a serious event as a bomb threat.

727
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:17,055
There should be better protocols, or other things need to be discussed on how parents can get notified without an issue.

728
00:54:18,436 --> 00:54:21,436
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco on the motion of Councilor Knight.

729
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,137
Thank you, Mr. President.

730
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:27,037
I would like to hear from the school committee first.

731
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:29,398
I hear from the residents, and I think

732
00:54:30,253 --> 00:54:32,954
it's great that they came and they, they, they spoke up on the issue.

733
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:37,255
And, uh, but at this point, I'd like to make, like to make a motion to table.

734
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:44,317
I think we need to hear from the school committee and what they hear about what went wrong and what we need, what needs to be done to improve the situation.

735
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:46,778
What would, what did we need to hear from law enforcement?

736
00:54:46,818 --> 00:54:47,998
We need to hear from the superintendent.

737
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:51,699
Like I said, we need to hear from the decision makers before we make a decision here.

738
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,360
So I'd like to make a motion to table.

739
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:59,488
The motion before us is to receive the paper and place it on file.

740
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:00,929
On that motion.

741
00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:02,250
No, motion to table.

742
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,451
Motion to proceed.

743
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:07,154
Does the motion so proceed and cancel the two out?

744
00:55:07,214 --> 00:55:10,236
Motion to table is undebatable.

745
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:11,617
Roll call.

746
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:12,618
Motion to table.

747
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:13,859
Motion to table.

748
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:15,059
All those in favor.

749
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,140
Roll call, please.

750
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,443
Roll call has been requested on the motion to table.

751
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,024
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

752
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:23,762
Yes.

753
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:23,842
Yes.

754
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:23,902
No.

755
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:24,022
No.

756
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:24,262
Yes.

757
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:26,064
What's that for?

758
00:55:26,144 --> 00:55:26,444
Yes.

759
00:55:26,464 --> 00:55:30,407
With the vote of three.

760
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:59,713
In the affirmative, four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion is tabled.

761
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:19,988
16-064 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that a complete assessment on the condition of city street signs be completed with recommendations for replacement where necessary.

762
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,509
Councilor Marks, thank you.

763
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,741
Thank you, Mr. President.

764
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:30,487
Many of our street signs are fading away and not legible.

765
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:37,572
And that includes stop signs and traffic signs, as well as street signs.

766
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:44,418
And I would ask that a complete audit be done of all our signage with recommendations.

767
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:50,643
I had a brief conversation with Mayor Burke recently, and she mentioned to me that she directed

768
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:59,001
uh, acting DPW commissioner, Brian Karen's, uh, to look into, uh, the assessment of all street signs.

769
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,463
So I guess that is ongoing right now.

770
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:10,271
Uh, but I would still ask through a formal request of this council that, uh, there'd be a complete audit and a replacement of signage.

771
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:14,714
Uh, what I did not put on this, Mr. President is sometime back.

772
00:57:14,815 --> 00:57:18,658
I offered a resolution to have the markers on hydrants.

773
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:25,040
And I know the city purchased a number of markers, but it fell short of the number of hydrants in the community.

774
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:27,602
So I ask also that- Excuse me, Councillor.

775
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:31,005
Please continue, Councillor.

776
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:32,105
Thank you, Mr. President.

777
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:41,152
And I ask also that the hydrant markers be part of this request, whereas public safety is of utmost importance in this community.

778
00:57:41,572 --> 00:57:42,393
Thank you, Mr. President.

779
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:45,695
Councillor, thank you for that good motion.

780
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:47,617
Councillor Kerrio.

781
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,520
Oh, thank you, Mr. President.

782
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:02,024
On this motion, I'd like to see, along with the assessment, I think some areas are over signed with this confusion.

783
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:05,586
So I think that aspect needs to be looked at too.

784
00:58:06,306 --> 00:58:08,187
So maybe we can consolidate some signs.

785
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:21,730
So the people have a little better understanding of what the signs mean, rather than seeing half a dozen signs, especially in the parking areas, where there's 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and people just don't know what the sign means, or any of the signs.

786
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:28,934
And there's certain streets that have several signs on them, Mr. President, that are unnecessary.

787
00:58:30,595 --> 00:58:32,216
As amended by Councilor Caviello.

788
00:58:32,297 --> 00:58:32,937
Councilor Knight.

789
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:36,239
Mr. President, this is a great resolution, a great resolve, Councilor Moxley.

790
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,480
I commend you for bringing it forward.

791
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,282
It deals with public safety, it deals with infrastructure, they're vital keys to a strong quality of life here in Medford.

792
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:46,745
I support the resolution wholeheartedly, Mr. President, that I move for approval.

793
00:58:47,706 --> 00:58:50,929
On the motion for approval, all those in favor, as amended?

794
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:52,290
All those opposed?

795
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,230

On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Curran to take papers under suspension and in the hand of the clerk.

829
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:37,116
All those in favor?

830
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:37,216
Aye.

831
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:38,458
All those opposed?

832
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:39,619
Motion carries.

833
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:50,671
16-066 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the Public Works Subcommittee investigate staffing levels in RDPW, Councilor Knight.

834
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:56,335
Mr. President, thank you very much and I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to bring this resolution forward under suspension.

835
01:01:57,035 --> 01:02:00,858
I filed this resolution in an effort to further investigate the staffing levels at RDPW.

836
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:08,679
As we go through our agenda week by week, many of the items that are on the agenda are actually related to basic city maintenance and city service issues.

837
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:19,521
With that being said, I think it's important and imperative for this council to take a look at the staffing levels at the DPW to ensure that there's enough help to ensure that they have safe staffing levels so that we can have safe streets and strong infrastructure.

838
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:28,563
Mr. President, I think part and parcel with a strong DPW will be strong downtowns because we'll have clean streets, we'll have repaired sidewalks, we'll have repaired potholes.

839
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,871
which will be something that's going to bring people to our squares.

840
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:36,112
We'll also have better lightage, because when lights go out, we'll have more people there that can help fix the lights.

841
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:42,535
So I bring this resolution forward, Mr. President, to continue to look at and examine the staffing levels in our DPW.

842
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:48,977
Presently, I believe there are 46 members in our DPW unit, and we are a community of about eight square miles.

843
01:02:49,257 --> 01:02:55,979
If we go right next door to Somerville, we have a community that's four square miles who have 65 members just in their highway division alone, Mr. President.

844
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,800
So I think that this warrants a long, hard look.

845
01:02:58,215 --> 01:03:00,196
I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this endeavor.

846
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:02,538
The motion approved by Councilor Knight.

847
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,199
Councilor Marks.

848
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:05,140
Thank you, Mr. President.

849
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,562
And I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

850
01:03:07,602 --> 01:03:17,489
This is a very wise and prudent resolution, in particular because of the implementation of the 3-1-1 system that's going to happen next month.

851
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:26,035
This council has been on record asking that additional staffing levels, in particular the DPW, to address

852
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:31,839
uh, some of the, uh, three one one complaints that are going to start filtering through electronically.

853
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:36,481
And, uh, I think this is a wise resolution and I support it wholeheartedly.

854
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:36,981
Mr. President.

855
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:37,801
Thank you.

856
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:38,522
Councilor Marks.

857
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:39,902
Councilor Caravaglia.

858
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:40,803
Thank you, Mr. President.

859
01:03:40,843 --> 01:03:47,885
Again, I thank council for bringing this, you know, in our earlier meeting, I think this was a discussion that we're all pretty much agreement on that.

860
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:52,167
Um, the DPW needs, uh, some more people to do the work of the city.

861
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,928
Um, you know, um, it's, it's, it's,

862
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,845
it's hugely understaffed compared to other cities.

863
01:03:57,885 --> 01:04:06,587
So I would hope that our subcommittee could make a recommendation to hire more people.

864
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:08,627
Very good.

865
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:11,008
On that motion, Councilor Scarpelli.

866
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:20,070
If I can, if I can add to that, I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this forward.

867
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:37,957
As we talk to DPW employees, one of the other issues that came about is not only the staffing level, but also their equipment and what their needs and what we have for aging equipment.

868
01:04:38,038 --> 01:04:47,963
And if we can add to that, get a list of any equipment or inventory that they might have needed to ask for in the past,

869
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:50,527
We should be looking forward as it comes to budget time.

870
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:51,268
Thank you.

871
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:25,464
minimal, I'm knocking on wood here, but minimal complaints, um, these last two storms and just want to thank them for their hard work through the nights.

872
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:29,626
Thank you on the motion.

873
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:30,447
All those in favor.

874
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:31,828
All those opposed.

875
01:05:31,868 --> 01:05:35,510
The motion carries 16 dash 0 6 7 off by council night.

876
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,590
Be resolved.

877
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,633
The director of veteran services provide the council with the number of veterans living in the city of Medford.

878
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:46,956
We have received the welcome home bonus broken down annually from 2001

879
01:05:48,463 --> 01:05:48,683
through 2015.

880
01:05:48,963 --> 01:05:51,044
Counselor Knight.

881
01:05:51,224 --> 01:05:52,585
Mr. President, thank you very much.

882
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:57,768
The welcome home bonus is a bonus that's given to veterans who are coming home from service, Mr. President.

883
01:05:57,908 --> 01:06:01,770
And if they reside in the city of Medford, they're entitled to a cash bonus by way of application.

884
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:08,293
But what this welcome home bonus does is it allows us the opportunity to begin to quantitate how many veterans actually reside in our city.

885
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:17,037
The date of 2001 was post 9-11 when the welcome home bonus was re-implemented and through 2015 will be the last fiscal year, Mr. President.

886
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:27,434
As I stated earlier in our subcommittee meeting, the city of Medford's about the 15th largest community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and our general population has somewhere between 7% and 9%.

887
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,981
of people that self-identify as veterans, Mr. President.

888
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:42,913
So I think it will be very helpful for us as we continue to ensure that our services delivered to our veterans are top of the line, that we see if there's been any growth there, if we can make an argument for more help in the office, Mr. President.

889
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,175
We have a 20-hour-a-week clerk working in that office.

890
01:06:46,216 --> 01:06:47,598
That was a zero-hour-a-week clerk.

891
01:06:48,115 --> 01:06:50,497
a couple years ago, and before that, it was a 40-hour position.

892
01:06:50,577 --> 01:06:57,402
So we've seen the office go down from a 40-hour-a-week clerk to a zero-hour-a-week clerk, and back up to a 20-hour-a-week clerk, Mr. President.

893
01:06:57,442 --> 01:07:03,606
I'd like to continue to advocate for more help in the Veterans Service Office, because I feel as though our veterans deserve no less.

894
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:06,728
With that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

895
01:07:07,229 --> 01:07:08,109
Thank you, Councilman.

896
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:08,830
Councilman Marks.

897
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,431
Thank you, Mr. President.

898
01:07:10,471 --> 01:07:14,814
This is a great resolve, and I'd be remiss not to mention the fact that

899
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:21,616
I believe it was two weeks ago, Councilor Caviello offered a resolution to create a veteran service advisory board.

900
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:29,119
And we just got notification from Mayor Burke that she is going to implement the veteran service advisory board.

901
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:44,005
And I think it touches upon what Councilor Knight just mentioned about providing services that might otherwise go unnoticed in having a board that oversees what veterans should be getting and if they're getting their fair share.

902
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:46,981
and to make sure they're responded to in a timely fashion.

903
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:54,747
So, I want to thank, on behalf of all the veterans in this community, thank Councilor Caviello for his resolve, Mr. President.

904
01:07:54,807 --> 01:07:57,709
And thank Mayor Burke for her quick action also.

905
01:07:58,329 --> 01:07:58,770
Thank you.

906
01:07:59,370 --> 01:07:59,951
Thank you all.

907
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:00,991
Councilor Caviello.

908
01:08:01,092 --> 01:08:01,772
Thank you, Mr. President.

909
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:06,416
Again, I want to thank — I did this to thank the veterans of our community.

910
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:09,338
And I thank the mayor for acting quickly on this.

911
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,100
And hopefully, this will bring in some of the younger veterans

912
01:08:12,623 --> 01:08:14,944
who've come back from since post 9-1-1.

913
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:23,368
And because the World War II guys are sort of getting thin, and the Korean guys are getting thin.

914
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:26,530
And even I'm a Vietnam era person.

915
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:27,910
We're starting to get old.

916
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:33,593
And then there was that gap in between Vietnam and the Middle East crisis.

917
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:39,996
So it'll be good to bring some of these younger people in and help out the newer veterans coming into the city.

918
01:08:40,925 --> 01:08:45,607
And also give help to Mr. Lindsey, whose office is understaffed.

919
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:46,847
Very good.

920
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:48,567
Vice President Longo-Curran.

921
01:08:48,747 --> 01:08:56,370
I just too want to thank Councilor Carviello for putting forward the Veterans Advisory Committee, and thank the mayor for such a quick turnaround.

922
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:03,192
I think that was two or three weeks that we now have, are going to implement an advisory committee, and I think it's great.

923
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:10,254
I know there's a number of veterans who are interested in serving on that committee, and it's only going to improve the quality of veteran services.

924
01:09:10,944 --> 01:09:14,605
in the city of Medford, so thank Councilor Caviello and thank the mayor for doing it so quickly.

925
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:17,145
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

926
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:18,425
All those opposed?

927
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:19,566
Motion carries.

928
01:09:21,946 --> 01:09:34,428
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved, I'm gonna need your help on this, be it resolved that the tree located on Princeton Street, roughly 10 feet from the corner of Princeton and Dartmouth.

929
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:38,869
Oh, I didn't finish it off.

930
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,697
That's, I was going to offer the second half next week.

931
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:48,078
Thank you very much.

932
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,242
That tree be removed, Mr. President, I apologize.

933
01:09:53,382 --> 01:09:55,223
That the tree be removed, Councilor Marks.

934
01:09:55,323 --> 01:09:56,544
In the interest of public safety.

935
01:09:57,064 --> 01:10:08,153
This tree, Mr. President, is in poor condition and although it may produce leaves during the summertime, it really is hollowed out and needs removal and I'd ask that the

936
01:10:09,392 --> 01:10:17,876
Tree Warden, Aggie Tudor, who does a tremendous job, go out immediately in the interest of public safety, especially with the snow and the wet, heavy snow, Mr. President.

937
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:18,477
Very good.

938
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:20,158
So on that motion, all those in favor?

939
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:21,478
All those opposed?

940
01:10:21,578 --> 01:10:22,279
Motion carries.

941
01:10:22,839 --> 01:10:34,965
Finally, offered by President Del Russo, whereas the federal and state election will be held on Tuesday, March 1st, and Tuesday, November 8th, 2016, be resolved at the council meetings of March

942
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,780
1st and November 8th, 2016, be canceled.

943
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:52,889
Be it further resolved that the summer calendar be Tuesday, July 19th, Tuesday, August 16th, Tuesday, September 20th, and Tuesday, September 20th, 27th.

944
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:54,370
Yes, I'll try it better this time.

945
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,030
Tuesday, July 19th,

946
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:13,593
August 16th, Tuesday, Tuesday, September 20th, and Tuesday, September 27th.

947
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:19,076
These are the consistence of past practice over the past several years.

948
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:21,438
The clerk has made this recommendation.

949
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:27,081
So on the motion for approval by Vice President Longo-Kern, all those in favor?

950
01:11:28,262 --> 01:11:29,063
All those opposed?

951
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,844
Motion carries.

952
01:11:32,965 --> 01:11:33,686
Records.

953
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:35,643
of the meeting.

954
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:37,484
Who's calling?

955
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:38,945
Councilor Falco.

956
01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:43,869
I actually have an adjustment to the records.

957
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:44,790
Okay.

958
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,011
We're going to call for the records.

959
01:11:46,392 --> 01:11:52,237
The records of the February 2nd, 2016 meeting were passed to Vice President Mungo Kern.

960
01:11:53,618 --> 01:11:55,679
How do you find those records, Madam Vice President?

961
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,385
Obviously, I think we might have a correction there, so I review the records.

962
01:12:02,425 --> 01:12:03,086
I find them in order.

963
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:08,715
All right, we have a request for amendation to those records, Councilor Falco.

964
01:12:09,176 --> 01:12:09,576
Thank you.

965
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:23,143
Under 16-053, it was an amendment that was made to include the minutes from each of the board and commission meetings on the website after, at the conclusion of the meetings.

966
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:24,363
Very good.

967
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:31,947
So Councilor Lungo, you make that, recognize that request for correction.

968
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,368
and otherwise recommend the approval of the minutes as amended.

969
01:12:37,928 --> 01:12:38,849
All those in favor?

970
01:12:39,749 --> 01:12:39,809
Aye.

971
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,150
All those opposed?

972
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:42,330
Announcement?

973
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:44,932
An announcement by Councilor Longo-Kern.

974
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:46,232
The records are accepted.

975
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:46,532
Yes.

976
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:47,753
Madam Vice President.

977
01:12:47,813 --> 01:12:55,917
Just want to announce that on Saturday, February 13th, which is this coming Saturday, the Medford Family Network is holding their annual fundraiser.

978
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:57,938
It's an ice cream social for families.

979
01:12:58,058 --> 01:13:01,420
I think we've all been invited as counselors to scoop ice cream for

980
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:04,043
a couple hours from 1 to 3 p.m.

981
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:05,743
That's at the McGlynn Middle School.

982
01:13:05,804 --> 01:13:06,824
It's always a great time.

983
01:13:06,844 --> 01:13:10,285
They have arts and crafts and dancing for the kids, and they put on a show.

984
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:13,687
I think it's $5 per person, $15 for a family.

985
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:19,429
Just urge and encourage everybody to attend the wonderful event for a great cause.

986
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:21,030
I scream, you scream.

987
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,951
On motion for adjournment?

988
01:13:25,971 --> 01:13:26,732
Do we have a citizen?

989
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:27,472
Sorry.

990
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:34,601
Yeah, did you want to speak, Valerie?

991
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:35,081
Sorry.

992
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:41,688
Good evening.

993
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:45,772
Please state your name and address for the record and the topic of your presentation.

994
01:13:45,932 --> 01:13:48,675
Yes, Valerie Washburn Geiselman, Medford, Massachusetts.

995
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,771
Okay, I'm here to give us an update.

996
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:56,151
Let's see, I have 10 minutes?

997
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:57,151
I have 10 minutes?

998
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,052
You have 10 minutes.

999
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:00,652
Okay, I don't have a watch with me to time myself.

1000
01:14:02,753 --> 01:14:04,673
I'm sorry, I was late tonight.

1001
01:14:04,893 --> 01:14:07,554
My ride wasn't able to make it, so I came by bus.

1002
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:12,235
I want to give an update on our death care.

1003
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:22,868
our concern for cemetery issues, our Cemetery Oak Grove, which borders our beloved Brooks Estate.

1004
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:37,620
This afternoon, I was told about a meeting that the seven churches clergy had at the sanctuary building in West Medford.

1005
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:42,204
Clergy from seven churches, including two from Temple, Shalom,

1006
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:58,089
made a resolve to promote the acceptance of green and natural burials and to create an advisory board to help their parishioners and the cemetery trustees and the manager to resolve disagreements and help with conflict negotiations.

1007
01:14:58,889 --> 01:15:01,590
Also, my understanding is that they very much want other

1008
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:17,582
uh, other groups and, um, other interested citizens to participate such as the conservation energy groups and, um, our new committee on, um, conservation and anybody who'd be interested.

1009
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:24,687
And of course, the funeral directors in our town and, um, other towns that serve our citizens.

1010
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:31,611
Uh, some citizens suggest that we also invite various departments from self test university.

1011
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,056
which is also partially located in Medford.

1012
01:15:35,537 --> 01:15:55,273
There are several departments that would help qualify, engineering departments and some of the science departments and even some of the psychology departments that have actually given talks on the benefits to people who participate in natural burials.

1013
01:15:56,614 --> 01:16:01,538
And I actually have a relative who studied at Tufts and he now does

1014
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:04,003
um, groundwater testing.

1015
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:07,955
And, um, that might also be a concern.

1016
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:19,628
I wanted to discuss briefly a meeting that I attended last week, the Cemetery Monthly Meeting, which was held over here in Room 201.

1017
01:16:20,068 --> 01:16:22,170
There were several other citizens there.

1018
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:32,778
And we listened for two hours to a discussion, which was already preplanned, with civil engineers discussing the

1019
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:54,015
the possibility and the perhaps need for something called a mausoleum in which people would be buried above ground and they would be buried in caskets and or niches or it could be both and the niches would be for cremation.

1020
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:02,691
This is something they are looking to for the future, as they expect in 10, 20, 30, or 40 years.

1021
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,632
They may run out of land.

1022
01:17:07,412 --> 01:17:10,913
And we all realize, of course, that this is a possibility.

1023
01:17:11,433 --> 01:17:20,115
However, we also feel that we need to deal with the issues at hand and the citizens' needs at hand.

1024
01:17:21,255 --> 01:17:26,176
And so although you have to always plan for the future, there's still a lot of land

1025
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:28,549
in Oak Grove to be used.

1026
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:41,244
And there are some citizens that really want the discussion of natural burials to go forward, and we will do that through the clergy and other interested groups that would like to participate.

1027
01:17:43,039 --> 01:18:11,501
I wanted to say at that meeting, we listened for over an hour to this discussion with the civil engineers, and some of the proposals suggested that there are various types of buildings that could be constructed, depending on the need and how they wanted to start the process, and the projected amount of money was going to be $1 million to $2 million, depending on the kind of buildings and

1028
01:18:12,643 --> 01:18:24,291
whatever various types of construction they wanted to do, including building a new office building, a garage, and other things that can be included in a mausoleum.

1029
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:39,903
At the end of that meeting, several of the people interested in green burials were on the agenda, and we were told rather abruptly as the other meeting ended that the meeting had been adjourned.

1030
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:44,340
And we made our point that we had already signed up to be on the agenda.

1031
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:50,782
And so one person spoke and asked questions about a certain type of green burial.

1032
01:18:51,462 --> 01:18:53,703
And there were three trustees.

1033
01:18:54,503 --> 01:19:03,927
And one of them had not been at the previous meeting, so she seemed really confused and was asking the person, the other trustee beside her, questions.

1034
01:19:03,987 --> 01:19:05,227
I don't know what she was asking.

1035
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:06,387
And then the other trustee,

1036
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:24,736
asked us questions and said that we needed to find if this was legally possible and if there were any diseases that could be transmitted in this kind of burial, which we had actually gone over the previous month.

1037
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:34,625
And also our attorney, Mark Rumley, had clarified that under Mass General Laws, there's absolutely no reason to prohibit natural burials.

1038
01:19:35,024 --> 01:19:39,326
And of course, that wouldn't mean, of course, that there's no worry about disease.

1039
01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:45,410
And he just confirmed that with me out in the hallway as we just spoke, as he was leaving, that that is absolutely true.

1040
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,211
This seems to be an issue that's brought up over and over again.

1041
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:57,517
And anybody who reads enough information on it, and you don't have to read much to understand, that that is not a concern.

1042
01:19:57,677 --> 01:20:01,098
And obviously, Mass General Laws would not allow it if it was a concern.

1043
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:10,653
uh, as I said, um, it was rather distressing to be told that, um, the meeting was adjourned when we were on the agenda.

1044
01:20:11,233 --> 01:20:21,197
And then, um, I asked a few questions and, um, uh, I felt, uh, really, um, I can't quite think of the right word to say, but, um,

1045
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:26,013
I didn't feel that we were listened to very carefully.

1046
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:30,999
I didn't feel that people had done their research that they should have done from the previous month.

1047
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:33,202
They had months to look things over.

1048
01:20:33,222 --> 01:20:37,647
I didn't feel that we were dealt with politely.

1049
01:20:38,888 --> 01:20:40,190
That was very discouraging.

1050
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:46,692
I was trying to think of what I wanted to say about it.

1051
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:57,679
Anyway, there was just one person asking questions and it was not a very pleasant meeting with our cemetery committee.

1052
01:20:58,204 --> 01:21:07,310
And I understand there's even some people in this room right now that have had some difficulty with the cemetery and that there needs to be a way to resolve this.

1053
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:19,398
There was one case recently that wasn't settled with the way other people feel it should have been in a humanitarian and carefully analyzed situation.

1054
01:21:20,718 --> 01:21:27,983
And it seems that there's no appeal process, which is really hard to understand when it's this kind of a situation.

1055
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:29,561
I understand there's other things.

1056
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:31,382
I mean, you can even appeal a parking ticket.

1057
01:21:31,462 --> 01:21:34,623
So I just don't understand why there's no appeal process.

1058
01:21:34,643 --> 01:21:38,044
And obviously, you don't want to go back to the same trustees unless you have new information.

1059
01:21:38,684 --> 01:21:42,345
And if you have new information, you certainly should be able to appeal.

1060
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:49,667
And even if you don't have new information but have a good reason to want to challenge their decision, that should also be a possibility.

1061
01:21:50,568 --> 01:21:52,468
So those are some of our concerns.

1062
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:57,870
Basically, just being able to participate as a citizen who's respected.

1063
01:21:58,283 --> 01:22:02,025
for the things they're trying to bring to a committee.

1064
01:22:02,646 --> 01:22:06,108
And, you know, we'll all have to deal with this someday.

1065
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,729
We all have to bury our loved ones.

1066
01:22:07,929 --> 01:22:12,692
And it's going to be something that we need to be able to have a choice in.

1067
01:22:13,593 --> 01:22:25,220
And I think the cemetery committee needs to be able to be more compassionate and do their research before they start

1068
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:30,013
Um, you know, challenging and asking questions have already been answered many times.

1069
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:31,134
One minute left.

1070
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:31,954
Okay.

1071
01:22:32,134 --> 01:22:33,916
Um, all right.

1072
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:34,276
I'm sorry.

1073
01:22:34,296 --> 01:22:39,019
I don't feel terribly well prepared tonight, but, um, I guess I'll have to finish there.

1074
01:22:39,159 --> 01:22:39,500
Thank you.

1075
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:52,949
Counselor months, just so I can understand this issue a little bit of maybe if miss Washburn weren't mine, I just had a question.

1076
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:58,423
do you know what date this was first before the cemetery board?

1077
01:22:58,443 --> 01:23:01,505
Do you know when this was first presented?

1078
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:03,906
The last last meeting was the second meeting.

1079
01:23:03,926 --> 01:23:05,647
We discussed this situation.

1080
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:08,689
So when was the first, do you remember?

1081
01:23:08,949 --> 01:23:12,111
It was, well, the last, the last one was last Tuesday.

1082
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:15,853
So it was a month before the month before it's once a month.

1083
01:23:15,893 --> 01:23:17,754
They meet in room 201 is my understanding.

1084
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:20,636
So that would have been eight weeks ago.

1085
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:22,457
Now, now it would have been nine weeks ago.

1086
01:23:23,148 --> 01:23:24,249
So it was back in January?

1087
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:25,249
Yes.

1088
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:30,872
And at the time, it was what, postponed or laid on the table?

1089
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:33,754
What happened to the issue when it first got presented?

1090
01:23:35,054 --> 01:23:40,297
The issue with the family that was looking for the extra grade that we took.

1091
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:43,882
Oh, so the green burial wasn't on that nine weeks ago?

1092
01:23:44,522 --> 01:23:45,323
It was discussed.

1093
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:52,125
And there again, the issue of a disease was brought up and, um, you know, that they had to research it.

1094
01:23:52,185 --> 01:23:54,486
So for two months they had known about the issue of disease.

1095
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:54,866
Yes.

1096
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:59,688
They have known about that and that it's not an issue as according even to our attorney.

1097
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:01,049
Okay.

1098
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:08,852
Cause we all received in our packets like we do for most boards of commissions, a copy of, uh, their minutes.

1099
01:24:09,673 --> 01:24:12,134
And these are dated February 3rd.

1100
01:24:12,794 --> 01:24:23,919
And the last page states, after discussion between members of the Board of Trustees, it was unanimously agreed that green burials are somewhat new to cemeteries and will require much more research.

1101
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:31,062
And it says the policy of Oak Grove Cemetery is for casket burials to be interred in sealed cement liners.

1102
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:32,583
Therefore, Ms.

1103
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:35,704
Washburn's request has been denied.

1104
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:48,730
They denied it based on the fact that apparently they want to do more research and the fact that their policy states that it has to have a casket in turn with sealed cement liners.

1105
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,071
Did you ever offer any type of?

1106
01:24:53,532 --> 01:24:55,573
We brought up different alternatives, yes.

1107
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:59,935
And we brought them up again on Tuesday, the last Tuesday.

1108
01:25:00,415 --> 01:25:04,217
And there again, the one person who did speak, the trustee who did speak,

1109
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:16,479
brought up the issue again when we brought up alternatives to the cement burial vault, which is not a green burial, basically.

1110
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,903
There again brought up the question of disease.

1111
01:25:23,365 --> 01:25:25,246
Just so I understand, I know you've done a lot of research

1112
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,653
Mount Aubin Cemetery currently does green burials?

1113
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:29,273
Yes, they do.

1114
01:25:29,513 --> 01:25:29,833
They do.

1115
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:41,740
We actually brought a speaker to the first meeting that we had, which would have been now nine weeks ago, of the woman who's Candace Curry, who's head of their green burial.

1116
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,860
She's a horticulturist.

1117
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:45,061
And they have many meetings over there.

1118
01:25:45,121 --> 01:25:47,863
They have a waiting list when they have meetings.

1119
01:25:49,204 --> 01:25:53,766
They constantly have people coming to purchase an area for green burials.

1120
01:25:53,826 --> 01:25:54,967
They're a private cemetery.

1121
01:25:55,936 --> 01:26:02,881
And their — my understanding is their lowest-cost burial site is 8,000, and it goes up from there.

1122
01:26:02,921 --> 01:26:05,423
And I don't even know if there's any 8,000 available.

1123
01:26:05,924 --> 01:26:07,945
And they have various types of green burials.

1124
01:26:07,985 --> 01:26:12,989
But, yes, they do it without a burial vault — without a cement vault.

1125
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:13,450
Yes.

1126
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:17,773
The President So there are local cemeteries currently, right now, that can accommodate a green burial?

1127
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:17,833
Ms.

1128
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:18,814
Washburn Yes, there are.

1129
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:20,195
The President Okay.

1130
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:22,517
Mr. President, just if I could, because Ms.

1131
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,158
Washburn has done a lot of research

1132
01:26:25,123 --> 01:26:31,328
have attended the meetings along with Adele Trevisano, another well-respected resident of this community.

1133
01:26:31,868 --> 01:26:46,158
And I think it would be interesting maybe as a council if we can find out from the Board of Trustees, Cemetery Board of Trustees, how many requests have been made over the past year of the board for a green burial, if they keep any record of that.

1134
01:26:46,919 --> 01:26:51,522
And to urge them, I as one member of the council would urge that the board

1135
01:26:52,182 --> 01:26:57,506
do their research, do their due diligence, their homework on this issue, and not leave it open-ended.

1136
01:26:58,326 --> 01:27:09,714
Because I think at the very least, Valerie deserves an answer on this, as well as the other people that are concerned about green burials in the community, Mr. President.

1137
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:15,558
And I look forward to a response back from the Board of Trustees on this.

1138
01:27:16,378 --> 01:27:20,241
Mr. Clerk, often bound to suspension by Councilor Marks that the

1139
01:27:21,018 --> 01:27:27,882
Board of trustees of Oak Grove cemetery respond back to the city council by answering the following question.

1140
01:27:28,362 --> 01:27:34,045
How many requests for green burials has the cemetery received in the past year in the past year?

1141
01:27:34,325 --> 01:27:35,686
Could I just add something to that?

1142
01:27:35,746 --> 01:27:40,589
And also if they, if they could, um, do their due diligence in their research.

1143
01:27:41,109 --> 01:27:45,531
And at least because from what I read this, they didn't say we don't want green burials.

1144
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:48,333
They're saying that it requires more research.

1145
01:27:48,857 --> 01:27:53,938
And they're saying that their policy right now calls for a casket with a cement liner.

1146
01:27:54,658 --> 01:27:55,998
So they're not saying we're not going to do it.

1147
01:27:56,018 --> 01:27:59,419
They're just saying this is what our policy is, and we have to do more research.

1148
01:27:59,919 --> 01:28:11,961
So I would ask, through the council resolution, that they do their homework and due diligence, Mr. President, and on behalf of all the residents of this community, come out with a recommendation.

1149
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:12,721
Could I just add to that?

1150
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:15,642
Be it further resolved, as Council Member Matz just said, Mr. Clerk.

1151
01:28:16,802 --> 01:28:16,942
Ma'am.

1152
01:28:17,788 --> 01:28:18,928
Yes, I'd just like to add something.

1153
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:23,769
Actually, having a vault like that is not green burial.

1154
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:30,911
Some places have a vault that they turn the vault upside down so that the body is next to the earth.

1155
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:36,932
Because the whole purpose of the green burial is to have the body close to the earth with as little encumbrance as possible.

1156
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:39,673
But that was brought up at the last meeting.

1157
01:28:40,193 --> 01:28:41,814
And I don't recall any.

1158
01:28:42,294 --> 01:28:44,494
There again, the question of disease was brought up.

1159
01:28:44,614 --> 01:28:47,395
If the body was next to the earth, is it going to be spreading disease?

1160
01:28:48,075 --> 01:28:58,684
The other issue that I had was, it should be a separate area, because there could be people who don't want to be near people for whatever reason, who want a natural burial.

1161
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:08,411
And honestly, we would like to have a little section just for ourselves, or it could be the way Mount Auburn does it, which is in between other graves.

1162
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:11,459
That's another possibility.

1163
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:20,267
And we do have an old section that Mr. Brogan brought up when we had our representative from Mount Auburn Cemetery.

1164
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:26,279
when she said that they do green burials between other graves as one alternative.

1165
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:33,884
And he did mention something about the old area and whether or not that could be a possibility.

1166
01:29:34,565 --> 01:29:38,528
And I don't know where that thought process went from there.

1167
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:48,455
But that would be another possibility, such as the way they do it at Mount Auburn, to do it in between the older area of the cemetery.

1168
01:29:49,623 --> 01:29:56,225
And the whole concept of green burial is also that it's a more natural setting.

1169
01:29:57,045 --> 01:30:12,550
And psychologically for people that prefer that, and obviously going to the cemetery can be a big part of the grieving process, is that that would be a healing process for people that really appreciate that concept.

1170
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:17,031
Mr. President, I believe it was three weeks ago

1171
01:30:17,604 --> 01:30:24,868
that this council voted unanimously to send out three questions to the city solicitor.

1172
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:38,914
And one of the questions was, how do we go about setting up an advisory board, similar to what Councilor Caviello did with the Veterans Services, an advisory board to the Cemetery Board of Trustees.

1173
01:30:39,655 --> 01:30:46,158
And tonight, I bumped into the city solicitor in the hallway, and he mentioned to me that that could be done as a legislative

1174
01:30:46,765 --> 01:30:49,126
uh, prerogative, uh, through a city ordinance.

1175
01:30:49,606 --> 01:30:52,727
So that is the response I got back from at least one question.

1176
01:30:53,148 --> 01:31:01,291
So it would be up to this body, uh, if they felt fit to put a, create a city ordinance that would create a cemetery advisory board.

1177
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:02,971
So that may be another option.

1178
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,172
That'd be very much appreciated.

1179
01:31:05,312 --> 01:31:07,053
Thank you, Mr. President, vice president.

1180
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:09,562
Just move the question.

1181
01:31:09,602 --> 01:31:10,623
I'm sorry.

1182
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:11,483
Move the question.

1183
01:31:11,543 --> 01:31:12,444
Councilor Caviello.

1184
01:31:13,204 --> 01:31:14,305
Valerie, if I could ask you a question.

1185
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:17,206
You've obviously done, you know, a little more knowledgeable of this than I am.

1186
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:24,209
Um, you said that Mount Auburn, I understand Mount Auburn does this and they put them in with everything.

1187
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:26,310
They mix them in with other, other graves.

1188
01:31:26,771 --> 01:31:30,572
They do that and they do other, they do other things as well, but that is one option.

1189
01:31:30,632 --> 01:31:31,933
Do they have a separate section there?

1190
01:31:32,423 --> 01:31:34,564
You know, I'm not 100% sure about that.

1191
01:31:34,924 --> 01:31:36,224
I think so, but I'm not 100% sure.

1192
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,365
They don't have a big area anyway.

1193
01:31:38,465 --> 01:31:47,408
Now, you said that turning the casket over and putting the vault on top of it, is that an acceptable?

1194
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:49,369
It's one alternative.

1195
01:31:49,409 --> 01:31:50,870
Is that an acceptable alternative?

1196
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:52,050
It's not a preferred way.

1197
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,291
Other than that way, what is the other alternative?

1198
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:02,100
The basic alternative is nothing other than the shroud.

1199
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:03,603
Well, it can be a shroud.

1200
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,747
It can be a pine casket.

1201
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:08,132
There's all kinds of natural caskets.

1202
01:32:09,877 --> 01:32:10,517
disintegrate.

1203
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:19,722
And that's the purpose, to bring the body back as close to the earth, dust to dust, and in a natural way, without encumbrance.

1204
01:32:20,362 --> 01:32:24,704
And also, the other point of it is, without adding pollution.

1205
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:28,806
And so cement eventually is a form of pollution.

1206
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:34,549
Rocks and stones would not be, but cement is.

1207
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:36,329
But for some people who

1208
01:32:37,973 --> 01:32:50,096
you know, are unable to find a cemetery that will allow a real green burial, the compromise is to have the casket upside down so the body is next to the earth.

1209
01:32:51,177 --> 01:32:59,879
And then, not the casket, the cement vault would be upside down so the body is next to the earth, yes.

1210
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:05,981
And of course, in many Jewish cemeteries and Muslim cemeteries, the body is next to the earth.

1211
01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:09,092
They already practice natural green burials.

1212
01:33:10,513 --> 01:33:12,894
And so it's not an uncommon practice.

1213
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:16,256
It's just not being done in a lot of public cemeteries.

1214
01:33:17,057 --> 01:33:18,278
It is being done in Amherst.

1215
01:33:18,918 --> 01:33:25,542
Actually, I have an uncle who is a funeral director out there, and he's buried in that cemetery.

1216
01:33:25,562 --> 01:33:26,503
I just forgot the name of it.

1217
01:33:27,784 --> 01:33:29,625
And there's one in Maine.

1218
01:33:30,578 --> 01:33:41,103
and one in New York, but people have been going to Maine or other places instead of being buried in their hometown, which everybody wants.

1219
01:33:41,203 --> 01:33:44,044
Even Candace Curry said, she's doing a lot of research on this.

1220
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:46,345
She's a big promoter of green burials.

1221
01:33:46,385 --> 01:33:53,669
We had a meeting at the public library in green burials, and we had people that came from other cities to hear about it after they saw the movie, A Will for the Woods.

1222
01:33:54,417 --> 01:34:03,503
which was made by Tony Hale, Adele's son, made a movie, A Will for the Woods, about a man who knew he was dying and wanted to have a green burial.

1223
01:34:04,084 --> 01:34:07,386
And he had to go to another state because his state wasn't doing it.

1224
01:34:08,847 --> 01:34:18,413
And this is the effort that people are making to have something that will give them comfort when they know their past, when they've passed, and it will bring their family comfort.

1225
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:20,194
Thank you.

1226
01:34:20,374 --> 01:34:22,456
So on the motion of Council Marks, all those in favor?

1227
01:34:22,636 --> 01:34:22,796
Aye.

1228
01:34:22,956 --> 01:34:23,637
All those opposed?

1229
01:34:25,386 --> 01:34:36,933
On the motion for a adjournment.

1230
01:34:39,474 --> 01:34:41,835
I understand you, uh, you, you approved it.

1231
01:34:42,296 --> 01:34:49,080
Um, I just wanted to say, uh, I don't know much about the green burial, um, but I'm sure it should be investigated.

1232
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:53,202
So there will be no future, uh, indecisiveness in the future.

1233
01:34:54,489 --> 01:35:00,832
And also she mentioned something about the cemetery was thinking about building a mausoleum of sorts.

1234
01:35:02,432 --> 01:35:13,477
I was curious if there may be a better capital idea to build an actual type of church structure or chapel there.

1235
01:35:14,477 --> 01:35:22,460
And you could have a one-stop burial situation, such as you could view the body there.

1236
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:34,418
You could, uh, have a prayer said, or at the same time, you could just walk to the burial hole and we'll have to worry about the elements at three different locations.

1237
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:35,480
Just a thought.

1238
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,821
It's been done.

1239
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:38,082
Other parts of the USA.

1240
01:35:38,863 --> 01:35:41,626
Um, motion for a German to all those in favor.

1241
01:35:44,509 --> 01:35:45,250
Meeting adjourned.
