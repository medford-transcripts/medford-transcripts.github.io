 나는 지난주 Robert Elementary School에서 표시된 Henz Square에서 회의에 대해 배웠습니다.

 기억하다
 회의는 일주일에 3 ~ 4 번 열릴 예정이며, 시장을 축하하고 싶습니다.
 나는 이것이 사회의 정보에 좋다고 생각합니다.
 협의회는 항상 사회 나 사업의 다양한 기여가 필요하다고 생각합니다.
 과거에는 주차 및 계약 관리 계약에 서명하기 전에 공개적으로 대중을 희생 해달라고 요청했습니다.
 그래서 나는 이것이 긍정적 인 단계라고 생각합니다.
 물론 이것은 모든 사람이 할 수있는 일이 아니며 7 명의 컨설턴트가 회의에서 만날 수 있습니다.
 나는 유권자들에게 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 알고 있으며,이 회의에서 우리의 모든 선호도는 몇 분의 수를 알 수 있습니다.
 이 목표는 항상 미래의 선거에 유용합니다.
 오늘 밤 우리는 18 시간 이내에 목표 목표를 열었습니다.
 따라서 이것은 우리가 목표에 대한 토론을 줄이는 데 도움이 될 것입니다.
 그리고 일반 정보를 얻는 것이 항상 유용합니다.
 따라서 이메일을 알고 있으며 우리가받는 전화는 매우 유용합니다.
 그러나 당신이 알고 있다면, 일부는 회의에 대한 많은 의견에 참여했고, 나는 여섯 번째 가방에서 모든 것을 해결하고 싶습니다. 그리고 우리는 당신이 알고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 함께 유지하고 우리가 어떻게 자랐는지 알아보십시오.
 그러므로이 정보를 수집하고 적절한 것을 전송할 수 있도록 몇 분이 있으면 매주 또는 2 주마다 우리에게 보낼 수 있는지 궁금합니다.</p>

 I think people need to be able to hear what we have to say about it, what the school committee has to say about it.
 We're the ones that decide on the budget in June and decide whether or not the safety budget is enough.

 I learned about this bomb threat through Patch.
 I read it online and as a parent, I didn't even think of it as a parent, I actually called my mother who works for the school system and said, did you know there was a bomb threat three days ago?
 Yeah, I found out after the end of the day.
 So I had my mother in the building
 with a potential bomb threat, whether or not it was low or no threat, you know, I was concerned.
 And then I thought, after I started getting the complaints, I thought, you know, I have one child in the school system, soon going to have two, and then eventually have three.
 And whether or not it was a threat or no threat, I truly believe, and I think it's where a lot of people are coming from, I think that as a parent, I think I should be given the choice
 And I think a lot of parents do believe the same thing.
 They should be given the choice because it's not something that happens every day.
 This is actually the first threat of something like this that I've heard of happening ever in the Medford Public Schools.
 So I think parents are looking for me to come out and say they should have been notified whether that was through a phone call or some type of communication rather than after the children left school.
 And I think that's important to say.
 I think it's important.
 I have the right to voice my opinion.
 And that is my opinion.
 Parents should have been notified in a non-emergency fashion, but a phone call should have went out and said, this is the situation, this is what we're dealing with, and we just want to let you know, there's nothing to be concerned about.
 But, and parents, I have a number of parents that have called me upset, saying they would have, even though it was low threat or no threat, parents would have went and picked up their children.
 I know it's happening all over the state.
 It's unfortunate.
 It's something that was completely out of control, out of Medford's control.
 I don't think Medford did any, you know, there's nothing Medford, City of Medford could have done except probably better communication.
 So I'm very glad it's being addressed tomorrow night.
 And maybe one of the reasons it is being addressed tomorrow night and not last week is because we did put the resolution on.
 You know, we are going to talk about it tonight.
 So I think that it needed to be put on and I think people need
 and avenues to be able to speak and give their opinions on it.
 And obviously, that's going to be in a lengthy meeting tomorrow night.
 But if people want to voice their opinions now, or people looking to other politicians, not just the school committee, to speak out on it, then that's our prerogative.
 And I think it was wrong the way it was handled.
 And I hope that new policies are put in place after tomorrow night.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1214.221s">[2pAQFYhyG5g_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  Thank you.
 You may speak one at a time.
 Thank you.
 Well, Councilor, thank you for the motion.
 And Councilor Falco, thank you for withdrawing it for the time being.
 I don't think either of us is in any way opposed to the meeting itself or to working things out.
 There's been zero information other than what was in the transcript.
 To our knowledge, the bomb threat occurred somewhere around 9 a.m.
 when kids were in school.
 Neither the kids nor the teachers knew about it, to our knowledge as well.
 We don't know if any sweep was done or conducted, and in that regard, we trust the police and we trust that the school
 has our children's best interests in mind.
 That said, how dare they not call us?
 How dare they not give us the option of deciding what to do?
 And loco parentis, from a legal perspective, does not mean they get to make that decision.
 And they could be challenged on that, and we're thinking about that.
 It's very distressing to know we've had three children in the school system, currently one in high school.
 to know that he's sitting there hoping they got it right.
 If we wanted to take him home, that should be our option.
 Let us tell you a little story.
 We came in to have a meeting with one of the personnel on the third floor.
 There's an elderly gentleman who sits at the front desk of the high school.
 Very nice gentleman.
 He gives you a pass, and you walk up.
 Doesn't ask for ID.
 You could be anybody.
 Off you go.
 We've seen him before, so he knows us.
 On our way out, this gentleman was traversing down toward Mr. Belson's area, I guess to go to the men's room.
 There was nobody there.
 Anyone could have walked in that high school, and anyone could have done damage.
 That needs to change.
 So when they tell us they looked at the videos, really?
 That's the extent of determining whether or not somebody was doing some harm in a school that size?
 It's unconscionable.
 And I think it is your jurisdiction, because one, you approved the budget.
 Two, as Ms.
 Cain pointed out, the school committee did nothing.
 They didn't even raise the issue, and it is something they should be talking about.
 So I'm just going to say I think it's unconscionable we weren't called.
 I think we should be given that opportunity.
 And I think it would be a sad day if you folks did not act on this, if you determine after that meeting.
 that proper steps have not been taken.
 Remember, the resolution itself says parents may decide.
 That's what we're here about.
 We're not here to question the police or to question Mr. Belson or Dr. Perrella, whom we have trust in.
 We're here to say we wrote a call.
 Do you have anything else to add?
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1390.442s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  Just the fact that I support everything you said and that absolutely
 People need to be informed.
 You can't make any decision without being informed, period.

 Jay Spaulding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway.
 As a former teacher in a public school district where we had bomb threats and active weapon reuse and a student was shot on property, I know that this issue is terrifying to both
 teachers, staff, students, parents, administration.
 And I understand the desire to have this resolution.
 However,
 School policy regarding safety and security is something that we cannot address here at City Council because the people who have the, in my opinion, the expertise, the knowledge on creating safety plans and security plans are not in this room tonight.
 In this room are parents who are scared.
 in this room are citizens who work in various areas of both city involvement and private industry.
 But the chief of police, the superintendent of the school, the principal of the high school, they're not here.
 Tomorrow night, as Councilor Falco said, a serious conversation
 where things can be addressed will happen.
 I will state as a former teacher that the worst thing, in my opinion, one can do during an active, whether it be an active weaponry incident, an injured student, or a bomb threat, is to have
 Parents show up on site and try to remove their child.
 That is a great way to cause chaos, to increase injury, and to cause further damage.
 Whether the bomb, whether the threat is real or not, the rush of parents to remove students from a building because they're making a decision based on emotion, and I understand that emotion.
 I've worked in those buildings.
 at those times, and I would like to leave myself.
 That's chaos.
 That further endangers everyone in the building.
 And in my opinion, again, having lived through this, the reason that staff, students, teachers are not informed right away or even that day is, again, chaos theory.
 We don't want people running through the hallways.
 We don't want teachers saying, screw this, you guys, I'm out.
 Good luck, kids.
 I don't wanna die.
 That's the reality of the situation.
 So I am disappointed that this has to come before city council tonight when the issue is coming tomorrow.
 I think it honestly is a waste of time when we can address this tomorrow with the actual stakeholders.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1622.085s">[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  Good evening.
 Welcome.
 Please state your name and address for the record.
 Thank you, Mr. President.
 I'm Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street.
 Uh, I too am a former educator in, in, in Massachusetts and, uh, there are definite ways and orderly in, in,
 constructive way for parents to come in and retrieve their kids can happen without it breaking down into chaos.
 Uh, you know, school could be put on lockdown.
 Everybody stays in their room.
 And as parents showed up, you know, they're notified where their kids, uh, they communicate and they get them out in an orderly fashion.
 Now I went to, uh, chief Sacco of the method.
 Police holds a informational town hall meeting every first Wednesday of the month.
 And this was the main topic.
 The police got this threat and the threat was an automated robotic threat to the school.
 So that was one of the things that they used to determine the legitimacy of the threat.
 It came at a very inopportune time around 10 in the morning.
 The police did go through the school and make a search.
 But some of the things that they brought up that I think makes it pertinent for this council to talk about was that something like half of the cameras in the school don't work, not every single door is locked and being looked at.
 Another thing to consider is that it wasn't the police
 department's decision to put out the information about this bomb threat at six 30 at night, uh, hours after it happened.
 Uh, uh, I believe that was on, uh, the superintendent of schools, his decision, uh, and, uh, going forward.
 I, as you do consider the budget budget in, in June in, in the police department that we have, I mean, there's Metro police officer,
 that was up there on duty that day also has two kids in the school.
 So they did sweep the school.
 They did do a search.
 I don't know the full extent of that.
 And they did pass on the information of the call to the state police to try to track where this robotic call came from.
 But in considering the budget in June with our police department, I think it would be pertinent to do what you can to get
 uh, uh, enough police officers on, on the method police force.
 Thank you, Mr. President.
 Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1791.319s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.
 I live at 281 Park street.
 Um,
 I heard about this bomb threat online as well.
 I have a student in the Roberts Elementary, but I pretty much get all of my information about the school online because my school doesn't notify.
 I know other schools call for snow days.
 So this call coming in at 630 for a bomb threat is no surprise.
 There's no clear policy in how schools are supposed to notify parents.
 I thought this was possibly the PR person's job to kind of unify us because at my school, we've had power outages, we've had heat being out, we've had issues where they can't clean things because there's no hot water, there's no parent notification.
 Somebody needs to unify this because everyone should know.
 We had the lockdown drill at my school and nobody notified.
 We had children having anxiety attacks because their parents couldn't prep them for this.
 This is just a larger issue that we need as parents.
 When I drop my child off at the school, I don't give up my parental rights.
 I found out about the power outage last year because I was volunteering in the school building and had to cancel a program for 100 children with less than two hours, walked in the school and found out they had no power.
 So something needs to be done on a systematic level of notifying parents.
 We're still the parent, and I need to know what's going on for my child.
 I don't want her to come home and give me this wild story of we had no heat and had to wear our winter coats, because I don't know to believe that.
 School didn't tell me that, so it's probably not true.
 So I think it's bigger than just bomb threat, and we really need to think about that.
 It's a bigger issue.
 Thank you.
</p>

 Chair recognizes Vice President Scarpelli.
 Vice President.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=1904.231s">[George Scarpelli]</a>:  I'm sorry, I took over.
 Thank you.
 Again, I understand why this is put forth, but again, like my fellow colleague, as a former school committee member, these are issues we've vetted.
 And this is why it's important that we let the due diligence of our elected officials present what needs to be presented tomorrow evening, because it is important.
 These, as a school committee member, we can list out a litany of answers to all these questions, but it's the job of the school committee to inform everybody tomorrow at their meeting that then would be processed through us, and then we could have that next discussion.
 But I think right now, putting the cart ahead of the horse,
 I understand the questions that you have, the parents have.
 I got the same calls and one of the biggest questions was the notification issue.
 Well, there's a lot of security issues when and why notifications have to be given.
 So that's not for me to tell you that right now, that's for the chief of police and the superintendent to talk tomorrow because I have questions too.
 I have questions about the presentation of the PR.
 and PR person, and when that was done.
 But again, we want to make sure that we're not, you know, putting our school base in a frenzy right now until we really know what has transpired.
 So I think that's very important.
 So thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2001.669s">[John Falco]</a>:  Thank you, Mr. President.
 I want to thank my consular colleague, Mr. Scarpelli, as well.
 The point that I was trying to make earlier was basically that we should hear from the school administration.
 They can give everyone the rundown as to what happened, what time it happened, why they made the decisions they made.
 If we're gonna comment on things tonight, it's purely speculation, and that is not safe for anything or anyone.
 So therefore, the important thing is, if you have questions, I think, please, I urge everyone, go to Medford High School tomorrow night,
 at the library, seven o'clock PM, the superintendent's going to be there.
 The chief of police is going to be there.
 All of the decision makers are going to be in the room and they will be able to go right through the timeline as to what happened and when and why they made the decisions they made.
 And that's what I was trying to put point, uh, put across.
 I mean, I am a parent of three children in the method public schools.
 I mean, I completely understand, um, you know, the notification issue.
 I mean, I have the same concerns, but I think that the administration should at least give us the information so we can,
 make decisions and ask good questions.
 So that's the point I was trying to get across.
 Uh, thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2076.179s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  Chair recognizes the citizen Councilor Marks.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2080.122s">[Michael Marks]</a>:  Uh, thank, thank you, Mr. President.
 I want to thank a council longer current for putting this on the agenda for tonight.
 Um, you know, it was mentioned, I think that this is the first time this has happened in the city and by far that's, this is not the first time there's been,
 a threat of this nature in the Medford Public Schools.
 But needless to say, I think Councilor Falco just mentioned about speculation.
 The reason why there's speculation is because there's no communication.
 And I think that's the main concern.
 I have two children in the public schools, and when I received the call that night, the first thing that came to my mind was, geez, I would have liked to have a little more information, and maybe I would have liked to have it a little sooner.
 And I realize it's a delicate balance because you don't want to create pandemonium.
 How do you release, you know, if the high school wants to release 800 kids, how do you release them?
 And how do you go on to do it in a safe manner?
 I understand that.
 And I think these are the issues that need to be discussed.
 But if there's a policy in place, why does it take eight days or tomorrow's nine days?
 Why does it take nine days to say this is our policy?
 This is what we implemented.
 This is what we found out.
 It shouldn't take that long.
 And I think that's the concern that I'm hearing.
 And then as a parent, when they tell me part of the reasoning why they consider this a low threat was they went through 18 hours of videotape.
 You know, anyone that goes up to the high school and the gentleman that spoke is right.
 If you had to go up and bring your student a book,
 say they forgot a book, they used to have you just sign a sheet of paper and you'd go bring the book to the main office.
 So they'd let you into the school.
 Just recently I was up there and now they are asking for ID.
 They've changed their policy.
 So the policy before was just sign a sheet.
 You could sign a John Lennon and walk in because really there's no check and balance.
 The second point I'd like to make too is that high school is open constantly
 Saturday and Sunday.
 Hundreds of people going in there.
 I go out myself, Saturday night, and watch my son play basketball.
 Every door up in the gymnasium is open.
 It's a free for all.
 There's not one security person up there.
 There's not one security person going on.
 So the public schools really have to take, you know, I'm not sure who's looking at 18 hours of videotape.
 But first of all, the back of the school, it's pitch dark out there.
 So I'm not sure what you're going to see with those cameras in the back.
 And secondly, the whole school's open.
 We have the Japanese program that's been up there for a number of years.
 And the city of Medford makes a fair amount of money for renting out almost the entire high school.
 But there's thousands of people that literally have been up and watched the program.
 They take over all the classrooms in the high school.
 They have other classrooms that are under lock and key.
 They come in with wheelers.
 And we don't know what they're bringing into the building.
 And these are the things.
 And I'm not saying that this program's a bad program.
 I'm just saying, how do you keep a sense of security when the building is open to everyone?
 There's really no security up there, especially after hours and on weekends, which is a real concern of mine.
 And I hope it's addressed tomorrow.
 But I think the issue that I've been hearing from parents is not whether or not they wanted to pull their children out was the lack of communication.
 Be open and upfront with people.
 And it shouldn't take eight days to figure out what's going on.
 And if there was a breach in policy or the policy wasn't followed, let us know.
 That's how we improve.
 This is how you improve upon policy and regulations when something like this happens.
 And to just brush it under the rug and then come up with a meeting.
 You know, I've been calling for two years.
 for a public safety summit, Mr. President, in this community.
 And it's not just on the city side, it's in general.
 It's to bring the police department, the fire chief in, the mayor, the council, and anyone else that wants to be part of it, Mr. President.
 And for two years, I just called for another one recently, that this council voted unanimously.
 We have got no response at all regarding a public safety summit.
 It's almost like people in this community don't want to discuss what's happening in the community.
 They don't want to discuss the robberies that are happening in our local drug stores almost daily, the bank robberies, an incident like this at the high school.
 And the list goes on and on and on, drug activity on our streets.
 And we've been asking, Mr. President, to get together, like any good community would, and discuss some of our shortfalls and maybe why we're seeing an increase
 in this particular activity in our community, and what we can do better to provide security.
 You know, so I'm glad that this was discussed tonight.
 We're not talking out of school now.
 We're not letting any secrets out about safety at the high school, you know, ways someone could breach the high school.
 We're saying that we believe there's a concern, and the concern has to be addressed in a much quicker fashion, so speculation
 doesn't get out there, and people start thinking, oh, my God, what's happening?
 So we hired a $90,000 PR person.
 I didn't see one communication from that PR person.
 Not one communication.
 If you can't address an issue of this nature, what are they addressing?
 Honestly, I don't know what's going on, Mr. President.
 This is a concern that parents should be upset about.
 And maybe this is not the best forum, but guess what?
 We're an open forum.
 People can come up to the podium and speak.
 And the day we start censoring what can be said at that podium, you might as well close the light and lock the door here at City Hall, Mr. President.
 I just want to thank Councilor Longo for bringing this important issue up.
