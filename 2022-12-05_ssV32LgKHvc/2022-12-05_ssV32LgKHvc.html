    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=0.029s">Right</a>  now, teachers in Medford are rallying at City Hall after working a year and a half without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=6.355s">WBC's</a>  Paul Burton is live in Medford, and Paul, I understand they have some new demands.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=12.589s">I</a>  tell you what, Lisa, they were decked in red for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=16.151s">Dozens</a>  of school teachers just marched right in here to Medford City Hall to deliver a letter of a vote of no confidence, both to the mayor and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=23.514s">Now,</a>  Mayor Cohen was not actually here to receive that letter, so they taped it to her door and continued with the rally, letting their voices be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=34.321s">More</a>  than 100 teachers rallied at Medford City Hall late this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=37.623s">Today</a>  they marched right into the building to hand Medford Mayor Brianna Lungo-Cohen and the school committee their vote of no confidence.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=45.369s">94%</a>  of our members have no confidence in the mayor and the school committee to get this contract ratified.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=51.233s">The</a>  teachers union has been without a contract for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=53.914s">Negotiations</a>  are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=55.555s">The</a>  city says they've reached a signed tentative agreement with the union, but it's not yet been ratified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=60.959s">The</a>  rest of them are all here because we just want something fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=64.4s">Listen,</a>  the city's, whatever situation they're in, they're in, but we didn't cause that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=68.361s">So</a>  we just want what is rightfully ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=70.522s">Teachers</a>  are looking for a 3% increase in compensation and better benefits.</p>

    <p>[Perez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=74.063s">Where's</a>  our contract?</p>

    <p>[Reporter 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=75.243s">Katie</a>  Perez is a fourth grade elementary teacher who says she's actually had to buy most of the supplies for her classroom.</p>

    <p>[Perez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=81.365s">So</a>  I purchased all tables for my classroom rather than desks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=85.106s">We</a>  have a lot of students that come from underprivileged families, so that's buying their school supplies.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=89.847s">Today</a>  the city released a statement saying, we always aim to do the right thing, especially for our hardworking teachers, which is how we have been able to reach a signed tentative agreement with the leadership of the Teachers Union.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=102.409s">There</a>  are less and less teachers going in, less and less people going into the field of education, and we want to attract the best here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=110.171s">So</a>  in order to do that, we want a compensation package that is better than surrounding communities.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=120.236s">Both</a>  bargaining teams will meet back here on Wednesday at 3.30 to go over that contract and hopefully reach an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=125.481s">No</a>  talks of any strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=126.642s">Today</a>  was all about delivering that letter of a vote of no confidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ssV32LgKHvc&t=130.506s">Live</a>  in Medford, I'm Paul Burton, WBZ News.</p>
