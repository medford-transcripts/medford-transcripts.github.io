1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:05,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, teachers in Medford are rallying at City Hall after working a year and a half without a contract.

2
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:10,399
[SPEAKER_00]: WBC's Paul Burton is live in Medford, and Paul, I understand they have some new demands.

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you what, Lisa, they were decked in red for education.

4
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:23,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Dozens of school teachers just marched right in here to Medford City Hall to deliver a letter of a vote of no confidence, both to the mayor and the school committee.

5
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:31,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Mayor Cohen was not actually here to receive that letter, so they taped it to her door and continued with the rally, letting their voices be heard.

6
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:37,603
[SPEAKER_02]: More than 100 teachers rallied at Medford City Hall late this afternoon.

7
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Today they marched right into the building to hand Medford Mayor Brianna Lungo-Cohen and the school committee their vote of no confidence.

8
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:51,212
[SPEAKER_00]: 94% of our members have no confidence in the mayor and the school committee to get this contract ratified.

9
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The teachers union has been without a contract for a year and a half.

10
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:55,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Negotiations are ongoing.

11
00:00:55,555 --> 00:01:00,659
[SPEAKER_02]: The city says they've reached a signed tentative agreement with the union, but it's not yet been ratified.

12
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,980
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of them are all here because we just want something fair.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, the city's, whatever situation they're in, they're in, but we didn't cause that.

14
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just want what is rightfully ours.

15
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:13,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers are looking for a 3% increase in compensation and better benefits.

16
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's our contract?

17
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie Perez is a fourth grade elementary teacher who says she's actually had to buy most of the supplies for her classroom.

18
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So I purchased all tables for my classroom rather than desks.

19
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:29,507
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of students that come from underprivileged families, so that's buying their school supplies.

20
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:42,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Today the city released a statement saying, we always aim to do the right thing, especially for our hardworking teachers, which is how we have been able to reach a signed tentative agreement with the leadership of the Teachers Union.

21
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,871
[SPEAKER_00]: There are less and less teachers going in, less and less people going into the field of education, and we want to attract the best here in Medford.

22
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:57,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to do that, we want a compensation package that is better than surrounding communities.

23
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:05,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Both bargaining teams will meet back here on Wednesday at 3.30 to go over that contract and hopefully reach an agreement.

24
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,602
[SPEAKER_02]: No talks of any strike.

25
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:10,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Today was all about delivering that letter of a vote of no confidence.

26
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Live in Medford, I'm Paul Burton, WBZ News.
