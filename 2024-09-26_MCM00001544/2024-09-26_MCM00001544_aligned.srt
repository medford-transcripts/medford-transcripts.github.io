1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:06,214
I think we can call the September Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting to order.

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:07,855
Thank you all for joining.

3
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:22,302
As I mentioned, Emily O'Brien, our chair, is out tonight, so she asked me to lead the meeting as vice chair, so I will gladly do that.

4
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:27,205
I may have to step away momentarily later to help with

5
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,885
putting kids to bed, but I'll be here as much as I can.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,006
We've got Daniel on who can step in in any interim.

7
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:44,129
So Daniel, would you mind calling the roll and giving us a, we'll see if we can figure out about Orem as well.

8
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,450
All right, so thanks.

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,710
Jared Powell.

10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,210
Present.

11
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:52,831
Bruce Kovac.

12
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:53,631
Present.

13
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:56,152
Emily O'Brien.

14
00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:59,577
Who we know is not to me?

15
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:02,960
All right, B. Van Fairchild?

16
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:03,941
Here.

17
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:06,824
Bernie Muneer?

18
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:07,544
Here.

19
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:10,467
Doug Packer?

20
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:16,372
Who I don't see.

21
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:21,116
Daniel Nuzzo-Marler?

22
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:21,677
Present.

23
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:23,899
Noam Raveni?

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,280
Present.

25
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,900
Mary Kate Gustafson-Fayette.

26
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,464
I can see.

27
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:37,364
Leah Godsey.

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,226
I also don't see.

29
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,948
Rebecca Wright.

30
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,349
I also don't see.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,750
Okay, one second.

32
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:58,536
Let's see.

33
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:02,818
With that, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of 12, which is that correct?

34
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:02,818
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,519
I counted 11.

36
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,200
Sorry, 11.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,100
That's quorum then.

38
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:10,483
Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:28,117
Yep, you're right.

40
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:29,178
Terrific.

41
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:29,678
All right.

42
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:30,198
All right.

43
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:30,798
We have one.

44
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,480
Just by the skin of our teeth.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,540
Yeah.

46
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:41,883
Sorry, we have someone else on who I can put in as a guest if you'd like to introduce yourself, Sarah.

47
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,646
Hi, I'm Sarah.

48
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,727
I'm glad to be here.

49
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,528
I'm a biker in Medford and

50
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,532
I don't know, what would you like to know about me?

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,533
I'm excited about hearing more about what you guys are all up to and being part of things.

52
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:08,796
I do a lot of biking recreationally, mountain biking and road biking, and I bike with my kids on cargo bike.

53
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,056
I commute every day with them.

54
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:19,180
And really hoping to see the Clippership Connector work continue and be part of that.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
There's one of my sons.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,101
There he is.

57
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:27,828
I'll mute myself, but I'll be listening in the background here.

58
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:29,389
Thanks for having the meeting open.

59
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,991
Thank you for joining us.

60
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,512
Thank you.

61
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,074
Thank you very much for joining.

62
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,997
You look like someone who rides like a long tail bike.

63
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,959
I could imagine like a lime green long tail.

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,921
Is that the kind of bike you ride?

65
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,042
That's right.

66
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:46,103
We just upgraded, though.

67
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:46,743
We have a black.

68
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,745
You have a spicy green now.

69
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,287
That's what you call profiling, Jared.

70
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:57,491
No, I'm, we, we've met before at like the Medford farmers market.

71
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,693
So I don't forget it.

72
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:01,373
Wow.

73
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,155
I don't, I don't forget an unusual cargo bike.

74
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,115
They, they stand out.

75
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:11,820
I'm going to say, this is just a cargo bike, uh, social.

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,921
Well, thank you for joining.

77
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,963
We appreciate it.

78
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:20,345
All right.

79
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,446
Let's see what it was.

80
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:22,627
Anyone else on that's everybody.

81
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:23,187
Okay, great.

82
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,555
All right, well, announcements.

83
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,017
What do we have?

84
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:32,598
Does anybody have any announcements?

85
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,459
Yes, I do, actually.

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,400
Great.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:49,008
I just came off a meeting that started at 6 o'clock, hosted by Somerville for the Elm Beacon Street Connector, and they're basically kicking off the project to make improvements

88
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:56,493
In the quarter that I think many of us use, or at least people who go from Medford from Western Medford to.

89
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,196
Kendall square or downtown frequently go through that that intersection.

90
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:05,098
Of moss land, Somerville Avenue, beacon street.

91
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,881
So, it'll be interesting to see what they have and I have put into the chat.

92
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:16,184
A, a link, which is on the Somerville website to get more information and to get the.

93
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:24,170
The reporting of the current session that's still actually going on, I had to leave at 7 to join this meeting.

94
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:30,515
But I'm looking forward to see what facilities they have in mind, a quick build, that sort of thing.

95
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,256
I just wanted to alert everybody to that.

96
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:35,699
That's great.

97
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:36,299
Thanks, Bruce.

98
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,443
Any other announcements that folks might have?

99
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:54,785
Uh, not an announcement, but, um, there are a couple of orders of business, uh, approval of previous minutes that we should take care of.

100
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,245
Oh, that's right.

101
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:55,545
Yeah.

102
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,106
You should have done those first actually, I guess.

103
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:00,427
I missed that in the bullet.

104
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,208
I have a outstanding question.

105
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,909
Did, um, I know I had to step out unexpectedly in the last meeting.

106
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,810
Did anyone take a copy of the minutes from that meeting?

107
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,471
Does any, can anyone fill me in on that?

108
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,911
I believe that I have some notes.

109
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,231
They're not in front of me.

110
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:23,732
So I think we need to hold on approving those while we compile them.

111
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:26,053
But sorry about that.

112
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,273
Yeah, I do have some for you, though.

113
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:28,253
OK.

114
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:30,674
All right.

115
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:31,114
No problem.

116
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:34,735
In that case, I think we only need to approve the June 26.

117
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,416
Did we not do that last time?

118
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,016
Well, I don't know, actually.

119
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,817
Were those minutes approved?

120
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:45,144
Yes.

121
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:46,265
Okay.

122
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:46,645
Okay.

123
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:46,885
Great.

124
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:47,645
Sorry.

125
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,306
Just needed to clear up that.

126
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,547
All right.

127
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,927
Well, in that case, we don't have minutes to approve right now.

128
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,788
So I didn't all right.

129
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:56,408
Job too much.

130
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:59,970
Thank you, Daniel.

131
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,230
Let's see.

132
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,172
Could we do a recap of the EV showcase from last?

133
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,493
Are we finishing announcements?

134
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,320
Well, that's kind of an announcement, I guess.

135
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,820
I guess.

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,741
Halfway between an announcement and an event.

137
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,442
Yeah, we can put it with the events.

138
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,562
That's up next anyway.

139
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:25,145
The only other announcement that I think I had was Todd sending around, well, two things maybe.

140
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:37,070
Todd sent around that photo to the bike commission that was showing a new blue bike station going in at the Rotary

141
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,561
Winthrop and High Street.

142
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,982
So that's very exciting.

143
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:43,423
Did you all see that?

144
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,104
I was on the email.

145
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,045
I didn't see the photo.

146
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:53,668
Yeah, I haven't seen the station, but I'm pleased to see that they're popping up literally all over the place.

147
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:58,710
So that's really great that Mets has finally gotten really mainstream with blue bikes.

148
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:01,992
The more density of stations we get, the better.

149
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:02,732
Better, yeah.

150
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:11,958
My computer rejected that email I found out this afternoon, and then I forgot to go back, so it stayed rejected.

151
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,041
Gotcha.

152
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:19,224
Yeah, it was just the station going in right at the corner.

153
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:23,928
I'm not sure which corner it was, like northwest maybe?

154
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:27,431
Is that right, or was I misreading that location?

155
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,434
The northeast side has probably the most space.

156
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,724
as opposed to the others, which are just sidewalk, just speculating.

157
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,345
Yeah, probably so.

158
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:39,947
Well, it's very exciting.

159
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:43,490
Yeah, I feel like I've been seeing a lot of them around lately, which is great.

160
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,174
OK, let's see.

161
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:58,262
Oh, and one other thing was Todd Blake also alerted me that they installed bike lanes on

162
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,606
Rove Street, I want to say about a week and a half ago.

163
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:06,969
Yes, I've actually used them.

164
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:10,093
They're north of where I live, just north of the railroad bridge.

165
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,136
And they go all the way to the Winchester Line.

166
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:16,180
At which point, I was wondering if

167
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:26,904
there was any continuity on the Winchester side, and there's absolutely nothing.

168
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:40,427
And I thought, well, we should at least take the initiative to paint a nice big sharrow in the middle 20 feet ahead of the line to show that you must... That's actually done, Ernie.

169
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:49,550
There's two places where sharrows have been put just before the bridge so that you see a sharrow as you cross the bridge.

170
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,236
Yes, but not at the Winchester line.

171
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:54,638
I drove it a few hours ago.

172
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:55,178
Really?

173
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,119
I thought I could have sworn.

174
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,779
I saw one there.

175
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:09,390
Maybe I'm our well, we have sharrows or something near the in the bike lane itself, but it abruptly ends with no indication that you have to, you know,

176
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:22,240
wake up a bit, because the shoulder white stripe marking also drops to maybe a foot and a half or two feet wide, certainly not a bike lane.

177
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:29,766
So I'm not mentioning this more than tongue in cheek, but it'd be kind of nice if we would rub it in their face.

178
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,993
I said, you know, and as a safety consideration, one bicyclist that they no longer have a bike lane.

179
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,101
I'll sit right up there and check, because I could have sworn I saw it there as well.

180
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,402
Not northbound.

181
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:45,263
Not northbound?

182
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:45,623
OK.

183
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,323
No.

184
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,785
Well, there wouldn't be one southbound.

185
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,586
No, no, it wouldn't be southbound.

186
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:51,707
Right.

187
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,608
Maybe I'm conflating what I saw at the bridge.

188
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:54,769
I think so.

189
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:55,709
Yeah.

190
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:02,574
Well, I'm glad that those are going in.

191
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:03,995
This is Remy.

192
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:07,057
I did have some other notes that I jotted down for announcements that I forgot to compile.

193
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,650
Let's see, the Grove Street bike lanes, also the speed tables.

194
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,293
I don't know if you all have seen some of those go in around town, but I think they've been put in quite a few spots.

195
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:20,476
There's two on George Street and I think a few others going in.

196
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:21,837
I want to say Lawrence, maybe.

197
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,878
I think Lawrence has.

198
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:26,120
They've become so ubiquitous, I've lost count.

199
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:33,765
I saw the ripped up pavement on George Street before I moved, but didn't see the actual tables being put in.

200
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,403
Yeah, they have been part of the river street as well.

201
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:40,985
My daughter part there.

202
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:42,807
Great.

203
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:45,169
Yeah, I was.

204
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:59,743
I wasn't sure how they were going to be received like I live just off of George Street so I get to see them there's a, there's a large elementary school bus stop there that picks up in the morning so it's a pretty good spot to have people slowing down so the, the

205
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:03,776
speed tables kind of bookend that stop.

206
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:06,818
They're not right at the stop, but they bookend it a bit.

207
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,186
People did not notice them at first and just continued over them as if they weren't there, and you didn't see any brake lights going over them.

208
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:20,729
But now that they've been striped, I definitely have seen people slow down a bit more.

209
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:26,794
They're not the really aggressive speed humps like you might see, obviously, on Powder House Boulevard and Somerville, so they don't

210
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:33,372
have that kind of bucking bronco quality to them, as much as I kind of wish they would.

211
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,874
But they're welcome, at least.

212
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,135
They're taller than they could be.

213
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,336
So I'll take that as the win.

214
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:44,000
I think there's some on South Street, too.

215
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,243
I want to say there might be one on South Street.

216
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:51,967
The ones in Somerville are not rationally linked to the speed limit.

217
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:02,586
the ones you're talking about result in bottoming out of many cars at anything over 10 miles an hour.

218
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,648
And it's a 20 to 25 mile an hour speed limit.

219
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:14,793
So anyone who is not frequently going through there can be rudely

220
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,266
interrupted while trying to drive.

221
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,647
It's really a safety issue, I think.

222
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:24,128
Yeah, they should lower the speed limit to 10 miles an hour, it's true.

223
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,209
Right.

224
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:34,653
The speed limit is, or the signs do have a 10 mile an hour sign on them, on those speed humps.

225
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:37,394
So that's appropriate then.

226
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,114
Yeah, they do.

227
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,295
I ride by them every day.

228
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:45,100
Yeah, they have a, I don't know if they all do, but at least some of them say, say, 10 miles an hour.

229
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,887
I think I think there's like, um, at least the 1 on Grove street is comfortable at 25 miles an hour, which is the speed limit.

230
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,809
So, yes, no problem there.

231
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,011
Yeah, I see your I see your hand there.

232
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:57,292
Leah.

233
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:03,237
Oh, yeah, I also sorry I got in late, but I also just wanted to point out that, like, it's kind of.

234
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:13,688
It's kind of hard to strike a balance sometimes because of the different size of cars and trucks.

235
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:24,277
Your little car might bottom out because the car part is closer to the ground, but a big truck can zoom right over it still.

236
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:25,794
Yeah.

237
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:39,920
And if we want the, if we want the trucks to slow down to 20 miles an hour, that means that some of those more cars might have to slow down to 10, but like, we can't slow down the trucks as much, you know, as we slow down the cars, the speed jumps.

238
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,101
Yeah.

239
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:53,726
I think I recall Todd kind of talking us through some of the distinctions between like the different levels of speed devices like that, like the speed bumps or humps, whichever one it is, where the ones that were.

240
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:58,430
very aggressive, and short, and very quick, and really jarring.

241
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,013
And then they can kind of go to the more gentle speed table type thing.

242
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,934
And they're designed to bring you down to different speeds.

243
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,915
Some are designed to bring you down to 10.

244
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,056
Some are just designed to bring you down to the speed limit.

245
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:17,040
And I think the speed tables they put in are designed to specifically bring you down to the speed limit and not below that.

246
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,423
So I think that's what they've put in.

247
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:26,012
But I appreciate the traffic calming around.

248
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:36,616
In my experience, it seems like unless there's a threat of damage to the car, there seems to be very little else that actually gets people to slow down, frankly.

249
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:38,577
Lee, I see you again.

250
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:48,867
Yeah, sorry 1 more thing about, like, speed and traffic calming is that they're not allowed to post a lower speed limit.

251
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,488
Until those sorts of, like, traffic calming.

252
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,230
Measures go in and you can actually observe cars going.

253
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,431
At a lower speed, it's.

254
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:05,633
It seems like it might be chicken or egg, but in traffic engineering, it's it's pretty.

255
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:20,216
cut and dry a lot of the time that you have to have a speech study that shows, um, the, you know, that, that people are going to listen to the lower speed limit signs before you actually put them in.

256
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:25,377
Otherwise you just end up pulling everyone over, which is impossible.

257
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:29,998
So I think they have to do it this way.

258
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:32,958
Gotcha.

259
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,159
Well, I'm glad they're doing it.

260
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,341
And yeah, you can't have police at every intersection.

261
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:45,309
So it seems like it's a wise idea to try to install mechanisms that do more to slow vehicles down.

262
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:55,998
On that point, without getting too far afield here in the announcements area, what about pinch points that

263
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:09,201
are really dangerous for bicyclists who are going along near the shoulder, and all of a sudden there's perhaps a crosswalk, or for some other reason, the curb juts out in front of you.

264
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:16,609
And it's not a speed bump, it's a six-inch tall piece of granite

265
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:25,336
that will clearly destroy you unless you veer quickly to the left and perhaps get eaten by a car.

266
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:43,269
Yeah, so the only ones I know about of those are on, like, the Felsway, where if you stick to the left side of the bike lane, you don't have to veer at all because the bike lane jogs half a width to account for the bump out.

267
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,512
Not true on High Street, if I recall.

268
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:58,738
Yeah, the one at Woburn Street narrows down to maybe 10 or 11 feet worth of distance, so you're sharing the lane, which of course is not comfortable for some people.

269
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:06,943
And I think it's probably a bit downhill too, so you're not apt to be slowing for it.

270
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:08,644
Yeah, maybe that's something.

271
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:14,167
Right, but that also means that you're typically running at about the same speed as traffic, so it's easier to manage.

272
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:24,361
A lot of people go 30 down there, and if you're going 18 on a bike, no, you're not going to win that one.

273
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:30,865
No, but frequently you'll hit 25 or 30 by the time you've hit that point.

274
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,346
Your point's well taken.

275
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:39,010
I think it's something that needs to be... At best, I think...

276
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:47,704
A pinch point like that should have maybe a three foot ramp of tar going up to the level.

277
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:55,006
And that is a jolting reminder that, oh, yes, you're about to, you know, cross a crosswalk.

278
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,047
But you can be safe if you're careful.

279
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:04,468
And oftentimes, like like in Somerville on College Ave, they have one of those where the

280
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,977
the bike lane just continues up over solid crosswalk.

281
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:13,657
It's a bus stop.

282
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:14,458
Right.

283
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:19,802
Um, we should, we should, yeah, this thing we should bring up with Todd.

284
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,965
Obviously this is a, wait, that's, that's mass stop, right?

285
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:26,287
Hi on high street.

286
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:28,049
Yeah.

287
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:28,289
Yeah.

288
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:28,729
Pretty sure.

289
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:29,169
Yeah.

290
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,272
So I was thinking that might be something that we can talk to Todd.

291
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:36,175
I'm waiting for that to be a problem in the rain, in the winter, you know,

292
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:40,743
when someone just slams into that, not seeing the curb itself.

293
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,765
Not seeing the pedestrian and therefore not seeing the curb.

294
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,646
Yeah, I mean, that's one possibility.

295
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:56,270
I mean, I'm honestly, in those situations, I'd be more worried about attempting to merge and, you know, merging into traffic.

296
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,490
Yeah, if you know you need to merge.

297
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,092
I'm saying the granite isn't easily seen.

298
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,773
The curb cut out.

299
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:15,366
I'll add this to the list of things that we need to kind of bring up with Todd and that we could probably solve with the addition of a traffic engineer that could be.

300
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:20,869
Well, I mean, we still have to get some of these things get mass dot to do something about it.

301
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,371
Because they're the 1 to control that road.

302
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:31,195
Okay, 1, 1 other announcement just something to think about.

303
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,584
Sorry, was it today or yesterday?

304
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:39,426
Yesterday maybe that a cyclist was killed in Cambridge.

305
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,747
Yeah, it was Monday, I believe.

306
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:40,987
Monday.

307
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:41,668
Monday?

308
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:42,188
OK.

309
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,530
Yeah, sorry, I don't have the article in front of me right now.

310
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:52,515
Does anyone who is generally aware want to fill us in just quickly on what happened?

311
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,096
Yeah, I mean, that was the one.

312
00:20:54,437 --> 00:21:02,062
So I mean, it was on MemDrive, and the driver of an SUV went off the road.

313
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:27,130
and struck the cyclist on the bike path, which is kind of like, it's good to remember that even fully separated cycle tracks don't help when there's no controls on what cars are doing.

314
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,412
There's also, as I say, there's a critical mass

315
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:43,184
protest ride on Friday, starting from Copley Square at, well, meet at 5.30, roll at 6 p.m.

316
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:53,591
Maybe it should be noted that it was a head-on collision, so the forces were very high.

317
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:54,352
Yeah.

318
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,595
But that's why there was a fatality.

319
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,717
Yeah, but I mean, like, but like, honestly, like, you know,

320
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:10,399
if they'd been stopped, you know, against an SUV, doesn't make much of a difference.

321
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:18,222
Yeah, but the trauma is a function of the energy expended, which is the square root of the speed.

322
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:26,425
It's partly true, but it's also that SUVs... How do you finish my sentence?

323
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:41,744
And like SUVs, it's not just about the kinetic energy, it's about how they hit people and how they hit people as they run them over because they strike directly on the body.

324
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:45,227
Their center of mass is so high that they run them over.

325
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,669
It doesn't matter whether it's head on or tailing.

326
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,015
If you get run over, the kinetic energy doesn't matter nearly as much because it's just the weight.

327
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,331
I think we can agree that, yeah.

328
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:05,433
Are there any actions we need to take as a body?

329
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:12,357
You know, that's why this is an announcement, because, like, the only announcement is the protest ride.

330
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:17,680
You know, MemDrive isn't in Medford.

331
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,401
We certainly have similar places.

332
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:26,325
You know, something we should keep in mind when we're asking DCR to do things.

333
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,110
and put in safety.

334
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,453
Do you have a sense of what caused the motor vehicle to lose control?

335
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:36,376
It doesn't say.

336
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:39,579
Yeah, I didn't hear anything about that either.

337
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:43,862
They ran.

338
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,324
It was a hit and run.

339
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,184
They didn't stay.

340
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:50,608
So that's, I think, part of why we don't know.

341
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,229
But I just wanted to point out that.

342
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,070
And the car was speeding.

343
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:53,831
Yeah.

344
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:54,672
The car was speeding.

345
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:03,651
Right there's also a road diet project that kind of hasn't gone anywhere for a while and road diets are.

346
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,731
Can be effective and reducing.

347
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:14,913
You know, operating speed, because cars don't have an extra lane to pass someone who they think is going too slow for them.

348
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,254
I have to go behind that person.

349
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:20,074
Yeah, thanks.

350
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:20,994
Thanks.

351
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,495
I think my, my takeaway here is that.

352
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,714
This is a useful announcement for us as a body, because it kind of contextualizes the work that we do.

353
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:47,564
And as a reminder that what we're doing is not just, you know, well, while sometimes we can just talk in a fairly academic way and bicker about things that a lot of people don't really care about, there are like real implications to road design and the types of conversations that we're having.

354
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:53,588
So it's a good reminder of why we're here and the effort with which we should be putting toward our

355
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:59,452
our advocacy work, like lives are lost when this sort of stuff doesn't get improved.

356
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:04,116
So it's a good reminder of why we're doing this and to take it seriously.

357
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:14,545
On that cheery note, last thing, I know the traffic commission was looking for additional members.

358
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:18,409
Did anyone on here throw their hat in the ring for that?

359
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:22,032
Or I don't think I heard any chatter that anyone was,

360
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:28,496
It's a good way to change things if you're interested in it and have the time for it on Tuesday afternoons.

361
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:34,377
All right.

362
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,457
I wish I had the time.

363
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:36,357
I know.

364
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:36,617
I do.

365
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:37,217
I do, too.

366
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,138
OK.

367
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:40,518
Events.

368
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:42,118
Sorry.

369
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:43,478
Any other announcements?

370
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,019
Leah thought about it but don't have time.

371
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,880
Fair enough.

372
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,500
We would love to have you on there, Leah, if you do have time.

373
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,029
All right, let's see, events.

374
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,774
We've got a couple on the list here, though I'm not sure that these are all distinct.

375
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:04,695
Let's see.

376
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:10,459
I can speak to two as a reminder, just things that they have.

377
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,561
Family Bike Ride is having an event October 6th.

378
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,183
That's to the zoo.

379
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,185
They're going from Cambridge to Franklin Park Zoo, which is fun.

380
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,987
So it's always a good, I know that there are Medford folks who join those.

381
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:30,213
those rides, so it's nice for us to promote them as well, because I know people do attend those.

382
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:33,434
We can promote those on social media.

383
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:45,001
So October 6, 9 AM, riding from MIT to the Franklin Park Zoo, I think to show off some infrastructure down there that we may not be aware of on the south side of the river in all cases.

384
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:47,523
Another one.

385
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:55,973
Jumping to the third on the list, but just because it's related and I'm already talking, uh, the Halloween bike ride, which I mentioned before Sunday, October 20th, 9 30 AM.

386
00:26:55,993 --> 00:27:16,858
Um, meeting at assembly row and writing up through Medford and, and going to mystic riverbend park and ending at the playground there for, uh, where kids can play and have candy and all that fun stuff and get to enjoy some of the paths along the mystic river.

387
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:17,158
So.

388
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,750
That's one that I will plan to attend.

389
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,431
I would like others to attend as well.

390
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,652
I know we brought this up on a previous call.

391
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:29,173
I think it was the previous call, if I'm not mistaken.

392
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:33,994
So folks had some questions about helmets and whatnot.

393
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:42,757
And helmets are, I did follow up with Paul Morgan, who runs these events as part of the nonprofit that he works with, Family Bike Ride.

394
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,341
And they do require helmets.

395
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:54,064
It has been added to the public materials, maybe not all of them, but at least some of the ones that I've seen that's been added to them.

396
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:06,770
He also went back, because there was a question of, to what extent is this a concern, right, that kids are riding around helmetless in these parades, which really can be thought of as parades.

397
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,631
No one's riding at 20 miles an hour on these things.

398
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:22,767
he actually went back and watched the footage that he had that people recorded with GoPros and things filing past that like some of their, the marshals had at various posts.

399
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:28,571
And there was, there was no helmetless writing on the on the last one.

400
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:35,777
So I think we can feel good about that and know that we are not promoting reckless endangerment.

401
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:40,340
And because of us asking about that, like I said, he did add

402
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,413
that language specifically to the materials about it, that helmets are required.

403
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:47,595
So I strongly think we should support it.

404
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:55,060
And, uh, I'm going to reach out to some of the elected officials and see if we can get some of them to be marshals and give a speech or something.

405
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,601
The mayor's expressed that she was interested.

406
00:28:56,621 --> 00:29:08,149
Um, would anyone else on here like to be a Marshall or something like that to kind of funnel kids along past obstacles or, or challenging intersections or anything like that?

407
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,750
If so, when is that again?

408
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,619
It's October 20th, Sunday, 930 AM.

409
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:23,545
I know they are looking for some people to serve in that kind of role to help people navigate around turns and stuff like that, or cross intersections, that sort of thing.

410
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,186
Who do we contact about that?

411
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:37,053
I can circulate contact information, but it's Paul Morgan who runs the community pedal power

412
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:44,301
nonprofit that operates these family bike rides.

413
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,764
Yeah, I would consider serving as a marshal for that.

414
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:49,526
That would be great.

415
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,247
Thank you, Bruce.

416
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,514
Has anyone else attended any of those events before?

417
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:03,998
Yeah, I went to a previous Halloween one.

418
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:05,299
Thought it was super fun.

419
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,140
Oh, great.

420
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:11,005
You got to think of a costume that works, uh, for your bike.

421
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,669
I was a lack of tube from, from Mario cart.

422
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,811
And I put a cloud on my bike.

423
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:23,977
I went last year with our, with our family and it was very, very, very fun.

424
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,723
That's a good costume.

425
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,464
That was a really, there were a lot of people.

426
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:32,145
It was really fun.

427
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,919
Yeah, I went to the one I went to the one last year, too.

428
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:38,939
It was it was a lot of people and a very slow bike ride.

429
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,280
Like it was, you know, only going a couple miles.

430
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,201
I think I think it was to Belmont last year.

431
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:48,622
And a playground at Belmont, you know, and it was it was great.

432
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:49,922
Hundreds of people easily.

433
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:54,224
I don't know how many hundreds, but hundreds for sure.

434
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,284
A big group and a lot of fun.

435
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:59,165
I think they did kind of trick or treating and

436
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,978
people showing off their costumes.

437
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:17,211
I've mentioned this before, but just for the sake of anybody who might have forgotten, one of the reasons that Paul runs these is that he's looking, obviously, to get more people out on bikes and riding with their families and normalizing biking through our area.

438
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:23,617
And there's also the component of it that is designed to show people

439
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,424
infrastructure, new-ish infrastructure, or lesser-known infrastructure that people might not know about, right?

440
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:39,971
Like, there's a lot of paths in our area along the Mystic River and Malden River and Alewife Brook and any number of other places where people just may not really realize.

441
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,512
Everybody thinks, like, oh, the Minuteman.

442
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,593
Like, that's where everybody rides bikes.

443
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,616
But that's really not true, and there's some lovely paths in our area.

444
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:53,921
So this one is designed specifically to show, I think, there's another one that he has planned that he's talked to us about before that

445
00:31:54,793 --> 00:32:00,417
maybe for next year or year after or something like that, depending on when the Clippership Connector is open.

446
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:04,460
And so there will be another ride in the future that shows that off as well.

447
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,722
But for now, it's showing off kind of the path that exists.

448
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:11,184
And this is the first one that will come into Medford.

449
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,506
So we're pretty excited about it.

450
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:19,390
I think there was talk of people peeling off and going to the Great American Beer Hall afterward.

451
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,413
But I'm not sure if that is formalized as a part of these announcement materials or not.

452
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:27,549
But thank you, Bruce.

453
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:28,590
I'll be there as well.

454
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,273
Yeah, I've got to check my calendar.

455
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:40,059
I just remembered that we have a wedding one of these October weekends, and I need to confirm exactly when that is.

456
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,662
But I'll look into it nonetheless.

457
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:43,702
Great.

458
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:44,123
Thank you.

459
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,684
Anyone else?

460
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:46,985
It's a fun time.

461
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:51,689
Ernie, Dan, Noah, Leah.

462
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,250
Anybody?

463
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:54,632
Sadly, I'm...

464
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,325
out of town for the next month.

465
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,946
So, yeah, I won't be able to.

466
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:07,629
Yeah, I fear I might be out of town as well and may show up spontaneously.

467
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,772
Will we be announcing the event the day before as well?

468
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:16,913
I'm free.

469
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:18,494
Wedding is not that way.

470
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:19,694
What do I have here?

471
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,736
Harvest Energy, that's Saturday the 19th.

472
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:27,157
Yeah, that was, that was next on, on my list.

473
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:32,401
I didn't realize that it was, uh, I hadn't put two and two together to see that that was the day before.

474
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:33,842
Um, yeah.

475
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:36,965
Yeah.

476
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,846
We plan to go to that one.

477
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:40,587
Bruce, is that one that you can attend?

478
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:41,548
I know that's one that you've always had.

479
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:41,748
Yeah.

480
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,169
It looks like I'm free as well.

481
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,290
Okay.

482
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,871
I always enjoy going to that one.

483
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:48,714
Okay, great.

484
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:50,455
When is it Saturday?

485
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,236
What time is it morning or afternoon?

486
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,338
Harvest your energies noon to three.

487
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,716
1, 2, 3, I think, I think, let's see.

488
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:03,537
When is Indigenous Peoples Day?

489
00:34:03,697 --> 00:34:05,378
Is that, is that that weekend?

490
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,439
That's the weekend before.

491
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:08,799
The weekend before, okay.

492
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,460
The 14th.

493
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:18,283
Okay, in that case, yeah, I'll be there that weekend, so I can, I'll plan to come to harvest your energy as well.

494
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:24,724
Uh, if we want to get ambitious, um, in, in the past, we've actually sponsored a ride.

495
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,565
Along some of the river paths, like to assembly row and back.

496
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:37,267
Um, the October bike ride, the Halloween bike ride is the next day, right?

497
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:39,188
So.

498
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,375
So yeah, on those pads, you mean?

499
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:43,835
Yeah.

500
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:44,435
Yeah.

501
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:48,038
I'm kind of doing two of them at the same time.

502
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,301
I put it in the chat, Jared, but I'm happy to Marshall as well.

503
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:53,722
Oh, awesome.

504
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:54,082
Thank you.

505
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:54,623
Sorry.

506
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,763
I'm looking two different places.

507
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,205
Uh, that would be great.

508
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:01,427
Yeah, that would be, I know Paul would, would appreciate that.

509
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:06,111
He likes to get kind of get the local folks in to get a little bit of skin in the game.

510
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:06,591
Right.

511
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:07,732
So thank you all.

512
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:10,714
Okay.

513
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,260
Yeah, those are, those are really fun.

514
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,041
Um, really fun events.

515
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:21,483
It's always awesome to see so many people writing around that you really didn't think we're, uh, we're writing in your area, but they are.

516
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:25,704
Okay.

517
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:29,365
So, uh, sorry, I heard something.

518
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:38,367
I would say if I don't know if there's anything I'll say about harvester energy, but if we wanted to do it as part of events, I can give her a report on the EV showcase.

519
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:39,848
Oh yeah.

520
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:40,328
That would be great.

521
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:43,719
So that was a week and a half ago.

522
00:35:44,339 --> 00:36:00,624
And I went with my folding e-bike and Becca brought her cargo e-bike and the Camberville e-bike lending library brought a total of four bike cargo, well, three cargo e-bikes and one cargo e-trike.

523
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:10,627
I think the, you know, a bunch of people came and a couple of other people also like showed up with like sort of off-road e-bikes.

524
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:18,539
A bunch of people showed up and talked to us about various things.

525
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,941
The mayor showed up and rode one of the e-bikes.

526
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,502
I've actually got a picture of her holding her dog and sitting in the bucket with Chris.

527
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,463
And sit in the bucket.

528
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,964
I haven't distributed that because I wasn't sure what she wanted to do with it.

529
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,365
I sent it to her, but I haven't seen it surface anymore yet.

530
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:35,865
Let's see.

531
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:48,890
The one takeaway from our perspective and from the perspective of the e-bike lending library, it was that we had a lot of cargo e-bikes.

532
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:59,373
My little folder was the closest thing to an ordinary bike, and maybe it would have helped to have a bit more representation on that end of things.

533
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,115
Just a regular bike, but with a motor, because it was

534
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:09,962
you know, my tiny folding bike, a bunch of cargo bikes, a couple of off-road bikes.

535
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:14,104
There wasn't just like a normal full-size bike.

536
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:15,805
That's an e-bike.

537
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:25,511
Um, so maybe giving people a slightly skewed idea of what's available in the market, but still like definitely got people interested.

538
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:29,013
Definitely got people, you know, thinking about their options.

539
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:43,124
Well, I showed up late with my Ioniq 5 and was forced to park next to an incredibly large moon lander, I guess called the Cybertruck.

540
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,785
So I understand how you feel, B-Dan.

541
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:51,806
It was just... It was kind of a ridiculous vehicle, wasn't it?

542
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:52,786
Yeah.

543
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:53,406
Oh, yes.

544
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:53,667
Yeah.

545
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:59,328
I had a conversation with Ellery also about that while we were there.

546
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:04,998
I think I've seen that vehicle around.

547
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:14,241
The Ford pickup truck that people use for commercial use is probably about the same size.

548
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:19,742
It just doesn't look as, I'm not quite sure what word I want to use, unusual.

549
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:20,062
Yes.

550
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:25,824
Well, the Ford at least probably has more room to put stuff in it.

551
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,164
Well, that's a good point.

552
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:28,945
Hard to tell.

553
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,714
The Cybertruck is more like an extremely poorly constructed El Camino.

554
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:40,779
Except it has less cargo capacity than El Camino and much heavier.

555
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,480
Anyway.

556
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,362
Yeah, but it is aluminum or stainless steel or whatever it is.

557
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,864
Yeah, and it somehow weighs four tons.

558
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:56,492
So I think the chat also, moving back to Harvester Energy, do we have people signed up?

559
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:57,333
That's a good question.

560
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,681
Or do I have people who want to attend?

561
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:04,303
Yeah, how many people do we need?

562
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:08,025
I mean, we can get two people to cover the whole time.

563
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:08,965
I think that's fine, right?

564
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,528
Yeah, and I'm free, so I'm willing to do it.

565
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:14,929
Free is better.

566
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,690
Yeah, certainly.

567
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:18,861
Yeah, I can cover.

568
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:25,143
I might need to show up a little bit late, depending on a kid's activity, but I should be able to cover most of that time, too.

569
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:27,224
So we actually need to get signed up then.

570
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:30,345
I can cover a little bit of it as well.

571
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:34,447
I just did it while we were on the call.

572
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:35,807
So we are all set.

573
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:36,487
Oh, excellent.

574
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:37,988
Thank you.

575
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:45,750
And just to make sure it actually makes it into the minutes, that's 12 to 3 on Saturday the 19th.

576
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,388
That's right.

577
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:51,069
We'll publish it.

578
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,509
It's always a pretty fun event.

579
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:58,631
I find the title a little awkward to say for whatever reason, but it seems like it's well attended and people enjoy it.

580
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:02,372
Well, great.

581
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,433
That all sounds good.

582
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:09,275
I'm glad we've got some folks signed up to join those things.

583
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,316
And thanks for the update on the EV showcase.

584
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,977
That was, I think, kind of an unfortunate situation where

585
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:22,742
We were not plugged in with the right people at the city for some reason.

586
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:29,226
And so we did not find out about this event until far too late when we could have been more helpful.

587
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:41,555
And I'm extremely appreciative of Chris Schmidt at the at the Camberville Lending Library to kind of reorganize some loans that he had scheduled for that morning so that he could get a crew of folks.

588
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,196
They apparently found out before we did.

589
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:56,759
They, yeah, it was a similar timeline, I think, but it was through like a Facebook post or something like that, where someone posted on Facebook that, Hey, no one from Medford is coming to this, this event.

590
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:04,284
And so I think we've rectified that problem, but it was just kind of a staffing thing where the specific person in charge of this event didn't know that we existed.

591
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,526
So that's unfortunate and we should fix that.

592
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,509
Okay.

593
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,130
Um,

594
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:24,429
Let's see, Clipper Ship Connector is the next thing on our list here, moving right along.

595
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:35,616
I'm not sure there's really much to say other than we've now heard officially that it's not going to be open until fall of next year, August of 2025.

596
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:39,198
I feel like that was the date that I saw written down.

597
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:43,521
Okay, well, I mean, that's kind of what we expected anyway.

598
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,684
Any idea if there might be a soft open in that, you know, it's not officially open because the signs aren't in and that kind of thing, but is accessible.

599
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,206
I mean, they're never going to tell us that.

600
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,067
Yeah, that's true.

601
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:02,249
That is frequently the way paths get finished.

602
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,010
Yeah.

603
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,991
It's usually, usually it says trail closed and the fence is open.

604
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:06,612
Right.

605
00:42:06,752 --> 00:42:07,152
Exactly.

606
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:13,956
So like, maybe that, you know, maybe that will happen in the spring or something, but who knows?

607
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:33,078
Yeah, I hope so, but I certainly know what the Somerville Community Greenway, Greenline Extension, whatever the official name is, that was one where it looked done for a long time, but it did have big fences up blocking off big chunks of it, and it was really not passable for a long time.

608
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:39,980
Yeah, that one, they really kept it closed off, but that was also alongside the tracks.

609
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,756
maybe more of a safety concern.

610
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:51,639
With the Cambridge Watertown Greenway, there was a long period when it was not officially open.

611
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,640
But you could go past the signs and bike it.

612
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,982
There were parts of the Northern Strand that were like that for quite a while, too.

613
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,082
So yeah.

614
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,963
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

615
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:04,824
I'm not sure.

616
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:08,345
I don't know if anybody has paid attention to the specific design.

617
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:26,533
uh, more than I have, but my, my understanding was that there was a boardwalk component and it might be the existence of the boardwalk component that precludes kind of an early opening because it's not like it's just a path you can ride on.

618
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:30,475
If they're like building, you know, decking and all that sort of stuff, then.

619
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:31,815
Yeah.

620
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:32,156
Well, right.

621
00:43:32,836 --> 00:43:34,517
But that also may not be the last thing that goes in.

622
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,298
Like oftentimes the last thing that goes in is like landscaping.

623
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,540
Yep, yep, that's true.

624
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,462
I talked to Representative Garbally about this.

625
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,043
That's how I got added to their mailing list.

626
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:52,244
And there's like a barrier next to the Yacht Club that needs to be erected as well.

627
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:57,085
And folks are kind of using the path as parking at the moment.

628
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:59,606
And that barrier is critical too.

629
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:03,487
So it looks like it's all paved when you go by it.

630
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:08,088
So I'm sure an entrepreneurial member of the community would go explore it.

631
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:12,820
So is it going around the yacht club?

632
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,520
Is that right?

633
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,202
Like it goes up to, was that Ship Avenue or something like that?

634
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:17,562
Is that it?

635
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:18,923
Like it goes around that parking lot?

636
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:20,003
Yeah.

637
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:27,687
And then it has like a planting and it's like a foot of like height difference or something to try to differentiate the two areas.

638
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:29,448
Gotcha.

639
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:35,311
Well, I'm definitely disappointed that it's not going to be open for so long, but I'm glad it's happening.

640
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,532
That is definitely something that

641
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,573
we get asked about a lot, which I'm always a little surprised by, because I recognize how important it is.

642
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:47,157
It's also, I'm surprised that people are plugged in enough, frankly, to even know that this really exists.

643
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:53,982
So I'm glad that- I mean, it's been talked about by a lot of different people, not just us, for a while.

644
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:55,403
Yeah, yeah.

645
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:57,685
It's hard to be plugged in sometimes.

646
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,147
So it shows how much demand there is.

647
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:00,787
Yeah.

648
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:01,187
Yeah.

649
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:04,929
It's frustrating that the DCR doesn't make the information more accessible.

650
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,829
You know, they distribute a PDF.

651
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:07,910
That's a printout.

652
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:14,052
It's been scanned back in and you can't find anything on their website about the current updates.

653
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:19,294
So it's sort of, there's definitely a communication breakdown there too.

654
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:19,394
Yeah.

655
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:21,214
Well, thank you.

656
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:21,774
Thank you, Noam.

657
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:26,296
I know you've been kind of dogged and figuring out some of this information, so we appreciate it.

658
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:31,190
OK, let's see.

659
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:37,075
Yeah, I put this one in the agenda, just an update on the road rage incident.

660
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:40,417
Yeah, that was just kind of an unfortunate thing.

661
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,199
Some of you may have seen it on social media.

662
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:42,739
I'm not sure.

663
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:53,008
But I was, for those who may not be familiar, I was riding to my child's bus stop, which is about a block and a half away.

664
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:56,110
I was on my own street, 100, 200 feet from my own house.

665
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,927
on a narrow residential street.

666
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:05,671
It's two ways, but only wide enough for one lane and there's parking on both sides.

667
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:15,360
Um, and I was rolling to the stop sign at George street and a pickup truck seemed very angry.

668
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:23,287
A guy in a pickup truck seemed very angry about my, my existence and, uh, pulled up behind me and was revving his engine.

669
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:30,965
very aggressively and yelling and screaming and very frustrated that I was, that I dared to be in the road.

670
00:46:31,385 --> 00:46:41,390
Um, I had my kid with me on my, on my bike, uh, safely buckled in and helmeted and following all rules of the road and all that sort of thing, um, approaching a stop sign.

671
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:53,637
So it's not like it was really slowing anybody down, but still, uh, you know, harassed and screamed at and all the usual stuff about being a clown and getting out of the road and not paying taxes and

672
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,437
all sorts of nonsense.

673
00:46:56,937 --> 00:47:01,078
It was very jarring is very frustrating as events like that, as events like that are.

674
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:11,900
I did post about it in a couple of forums on on social media, writing a bit of a screed asking people to not behave that way or condone such behavior.

675
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:22,342
And I was pleased by the amount of positive sounds like the wrong word, but positive traction, positive reaction and engagement, I suppose that

676
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:35,318
Both of the posts got a couple hundred engagements and many, many, many, many comments about it of people expressing support and being frustrated that someone would do that in the community.

677
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,920
I don't know if this person was a neighbor, I didn't recognize him, or just someone cutting through the neighborhood.

678
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,302
Jared, would you mind sharing the street that this happened on?

679
00:47:43,981 --> 00:47:44,921
I'm sorry, say that again, Bruce.

680
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,203
Would you mind sharing which street this occurred on?

681
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:48,383
Brookings Street.

682
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,845
It was on Brookings and you were heading south, northbound rather to George or the other way?

683
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:54,466
That's correct, northbound to George.

684
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:55,226
Okay.

685
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,347
Northbound to George.

686
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:58,528
Just wanted to check on that.

687
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:09,913
I would like to ask us to do something formally, which would be to engage the representative of the police department.

688
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,675
Maybe it's Carl Brooks, maybe it's somebody else, I'm not sure.

689
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:30,178
But to really understand what we can do in those situations when somebody deliberately doesn't honor the forefoot passing, for example, or verbally harasses or intimidates using their vehicle.

690
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,604
Because I feel it's the kind of thing which nobody does anything about it because it doesn't get taken seriously.

691
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:43,940
And I'd like to have us somehow enter a dialogue.

692
00:48:43,960 --> 00:49:05,447
I don't know if we need the mayor involved, if it's something that Todd can help us with, but I guess I would like to make an official motion that we look into engaging the police in some fashion to understand what we would recommend to people, right?

693
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,928
And maybe get some actual

694
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:12,968
feedback from the police so that they know this does happen.

695
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:19,334
And if you get a license number, you know, at a minimum, they'll make a phone call, for example.

696
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:34,348
You know, that happened to me once in Belmont, I called the police and they actually tried to call the individual couldn't get through, but, you know, they at least gave good lip service to it.

697
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,140
Yeah.

698
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:52,404
So something, so a few days ago I happened to run across a post, um, by someone who said that since adding in a very obvious camera to their biking setup, you know, it's like mounted on their shoulder.

699
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:55,304
Like it's very clearly a camera.

700
00:49:56,104 --> 00:49:59,725
Uh, they get a lot more, you know, safe passing distance.

701
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,186
Um, they, if someone starts.

702
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:26,770
um harassing them they point to the camera and it very quickly stops and you know obviously this is not like a universal solution uh like we can't recommend that all cyclists wear cameras as a way to avoid these sorts of things but it does kind of speak to like

703
00:50:28,181 --> 00:50:30,383
the things that drivers pay attention to.

704
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:44,414
Basically, you know, they'll do it if they think that there are no consequences, that there's, you know, that no one can report on them, that no one's observing them except for the cyclist they're harassing.

705
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:51,660
But they stop, or at least most of them stop, if there's any chance of consequences.

706
00:50:52,660 --> 00:51:05,764
When I'm in similar situations, I might reach in my pocket and grab my phone and just smile at them and pretend to take a picture, because I just don't have the wherewithal to go through all that.

707
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:12,186
And a couple of times, the person would laugh and take their camera out and take a picture of me.

708
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:16,548
And we both go on our way realizing we're not going to do anything about it anyway.

709
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:37,824
But there was at least some maybe useful, I'm not sure antagonistic, I don't know, but some disruptive quality to that gesture that changed the timber and reduce the fire of the possible exchange.

710
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:45,067
So if it's a pickup truck of the guy with a loud muffler, they just speed away and you know, try to

711
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:52,192
acoustically grind you into their path and into their dirt trail.

712
00:51:52,893 --> 00:52:05,788
There was an interesting article a few days ago, maybe last week, on I think it was WBZ TV, where they kind of did a poll about what

713
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:10,525
What is permissible and what isn't by bicyclists and they were very.

714
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:17,572
I thought evenly handed in basically, you know, describing the rights of cyclists.

715
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:21,595
That people typically didn't know about, you know, things like.

716
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,130
Oh, you have to ride in the bike lane, right?

717
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,011
Well, no, right?

718
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:26,971
I mean, things like that.

719
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:34,093
So there was quite a bit of surprise by both the anchor who was doing it and, in general, the way they presented it.

720
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:40,755
But it does feel like that's another layer of education that people need to learn.

721
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:49,878
I have also seen on the back of buses now, I always wanted this, and I'm glad they're doing it, the four-foot passing law.

722
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,793
Is actually now on the back of some buses as an advertisement.

723
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:54,954
I don't know who's paying for it.

724
00:52:55,674 --> 00:53:00,298
But you might recall about a year ago, I looked into what it would take to get that advertising.

725
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:04,501
And it was way too expensive for a group like ours to do.

726
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:07,803
That might just be the state doing it because I hope so.

727
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:11,386
But it was, um, hey, folks, sorry, sorry to interrupt.

728
00:53:11,426 --> 00:53:13,067
I need to step away for just a couple minutes.

729
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,512
This is obviously a conversation I want to want to participate in, but I have to leave for about 5 minutes and I'll be, I'll be right back.

730
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:19,672
So.

731
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:23,376
continue as you were and fill me in in a minute.

732
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:46,453
So I actually, I believe I have a motion on the table to put together some sort of response for us to look into working with the mayor and or the police department to at least clarify exactly how members of our community should handle such incidents with regard to reporting.

733
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,069
That's a good question before we move on that.

734
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:56,252
I remember Emily talking about setting up a meeting with the traffic officer.

735
00:53:56,272 --> 00:54:03,315
And obviously, Emily's not here to comment, but I don't know if anybody knows if that got moved ahead because maybe that.

736
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:07,096
Is a stepping stone for the bigger initiative.

737
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:15,260
We also, I guess I'm requesting that we put forth the resolution that we be more.

738
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:29,586
assertive about this particular incident, and in particular, an understanding of who should we contact or what should we do, so it's not just something that ends up in a vacuum.

739
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:37,049
Because it's obviously not going to change, and it happens to more people than some, but

740
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:43,651
It's a very intimidating factor for many people who don't want to ride.

741
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:55,023
In fact, I believe when people say they're worried about traffic, it's really a surrogate for not wanting to assert their right to the road because they're afraid of these kind of encounters.

742
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:55,703
Yeah.

743
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:56,764
Well, legitimately so.

744
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,188
Because, of course, there's always the worry

745
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:13,382
that just being yelled at is uncomfortable, but a driver could equally well decide to take physical action, and they have a large vehicle.

746
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:24,766
But I was going to add, though, to your motion, I'd like to include ways that we can be proactive.

747
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:26,887
It's good to try to establish

748
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:42,260
what people can do if this happens to them, but what can we do to educate drivers or to set things up so that these incidents are less likely to happen?

749
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:49,277
Bruce, I wonder what's codified in other communities who've had to address this.

750
00:55:49,357 --> 00:56:00,241
I would specifically think that Cambridge and Somerville have established some norms for what's legal or reasonable,

751
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:06,344
and responsible but not confrontational conduct.

752
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,905
All of the legality is gonna be handled by the state.

753
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:14,828
I mean, that's cut and dry in the regulations and mass general law.

754
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:22,932
So it's really a question of the policies of the police department and any of the safety organizations as to what they're recommending.

755
00:56:23,452 --> 00:56:25,433
But you have a good idea there, I mean,

756
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,452
we don't need to reinvent the wheel, right?

757
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:35,335
If, if, uh, have come up with policies that are useful.

758
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:51,762
Well, it would be nice for drivers to, to be aware that there isn't, you know, a great, uh, change when they cross lines from the town they live in to one that they're happened to be driving through.

759
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:54,143
So, um,

760
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,883
I mean, I'd like to I'd like to modify my resolution.

761
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:04,426
We put together a working group to to proceed forward on this.

762
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,389
Okay, so hold on.

763
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:09,510
I'm back.

764
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,051
Okay, thank you.

765
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:23,440
To clarify, this is a motion to put together a working group to discuss which police office sorry, with the police department that what we want to do in the case of aggressive driving.

766
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:27,654
It's not even quite that far.

767
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:32,923
This proposal is to put together a working group to try to figure out how we should address the problem.

768
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:35,427
Maybe it's discussing with the police.

769
00:57:35,507 --> 00:57:37,871
Maybe it's figuring out how to do more.

770
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:55,231
or we're working with the other cities and towns on getting information, but it's really the proposal I'm putting forth now is just that we put together a working group so that we can explore a handful of different options as opposed to discussing it just in this meeting.

771
00:57:56,412 --> 00:58:01,374
Should we possibly check if we have anyone willing to do the working group before we make that proposal?

772
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:02,935
Well, clearly, I'm willing to do it.

773
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:03,755
Okay.

774
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:05,838
Yeah, I am as well.

775
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:08,578
I second the motion.

776
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:09,239
Yeah.

777
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:13,380
Thank you, Ernie.

778
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,521
Well, in that case, we've got a second.

779
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:25,624
All in favor of the motion to start a working group to consider steps that we might take toward dealing with this issue?

780
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:26,965
Say aye.

781
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:27,585
Aye.

782
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:28,385
Aye.

783
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:30,506
All right.

784
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:31,666
The ayes have it.

785
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:41,285
I'm happy and very willing to participate in that, Bruce.

786
00:58:42,025 --> 00:58:49,929
And I think having this particular incident fairly fresh in my mind is probably useful for that as well.

787
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:58,074
So we've got, excuse me, a very specific incident that we can point to, which is always helpful for change.

788
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:03,617
I did reach out to different city councilors and actually

789
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:14,586
the chief of police and the mayor and described to them what happened as well and heard back from some of them, not the chief of police, unfortunately.

790
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:17,748
So I think this is a good idea.

791
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:33,898
And definitely reading some of the responses that people made to my initial posts is something that I'm not alone in having experienced, unfortunately, too often in our area and something that I think keeps people off of bikes

792
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,382
Would anyone else like to join this?

793
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:41,344
I'd say maybe it's just Scott.

794
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:52,112
I'll put together, whoever's involved, I'll put together an email and see if we can, you know, put together a working group of some kind in the next several weeks.

795
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:54,613
That would be great.

796
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:55,334
Thank you, Bruce.

797
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:01,538
Is anyone on this call particularly interested in doing that?

798
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,600
I know we'd be happy to have some other voices there.

799
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:08,488
Yeah, I'm a baby.

800
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:10,289
Not sure.

801
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,612
Maybe we can talk about it while we assemble light kits.

802
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:21,933
Would that work?

803
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:23,473
Two birds with one stone?

804
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:27,955
OK, well, thank you all.

805
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:31,456
That sounds good to me.

806
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:34,597
An unacceptable behavior, and I would like to see

807
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:47,520
something done about it and not not simply because it happened to me it's happened to me before this was just a particularly egregious incident and on your own street, even though your own street is no different than any other street pitches.

808
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:56,396
Very clearly, particularly it's a very slow residential street that nobody has any business going more than about 15 miles an hour on anyway.

809
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,117
No, it's 1 of those.

810
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:00,519
You've got to pull over if there's any oncoming traffic.

811
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:07,544
Yeah, it's just, it's a. Particularly outrageous, it's not like you're on, I don't know, mystic Avenue.

812
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:13,589
Right and not that that's an excuse, but I'm just saying it's a different situation.

813
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:18,452
And it's one block long, like there's only so much you can be delayed.

814
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:19,633
Yeah, exactly.

815
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:21,093
Yeah.

816
01:01:21,173 --> 01:01:24,856
Stop sign, you know, what are you gonna do?

817
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:38,004
I have a great fear that the frequency of such incidents may tremendously increase after November 5th.

818
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,347
So I think this is a good idea, Bruce, to somehow

819
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,129
it codified what the limits of our responses should be.

820
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:53,451
Yeah, absolutely.

821
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,412
Lots of conversations that can be had there.

822
01:01:58,153 --> 01:01:58,834
Let's see.

823
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:04,536
Next on the list here, we're getting closer to the end of our agenda, which I think is fine.

824
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:06,977
Infrastructure updates.

825
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:14,200
I don't know that we really have anyone on who can speak to those in any real detail, which is unfortunate.

826
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:18,652
Another problem of the city's staffing right now.

827
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,953
Um, what's going on with South and nevermind.

828
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:29,455
Sorry, South and I was thinking South Street is going to say, I just was on South Street recently and it looks fine, but it sounds like you got it.

829
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:31,116
Yeah, sounds to me.

830
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:33,317
I don't I don't know that we have an update here.

831
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:40,752
The, no, that was, I think that was a meeting that they had, which was sort of the kickoff and getting initial feedback.

832
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:47,394
And then they're going to go stew on it and then they'll eventually come back and Leah, maybe, you know, more about it.

833
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:50,355
Because I know you're involved directly in that.

834
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:54,396
Project correct no, you are not.

835
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:54,696
Okay.

836
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:55,356
Not correct.

837
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:56,057
All right.

838
01:02:56,097 --> 01:02:56,257
Sorry.

839
01:02:58,043 --> 01:03:00,765
I thought somebody was in any event.

840
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:10,634
I believe that once they've stood on it and come back with their next plan, there'll be another similar meeting that we need to keep our ear to.

841
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:17,940
At some point, there'll be a 25 percent design meeting.

842
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,701
Yeah, typically.

843
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:23,025
That will be

844
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:25,925
It'll take a while, right?

845
01:03:26,165 --> 01:03:31,270
Like probably a year or something, at least.

846
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:37,735
But I thought, has anyone heard back of if they were going to meet with us still?

847
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:40,878
I've heard nothing.

848
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:45,922
Emily might be looking into that, or that's what the request was, and I've not heard anything.

849
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:47,683
Emily was looking into that.

850
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:51,186
Did she give an update about it last meeting?

851
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:51,787
I don't remember.

852
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:56,974
I think the last update I heard was that they said, yep, we can meet with you.

853
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:57,074
Okay.

854
01:03:58,275 --> 01:04:03,737
Um, and then Emily said, you know, what time anytimes good will conform to your schedule and then we never heard back.

855
01:04:03,977 --> 01:04:04,257
Okay.

856
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:04,657
So.

857
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,078
Sounds like we probably need to reach out again to.

858
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:08,838
Follow up.

859
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:11,919
Yeah, I can I can read what Emily sent me.

860
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,120
It was regarding the project that's happening.

861
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,201
The last I've gotten from them is we're reviewing alternatives.

862
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,821
We'll get back to you when we have more.

863
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:23,762
This was after a certain amount of pestering for meetings.

864
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:34,384
That's right, so I think I think it was me that triggered this going on the agenda.

865
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,165
Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong, but.

866
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:52,797
There's been so much brouhaha lately about these overrides in Medford, which for anyone who's moderately plugged into the political scene in Medford, which I suspect those of us on this call are more than others.

867
01:04:55,299 --> 01:05:00,222
The reason this kind of came to my mind for this meeting was in the

868
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:10,353
I'm not sure what you want to call that, bickering back and forth conversation about the fire department related override.

869
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:19,976
I saw in one of the discussions, and now I'm having a tough time citing it, which forgive me for, I'll see if I can find it later.

870
01:05:21,457 --> 01:05:32,381
There was some reference to the design of the new fire station was tied to the update on South and Main.

871
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:52,642
which makes sense because when they gave that presentation about South and Main, they talked about how they were considering various kind of rotary or roundabout configurations that they very quickly ruled out because it would require infringing on, I think, the fire department's property in a way that was problematic.

872
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:58,606
And just in some of those discussions that came up in talking about the design,

873
01:06:01,477 --> 01:06:04,478
there was an issue with that design, and they were taking that into account.

874
01:06:04,558 --> 01:06:13,220
So it sounded simply like they are looking at this issue, but I have heard nothing about it.

875
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,062
So I was hoping we could get an update, but Todd wasn't able to join us today.

876
01:06:21,363 --> 01:06:26,104
Yeah, so I'd say we should pester again, frankly, and see what we can do there.

877
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:38,874
Yeah, has anyone else noticed any other infrastructure or anything that we want to follow up with Todd about specifically?

878
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:42,035
He emailed us about another blue bike station going in.

879
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:43,875
Yep.

880
01:06:44,215 --> 01:06:44,615
Yeah, sorry.

881
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:49,656
I mentioned that when I pinned the announcements section, Leah.

882
01:06:49,777 --> 01:06:52,717
No, that was my fault for not seeing you in the waiting room there.

883
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:53,897
So apologies for that.

884
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:56,238
But it's exciting.

885
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:57,238
We were all excited.

886
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:59,099
So you missed our excitement about it, Leah.

887
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:00,159
We were excited about it.

888
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:00,913
It's great.

889
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:09,018
I'd like to at some point suggest to Todd that we get Sheroes on city hall mall.

890
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:16,502
Which right now is a bit of a. A bit of a bottleneck as you're coming through Medford square from the East.

891
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,512
You know, there's three lanes there, one which turns right and two which turn left.

892
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:28,194
And then you have people coming eastbound on Riverside that have to merge through that.

893
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:31,176
Typically, those people are going towards Malden.

894
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:35,237
So you have a lot of cross-traffic through that area.

895
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:45,522
And at a minimum, it would be good, I think, to have Sharrows there and Bicycles Meashere full lane and perhaps even a four-foot sign or something.

896
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:47,389
in those areas.

897
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,871
Is that something we could request Todd to do?

898
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:55,372
Yeah, I think so.

899
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,313
I ride that same area and I agree with you, Bruce.

900
01:07:58,353 --> 01:08:08,576
That's a tough one to figure out where you're supposed to be sometimes and people certainly, wherever you think you're supposed to be, I'm sure the drivers around you disagree.

901
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:09,276
Yeah.

902
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:15,038
I mean, if you're going straight from the right turn lane, people who are going to Malden get on your case.

903
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:31,064
If you're sticking far to the left because you want to stay left on Salem Street so you can continue south on Main Street, for example, then you get another set of people who worry about you being there and in the center, you're in the center.

904
01:08:31,664 --> 01:08:32,924
Yeah.

905
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:37,145
We've already got Sharrows on all three lanes of Salem Street.

906
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:38,345
Yeah.

907
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:44,747
That would just be bringing the other streets in Medford Square up to the same standard.

908
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:45,845
Yeah, that's true.

909
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:46,865
That would be useful.

910
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:48,626
Yeah, I like that.

911
01:08:50,046 --> 01:09:00,169
Yeah, I'm not opposed to having kind of an occasional digest of things that we happen to notice that, or maybe low effort that we could pester Todd about.

912
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:11,052
I know he's got plenty to do, but it's never a bad idea to do a little light pestering for safety's sake, right?

913
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:11,132
Yep.

914
01:09:11,632 --> 01:09:13,313
Well, on that note then,

915
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:18,078
Is there anything else that anyone has noticed that they would like to mention while we're at it?

916
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:18,538
Ernie?

917
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,900
Not about infrastructure.

918
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,021
Are you closing that as an agenda item and moving on?

919
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:27,461
No.

920
01:09:27,782 --> 01:09:33,864
No, I mean, I was going to see if anybody else had any minor infrastructure updates before thinking about moving on.

921
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:35,544
Nope.

922
01:09:35,624 --> 01:09:37,945
Anything else they wanted to talk to Todd about?

923
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:46,172
I think we got a lot of the updates regarding that done in the beginning, like, with the bikes and other.

924
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:55,062
Yeah, I was, I was thinking kind of specifically if if I was going to be reaching out to Todd about the, the shares on city hall mall, if there was.

925
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:59,827
Maybe anything else that was kind of a light lift that we wanted to ask for at the same time.

926
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:10,112
Well, I'd like to bring up continuing the work from West Medford Square to the Arlington line on High Street.

927
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:17,714
But you know, the distaste for removing parking spaces has always been the big bugaboo.

928
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:28,356
Although I realized that that is falling as a huge brick wall against these modernizations as time goes by.

929
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:33,716
But, you know, it'd be nice to see it happen in my lifetime.

930
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:37,757
You know, it's been on this desk for three years.

931
01:10:38,658 --> 01:10:55,803
But the dissolution of 40 unused parking spaces is an argument that they perhaps just don't have the bandwidth nor courage to argue.

932
01:10:57,377 --> 01:11:01,239
But it's, you know, I'd like to bring it up at least once a year.

933
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,742
Yeah, no, I mean, like, yeah, I mean, we saw we saw what happened with like Winthrop Street.

934
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:06,022
Right.

935
01:11:06,102 --> 01:11:16,847
So, you know, it's going to be an uphill battle with removal of any parking, because there's always someone who uses it occasionally.

936
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:17,928
Yeah, of course.

937
01:11:18,128 --> 01:11:19,409
But but, you know, like,

938
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:25,930
We got some of them removed on Winthrop Street, and maybe we'll get the next batch removed eventually.

939
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,592
So, you know, if we can get a few more blocks on High Street, that'll be something.

940
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,994
Yeah, it's a great discontinuity to have part of it done and then have nothing happen.

941
01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:40,318
And then all of a sudden, you've hit the rotaries and are entering Arlington.

942
01:11:41,299 --> 01:11:42,700
So anyway.

943
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:49,766
On the other end as well, to continue from the Brooks War to the Winthrop Street Rotary would be useful as well.

944
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:55,011
But the better thing would be to get that part repaved, because that's in pretty rough shape.

945
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:55,972
Right.

946
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:08,976
Well, it seems like we've got like a couple of things like one is to make some of these light asks that are easy to happen casually and hopefully don't add too much to their to their docket.

947
01:12:09,636 --> 01:12:11,597
But then there's kind of the broader question of.

948
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:15,472
What are the city's priorities right now?

949
01:12:15,652 --> 01:12:16,572
What's in the queue?

950
01:12:17,192 --> 01:12:18,752
Which is a slightly different question.

951
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:32,995
Exactly what I was going to request is that we get the list of streets that are going to be repaved and the limits of those streets this upcoming construction season.

952
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:40,957
Because we can take a look at them over the winter and see if we have any recommendations for those streets that they can do while they're repaving them.

953
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:44,069
I, I love that.

954
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,590
I like that.

955
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:52,192
I had kind of a general hand wavy thought and you were able to define it clearly and explicitly, Leah, that's perfect.

956
01:12:52,232 --> 01:12:52,412
Yeah.

957
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:53,792
Yeah.

958
01:12:54,012 --> 01:12:55,053
This is very naughty.

959
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:59,934
I'm so sorry to be down, but Medford has not put out like a.

960
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:07,295
a CIP in a bit, like a plan of how they're going to spend their money.

961
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,636
Sorry, point of information.

962
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,017
Can you define that for us?

963
01:13:11,738 --> 01:13:14,059
A capital investment plan.

964
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:14,159
Okay.

965
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,882
Says where they're going to spend their money.

966
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:30,230
I haven't seen one in a bit, and I don't necessarily like to assume that the old one is accurate or that old list of

967
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,248
Like, they had an old list of streets that they were going to repave and it went a couple of years, but.

968
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:39,331
You know, I don't necessarily know if things have changed priority or if.

969
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,493
You know, they didn't get to everything.

970
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:43,195
So stuff's been bumped back.

971
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,157
So a new list would be very helpful.

972
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:52,122
Yeah, I'm just going to add that, like, I know that Todd.

973
01:13:53,523 --> 01:13:56,946
Looks at the bicycle master plan.

974
01:13:58,012 --> 01:14:04,055
when repaving things, you know, to see if there's something they can throw in while they're doing that.

975
01:14:04,575 --> 01:14:10,117
But of course, the master plan is still, you know, sort of paused on updates.

976
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:23,523
So it would be good to get that list so that we can look at it and look at the master plan and say, is there something missing that we think should be added, you know, right away before they repave these?

977
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,524
Yeah, I think that's a that's a really good

978
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:35,157
a really good ask and frankly would give us plenty to do over the fall and winter, right?

979
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,959
So that we can be ready with some good suggestions when this stuff is shovel ready.

980
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:50,949
And Jared Todd should be reminded that the cost of doing high street is extraordinarily low, especially per linear Todd.

981
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:57,115
It's really, it's really just signage and paint is high street.

982
01:14:57,155 --> 01:15:01,799
Isn't anything that Todd has anything over any control over this mass dot.

983
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:03,480
Really?

984
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:07,352
Isn't High Street Route 60?

985
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:07,693
Yeah.

986
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:12,717
It is, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's owned by the state.

987
01:15:13,097 --> 01:15:13,878
Yeah, I thought it was.

988
01:15:13,938 --> 01:15:14,218
Okay.

989
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:16,621
Yeah, I think I could be wrong on that.

990
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:22,826
I mean, I thought that like the Brooks project was done by the state because of that.

991
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:27,630
It may have been funded by the state, but that was a safe routes to school funding.

992
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,732
So that's where the state got involved.

993
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:30,613
Okay.

994
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:32,560
Interesting.

995
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,186
Yeah, I thought High Street was owned by the state as well.

996
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:36,970
I could be wrong about that.

997
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:39,376
I'll do a little check real quick.

998
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,408
I don't remember the details.

999
01:15:41,428 --> 01:15:48,050
I feel like this, whether it was owned by it or not, I feel like there was some reason that the city had purview over the markets and things on it.

1000
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,230
So it would be good to clarify.

1001
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:59,832
I think sometimes people like use the fact that something's a state numbered route, even if they own it, to try to not make any improvements, because they're like, oh, it's.

1002
01:16:00,012 --> 01:16:00,932
Well, maybe those.

1003
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:03,773
We need to talk to MassDOT, but it would be fine.

1004
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:15,638
Maybe there's a distinction between changing infrastructure versus something as simple as signage and paint, where we have no way of knowing.

1005
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:16,898
I mean, it's fantastic.

1006
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:21,620
I mean, we've heard of stones or changing lanes, but I don't know.

1007
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,941
I mean, look, from my perspective, I would

1008
01:16:27,573 --> 01:16:36,059
be happy if the city would maintain something that they own, because it's really hard to maintain something you don't own.

1009
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:39,762
And so if they don't maintain it, nothing gets maintained.

1010
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:41,664
Yep.

1011
01:16:41,744 --> 01:16:45,787
That's why we have so many sidewalks that don't get shoveled in the winter.

1012
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:49,650
Well, let's ask for that list.

1013
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:56,495
And I don't think we have to officially convene a working group yet, but I think we can probably expect that that's kind of

1014
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:59,686
one of the things that we'll do in the next meeting or two.

1015
01:17:01,607 --> 01:17:05,028
Assuming such a list exists, which I hope it does.

1016
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:23,195
But I think that over the past couple of years, I think we've been very pleased with the extent to which the city has brought us into its decision-making process where it felt like we used to be chasing things a little bit and finding out about things a little bit too late.

1017
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:39,764
I don't want to say we're back to that situation because I think we are brought in, but I think the staffing issues at the city have made it such that it's harder for us to be as involved as we might like or even as Todd might like.

1018
01:17:40,464 --> 01:17:41,405
Yeah.

1019
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:51,467
So I'd like to officially motion that we write to Todd to ask for that list, for the list of upcoming repaving projects.

1020
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:56,087
I'll second that.

1021
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:07,270
OK, we've got a motion to request from Todd the city's repaving projects in the upcoming season.

1022
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:08,871
All in favor?

1023
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,711
Aye.

1024
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:12,472
The ayes have it.

1025
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:13,812
We'll do it.

1026
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:16,133
Does someone want to do that?

1027
01:18:16,153 --> 01:18:20,514
I'm happy to.

1028
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:21,374
Great.

1029
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:24,415
Thank you.

1030
01:18:25,556 --> 01:18:26,197
Absolutely.

1031
01:18:26,797 --> 01:18:27,878
Todd's a lovely person.

1032
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,039
Happy to address to him.

1033
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,042
We need more Todd's at the city.

1034
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:36,124
We need at least one more time.

1035
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:40,427
That is true.

1036
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:41,408
That is true.

1037
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:45,571
Leah, you had a question here in the chat.

1038
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:51,816
I think I know the answer, but I'll make sure Bruce weighs in here about

1039
01:18:52,778 --> 01:18:56,061
us weighing in as a commission on the overrides?

1040
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:01,105
So that's a good question.

1041
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:07,470
And I can only tell you what I read in the general laws.

1042
01:19:09,091 --> 01:19:19,360
And I think this is the kind of thing which if we really want to know, we should check with the city solicitor, who may or may not be as responsive as the previous city solicitor was.

1043
01:19:21,676 --> 01:19:32,619
I do recall that we were told that commissions can weigh in on items that are germane to their, what's it, where their function.

1044
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:44,562
So, you know, that could mean that, for example, the streets might be something that we'd be able to weigh in on, but it's not clear that it'd be a stretch for like the fire department one.

1045
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:47,627
And I forget the exact order of these.

1046
01:19:47,647 --> 01:19:49,868
I know there's another that has to do with schools.

1047
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:51,048
Schools, yeah.

1048
01:19:51,108 --> 01:19:56,049
Yeah, I was thinking if we weighed in on anything, it would be the one to give more funding to the DPW.

1049
01:19:56,769 --> 01:20:03,691
I think we could make an argument that that would be directly benefiting us and helping us in our mission.

1050
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:04,511
Yeah.

1051
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:12,113
The only problem is that I don't see how we're going to get a decision, a definitive decision between now and when we'd be able to do anything for the election.

1052
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:16,401
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we'd be able to in our next meeting.

1053
01:20:16,882 --> 01:20:19,584
Well, Bruce, do we even have a city solicitor?

1054
01:20:20,124 --> 01:20:20,965
I don't know.

1055
01:20:21,205 --> 01:20:22,005
I don't think we do.

1056
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:26,709
Well, the city's got to have a city solicitor in some fashion.

1057
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:29,931
This seems to be a hot topic, I think.

1058
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,973
Yeah, I thought we had one that we had asked questions.

1059
01:20:33,927 --> 01:20:36,308
To in the previously about other things.

1060
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,208
Yeah, we did.

1061
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:43,209
We used to ask directly to, and he was quite responsive about clarifying these things.

1062
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:46,690
And I don't know who the current city solicitor even is.

1063
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:51,631
At this point, I'm pretty sure it's outsourced to all right now.

1064
01:20:51,971 --> 01:20:53,572
Yeah, I thought it was.

1065
01:20:53,612 --> 01:20:58,653
Yeah, I think we've got an outside council serving in that in that role.

1066
01:20:58,673 --> 01:21:03,614
So, I'm going to have to reach out to the mayor's office to get access to that.

1067
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:09,207
Yeah, so this is like an interesting question too, because there's that question of like, what are we legally allowed to do?

1068
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:14,112
And then there's also the idea that we're a city commission that exists at the pleasure of the mayor.

1069
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:21,941
So it seems like if the mayor is for it, then it is probably within our purview to be for it as well.

1070
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:23,002
Right?

1071
01:21:23,082 --> 01:21:25,825
If it's related to our function and in line with the mayor's.

1072
01:21:26,697 --> 01:21:34,160
Thoughts if, if we were to disagree with the mayor's push on that particular thing, that could get, that could get touchy, but it's a very good point.

1073
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:47,045
If you do, if you, if we do agree with the mayor and it is within our purview, then logically it seems separately from legally, logically, it seems like it would probably be okay for us to, to advocate for it.

1074
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:51,506
Um, so I'm not sure how we get that answer.

1075
01:21:51,546 --> 01:21:52,647
Just a question of the mayor.

1076
01:21:53,477 --> 01:21:55,818
Is that I guess that's where you would start, right?

1077
01:21:56,358 --> 01:21:56,678
Yeah.

1078
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,620
That's what I see, too.

1079
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:06,803
I mean, ask her if she wants more mass in the foundation of the support she needs for this.

1080
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:21,870
This didn't come up on the school committee this week, and the mayor had to recuse herself from endorsing one of the questions, but the school committee did issue a

1081
01:22:24,327 --> 01:22:27,070
Proclamation in support of it today.

1082
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:30,974
Yeah, that would be within their purview for sure.

1083
01:22:30,994 --> 01:22:34,978
They're elected not a body of the city.

1084
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,583
Well, they are, but in a different way than we are.

1085
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:43,334
I think we should try to get a clarification from the mayor.

1086
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:46,215
And if she needs to talk to the council, that'd be good.

1087
01:22:47,636 --> 01:22:54,879
If she recused herself at the school committee meeting, it might be because she thought there was a conflict of interest for herself.

1088
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,220
I don't know.

1089
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,801
Why don't we just get it resolved somehow?

1090
01:23:01,502 --> 01:23:03,523
Yeah, I'll reach out to the mayor.

1091
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,604
Sorry, B-10, does this have a...

1092
01:23:08,577 --> 01:23:09,178
A city solicitor.

1093
01:23:09,258 --> 01:23:10,879
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

1094
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:11,379
Okay.

1095
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:14,362
City solicitor and public records access officer is vacant.

1096
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:22,068
There is staff who is Janice Spencer, the office manager and confidential secretary.

1097
01:23:23,209 --> 01:23:36,540
So I'm not quite clear there, but it's possible that she would have the information on who to talk to in the absence of.

1098
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:38,709
a current solicitor.

1099
01:23:39,589 --> 01:23:40,790
Yeah, we've got a couple of people.

1100
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:47,273
I'll reach out to the mayor and someone at the department there and see if we can't get that answered.

1101
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:59,020
But if we can get it answered, let's assume for the moment that we are allowed to advocate one way or the other for something that is directly related to us.

1102
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:03,883
I mean, maybe we should wait because this is also a public meeting.

1103
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:08,285
not allowed to weigh in on it.

1104
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:09,465
They might not want to.

1105
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:10,385
You are.

1106
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:11,006
Indeed.

1107
01:24:11,486 --> 01:24:12,266
You are right.

1108
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:13,286
OK.

1109
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:14,907
Oh, boy.

1110
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:21,528
So do we put this down as a motion to request clarification from the mayor's office?

1111
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:24,249
That sounds right to me.

1112
01:24:24,269 --> 01:24:26,610
I think so, too.

1113
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:30,171
In terms of timing, though, the election is early November.

1114
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:33,352
If we can't get a decision until

1115
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:43,924
you know, our next, until before our next meeting, say we can, then we're looking at the end of October before we would even be in a position to weigh in about it.

1116
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:52,288
We could call a special meeting if need be to specifically vote on which, if any of the proposals we support.

1117
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:53,309
Okay.

1118
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:54,570
Great, great point, Bruce.

1119
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,170
I like that.

1120
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,610
Right.

1121
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,971
That sounds like a good plan then.

1122
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:57,911
All right.

1123
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:01,594
So I'll, did someone want to make a motion that we reach out to them?

1124
01:25:01,814 --> 01:25:02,254
So moved.

1125
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:04,667
Okay.

1126
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:05,908
Seconded.

1127
01:25:06,788 --> 01:25:07,108
All right.

1128
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:07,848
All in favor.

1129
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:08,628
Aye.

1130
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:09,068
Aye.

1131
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:09,789
Aye.

1132
01:25:10,509 --> 01:25:10,889
All right.

1133
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:14,610
We're just adding things to my plate left and right here, aren't we?

1134
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:15,570
All right.

1135
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:18,351
No problem.

1136
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:19,351
These are important ones.

1137
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,131
Happy to do it.

1138
01:25:22,252 --> 01:25:22,492
Okay.

1139
01:25:22,632 --> 01:25:23,332
I'll reach out to the mayor.

1140
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:27,093
Let's see.

1141
01:25:27,213 --> 01:25:31,255
I don't think we have anything else on infrastructure.

1142
01:25:31,475 --> 01:25:32,855
Ernie, I think you had.

1143
01:25:34,694 --> 01:26:01,611
uh you wanted to add uh yeah just yeah just to say that uh this past week i stocked the schools of uh i think 157 bike light kits the five schools uh 10 for chief buckley i don't know what he ever does with them he's supposed to throw them in the cruisers and uh west medford uh

1144
01:26:03,327 --> 01:26:04,208
center as well.

1145
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:10,234
And I guess I'll pack up some more for our October 19th event.

1146
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:12,016
I hadn't thought of that.

1147
01:26:13,157 --> 01:26:16,541
And by digging into next year's supply.

1148
01:26:17,782 --> 01:26:19,203
So and that's just fine.

1149
01:26:19,544 --> 01:26:25,650
There is any other need for bike light kits this fall, then certainly let me know.

1150
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:33,504
I had a question about this, like, I passed someone just, you know, in my building.

1151
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:42,709
Who was, you know, going out for a bike ride with her bike and she didn't seem to have a light on it and it was kind of dark out already.

1152
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:43,510
And I was wondering is.

1153
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:49,954
Is that something where, like, it would be useful for other members of the commission to just.

1154
01:26:51,054 --> 01:26:53,916
carry one or two around with us for when we bike?

1155
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:58,479
That has been suggested over the years, I hope.

1156
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:07,145
And at the beginning, I think I even distributed to members front porches a box each of six or 10 lights.

1157
01:27:07,846 --> 01:27:11,368
And I don't think too many people took it upon themselves.

1158
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:17,773
I think it's a good idea when you're out on a bike to carry one or two, and especially if you run into a

1159
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:24,176
a child who is unlit.

1160
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:31,179
You know, you can strap it on them, talk to them about it, show them the booklet, etc.

1161
01:27:32,432 --> 01:27:48,380
I'd be happy to, to, you know, take a couple from you at the harvest your energy festival and do the transfer that way, since I do not have a front porch, especially as we get into the fall and the, you know, kind of the commute home is in the dark.

1162
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:55,623
I'm happy to carry really leave 10 or 20 in my front hall for

1163
01:27:56,133 --> 01:28:00,796
anyone to pick up, but that hasn't really happened over the year.

1164
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:10,143
But I can continue to do that so that you can see my front closed foyer as a little warehouse to pick them up as needed.

1165
01:28:10,863 --> 01:28:13,425
Oh, um, yeah, I don't really know where your house is.

1166
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:20,870
But if we're both going to be at the harvest your energy festival, I think it would be easier to take what's left over.

1167
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,331
It's recommended anyway.

1168
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:22,752
Sounds good.

1169
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:23,412
Yep.

1170
01:28:26,865 --> 01:28:28,886
Um, that is great.

1171
01:28:29,006 --> 01:28:30,326
Thank you all so much.

1172
01:28:30,386 --> 01:28:32,427
And Ernie, thank you for, thank you for doing that.

1173
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:43,551
That's, uh, I know you put a lot of time and effort into getting the finances together to do that and the effort and putting the kits together and distributing them.

1174
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:49,573
And I know how much time that takes and it's kind of invisible labor maybe at times, but, but we appreciate it.

1175
01:28:50,473 --> 01:28:50,773
Thanks.

1176
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:52,834
My pleasure.

1177
01:28:54,674 --> 01:28:55,935
Um, one.

1178
01:28:57,155 --> 01:28:58,175
You all reminded me of something.

1179
01:28:58,395 --> 01:29:03,037
Um, my, I have a, I have a kid in the public school system now, which I'm very excited about.

1180
01:29:03,457 --> 01:29:08,699
And I will be, I signed up to volunteer with their.

1181
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:20,443
Sorry for the, the name is escaping the, the walk and roll bike to school thing that they, that we do, um, every once in a while leading kind of convoys or whatever.

1182
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:23,034
those have not been planned yet.

1183
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:34,084
And I don't know if there's anybody else at the Misitech school where my child is who plans those or if by volunteering to be involved that now is me who's planning them.

1184
01:29:34,104 --> 01:29:34,945
I'm not really sure.

1185
01:29:35,986 --> 01:29:42,091
But I'll just something to know that now we've got an in in that school in terms of

1186
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:47,678
uh, biking and whatnot, which I know you, you brought up before Ernie has not really having that person.

1187
01:29:47,738 --> 01:29:58,264
So I can, I can do my best to, to plug us into that school and I'll publicize and let us know about any walk and bike to school events that are, that are coming up in case others are interested in helping out with that.

1188
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:06,789
Well, I think that's everything that was on our agenda.

1189
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,810
Is there anything else anyone would like to chat about?

1190
01:30:13,095 --> 01:30:13,876
We would do adjourn.

1191
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,001
Seconded.

1192
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,443
All right.

1193
01:30:19,224 --> 01:30:19,945
All in favor?

1194
01:30:19,965 --> 01:30:21,066
Aye.

1195
01:30:21,126 --> 01:30:21,226
Aye.

1196
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:22,568
Aye.

1197
01:30:22,809 --> 01:30:24,111
Well, thank you all very much.

1198
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,392
We'll see you at some events.

1199
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:27,836
And keep doing the good work.
