1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:06,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can call the September Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting to order.

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:07,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for joining.

3
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:22,302
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned, Emily O'Brien, our chair, is out tonight, so she asked me to lead the meeting as vice chair, so I will gladly do that.

4
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:27,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have to step away momentarily later to help with

5
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,885
[SPEAKER_11]: putting kids to bed, but I'll be here as much as I can.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,006
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got Daniel on who can step in in any interim.

7
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:44,129
[SPEAKER_11]: So Daniel, would you mind calling the roll and giving us a, we'll see if we can figure out about Orem as well.

8
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,450
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so thanks.

[SPEAKER_08]: Leah Godsey.

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I also don't see.

29
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Rebecca Wright.

30
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I also don't see.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, one second.

32
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:58,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

33
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:02,818
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of 12, which is that correct?

34
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:02,818
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I counted 11.

36
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, 11.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,100
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quorum then.

38
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:10,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:28,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, you're right.

40
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:29,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Terrific.

41
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:29,678
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

42
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:30,198
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

43
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:30,798
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one.

44
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Just by the skin of our teeth.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

46
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:41,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, we have someone else on who I can put in as a guest if you'd like to introduce yourself, Sarah.

47
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Sarah.

48
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.

49
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a biker in Medford and

50
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, what would you like to know about me?

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about hearing more about what you guys are all up to and being part of things.

52
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of biking recreationally, mountain biking and road biking, and I bike with my kids on cargo bike.

53
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I commute every day with them.

54
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:19,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And really hoping to see the Clippership Connector work continue and be part of that.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one of my sons.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,101
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.

57
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mute myself, but I'll be listening in the background here.

58
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:29,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having the meeting open.

59
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for joining us.

60
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

61
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for joining.

62
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,997
[SPEAKER_11]: You look like someone who rides like a long tail bike.

63
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I could imagine like a lime green long tail.

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the kind of bike you ride?

65
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,042
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

66
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: We just upgraded, though.

67
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a black.

68
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a spicy green now.

69
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,287
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you call profiling, Jared.

70
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:57,491
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm, we, we've met before at like the Medford farmers market.

71
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't forget it.

72
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:01,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

73
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, I don't forget an unusual cargo bike.

74
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,115
[SPEAKER_11]: They, they stand out.

75
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:11,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say, this is just a cargo bike, uh, social.

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for joining.

77
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

78
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:20,345
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

79
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what it was.

80
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:22,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone else on that's everybody.

81
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:23,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

82
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,555
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, announcements.

83
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,017
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we have?

84
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:32,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody have any announcements?

85
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do, actually.

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came off a meeting that started at 6 o'clock, hosted by Somerville for the Elm Beacon Street Connector, and they're basically kicking off the project to make improvements

88
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:56,493
[SPEAKER_01]: In the quarter that I think many of us use, or at least people who go from Medford from Western Medford to.

89
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Kendall square or downtown frequently go through that that intersection.

90
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:05,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Of moss land, Somerville Avenue, beacon street.

91
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it'll be interesting to see what they have and I have put into the chat.

92
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:16,184
[SPEAKER_01]: A, a link, which is on the Somerville website to get more information and to get the.

93
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:24,170
[SPEAKER_01]: The reporting of the current session that's still actually going on, I had to leave at 7 to join this meeting.

94
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:30,515
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm looking forward to see what facilities they have in mind, a quick build, that sort of thing.

95
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to alert everybody to that.

96
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:35,699
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

97
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:36,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Bruce.

98
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other announcements that folks might have?

99
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:54,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, not an announcement, but, um, there are a couple of orders of business, uh, approval of previous minutes that we should take care of.

100
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

101
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:55,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

102
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have done those first actually, I guess.

103
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:00,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed that in the bullet.

104
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a outstanding question.

105
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Did, um, I know I had to step out unexpectedly in the last meeting.

106
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone take a copy of the minutes from that meeting?

107
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Does any, can anyone fill me in on that?

108
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that I have some notes.

109
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,231
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not in front of me.

110
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:23,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to hold on approving those while we compile them.

111
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:26,053
[SPEAKER_11]: But sorry about that.

112
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do have some for you, though.

113
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:28,253
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

114
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:30,674
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

115
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:31,114
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

116
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:34,735
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, I think we only need to approve the June 26.

117
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we not do that last time?

118
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know, actually.

119
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Were those minutes approved?

120
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:45,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

121
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:46,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

122
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:46,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

123
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:46,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

124
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:47,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

125
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Just needed to clear up that.

126
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,547
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

127
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in that case, we don't have minutes to approve right now.

128
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't all right.

129
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:56,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Job too much.

130
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:59,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Daniel.

131
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

132
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we do a recap of the EV showcase from last?

133
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we finishing announcements?

134
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's kind of an announcement, I guess.

135
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Halfway between an announcement and an event.

137
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can put it with the events.

138
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,562
[SPEAKER_11]: That's up next anyway.

139
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:25,145
[SPEAKER_11]: The only other announcement that I think I had was Todd sending around, well, two things maybe.

140
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:37,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd sent around that photo to the bike commission that was showing a new blue bike station going in at the Rotary

141
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Winthrop and High Street.

142
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,982
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's very exciting.

143
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:43,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you all see that?

144
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the email.

145
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see the photo.

146
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:53,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't seen the station, but I'm pleased to see that they're popping up literally all over the place.

147
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:58,710
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really great that Mets has finally gotten really mainstream with blue bikes.

148
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:01,992
[SPEAKER_06]: The more density of stations we get, the better.

149
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:02,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Better, yeah.

150
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:11,958
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer rejected that email I found out this afternoon, and then I forgot to go back, so it stayed rejected.

151
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

152
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:19,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was just the station going in right at the corner.

153
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:23,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure which corner it was, like northwest maybe?

154
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:27,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that right, or was I misreading that location?

155
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,434
[SPEAKER_01]: The northeast side has probably the most space.

156
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to the others, which are just sidewalk, just speculating.

157
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, probably so.

158
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:39,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's very exciting.

159
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:43,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I feel like I've been seeing a lot of them around lately, which is great.

160
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,174
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, let's see.

161
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:58,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and one other thing was Todd Blake also alerted me that they installed bike lanes on

162
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Rove Street, I want to say about a week and a half ago.

163
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I've actually used them.

164
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:10,093
[SPEAKER_01]: They're north of where I live, just north of the railroad bridge.

165
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go all the way to the Winchester Line.

166
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:16,180
[SPEAKER_00]: At which point, I was wondering if

167
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:26,904
[SPEAKER_00]: there was any continuity on the Winchester side, and there's absolutely nothing.

168
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:40,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, we should at least take the initiative to paint a nice big sharrow in the middle 20 feet ahead of the line to show that you must... That's actually done, Ernie.

169
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:49,550
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two places where sharrows have been put just before the bridge so that you see a sharrow as you cross the bridge.

170
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but not at the Winchester line.

171
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:54,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove it a few hours ago.

172
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:55,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

173
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I could have sworn.

174
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw one there.

175
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:09,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm our well, we have sharrows or something near the in the bike lane itself, but it abruptly ends with no indication that you have to, you know,

176
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:22,240
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up a bit, because the shoulder white stripe marking also drops to maybe a foot and a half or two feet wide, certainly not a bike lane.

177
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:29,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not mentioning this more than tongue in cheek, but it'd be kind of nice if we would rub it in their face.

178
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,993
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, and as a safety consideration, one bicyclist that they no longer have a bike lane.

179
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sit right up there and check, because I could have sworn I saw it there as well.

180
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Not northbound.

181
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:45,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Not northbound?

182
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:45,623
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

183
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,323
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

184
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there wouldn't be one southbound.

185
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,586
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it wouldn't be southbound.

186
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:51,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

187
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm conflating what I saw at the bridge.

188
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:54,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

189
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:55,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

190
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:02,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad that those are going in.

191
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:03,995
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Remy.

192
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:07,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have some other notes that I jotted down for announcements that I forgot to compile.

193
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, the Grove Street bike lanes, also the speed tables.

194
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you all have seen some of those go in around town, but I think they've been put in quite a few spots.

195
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:20,476
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two on George Street and I think a few others going in.

196
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:21,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say Lawrence, maybe.

197
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Lawrence has.

198
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:26,120
[SPEAKER_01]: They've become so ubiquitous, I've lost count.

199
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:33,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the ripped up pavement on George Street before I moved, but didn't see the actual tables being put in.

200
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they have been part of the river street as well.

201
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:40,985
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter part there.

202
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:42,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

203
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:45,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was.

204
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:59,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure how they were going to be received like I live just off of George Street so I get to see them there's a, there's a large elementary school bus stop there that picks up in the morning so it's a pretty good spot to have people slowing down so the, the

205
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:03,776
[SPEAKER_11]: speed tables kind of bookend that stop.

206
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:06,818
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not right at the stop, but they bookend it a bit.

207
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,186
[SPEAKER_11]: People did not notice them at first and just continued over them as if they weren't there, and you didn't see any brake lights going over them.

208
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:20,729
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that they've been striped, I definitely have seen people slow down a bit more.

209
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:26,794
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not the really aggressive speed humps like you might see, obviously, on Powder House Boulevard and Somerville, so they don't

210
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:33,372
[SPEAKER_11]: have that kind of bucking bronco quality to them, as much as I kind of wish they would.

211
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,874
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're welcome, at least.

212
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,135
[SPEAKER_11]: They're taller than they could be.

213
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll take that as the win.

214
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:44,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's some on South Street, too.

215
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say there might be one on South Street.

216
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:51,967
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in Somerville are not rationally linked to the speed limit.

217
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:02,586
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones you're talking about result in bottoming out of many cars at anything over 10 miles an hour.

218
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a 20 to 25 mile an hour speed limit.

219
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:14,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who is not frequently going through there can be rudely

220
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,266
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupted while trying to drive.

221
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a safety issue, I think.

222
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:24,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they should lower the speed limit to 10 miles an hour, it's true.

223
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

224
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:34,653
[SPEAKER_11]: The speed limit is, or the signs do have a 10 mile an hour sign on them, on those speed humps.

225
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:37,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's appropriate then.

226
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they do.

227
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,295
[SPEAKER_11]: I ride by them every day.

228
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:45,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they have a, I don't know if they all do, but at least some of them say, say, 10 miles an hour.

229
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think there's like, um, at least the 1 on Grove street is comfortable at 25 miles an hour, which is the speed limit.

230
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yes, no problem there.

231
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I see your I see your hand there.

232
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:57,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Leah.

233
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:03,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, I also sorry I got in late, but I also just wanted to point out that, like, it's kind of.

234
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:13,688
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of hard to strike a balance sometimes because of the different size of cars and trucks.

235
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:24,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Your little car might bottom out because the car part is closer to the ground, but a big truck can zoom right over it still.

236
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:25,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

237
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:39,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we want the, if we want the trucks to slow down to 20 miles an hour, that means that some of those more cars might have to slow down to 10, but like, we can't slow down the trucks as much, you know, as we slow down the cars, the speed jumps.

238
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

239
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:53,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I recall Todd kind of talking us through some of the distinctions between like the different levels of speed devices like that, like the speed bumps or humps, whichever one it is, where the ones that were.

240
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:58,430
[SPEAKER_11]: very aggressive, and short, and very quick, and really jarring.

241
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,013
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they can kind of go to the more gentle speed table type thing.

242
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're designed to bring you down to different speeds.

243
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Some are designed to bring you down to 10.

244
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Some are just designed to bring you down to the speed limit.

245
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:17,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the speed tables they put in are designed to specifically bring you down to the speed limit and not below that.

246
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,423
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's what they've put in.

247
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:26,012
[SPEAKER_11]: But I appreciate the traffic calming around.

248
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:36,616
[SPEAKER_11]: In my experience, it seems like unless there's a threat of damage to the car, there seems to be very little else that actually gets people to slow down, frankly.

249
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:38,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Lee, I see you again.

250
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:48,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sorry 1 more thing about, like, speed and traffic calming is that they're not allowed to post a lower speed limit.

251
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Until those sorts of, like, traffic calming.

252
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Measures go in and you can actually observe cars going.

253
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,431
[SPEAKER_12]: At a lower speed, it's.

254
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:05,633
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like it might be chicken or egg, but in traffic engineering, it's it's pretty.

255
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:20,216
[SPEAKER_12]: cut and dry a lot of the time that you have to have a speech study that shows, um, the, you know, that, that people are going to listen to the lower speed limit signs before you actually put them in.

256
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:25,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise you just end up pulling everyone over, which is impossible.

257
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:29,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think they have to do it this way.

258
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:32,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

259
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad they're doing it.

260
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, you can't have police at every intersection.

261
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:45,309
[SPEAKER_11]: So it seems like it's a wise idea to try to install mechanisms that do more to slow vehicles down.

262
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:55,998
[SPEAKER_00]: On that point, without getting too far afield here in the announcements area, what about pinch points that

263
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:09,201
[SPEAKER_00]: are really dangerous for bicyclists who are going along near the shoulder, and all of a sudden there's perhaps a crosswalk, or for some other reason, the curb juts out in front of you.

264
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:16,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a speed bump, it's a six-inch tall piece of granite

265
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:25,336
[SPEAKER_00]: that will clearly destroy you unless you veer quickly to the left and perhaps get eaten by a car.

266
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:43,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the only ones I know about of those are on, like, the Fellsway, where if you stick to the left side of the bike lane, you don't have to veer at all because the bike lane jogs half a width to account for the bump out.

267
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Not true on High Street, if I recall.

268
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:58,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one at Woburn Street narrows down to maybe 10 or 11 feet worth of distance, so you're sharing the lane, which of course is not comfortable for some people.

269
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:06,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's probably a bit downhill too, so you're not apt to be slowing for it.

270
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:08,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe that's something.

271
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:14,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but that also means that you're typically running at about the same speed as traffic, so it's easier to manage.

272
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:24,361
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go 30 down there, and if you're going 18 on a bike, no, you're not going to win that one.

273
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:30,865
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but frequently you'll hit 25 or 30 by the time you've hit that point.

274
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Your point's well taken.

275
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:39,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that needs to be... At best, I think...

276
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:47,704
[SPEAKER_00]: A pinch point like that should have maybe a three foot ramp of tar going up to the level.

277
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:55,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a jolting reminder that, oh, yes, you're about to, you know, cross a crosswalk.

278
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,047
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be safe if you're careful.

279
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:04,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And oftentimes, like like in Somerville on College Ave, they have one of those where the

280
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,977
[SPEAKER_06]: the bike lane just continues up over solid crosswalk.

281
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:13,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bus stop.

282
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:14,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

283
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:19,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we should, we should, yeah, this thing we should bring up with Todd.

284
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously this is a, wait, that's, that's mass stop, right?

285
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:26,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi on high street.

286
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:28,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

287
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:28,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

288
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:28,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sure.

289
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:29,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

290
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was thinking that might be something that we can talk to Todd.

291
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:36,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for that to be a problem in the rain, in the winter, you know,

292
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:40,743
[SPEAKER_00]: when someone just slams into that, not seeing the curb itself.

293
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Not seeing the pedestrian and therefore not seeing the curb.

294
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that's one possibility.

295
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:56,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm honestly, in those situations, I'd be more worried about attempting to merge and, you know, merging into traffic.

296
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you know you need to merge.

297
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying the granite isn't easily seen.

298
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,773
[SPEAKER_00]: The curb cut out.

299
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:15,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll add this to the list of things that we need to kind of bring up with Todd and that we could probably solve with the addition of a traffic engineer that could be.

300
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:20,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, we still have to get some of these things get mass dot to do something about it.

301
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're the 1 to control that road.

302
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:31,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, 1, 1 other announcement just something to think about.

303
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, was it today or yesterday?

304
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:39,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday maybe that a cyclist was killed in Cambridge.

305
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was Monday, I believe.

306
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:40,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Monday.

307
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:41,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Monday?

308
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:42,188
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

309
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry, I don't have the article in front of me right now.

310
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:52,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anyone who is generally aware want to fill us in just quickly on what happened?

311
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, that was the one.

312
00:20:54,437 --> 00:21:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, it was on MemDrive, and the driver of an SUV went off the road.

313
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:27,130
[SPEAKER_06]: and struck the cyclist on the bike path, which is kind of like, it's good to remember that even fully separated cycle tracks don't help when there's no controls on what cars are doing.

314
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also, as I say, there's a critical mass

315
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:43,184
[SPEAKER_06]: protest ride on Friday, starting from Copley Square at, well, meet at 5.30, roll at 6 p.m.

316
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:53,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it should be noted that it was a head-on collision, so the forces were very high.

317
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:54,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

318
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,595
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why there was a fatality.

319
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I mean, like, but like, honestly, like, you know,

320
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:10,399
[SPEAKER_06]: if they'd been stopped, you know, against an SUV, doesn't make much of a difference.

321
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:18,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the trauma is a function of the energy expended, which is the square root of the speed.

322
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:26,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's partly true, but it's also that SUVs... How do you finish my sentence?

323
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:41,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And like SUVs, it's not just about the kinetic energy, it's about how they hit people and how they hit people as they run them over because they strike directly on the body.

324
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:45,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Their center of mass is so high that they run them over.

325
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter whether it's head on or tailing.

326
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,015
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get run over, the kinetic energy doesn't matter nearly as much because it's just the weight.

327
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can agree that, yeah.

328
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:05,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any actions we need to take as a body?

329
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:12,357
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's why this is an announcement, because, like, the only announcement is the protest ride.

330
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:17,680
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, MemDrive isn't in Medford.

331
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly have similar places.

332
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:26,325
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, something we should keep in mind when we're asking DCR to do things.

333
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,110
[SPEAKER_06]: and put in safety.

334
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a sense of what caused the motor vehicle to lose control?

335
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:36,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say.

336
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:39,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't hear anything about that either.

337
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:43,862
[SPEAKER_12]: They ran.

338
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,324
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a hit and run.

339
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,184
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't stay.

340
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:50,608
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's, I think, part of why we don't know.

341
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,229
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just wanted to point out that.

342
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And the car was speeding.

343
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:53,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

344
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:54,672
[SPEAKER_12]: The car was speeding.

345
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:03,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Right there's also a road diet project that kind of hasn't gone anywhere for a while and road diets are.

346
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Can be effective and reducing.

347
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:14,913
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, operating speed, because cars don't have an extra lane to pass someone who they think is going too slow for them.

348
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to go behind that person.

349
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:20,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thanks.

350
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:20,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

351
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I think my, my takeaway here is that.

352
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,714
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a useful announcement for us as a body, because it kind of contextualizes the work that we do.

353
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:47,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a reminder that what we're doing is not just, you know, well, while sometimes we can just talk in a fairly academic way and bicker about things that a lot of people don't really care about, there are like real implications to road design and the types of conversations that we're having.

354
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:53,588
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a good reminder of why we're here and the effort with which we should be putting toward our

355
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:59,452
[SPEAKER_11]: our advocacy work, like lives are lost when this sort of stuff doesn't get improved.

356
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:04,116
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a good reminder of why we're doing this and to take it seriously.

357
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:14,545
[SPEAKER_11]: On that cheery note, last thing, I know the traffic commission was looking for additional members.

358
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:18,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Did anyone on here throw their hat in the ring for that?

359
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:22,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I don't think I heard any chatter that anyone was,

360
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:28,496
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good way to change things if you're interested in it and have the time for it on Tuesday afternoons.

361
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:34,377
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

362
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had the time.

363
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:36,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

364
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:36,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

365
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:37,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, too.

366
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,138
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

367
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:40,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Events.

368
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:42,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

369
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:43,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other announcements?

370
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Leah thought about it but don't have time.

371
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

372
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,500
[SPEAKER_11]: We would love to have you on there, Leah, if you do have time.

373
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,029
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's see, events.

374
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,774
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a couple on the list here, though I'm not sure that these are all distinct.

375
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:04,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

376
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:10,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I can speak to two as a reminder, just things that they have.

377
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Family Bike Ride is having an event October 6th.

378
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,183
[SPEAKER_11]: That's to the zoo.

379
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,185
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going from Cambridge to Franklin Park Zoo, which is fun.

380
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's always a good, I know that there are Medford folks who join those.

381
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:30,213
[SPEAKER_11]: those rides, so it's nice for us to promote them as well, because I know people do attend those.

382
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:33,434
[SPEAKER_11]: We can promote those on social media.

383
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:45,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So October 6, 9 AM, riding from MIT to the Franklin Park Zoo, I think to show off some infrastructure down there that we may not be aware of on the south side of the river in all cases.

384
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:47,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one.

385
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:55,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Jumping to the third on the list, but just because it's related and I'm already talking, uh, the Halloween bike ride, which I mentioned before Sunday, October 20th, 9 30 AM.

386
00:26:55,993 --> 00:27:16,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, meeting at assembly row and writing up through Medford and, and going to mystic riverbend park and ending at the playground there for, uh, where kids can play and have candy and all that fun stuff and get to enjoy some of the paths along the mystic river.

387
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:17,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

388
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one that I will plan to attend.

389
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like others to attend as well.

390
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we brought this up on a previous call.

391
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:29,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was the previous call, if I'm not mistaken.

392
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:33,994
[SPEAKER_11]: So folks had some questions about helmets and whatnot.

393
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:42,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And helmets are, I did follow up with Paul Morgan, who runs these events as part of the nonprofit that he works with, Family Bike Ride.

394
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do require helmets.

395
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:54,064
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been added to the public materials, maybe not all of them, but at least some of the ones that I've seen that's been added to them.

396
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:06,770
[SPEAKER_11]: He also went back, because there was a question of, to what extent is this a concern, right, that kids are riding around helmetless in these parades, which really can be thought of as parades.

397
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,631
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's riding at 20 miles an hour on these things.

398
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:22,767
[SPEAKER_11]: he actually went back and watched the footage that he had that people recorded with GoPros and things filing past that like some of their, the marshals had at various posts.

399
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:28,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was, there was no helmetless writing on the on the last one.

400
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:35,777
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we can feel good about that and know that we are not promoting reckless endangerment.

401
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:40,340
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of us asking about that, like I said, he did add

402
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,413
[SPEAKER_11]: that language specifically to the materials about it, that helmets are required.

403
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:47,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So I strongly think we should support it.

404
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:55,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, I'm going to reach out to some of the elected officials and see if we can get some of them to be marshals and give a speech or something.

405
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,601
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor's expressed that she was interested.

406
00:28:56,621 --> 00:29:08,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, would anyone else on here like to be a Marshall or something like that to kind of funnel kids along past obstacles or, or challenging intersections or anything like that?

407
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,750
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, when is that again?

408
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,619
[SPEAKER_11]: It's October 20th, Sunday, 930 AM.

409
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:23,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they are looking for some people to serve in that kind of role to help people navigate around turns and stuff like that, or cross intersections, that sort of thing.

410
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do we contact about that?

411
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:37,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I can circulate contact information, but it's Paul Morgan who runs the community pedal power

412
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:44,301
[SPEAKER_11]: nonprofit that operates these family bike rides.

413
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would consider serving as a marshal for that.

414
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:49,526
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be great.

415
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Bruce.

416
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone else attended any of those events before?

417
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:03,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I went to a previous Halloween one.

418
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:05,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Thought it was super fun.

419
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great.

420
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:11,005
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to think of a costume that works, uh, for your bike.

421
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I was a lack of tube from, from Mario cart.

422
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,811
[SPEAKER_12]: And I put a cloud on my bike.

423
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:23,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I went last year with our, with our family and it was very, very, very fun.

424
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,723
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good costume.

425
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,464
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really, there were a lot of people.

426
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fun.

427
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I went to the one I went to the one last year, too.

428
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:38,939
[SPEAKER_11]: It was it was a lot of people and a very slow bike ride.

429
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was, you know, only going a couple miles.

430
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I think it was to Belmont last year.

431
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:48,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And a playground at Belmont, you know, and it was it was great.

432
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:49,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Hundreds of people easily.

433
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:54,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how many hundreds, but hundreds for sure.

434
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,284
[SPEAKER_11]: A big group and a lot of fun.

435
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:59,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they did kind of trick or treating and

436
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,978
[SPEAKER_11]: people showing off their costumes.

437
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:17,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I've mentioned this before, but just for the sake of anybody who might have forgotten, one of the reasons that Paul runs these is that he's looking, obviously, to get more people out on bikes and riding with their families and normalizing biking through our area.

438
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:23,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also the component of it that is designed to show people

439
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,424
[SPEAKER_11]: infrastructure, new-ish infrastructure, or lesser-known infrastructure that people might not know about, right?

440
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:39,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there's a lot of paths in our area along the Mystic River and Malden River and Alewife Brook and any number of other places where people just may not really realize.

441
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody thinks, like, oh, the Minuteman.

442
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's where everybody rides bikes.

443
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,616
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's really not true, and there's some lovely paths in our area.

444
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:53,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one is designed specifically to show, I think, there's another one that he has planned that he's talked to us about before that

445
00:31:54,793 --> 00:32:00,417
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe for next year or year after or something like that, depending on when the Clippership Connector is open.

446
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:04,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there will be another ride in the future that shows that off as well.

447
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,722
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, it's showing off kind of the path that exists.

448
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:11,184
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the first one that will come into Medford.

449
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,506
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're pretty excited about it.

450
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:19,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there was talk of people peeling off and going to the Great American Beer Hall afterward.

451
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm not sure if that is formalized as a part of these announcement materials or not.

452
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:27,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you, Bruce.

453
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:28,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be there as well.

454
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got to check my calendar.

455
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:40,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remembered that we have a wedding one of these October weekends, and I need to confirm exactly when that is.

456
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,662
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll look into it nonetheless.

457
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:43,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

458
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:44,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

459
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone else?

460
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:46,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fun time.

461
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:51,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Ernie, Dan, Noah, Leah.

462
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody?

463
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:54,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, I'm...

464
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,325
[SPEAKER_07]: out of town for the next month.

465
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I won't be able to.

466
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:07,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I fear I might be out of town as well and may show up spontaneously.

467
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we be announcing the event the day before as well?

468
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:16,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm free.

469
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Wedding is not that way.

470
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:19,694
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I have here?

471
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest Energy, that's Saturday the 19th.

472
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:27,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was, that was next on, on my list.

473
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:32,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize that it was, uh, I hadn't put two and two together to see that that was the day before.

474
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:33,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.

475
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:36,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

476
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,846
[SPEAKER_11]: We plan to go to that one.

477
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:40,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Bruce, is that one that you can attend?

478
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:41,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that's one that you've always had.

479
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:41,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

480
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,169
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I'm free as well.

481
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

482
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I always enjoy going to that one.

483
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:48,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

484
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:50,455
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it Saturday?

485
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,236
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is it morning or afternoon?

486
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Harvest your energies noon to three.

487
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,716
[SPEAKER_11]: 1, 2, 3, I think, I think, let's see.

488
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:03,537
[SPEAKER_11]: When is Indigenous Peoples Day?

489
00:34:03,697 --> 00:34:05,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that, is that that weekend?

490
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,439
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the weekend before.

491
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:08,799
[SPEAKER_11]: The weekend before, okay.

492
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,460
[SPEAKER_06]: The 14th.

493
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:18,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, in that case, yeah, I'll be there that weekend, so I can, I'll plan to come to harvest your energy as well.

494
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:24,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if we want to get ambitious, um, in, in the past, we've actually sponsored a ride.

495
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Along some of the river paths, like to assembly row and back.

496
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:37,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the October bike ride, the Halloween bike ride is the next day, right?

497
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:39,188
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

498
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, on those pads, you mean?

499
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:43,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

500
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:44,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

501
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:48,038
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of doing two of them at the same time.

502
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,301
[SPEAKER_12]: I put it in the chat, Jared, but I'm happy to Marshall as well.

503
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:53,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, awesome.

504
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:54,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

505
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:54,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

506
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking two different places.

507
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, that would be great.

508
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would be, I know Paul would, would appreciate that.

509
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:06,111
[SPEAKER_11]: He likes to get kind of get the local folks in to get a little bit of skin in the game.

510
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:06,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

511
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:07,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you all.

512
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:10,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

513
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, those are, those are really fun.

514
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, really fun events.

515
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:21,483
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always awesome to see so many people writing around that you really didn't think we're, uh, we're writing in your area, but they are.

516
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:25,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

517
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:29,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, sorry, I heard something.

518
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:38,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if I don't know if there's anything I'll say about harvester energy, but if we wanted to do it as part of events, I can give her a report on the EV showcase.

519
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:39,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

520
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:40,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

521
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:43,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a week and a half ago.

522
00:35:44,339 --> 00:36:00,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went with my folding e-bike and Becca brought her cargo e-bike and the Camberville e-bike lending library brought a total of four bike cargo, well, three cargo e-bikes and one cargo e-trike.

523
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:10,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the, you know, a bunch of people came and a couple of other people also like showed up with like sort of off-road e-bikes.

524
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:18,539
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of people showed up and talked to us about various things.

525
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,941
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor showed up and rode one of the e-bikes.

526
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually got a picture of her holding her dog and sitting in the bucket with Chris.

527
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And sit in the bucket.

528
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't distributed that because I wasn't sure what she wanted to do with it.

529
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent it to her, but I haven't seen it surface anymore yet.

530
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:35,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

531
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:48,890
[SPEAKER_06]: The one takeaway from our perspective and from the perspective of the e-bike lending library, it was that we had a lot of cargo e-bikes.

532
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:59,373
[SPEAKER_06]: My little folder was the closest thing to an ordinary bike, and maybe it would have helped to have a bit more representation on that end of things.

533
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a regular bike, but with a motor, because it was

534
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:09,962
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, my tiny folding bike, a bunch of cargo bikes, a couple of off-road bikes.

535
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:14,104
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't just like a normal full-size bike.

536
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:15,805
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an e-bike.

537
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so maybe giving people a slightly skewed idea of what's available in the market, but still like definitely got people interested.

538
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:29,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely got people, you know, thinking about their options.

539
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:43,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I showed up late with my Ioniq 5 and was forced to park next to an incredibly large moon lander, I guess called the Cybertruck.

540
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,785
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand how you feel, B-Dan.

541
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:51,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just... It was kind of a ridiculous vehicle, wasn't it?

542
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:52,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

543
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:53,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

544
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:53,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

545
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:59,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a conversation with Ellery also about that while we were there.

546
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:04,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I've seen that vehicle around.

547
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:14,241
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ford pickup truck that people use for commercial use is probably about the same size.

548
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:19,742
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't look as, I'm not quite sure what word I want to use, unusual.

549
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:20,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

550
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:25,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Ford at least probably has more room to put stuff in it.

551
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good point.

552
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:28,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Hard to tell.

553
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,714
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cybertruck is more like an extremely poorly constructed El Camino.

554
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it has less cargo capacity than El Camino and much heavier.

555
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

556
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it is aluminum or stainless steel or whatever it is.

557
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it somehow weighs four tons.

558
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the chat also, moving back to Harvester Energy, do we have people signed up?

559
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:57,333
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

560
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do I have people who want to attend?

561
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:04,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how many people do we need?

562
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:08,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can get two people to cover the whole time.

563
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:08,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fine, right?

564
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm free, so I'm willing to do it.

565
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:14,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Free is better.

566
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.

567
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:18,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I can cover.

568
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:25,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I might need to show up a little bit late, depending on a kid's activity, but I should be able to cover most of that time, too.

569
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:27,224
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually need to get signed up then.

570
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:30,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cover a little bit of it as well.

571
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:34,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I just did it while we were on the call.

572
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:35,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are all set.

573
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:36,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excellent.

574
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:37,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

575
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:45,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to make sure it actually makes it into the minutes, that's 12 to 3 on Saturday the 19th.

576
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,388
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

577
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:51,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll publish it.

578
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,509
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a pretty fun event.

579
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:58,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I find the title a little awkward to say for whatever reason, but it seems like it's well attended and people enjoy it.

580
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:02,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, great.

581
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,433
[SPEAKER_11]: That all sounds good.

582
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:09,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad we've got some folks signed up to join those things.

583
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks for the update on the EV showcase.

584
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That was, I think, kind of an unfortunate situation where

585
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:22,742
[SPEAKER_11]: We were not plugged in with the right people at the city for some reason.

586
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:29,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we did not find out about this event until far too late when we could have been more helpful.

587
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:41,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm extremely appreciative of Chris Schmidt at the at the Camberville Lending Library to kind of reorganize some loans that he had scheduled for that morning so that he could get a crew of folks.

588
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,196
[SPEAKER_06]: They apparently found out before we did.

589
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:56,759
[SPEAKER_11]: They, yeah, it was a similar timeline, I think, but it was through like a Facebook post or something like that, where someone posted on Facebook that, Hey, no one from Medford is coming to this, this event.

590
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:04,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think we've rectified that problem, but it was just kind of a staffing thing where the specific person in charge of this event didn't know that we existed.

591
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's unfortunate and we should fix that.

592
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

593
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

594
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:24,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Clipper Ship Connector is the next thing on our list here, moving right along.

595
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:35,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure there's really much to say other than we've now heard officially that it's not going to be open until fall of next year, August of 2025.

596
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:39,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that was the date that I saw written down.

597
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:43,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I mean, that's kind of what we expected anyway.

598
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea if there might be a soft open in that, you know, it's not officially open because the signs aren't in and that kind of thing, but is accessible.

599
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're never going to tell us that.

600
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

601
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:02,249
[SPEAKER_06]: That is frequently the way paths get finished.

602
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

603
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually, usually it says trail closed and the fence is open.

604
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

605
00:42:06,752 --> 00:42:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

606
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:13,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, maybe that, you know, maybe that will happen in the spring or something, but who knows?

607
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:33,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I hope so, but I certainly know what the Somerville Community Greenway, Greenline Extension, whatever the official name is, that was one where it looked done for a long time, but it did have big fences up blocking off big chunks of it, and it was really not passable for a long time.

608
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:39,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one, they really kept it closed off, but that was also alongside the tracks.

609
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,756
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe more of a safety concern.

610
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:51,639
[SPEAKER_06]: With the Cambridge Watertown Greenway, there was a long period when it was not officially open.

611
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,640
[SPEAKER_06]: But you could go past the signs and bike it.

612
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There were parts of the Northern Strand that were like that for quite a while, too.

613
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

614
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I certainly hope so.

615
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:04,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

616
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:08,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody has paid attention to the specific design.

617
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:26,533
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, more than I have, but my, my understanding was that there was a boardwalk component and it might be the existence of the boardwalk component that precludes kind of an early opening because it's not like it's just a path you can ride on.

618
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:30,475
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're like building, you know, decking and all that sort of stuff, then.

619
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:31,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

620
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:32,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right.

621
00:43:32,836 --> 00:43:34,517
[SPEAKER_06]: But that also may not be the last thing that goes in.

622
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Like oftentimes the last thing that goes in is like landscaping.

623
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, yep, that's true.

624
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked to Representative Garbally about this.

625
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I got added to their mailing list.

626
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:52,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's like a barrier next to the Yacht Club that needs to be erected as well.

627
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:57,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And folks are kind of using the path as parking at the moment.

628
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:59,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And that barrier is critical too.

629
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:03,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like it's all paved when you go by it.

630
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:08,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure an entrepreneurial member of the community would go explore it.

631
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:12,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So is it going around the yacht club?

632
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that right?

633
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it goes up to, was that Ship Avenue or something like that?

634
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:17,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it?

635
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:18,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it goes around that parking lot?

636
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:20,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

637
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:27,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it has like a planting and it's like a foot of like height difference or something to try to differentiate the two areas.

638
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:29,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

639
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:35,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm definitely disappointed that it's not going to be open for so long, but I'm glad it's happening.

640
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,532
[SPEAKER_11]: That is definitely something that

641
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,573
[SPEAKER_11]: we get asked about a lot, which I'm always a little surprised by, because I recognize how important it is.

642
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:47,157
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also, I'm surprised that people are plugged in enough, frankly, to even know that this really exists.

643
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:53,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad that- I mean, it's been talked about by a lot of different people, not just us, for a while.

644
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:55,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

645
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:57,685
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to be plugged in sometimes.

646
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shows how much demand there is.

647
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:00,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

648
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:01,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

649
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:04,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It's frustrating that the DCR doesn't make the information more accessible.

650
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they distribute a PDF.

651
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:07,910
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a printout.

652
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:14,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been scanned back in and you can't find anything on their website about the current updates.

653
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:19,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's sort of, there's definitely a communication breakdown there too.

654
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:19,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

655
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:21,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you.

656
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:21,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Noam.

657
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:26,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you've been kind of dogged and figuring out some of this information, so we appreciate it.

658
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:31,190
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, let's see.

659
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:37,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I put this one in the agenda, just an update on the road rage incident.

660
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:40,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was just kind of an unfortunate thing.

661
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of you may have seen it on social media.

662
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:42,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

663
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:53,008
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was, for those who may not be familiar, I was riding to my child's bus stop, which is about a block and a half away.

664
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:56,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on my own street, 100, 200 feet from my own house.

665
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,927
[SPEAKER_11]: on a narrow residential street.

666
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:05,671
[SPEAKER_11]: It's two ways, but only wide enough for one lane and there's parking on both sides.

667
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:15,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I was rolling to the stop sign at George street and a pickup truck seemed very angry.

668
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:23,287
[SPEAKER_11]: A guy in a pickup truck seemed very angry about my, my existence and, uh, pulled up behind me and was revving his engine.

669
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:30,965
[SPEAKER_11]: very aggressively and yelling and screaming and very frustrated that I was, that I dared to be in the road.

670
00:46:31,385 --> 00:46:41,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I had my kid with me on my, on my bike, uh, safely buckled in and helmeted and following all rules of the road and all that sort of thing, um, approaching a stop sign.

671
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:53,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not like it was really slowing anybody down, but still, uh, you know, harassed and screamed at and all the usual stuff about being a clown and getting out of the road and not paying taxes and

672
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,437
[SPEAKER_11]: all sorts of nonsense.

673
00:46:56,937 --> 00:47:01,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very jarring is very frustrating as events like that, as events like that are.

674
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:11,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I did post about it in a couple of forums on on social media, writing a bit of a screed asking people to not behave that way or condone such behavior.

675
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:22,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was pleased by the amount of positive sounds like the wrong word, but positive traction, positive reaction and engagement, I suppose that

676
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:35,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of the posts got a couple hundred engagements and many, many, many, many comments about it of people expressing support and being frustrated that someone would do that in the community.

677
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this person was a neighbor, I didn't recognize him, or just someone cutting through the neighborhood.

678
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared, would you mind sharing the street that this happened on?

679
00:47:43,981 --> 00:47:44,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, say that again, Bruce.

680
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind sharing which street this occurred on?

681
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:48,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Brookings Street.

682
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,845
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on Brookings and you were heading south, northbound rather to George or the other way?

683
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:54,466
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct, northbound to George.

684
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:55,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

685
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Northbound to George.

686
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:58,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wanted to check on that.

687
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:09,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to ask us to do something formally, which would be to engage the representative of the police department.

688
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's Carl Brooks, maybe it's somebody else, I'm not sure.

689
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:30,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But to really understand what we can do in those situations when somebody deliberately doesn't honor the forefoot passing, for example, or verbally harasses or intimidates using their vehicle.

690
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel it's the kind of thing which nobody does anything about it because it doesn't get taken seriously.

691
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:43,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to have us somehow enter a dialogue.

692
00:48:43,960 --> 00:49:05,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we need the mayor involved, if it's something that Todd can help us with, but I guess I would like to make an official motion that we look into engaging the police in some fashion to understand what we would recommend to people, right?

693
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe get some actual

694
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:12,968
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback from the police so that they know this does happen.

695
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:19,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a license number, you know, at a minimum, they'll make a phone call, for example.

696
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:34,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that happened to me once in Belmont, I called the police and they actually tried to call the individual couldn't get through, but, you know, they at least gave good lip service to it.

697
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

698
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:52,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So something, so a few days ago I happened to run across a post, um, by someone who said that since adding in a very obvious camera to their biking setup, you know, it's like mounted on their shoulder.

699
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:55,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's very clearly a camera.

700
00:49:56,104 --> 00:49:59,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they get a lot more, you know, safe passing distance.

701
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they, if someone starts.

702
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:26,770
[SPEAKER_06]: um harassing them they point to the camera and it very quickly stops and you know obviously this is not like a universal solution uh like we can't recommend that all cyclists wear cameras as a way to avoid these sorts of things but it does kind of speak to like

703
00:50:28,181 --> 00:50:30,383
[SPEAKER_06]: the things that drivers pay attention to.

704
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, you know, they'll do it if they think that there are no consequences, that there's, you know, that no one can report on them, that no one's observing them except for the cyclist they're harassing.

705
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:51,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But they stop, or at least most of them stop, if there's any chance of consequences.

706
00:50:52,660 --> 00:51:05,764
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in similar situations, I might reach in my pocket and grab my phone and just smile at them and pretend to take a picture, because I just don't have the wherewithal to go through all that.

707
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:12,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of times, the person would laugh and take their camera out and take a picture of me.

708
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:16,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both go on our way realizing we're not going to do anything about it anyway.

709
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:37,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was at least some maybe useful, I'm not sure antagonistic, I don't know, but some disruptive quality to that gesture that changed the timber and reduce the fire of the possible exchange.

710
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:45,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a pickup truck of the guy with a loud muffler, they just speed away and you know, try to

711
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:52,192
[SPEAKER_00]: acoustically grind you into their path and into their dirt trail.

712
00:51:52,893 --> 00:52:05,788
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an interesting article a few days ago, maybe last week, on I think it was WBZ TV, where they kind of did a poll about what

713
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:10,525
[SPEAKER_01]: What is permissible and what isn't by bicyclists and they were very.

714
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:17,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought evenly handed in basically, you know, describing the rights of cyclists.

715
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:21,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That people typically didn't know about, you know, things like.

716
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have to ride in the bike lane, right?

717
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, right?

718
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:26,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things like that.

719
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:34,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was quite a bit of surprise by both the anchor who was doing it and, in general, the way they presented it.

720
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does feel like that's another layer of education that people need to learn.

721
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:49,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also seen on the back of buses now, I always wanted this, and I'm glad they're doing it, the four-foot passing law.

722
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Is actually now on the back of some buses as an advertisement.

723
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:54,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's paying for it.

724
00:52:55,674 --> 00:53:00,298
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might recall about a year ago, I looked into what it would take to get that advertising.

725
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:04,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was way too expensive for a group like ours to do.

726
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:07,803
[SPEAKER_06]: That might just be the state doing it because I hope so.

727
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:11,386
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was, um, hey, folks, sorry, sorry to interrupt.

728
00:53:11,426 --> 00:53:13,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to step away for just a couple minutes.

729
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,512
[SPEAKER_11]: This is obviously a conversation I want to want to participate in, but I have to leave for about 5 minutes and I'll be, I'll be right back.

730
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:19,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

731
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:23,376
[SPEAKER_11]: continue as you were and fill me in in a minute.

732
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:46,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually, I believe I have a motion on the table to put together some sort of response for us to look into working with the mayor and or the police department to at least clarify exactly how members of our community should handle such incidents with regard to reporting.

733
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,069
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question before we move on that.

734
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:56,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Emily talking about setting up a meeting with the traffic officer.

735
00:53:56,272 --> 00:54:03,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, Emily's not here to comment, but I don't know if anybody knows if that got moved ahead because maybe that.

736
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:07,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Is a stepping stone for the bigger initiative.

737
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:15,260
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, I guess I'm requesting that we put forth the resolution that we be more.

738
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:29,586
[SPEAKER_01]: assertive about this particular incident, and in particular, an understanding of who should we contact or what should we do, so it's not just something that ends up in a vacuum.

739
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:37,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's obviously not going to change, and it happens to more people than some, but

740
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:43,651
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very intimidating factor for many people who don't want to ride.

741
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:55,023
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I believe when people say they're worried about traffic, it's really a surrogate for not wanting to assert their right to the road because they're afraid of these kind of encounters.

742
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:55,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

743
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:56,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, legitimately so.

744
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, of course, there's always the worry

745
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:13,382
[SPEAKER_06]: that just being yelled at is uncomfortable, but a driver could equally well decide to take physical action, and they have a large vehicle.

746
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:24,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was going to add, though, to your motion, I'd like to include ways that we can be proactive.

747
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:26,887
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to try to establish

748
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:42,260
[SPEAKER_06]: what people can do if this happens to them, but what can we do to educate drivers or to set things up so that these incidents are less likely to happen?

749
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:49,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce, I wonder what's codified in other communities who've had to address this.

750
00:55:49,357 --> 00:56:00,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I would specifically think that Cambridge and Somerville have established some norms for what's legal or reasonable,

751
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:06,344
[SPEAKER_00]: and responsible but not confrontational conduct.

752
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,905
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the legality is gonna be handled by the state.

753
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:14,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's cut and dry in the regulations and mass general law.

754
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:22,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a question of the policies of the police department and any of the safety organizations as to what they're recommending.

755
00:56:23,452 --> 00:56:25,433
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have a good idea there, I mean,

756
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,452
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't need to reinvent the wheel, right?

757
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:35,335
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, uh, have come up with policies that are useful.

758
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:51,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it would be nice for drivers to, to be aware that there isn't, you know, a great, uh, change when they cross lines from the town they live in to one that they're happened to be driving through.

759
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:54,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um,

760
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd like to I'd like to modify my resolution.

761
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:04,426
[SPEAKER_01]: We put together a working group to to proceed forward on this.

762
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so hold on.

763
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:09,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back.

764
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

765
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:23,440
[SPEAKER_08]: To clarify, this is a motion to put together a working group to discuss which police office sorry, with the police department that what we want to do in the case of aggressive driving.

766
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:27,654
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even quite that far.

767
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:32,923
[SPEAKER_01]: This proposal is to put together a working group to try to figure out how we should address the problem.

768
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's discussing with the police.

769
00:57:35,507 --> 00:57:37,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's figuring out how to do more.

770
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:55,231
[SPEAKER_01]: or we're working with the other cities and towns on getting information, but it's really the proposal I'm putting forth now is just that we put together a working group so that we can explore a handful of different options as opposed to discussing it just in this meeting.

771
00:57:56,412 --> 00:58:01,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we possibly check if we have anyone willing to do the working group before we make that proposal?

772
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:02,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, clearly, I'm willing to do it.

773
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:03,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

774
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:05,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I am as well.

775
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:08,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I second the motion.

776
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:09,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

777
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:13,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ernie.

778
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in that case, we've got a second.

779
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:25,624
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor of the motion to start a working group to consider steps that we might take toward dealing with this issue?

780
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:26,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Say aye.

781
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:27,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

782
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:28,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

783
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:30,506
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

784
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:31,666
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

785
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:41,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy and very willing to participate in that, Bruce.

786
00:58:42,025 --> 00:58:49,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think having this particular incident fairly fresh in my mind is probably useful for that as well.

787
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:58,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got, excuse me, a very specific incident that we can point to, which is always helpful for change.

788
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:03,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I did reach out to different city councilors and actually

789
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:14,586
[SPEAKER_11]: the chief of police and the mayor and described to them what happened as well and heard back from some of them, not the chief of police, unfortunately.

790
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:17,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is a good idea.

791
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:33,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And definitely reading some of the responses that people made to my initial posts is something that I'm not alone in having experienced, unfortunately, too often in our area and something that I think keeps people off of bikes

792
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Would anyone else like to join this?

793
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:41,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say maybe it's just Scott.

794
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:52,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put together, whoever's involved, I'll put together an email and see if we can, you know, put together a working group of some kind in the next several weeks.

795
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:54,613
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be great.

796
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:55,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Bruce.

797
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:01,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Is anyone on this call particularly interested in doing that?

798
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we'd be happy to have some other voices there.

799
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:08,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a baby.

800
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:10,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Not sure.

801
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we can talk about it while we assemble light kits.

802
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:21,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that work?

803
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:23,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Two birds with one stone?

804
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:27,955
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, well, thank you all.

805
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:31,456
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds good to me.

806
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:34,597
[SPEAKER_11]: An unacceptable behavior, and I would like to see

807
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:47,520
[SPEAKER_11]: something done about it and not not simply because it happened to me it's happened to me before this was just a particularly egregious incident and on your own street, even though your own street is no different than any other street pitches.

808
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:56,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Very clearly, particularly it's a very slow residential street that nobody has any business going more than about 15 miles an hour on anyway.

809
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,117
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's 1 of those.

810
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:00,519
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to pull over if there's any oncoming traffic.

811
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:07,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just, it's a. Particularly outrageous, it's not like you're on, I don't know, mystic Avenue.

812
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Right and not that that's an excuse, but I'm just saying it's a different situation.

813
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:18,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one block long, like there's only so much you can be delayed.

814
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:19,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

815
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:21,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

816
01:01:21,173 --> 01:01:24,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop sign, you know, what are you gonna do?

817
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:38,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great fear that the frequency of such incidents may tremendously increase after November 5th.

818
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a good idea, Bruce, to somehow

819
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,129
[SPEAKER_00]: it codified what the limits of our responses should be.

820
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:53,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

821
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of conversations that can be had there.

822
01:01:58,153 --> 01:01:58,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

823
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:04,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Next on the list here, we're getting closer to the end of our agenda, which I think is fine.

824
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:06,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Infrastructure updates.

825
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:14,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that we really have anyone on who can speak to those in any real detail, which is unfortunate.

826
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:18,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Another problem of the city's staffing right now.

827
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's going on with South and nevermind.

828
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:29,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, South and I was thinking South Street is going to say, I just was on South Street recently and it looks fine, but it sounds like you got it.

829
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:31,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sounds to me.

830
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:33,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't I don't know that we have an update here.

831
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:40,752
[SPEAKER_01]: The, no, that was, I think that was a meeting that they had, which was sort of the kickoff and getting initial feedback.

832
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:47,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to go stew on it and then they'll eventually come back and Leah, maybe, you know, more about it.

833
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:50,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know you're involved directly in that.

834
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:54,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Project correct no, you are not.

835
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:54,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

836
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:55,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Not correct.

837
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

838
01:02:56,097 --> 01:02:56,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

839
01:02:58,043 --> 01:03:00,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought somebody was in any event.

840
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:10,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that once they've stood on it and come back with their next plan, there'll be another similar meeting that we need to keep our ear to.

841
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:17,940
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point, there'll be a 25 percent design meeting.

842
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, typically.

843
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:23,025
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be

844
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:25,925
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll take a while, right?

845
01:03:26,165 --> 01:03:31,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Like probably a year or something, at least.

846
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:37,735
[SPEAKER_12]: But I thought, has anyone heard back of if they were going to meet with us still?

847
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:40,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard nothing.

848
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:45,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily might be looking into that, or that's what the request was, and I've not heard anything.

849
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:47,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily was looking into that.

850
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:51,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Did she give an update about it last meeting?

851
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:51,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

852
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:56,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the last update I heard was that they said, yep, we can meet with you.

853
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:57,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

854
01:03:58,275 --> 01:04:03,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then Emily said, you know, what time anytimes good will conform to your schedule and then we never heard back.

855
01:04:03,977 --> 01:04:04,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

856
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:04,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

857
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like we probably need to reach out again to.

858
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:08,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow up.

859
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:11,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can I can read what Emily sent me.

860
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It was regarding the project that's happening.

861
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,201
[SPEAKER_08]: The last I've gotten from them is we're reviewing alternatives.

862
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get back to you when we have more.

863
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:23,762
[SPEAKER_08]: This was after a certain amount of pestering for meetings.

864
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:34,384
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, so I think I think it was me that triggered this going on the agenda.

865
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong, but.

866
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:52,797
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been so much brouhaha lately about these overrides in Medford, which for anyone who's moderately plugged into the political scene in Medford, which I suspect those of us on this call are more than others.

867
01:04:55,299 --> 01:05:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason this kind of came to my mind for this meeting was in the

868
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:10,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what you want to call that, bickering back and forth conversation about the fire department related override.

869
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:19,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw in one of the discussions, and now I'm having a tough time citing it, which forgive me for, I'll see if I can find it later.

870
01:05:21,457 --> 01:05:32,381
[SPEAKER_11]: There was some reference to the design of the new fire station was tied to the update on South and Main.

871
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:52,642
[SPEAKER_11]: which makes sense because when they gave that presentation about South and Main, they talked about how they were considering various kind of rotary or roundabout configurations that they very quickly ruled out because it would require infringing on, I think, the fire department's property in a way that was problematic.

872
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:58,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And just in some of those discussions that came up in talking about the design,

873
01:06:01,477 --> 01:06:04,478
[SPEAKER_11]: there was an issue with that design, and they were taking that into account.

874
01:06:04,558 --> 01:06:13,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So it sounded simply like they are looking at this issue, but I have heard nothing about it.

875
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,062
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was hoping we could get an update, but Todd wasn't able to join us today.

876
01:06:21,363 --> 01:06:26,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I'd say we should pester again, frankly, and see what we can do there.

877
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:38,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, has anyone else noticed any other infrastructure or anything that we want to follow up with Todd about specifically?

878
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:42,035
[SPEAKER_12]: He emailed us about another blue bike station going in.

879
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:43,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

880
01:06:44,215 --> 01:06:44,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry.

881
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:49,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned that when I pinned the announcements section, Leah.

882
01:06:49,777 --> 01:06:52,717
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was my fault for not seeing you in the waiting room there.

883
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:53,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So apologies for that.

884
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:56,238
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's exciting.

885
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:57,238
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all excited.

886
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:59,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So you missed our excitement about it, Leah.

887
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:00,159
[SPEAKER_11]: We were excited about it.

888
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:00,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

889
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:09,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to at some point suggest to Todd that we get Sheroes on city hall mall.

890
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:16,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Which right now is a bit of a. A bit of a bottleneck as you're coming through Medford square from the East.

891
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's three lanes there, one which turns right and two which turn left.

892
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:28,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have people coming eastbound on Riverside that have to merge through that.

893
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:31,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, those people are going towards Malden.

894
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:35,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a lot of cross-traffic through that area.

895
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:45,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a minimum, it would be good, I think, to have Sharrows there and Bicycles Meashere full lane and perhaps even a four-foot sign or something.

896
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:47,389
[SPEAKER_01]: in those areas.

897
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something we could request Todd to do?

898
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so.

899
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I ride that same area and I agree with you, Bruce.

900
01:07:58,353 --> 01:08:08,576
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a tough one to figure out where you're supposed to be sometimes and people certainly, wherever you think you're supposed to be, I'm sure the drivers around you disagree.

901
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:09,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

902
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:15,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're going straight from the right turn lane, people who are going to Malden get on your case.

903
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:31,064
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're sticking far to the left because you want to stay left on Salem Street so you can continue south on Main Street, for example, then you get another set of people who worry about you being there and in the center, you're in the center.

904
01:08:31,664 --> 01:08:32,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

905
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:37,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already got Sharrows on all three lanes of Salem Street.

906
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:38,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

907
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: That would just be bringing the other streets in Medford Square up to the same standard.

908
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:45,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

909
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:46,865
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be useful.

910
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:48,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I like that.

911
01:08:50,046 --> 01:09:00,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm not opposed to having kind of an occasional digest of things that we happen to notice that, or maybe low effort that we could pester Todd about.

912
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:11,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I know he's got plenty to do, but it's never a bad idea to do a little light pestering for safety's sake, right?

913
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:11,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

914
01:09:11,632 --> 01:09:13,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, on that note then,

915
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:18,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything else that anyone has noticed that they would like to mention while we're at it?

916
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:18,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Ernie?

917
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Not about infrastructure.

918
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you closing that as an agenda item and moving on?

919
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:27,461
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

920
01:09:27,782 --> 01:09:33,864
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, I was going to see if anybody else had any minor infrastructure updates before thinking about moving on.

921
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:35,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

922
01:09:35,624 --> 01:09:37,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else they wanted to talk to Todd about?

923
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:46,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we got a lot of the updates regarding that done in the beginning, like, with the bikes and other.

924
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:55,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was, I was thinking kind of specifically if if I was going to be reaching out to Todd about the, the shares on city hall mall, if there was.

925
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:59,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe anything else that was kind of a light lift that we wanted to ask for at the same time.

926
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:10,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to bring up continuing the work from West Medford Square to the Arlington line on High Street.

927
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:17,714
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the distaste for removing parking spaces has always been the big bugaboo.

928
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:28,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I realized that that is falling as a huge brick wall against these modernizations as time goes by.

929
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:33,716
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it'd be nice to see it happen in my lifetime.

930
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:37,757
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's been on this desk for three years.

931
01:10:38,658 --> 01:10:55,803
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dissolution of 40 unused parking spaces is an argument that they perhaps just don't have the bandwidth nor courage to argue.

932
01:10:57,377 --> 01:11:01,239
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, you know, I'd like to bring it up at least once a year.

933
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I mean, like, yeah, I mean, we saw we saw what happened with like Winthrop Street.

934
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:06,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

935
01:11:06,102 --> 01:11:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's going to be an uphill battle with removal of any parking, because there's always someone who uses it occasionally.

936
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:17,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course.

937
01:11:18,128 --> 01:11:19,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But but, you know, like,

938
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:25,930
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some of them removed on Winthrop Street, and maybe we'll get the next batch removed eventually.

939
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if we can get a few more blocks on High Street, that'll be something.

940
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great discontinuity to have part of it done and then have nothing happen.

941
01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:40,318
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, you've hit the rotaries and are entering Arlington.

942
01:11:41,299 --> 01:11:42,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway.

943
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:49,766
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end as well, to continue from the Brooks War to the Winthrop Street Rotary would be useful as well.

944
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:55,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But the better thing would be to get that part repaved, because that's in pretty rough shape.

945
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:55,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

946
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:08,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it seems like we've got like a couple of things like one is to make some of these light asks that are easy to happen casually and hopefully don't add too much to their to their docket.

947
01:12:09,636 --> 01:12:11,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there's kind of the broader question of.

948
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:15,472
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the city's priorities right now?

949
01:12:15,652 --> 01:12:16,572
[SPEAKER_11]: What's in the queue?

950
01:12:17,192 --> 01:12:18,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a slightly different question.

951
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:32,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly what I was going to request is that we get the list of streets that are going to be repaved and the limits of those streets this upcoming construction season.

952
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:40,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we can take a look at them over the winter and see if we have any recommendations for those streets that they can do while they're repaving them.

953
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:44,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I love that.

954
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

955
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:52,192
[SPEAKER_11]: I had kind of a general hand wavy thought and you were able to define it clearly and explicitly, Leah, that's perfect.

956
01:12:52,232 --> 01:12:52,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

957
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:53,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

958
01:12:54,012 --> 01:12:55,053
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very naughty.

959
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:59,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so sorry to be down, but Medford has not put out like a.

960
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:07,295
[SPEAKER_12]: a CIP in a bit, like a plan of how they're going to spend their money.

961
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, point of information.

962
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you define that for us?

963
01:13:11,738 --> 01:13:14,059
[SPEAKER_12]: A capital investment plan.

964
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:14,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

965
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Says where they're going to spend their money.

966
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:30,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen one in a bit, and I don't necessarily like to assume that the old one is accurate or that old list of

967
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they had an old list of streets that they were going to repave and it went a couple of years, but.

968
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:39,331
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't necessarily know if things have changed priority or if.

969
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,493
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they didn't get to everything.

970
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:43,195
[SPEAKER_12]: So stuff's been bumped back.

971
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,157
[SPEAKER_12]: So a new list would be very helpful.

972
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:52,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm just going to add that, like, I know that Todd.

973
01:13:53,523 --> 01:13:56,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks at the bicycle master plan.

974
01:13:58,012 --> 01:14:04,055
[SPEAKER_06]: when repaving things, you know, to see if there's something they can throw in while they're doing that.

975
01:14:04,575 --> 01:14:10,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, the master plan is still, you know, sort of paused on updates.

976
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:23,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be good to get that list so that we can look at it and look at the master plan and say, is there something missing that we think should be added, you know, right away before they repave these?

977
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that's a that's a really good

978
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: a really good ask and frankly would give us plenty to do over the fall and winter, right?

979
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we can be ready with some good suggestions when this stuff is shovel ready.

980
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:50,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jared Todd should be reminded that the cost of doing high street is extraordinarily low, especially per linear Todd.

981
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:57,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's really just signage and paint is high street.

982
01:14:57,155 --> 01:15:01,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't anything that Todd has anything over any control over this mass dot.

983
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:03,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

984
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:07,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't High Street Route 60?

985
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:07,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

986
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:12,717
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's owned by the state.

987
01:15:13,097 --> 01:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I thought it was.

988
01:15:13,938 --> 01:15:14,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

989
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:16,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I could be wrong on that.

990
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:22,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought that like the Brooks project was done by the state because of that.

991
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:27,630
[SPEAKER_12]: It may have been funded by the state, but that was a safe routes to school funding.

992
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the state got involved.

993
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:30,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

994
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:32,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

995
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought High Street was owned by the state as well.

996
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:36,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong about that.

997
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:39,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do a little check real quick.

998
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember the details.

999
01:15:41,428 --> 01:15:48,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this, whether it was owned by it or not, I feel like there was some reason that the city had purview over the markets and things on it.

1000
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,230
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be good to clarify.

1001
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:59,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I think sometimes people like use the fact that something's a state numbered route, even if they own it, to try to not make any improvements, because they're like, oh, it's.

1002
01:16:00,012 --> 01:16:00,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe those.

1003
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:03,773
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to talk to MassDOT, but it would be fine.

1004
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:15,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a distinction between changing infrastructure versus something as simple as signage and paint, where we have no way of knowing.

1005
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:16,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's fantastic.

1006
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:21,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've heard of stones or changing lanes, but I don't know.

1007
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look, from my perspective, I would

1008
01:16:27,573 --> 01:16:36,059
[SPEAKER_12]: be happy if the city would maintain something that they own, because it's really hard to maintain something you don't own.

1009
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:39,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if they don't maintain it, nothing gets maintained.

1010
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:41,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1011
01:16:41,744 --> 01:16:45,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we have so many sidewalks that don't get shoveled in the winter.

1012
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:49,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's ask for that list.

1013
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:56,495
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think we have to officially convene a working group yet, but I think we can probably expect that that's kind of

1014
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:59,686
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the things that we'll do in the next meeting or two.

1015
01:17:01,607 --> 01:17:05,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Assuming such a list exists, which I hope it does.

1016
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:23,195
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that over the past couple of years, I think we've been very pleased with the extent to which the city has brought us into its decision-making process where it felt like we used to be chasing things a little bit and finding out about things a little bit too late.

1017
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:39,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to say we're back to that situation because I think we are brought in, but I think the staffing issues at the city have made it such that it's harder for us to be as involved as we might like or even as Todd might like.

1018
01:17:40,464 --> 01:17:41,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1019
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:51,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to officially motion that we write to Todd to ask for that list, for the list of upcoming repaving projects.

1020
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that.

1021
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:07,270
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, we've got a motion to request from Todd the city's repaving projects in the upcoming season.

1022
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:08,871
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

1023
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1024
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

1025
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:13,812
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do it.

1026
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:16,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Does someone want to do that?

1027
01:18:16,153 --> 01:18:20,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to.

1028
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:21,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1029
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:24,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1030
01:18:25,556 --> 01:18:26,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

1031
01:18:26,797 --> 01:18:27,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd's a lovely person.

1032
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to address to him.

1033
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,042
[SPEAKER_11]: We need more Todd's at the city.

1034
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:36,124
[SPEAKER_06]: We need at least one more time.

1035
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:40,427
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

1036
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:41,408
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

1037
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:45,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Leah, you had a question here in the chat.

1038
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:51,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I know the answer, but I'll make sure Bruce weighs in here about

1039
01:18:52,778 --> 01:18:56,061
[SPEAKER_11]: us weighing in as a commission on the overrides?

1040
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:01,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question.

1041
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:07,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can only tell you what I read in the general laws.

1042
01:19:09,091 --> 01:19:19,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is the kind of thing which if we really want to know, we should check with the city solicitor, who may or may not be as responsive as the previous city solicitor was.

1043
01:19:21,676 --> 01:19:32,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I do recall that we were told that commissions can weigh in on items that are germane to their, what's it, where their function.

1044
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:44,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that could mean that, for example, the streets might be something that we'd be able to weigh in on, but it's not clear that it'd be a stretch for like the fire department one.

1045
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:47,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forget the exact order of these.

1046
01:19:47,647 --> 01:19:49,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's another that has to do with schools.

1047
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:51,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Schools, yeah.

1048
01:19:51,108 --> 01:19:56,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was thinking if we weighed in on anything, it would be the one to give more funding to the DPW.

1049
01:19:56,769 --> 01:20:03,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we could make an argument that that would be directly benefiting us and helping us in our mission.

1050
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:04,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1051
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:12,113
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is that I don't see how we're going to get a decision, a definitive decision between now and when we'd be able to do anything for the election.

1052
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:16,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we'd be able to in our next meeting.

1053
01:20:16,882 --> 01:20:19,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Bruce, do we even have a city solicitor?

1054
01:20:20,124 --> 01:20:20,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1055
01:20:21,205 --> 01:20:22,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we do.

1056
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:26,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the city's got to have a city solicitor in some fashion.

1057
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:29,931
[SPEAKER_12]: This seems to be a hot topic, I think.

1058
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought we had one that we had asked questions.

1059
01:20:33,927 --> 01:20:36,308
[SPEAKER_06]: To in the previously about other things.

1060
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did.

1061
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:43,209
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to ask directly to, and he was quite responsive about clarifying these things.

1062
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:46,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know who the current city solicitor even is.

1063
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:51,631
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point, I'm pretty sure it's outsourced to all right now.

1064
01:20:51,971 --> 01:20:53,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I thought it was.

1065
01:20:53,612 --> 01:20:58,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we've got an outside council serving in that in that role.

1066
01:20:58,673 --> 01:21:03,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm going to have to reach out to the mayor's office to get access to that.

1067
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:09,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so this is like an interesting question too, because there's that question of like, what are we legally allowed to do?

1068
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:14,112
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's also the idea that we're a city commission that exists at the pleasure of the mayor.

1069
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:21,941
[SPEAKER_11]: So it seems like if the mayor is for it, then it is probably within our purview to be for it as well.

1070
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:23,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

1071
01:21:23,082 --> 01:21:25,825
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's related to our function and in line with the mayor's.

1072
01:21:26,697 --> 01:21:34,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thoughts if, if we were to disagree with the mayor's push on that particular thing, that could get, that could get touchy, but it's a very good point.

1073
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:47,045
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do, if you, if we do agree with the mayor and it is within our purview, then logically it seems separately from legally, logically, it seems like it would probably be okay for us to, to advocate for it.

1074
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:51,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I'm not sure how we get that answer.

1075
01:21:51,546 --> 01:21:52,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a question of the mayor.

1076
01:21:53,477 --> 01:21:55,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that I guess that's where you would start, right?

1077
01:21:56,358 --> 01:21:56,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1078
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,620
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I see, too.

1079
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:06,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ask her if she wants more mass in the foundation of the support she needs for this.

1080
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:21,870
[SPEAKER_09]: This didn't come up on the school committee this week, and the mayor had to recuse herself from endorsing one of the questions, but the school committee did issue a

1081
01:22:24,327 --> 01:22:27,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Proclamation in support of it today.

1082
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:30,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be within their purview for sure.

1083
01:22:30,994 --> 01:22:34,978
[SPEAKER_12]: They're elected not a body of the city.

1084
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are, but in a different way than we are.

1085
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:43,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should try to get a clarification from the mayor.

1086
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:46,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And if she needs to talk to the council, that'd be good.

1087
01:22:47,636 --> 01:22:54,879
[SPEAKER_01]: If she recused herself at the school committee meeting, it might be because she thought there was a conflict of interest for herself.

1088
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1089
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we just get it resolved somehow?

1090
01:23:01,502 --> 01:23:03,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll reach out to the mayor.

1091
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, B-10, does this have a...

1092
01:23:08,577 --> 01:23:09,178
[SPEAKER_06]: A city solicitor.

1093
01:23:09,258 --> 01:23:10,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

1094
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:11,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1095
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: City solicitor and public records access officer is vacant.

1096
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:22,068
[SPEAKER_06]: There is staff who is Janice Spencer, the office manager and confidential secretary.

1097
01:23:23,209 --> 01:23:36,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not quite clear there, but it's possible that she would have the information on who to talk to in the absence of.

1098
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:38,709
[SPEAKER_06]: a current solicitor.

1099
01:23:39,589 --> 01:23:40,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we've got a couple of people.

1100
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:47,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll reach out to the mayor and someone at the department there and see if we can't get that answered.

1101
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:59,020
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we can get it answered, let's assume for the moment that we are allowed to advocate one way or the other for something that is directly related to us.

1102
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:03,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe we should wait because this is also a public meeting.

1103
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:08,285
[SPEAKER_12]: not allowed to weigh in on it.

1104
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:09,465
[SPEAKER_12]: They might not want to.

1105
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:10,385
[SPEAKER_11]: You are.

1106
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:11,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed.

1107
01:24:11,486 --> 01:24:12,266
[SPEAKER_11]: You are right.

1108
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:13,286
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1109
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:14,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, boy.

1110
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:21,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So do we put this down as a motion to request clarification from the mayor's office?

1111
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:24,249
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds right to me.

1112
01:24:24,269 --> 01:24:26,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so, too.

1113
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:30,171
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of timing, though, the election is early November.

1114
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:33,352
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can't get a decision until

1115
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:43,924
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, our next, until before our next meeting, say we can, then we're looking at the end of October before we would even be in a position to weigh in about it.

1116
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:52,288
[SPEAKER_01]: We could call a special meeting if need be to specifically vote on which, if any of the proposals we support.

1117
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:53,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1118
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:54,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, great point, Bruce.

1119
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

1120
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1121
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a good plan then.

1122
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:57,911
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1123
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:01,594
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll, did someone want to make a motion that we reach out to them?

1124
01:25:01,814 --> 01:25:02,254
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

1125
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:04,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1126
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded.

1127
01:25:06,788 --> 01:25:07,108
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1128
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:07,848
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor.

1129
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:08,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1130
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:09,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1131
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:09,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1132
01:25:10,509 --> 01:25:10,889
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1133
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:14,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just adding things to my plate left and right here, aren't we?

1134
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:15,570
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1135
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:18,351
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

1136
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:19,351
[SPEAKER_11]: These are important ones.

1137
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to do it.

1138
01:25:22,252 --> 01:25:22,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1139
01:25:22,632 --> 01:25:23,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll reach out to the mayor.

1140
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:27,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1141
01:25:27,213 --> 01:25:31,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have anything else on infrastructure.

1142
01:25:31,475 --> 01:25:32,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Ernie, I think you had.

1143
01:25:34,694 --> 01:26:01,611
[SPEAKER_00]: uh you wanted to add uh yeah just yeah just to say that uh this past week i stocked the schools of uh i think 157 bike light kits the five schools uh 10 for chief buckley i don't know what he ever does with them he's supposed to throw them in the cruisers and uh west medford uh

1144
01:26:03,327 --> 01:26:04,208
[SPEAKER_00]: center as well.

1145
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:10,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'll pack up some more for our October 19th event.

1146
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:12,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't thought of that.

1147
01:26:13,157 --> 01:26:16,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And by digging into next year's supply.

1148
01:26:17,782 --> 01:26:19,203
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that's just fine.

1149
01:26:19,544 --> 01:26:25,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There is any other need for bike light kits this fall, then certainly let me know.

1150
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:33,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a question about this, like, I passed someone just, you know, in my building.

1151
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:42,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was, you know, going out for a bike ride with her bike and she didn't seem to have a light on it and it was kind of dark out already.

1152
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:43,510
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was wondering is.

1153
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:49,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something where, like, it would be useful for other members of the commission to just.

1154
01:26:51,054 --> 01:26:53,916
[SPEAKER_12]: carry one or two around with us for when we bike?

1155
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:58,479
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been suggested over the years, I hope.

1156
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:07,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the beginning, I think I even distributed to members front porches a box each of six or 10 lights.

1157
01:27:07,846 --> 01:27:11,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think too many people took it upon themselves.

1158
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:17,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good idea when you're out on a bike to carry one or two, and especially if you run into a

1159
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:24,176
[SPEAKER_00]: a child who is unlit.

1160
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:31,179
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can strap it on them, talk to them about it, show them the booklet, etc.

1161
01:27:32,432 --> 01:27:48,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to, to, you know, take a couple from you at the harvest your energy festival and do the transfer that way, since I do not have a front porch, especially as we get into the fall and the, you know, kind of the commute home is in the dark.

1162
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:55,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to carry really leave 10 or 20 in my front hall for

1163
01:27:56,133 --> 01:28:00,796
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone to pick up, but that hasn't really happened over the year.

1164
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:10,143
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can continue to do that so that you can see my front closed foyer as a little warehouse to pick them up as needed.

1165
01:28:10,863 --> 01:28:13,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, um, yeah, I don't really know where your house is.

1166
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:20,870
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we're both going to be at the harvest your energy festival, I think it would be easier to take what's left over.

1167
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recommended anyway.

1168
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:22,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

1169
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:23,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1170
01:28:26,865 --> 01:28:28,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that is great.

1171
01:28:29,006 --> 01:28:30,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all so much.

1172
01:28:30,386 --> 01:28:32,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ernie, thank you for, thank you for doing that.

1173
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:43,551
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, uh, I know you put a lot of time and effort into getting the finances together to do that and the effort and putting the kits together and distributing them.

1174
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:49,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know how much time that takes and it's kind of invisible labor maybe at times, but, but we appreciate it.

1175
01:28:50,473 --> 01:28:50,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1176
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:52,834
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.

1177
01:28:54,674 --> 01:28:55,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, one.

1178
01:28:57,155 --> 01:28:58,175
[SPEAKER_11]: You all reminded me of something.

1179
01:28:58,395 --> 01:29:03,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, my, I have a, I have a kid in the public school system now, which I'm very excited about.

1180
01:29:03,457 --> 01:29:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will be, I signed up to volunteer with their.

1181
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:20,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the, the name is escaping the, the walk and roll bike to school thing that they, that we do, um, every once in a while leading kind of convoys or whatever.

1182
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:23,034
[SPEAKER_11]: those have not been planned yet.

1183
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:34,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if there's anybody else at the Misitech school where my child is who plans those or if by volunteering to be involved that now is me who's planning them.

1184
01:29:34,104 --> 01:29:34,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really sure.

1185
01:29:35,986 --> 01:29:42,091
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll just something to know that now we've got an in in that school in terms of

1186
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:47,678
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, biking and whatnot, which I know you, you brought up before Ernie has not really having that person.

1187
01:29:47,738 --> 01:29:58,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can, I can do my best to, to plug us into that school and I'll publicize and let us know about any walk and bike to school events that are, that are coming up in case others are interested in helping out with that.

1188
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:06,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think that's everything that was on our agenda.

1189
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything else anyone would like to chat about?

1190
01:30:13,095 --> 01:30:13,876
[SPEAKER_01]: We would do adjourn.

1191
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded.

1192
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,443
