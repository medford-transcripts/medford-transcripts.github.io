    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=0.629s">Hi,</a>  Mustang community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=2.57s">This</a>  is your proud superintendent, Dr. Edward Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=7.753s">I</a>  am here today to share a few updates about the reopening of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=14.336s">Although</a>  it sure has felt like summer this week, with the heat and humidity we have been facing, fall is soon to come and it is back to school time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=26.946s">I</a>  am sure all of you have a mix of emotions as we return to our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=33.293s">I</a>  have always loved back to school time, an opportunity to meet your teachers and make new friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=42.203s">Perhaps</a>  you're even moving on up to middle school or maybe high school this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=48.982s">As</a>  excited as you may be, I know that many of you are a bit nervous about returning to school during this ongoing coronavirus pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=60.691s">I</a>  would like to assure you today that Medford Public Schools is committed to your safety and your health in all of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=70.822s">As</a>  you may know, mask wearing is mandatory for all students and staff, and we are committed to keeping our buildings cleaned and ventilated each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=84.508s">We</a>  are proud of the work that we did last year with in-school COVID testing, and we are committed to continuing this partnership with Tufts University and Armstrong Ambulance to offer the same program again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=100.123s">I</a>  encourage you to look out for the testing consent form in today's communication, as well as on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=108.988s">We</a>  are aiming for 100% testing participation from our students this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=115.131s">And</a>  by signing and returning the form to your school's office, your child will be ready to participate in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=124.571s">We</a>  also encourage our Medford community to continue to be vigilant with COVID-19 preventative measures, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and diligent hand-washing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=140.255s">It</a>  is my greatest hope that all who are able get vaccinated as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=147.674s">The</a>  vaccine has given us hope and we must continue to do our part to keep all children and our medically vulnerable persons very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=158.368s">In</a>  closing, I encourage all of you to enjoy the sunshine this last weekend of summer for us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=166.935s">I</a>  look forward to warmly welcoming all our students in grades one through 12 this Tuesday, August 31st, and to also welcome our newest Mustangs, our kindergartners, on Wednesday, September 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=184.986s">I</a>  can't wait to see you, and I hope that all of you have a wonderful weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/iIp6ODorcE0&t=190.502s">Go</a>  Mustangs!</p>
