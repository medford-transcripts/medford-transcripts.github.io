[SPEAKER_06]: Seven present, zero absent.

33
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

34
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Just waiting for the slide deck to be pulled up.

35
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:33,229
[SPEAKER_04]: One moment.

36
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

37
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:27,095
[SPEAKER_01]: This evening, I'm going to be presenting before the committee this budget update.

38
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:40,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on questions that came in from the members and were asked last week, I have attempted to respond to provide answers for the majority of the questions.

39
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start the presentation.

40
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:45,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

41
00:03:48,095 --> 00:04:11,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing, for those of you in the community who are just joining for the first time and are not certain how school budgets function and the different funding streams that are available to school districts, this slide shows that these are the different ways that funding comes.

42
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:16,268
[SPEAKER_01]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the governor's budget,

43
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,611
[SPEAKER_01]: submits an allocation to the municipality.

44
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:40,489
[SPEAKER_01]: That funding goes to the municipality, the city of Medford, and the city of Medford's chapter 70 allocation, that's what the city, local aid, local contribution, that's what comprises the city's funding sources.

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:49,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the allocation from the city, that funding funnels and goes to all of Medford Public Schools.

46
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:56,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows us to address our district priorities and goals, departmental priorities and goals.

47
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes the superintendent's recommendations.

48
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:05,239
[SPEAKER_01]: This process, the budget meeting process, which is a multi-step process,

49
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,500
[SPEAKER_01]: school committee requests.

50
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:15,263
[SPEAKER_01]: We receive again the municipal appropriations and then eventually school committee adoption.

51
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:20,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Also federal funding is involved in this process.

52
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:29,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And the federal government provides supplemental grants and again it's intended to supplement, not to supplant.

53
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:40,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So we receive federal and state grants, our title grants, our Perkins grants, our IDEA grants at the time of the pandemic.

54
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:44,599
[SPEAKER_01]: the additional COVID-19 grants.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to state that these allocations, the federal government grants, they fluctuate.

56
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:57,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does not remain the same exact amount every year.

57
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a slight increase and sometimes there is a decrease.

58
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:11,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say this is kind of where the funding streams kind of come from that come to the district.

59
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:12,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.

60
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:19,850
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, for Medford Public Schools, all of our funding sources are as follows.

61
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,935
[SPEAKER_01]: The general fund allocation, which we talked about the Chapter 70 allocation.

62
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:30,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Grants, again, IDEA title grants.

63
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,262
[SPEAKER_01]: ESSER, which is one time funding source.

64
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:42,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth funding source is revolving accounts.

65
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:47,549
[SPEAKER_01]: The revolving accounts are accounts that are based out of Medford Public Schools.

66
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:53,812
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of the official operating budget, but it is a funding source that we do use.

67
00:06:54,272 --> 00:07:00,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that is happening within the district comes from these four

68
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:08,081
[SPEAKER_01]: funding sources, so I hope you can see that there are funding sources coming from these four areas.

69
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

70
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:26,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So in response to the budget process, right now we are at April 10th, and there were several steps that have already taken place.

71
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,465
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee has approved the district's strategic plan.

72
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:45,331
[SPEAKER_01]: There were budget surveys that were administered during the month of March that went to school committee members, department heads, administrators.

73
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:54,294
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now in the process of having budget meetings discussing funding and where we are.

74
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:57,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're at our second budget meeting.

75
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:10,027
[SPEAKER_01]: This process will continue where the superintendent will give formal recommendations coming up at the May 1st meeting.

76
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:17,269
[SPEAKER_01]: School committee will formally put in their requests by the May 15th meeting.

77
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:26,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this context, the municipal appropriation was given to us a little earlier.

78
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do need to slide that block up forward.

79
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee will adopt it in June, and there will be implementation in July.

80
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:38,682
[SPEAKER_01]: July 1 is the implementation of the new fiscal year.

81
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:59,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So the previous budget objectives at our April 3 meeting, which was just a week ago, it was the introduction to the budget process and reviewing our FY 23 allocation.

82
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:08,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we will be looking at some funding requests, reviewing the available FY 24 ESSER funds and highlighting some priorities.

83
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:19,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Upcoming on May 1st will be the official recommendations on our strategic priorities for Medford public schools.

84
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:32,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So our FY23 budget, the budget that we are currently in right now, we were allocated 68,994,776.

85
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are our FY23 budget numbers that we're currently working with right now.

86
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:59,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Our anticipated operating budget that was given to us from the municipality is $71 million for FY 24 budget numbers.

87
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:32,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So our anticipated operating budget to be approved in June is totals a $1.7 million increase over the operating budget that we received last year, which is the equivalent is a 2.5% increase for this coming fiscal year, FY 24.

88
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:46,435
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key budget drivers, which I will talk about later, is our employment agreements.

89
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:57,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for a refresher, our FY22, based on our contracts that were settled, 2.5% increase for FY22, 2.5% increase for FY23.

90
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:11,783
[SPEAKER_01]: and for FY 24, 2.5% plus an additional 1% on the 100th day of school.

91
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:26,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're talking about a $1.1 million fixed cost increase based on FY 23 increases, and that is inclusive of the teachers only.

92
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:50,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I reviewed some of the fixed cost increases, and again, I wanted to just go back to kind of restate some of the fixed costs that we know are going to increase and where some of them are going to have impacts on this budget process.

93
00:11:51,604 --> 00:12:04,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are aware that for FY24, which starts on July 1, that our special education costs are going to increase, and that projection is around $1 million.

94
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:16,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that is a projection because we know that there is an unanticipated, unknown piece to those numbers.

95
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:29,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Our FY 24 contractual increases across the board, our increases to personnel, we are anticipating that at a $3.3 million increase.

96
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: A significant portion 2% in FY 22 and 2% sent in FY 23 of these increases were incorporated into our last two budgets in anticipation of our negotiations.

97
00:12:50,647 --> 00:13:08,722
[SPEAKER_01]: still with FY23 and 24 increases, exceeding the budgeted amounts, that has really impacted our flexibility that we previously thought would have been, that we previously thought would have existed.

98
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,233
[SPEAKER_01]: For FY 24, we do have anticipated vendor increases.

99
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:25,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying anticipated because we are still working on some numbers for outside contracts, transportation, and maintenance.

100
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:32,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are anticipated, but we know it's going to increase and not decrease.

101
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:47,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are still working on additional CBAs for our custodians, our monitors, our administrators, our security monitors, and our food service workers.

102
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:01,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is another way of looking at our anticipated increases.

103
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:07,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will kind of restate this again later in the slide.

104
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:19,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Out-of-district tuitions, we're expecting again from 3.7 million, which was allocated for this year, FY23, we're expecting that increase to be approximately 4.2 million.

105
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:29,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that number can fluctuate our transportation and van services as a 10% increase there from 1.5 million.

106
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:35,810
[SPEAKER_01]: We are expecting or anticipating approximately 2.24 again that number can fluctuate.

107
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:49,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Our transportation and school bus, our big yellow bus transportation, we anticipate going from 1.2 million to approximately 1.25 million.

108
00:14:49,623 --> 00:15:07,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we are looking at that anticipated that our current contract and also looking at the possibility of other contracts to look to see what's going to best meet the needs of the district.

109
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,645
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few more anticipated increases, utilities, gas and electric.

110
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:22,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are increasing as well from 1.85 million for FY23.

111
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:31,296
[SPEAKER_01]: We are expecting it to come in around $2 million for gas and electric next year.

112
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:43,384
[SPEAKER_01]: And our cleaning contract, FY23, we paid $445,000 for that contract.

113
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: We are anticipating an increase in that, a similar increase of $45,000 to $50,000 for our cleaning contracts.

114
00:15:55,212 --> 00:16:01,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say where some of these anticipated increases are coming from.

115
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:16,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So to total all of that, we're looking at approximately $1.4 million increase in ordinary expenses, things that are non-salary.

116
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:29,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So a $1.4 million increase in ordinary expenses, a $3.3 million increase in personnel expenses.

117
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:32,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are our settled CBAs.

118
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:41,307
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are anticipating a $4.7 million increase, which is about 6.8%.

119
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:55,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So just based on the increases that are in place and our approximations, we would be anticipating a $74 million potential request

120
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:10,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a gap that we will definitely need to address moving forward.

121
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:19,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to address the FY23 and FY24 ESSER budgets.

122
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:30,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mention this in our previous presentations, but I just wanna say how some of our ESSER funding is currently being used.

123
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:42,996
[SPEAKER_01]: for cell and counseling programs, for supervision and evaluation, professional development, for talking points and other subscriptions.

124
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:54,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are doing analyses on subscriptions that are not being used to the highest levels about dropping those.

125
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So that number,

126
00:17:57,222 --> 00:18:10,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you see a TBD listed, we are really working at looking at the usability of all of the subscriptions, and we're still in the process of calculating those numbers.

127
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:20,071
[SPEAKER_01]: For our MBTA PASS program, we will probably, this will be one of the areas that we will talk about.

128
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,572
[SPEAKER_01]: We anticipated $150,000.

129
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:33,680
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking we're going to be closer to $202,000 for next year as an anticipated expense.

130
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,842
[SPEAKER_01]: The connectivity fund, we still have as TBD.

131
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:41,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And for summer programming, we have those listed as TBD.

132
00:18:44,966 --> 00:19:01,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuing with our FY 23, 24 estimated budget, we have some numbers that are fairly similar.

133
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:07,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently right now, our engagement specialists.

134
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:19,572
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some were engagement specialists we did have a vacancy we had some turnover, and we had some engagement specialists that are not 1.0.

135
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:29,055
[SPEAKER_01]: They are working in supporting the district, but they are working for us in a point six capacity.

136
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:39,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So that also attributes for the lower number that you're seeing for behavior specialists were anticipating 130,000.

137
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,941
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the 1.0 reading specialists.

138
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:51,707
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are to carry two of them on our ESSER funding, it would be approximately 200,000.

139
00:19:51,847 --> 00:20:05,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ELL newcomer program, we do have newcomer, we currently have five newcomer staff, and we're looking at that number as well.

140
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have another,

141
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:18,890
[SPEAKER_01]: payout of $, that will be coming out of our funding.

142
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:28,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill for literacy, which is our intensive professional development that we are offering for

143
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:35,060
[SPEAKER_01]: are elementary educators who are participating in that professional development.

144
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,902
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have it at approximately 90,000.

145
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,443
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on a final number.

146
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:49,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we have new staff that also come into the school, those staff need to be trained and to come up to speed.

147
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's taking that into account.

148
00:20:51,748 --> 00:21:10,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And for restorative justice, responsive classroom, those best practices, we have approximately 100,000 set aside to be addressing those professional learning opportunities for our educators.

149
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So, our proposed so budget through the calculations.

150
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,698
[SPEAKER_01]: At the last time I presented to you.

151
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:30,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I had $250,000 that we're showing for the mathematics program that funding, it said the operating

152
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:42,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our ESSER balance right now is 3.2 million for FY 24.

153
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:53,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And the curriculum, which I talked about, I mentioned at last week's professional, at last week's committee of the whole, our new elementary literacy program.

154
00:21:55,055 --> 00:22:00,077
[SPEAKER_01]: We initially thought the literacy programs were going to be approximately $600,000.

155
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:15,303
[SPEAKER_01]: In actuality, the literacy programs that are currently being reviewed by the literacy team is in the vicinity of $800,000 to $900,000 for the adoption of the new programs.

156
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been awarded $200,000 from DESE as a grant.

157
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:46,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on which program ends up being selected by the literacy team, we would still have an estimated cost of approximately $600,000 because the cost of the programs that are being considered are significantly more.

158
00:22:46,713 --> 00:23:05,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to provide that clarification that two of the programs that made the final cut are 800 and 900,000 respectively, and the literacy team is working diligently to pick the best program for Medford.

159
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:10,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would still be an ask of 600,000 to potentially 700,000.

160
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:24,344
[SPEAKER_01]: If the most expensive program is selected so I just wanted everyone to put a little pin in that number to know that that is something we are thinking about.

161
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:51,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the restorative justice, which we talked about on the previous slide, bystander intervention at the secondary level, that's approximately 100,000, and the Hill for Literacy, again, which is our professional development programming at the elementary levels, and would be supporting, through our partnership with them, whichever new literacy program is selected.

162
00:23:55,618 --> 00:24:06,373
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, that's a slight modification from 1 million, we could say to almost 800,000 but if we do go with the more expensive program.

163
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:08,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of 600,000 that number would be 700,000.

164
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,526
[SPEAKER_01]: 800,000 900,000 so we're still kind of creeping very close to the 1 million mark.

165
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:17,309
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have 3.2 million allocated for FY 24.

166
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:35,299
[SPEAKER_01]: So a special request last week was to show the ESSER funding that Medford Public Schools received.

167
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:44,584
[SPEAKER_01]: ESSER 1 we received, we were allocated $668,052.

168
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero, as of right now, the end of year, fiscal year 23, that ESSER 1 funding is at zero.

169
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,910
[SPEAKER_01]: ESSER 2, we were awarded $2 million

170
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,819
[SPEAKER_01]: 372,520, and as of right now, that is also at zero, the balance remaining.

171
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,320
[SPEAKER_01]: ESSER III, we have 5,309,620.

172
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:24,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Our anticipated balance at the end of this year will be $3.2 million.

173
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:31,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So our total allotment allocation for ESSER funding to the Medford Public Schools was $8,350,192.

174
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:46,274
[SPEAKER_01]: In response to the mayor's question about so three funding all so three funding must be spent by September 30 2024.

175
00:25:51,545 --> 00:26:03,570
[SPEAKER_01]: That is during the first quarter of FY 25 because the new fiscal year would start on July 1 of 2024.

176
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:11,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have also begun thinking about that and looking to see for some of the programmatic needs.

177
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:19,757
[SPEAKER_01]: such as the costly literacy program that we're going to be bringing on.

178
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:27,502
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we have the $250,000 balance of the math that we're paying out of the operating budget.

179
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:34,806
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if we were to try to leave 3 quarters of a million, approximately $750,000,

180
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:46,312
[SPEAKER_01]: left on ESSER funding three to carry us over, it could help to defray the cost of some of the programs.

181
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:58,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's just a possible suggestion as we go through this budget process and we look at what is ahead of us.

182
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:17,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So our FY budgetary priorities, which I talked about last week, I, I have highlighted two sections for the committee under strategic staffing investments focused on our most vulnerable learners.

183
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:36,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We have identified a necessary need, not an optional need to provide an additional occupational therapist, and an additional speech and language pathologists, so the OT and SLP, a 2.0 FTE.

184
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:43,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Those positions are needed for our IEP needs.

185
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:52,878
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen significant increases in speech and language and OT with our youngest learners that are in our MEET programming.

186
00:27:53,278 --> 00:28:04,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to balance the needs and balance the caseloads, that was an identified need that we need to have in place for next year.

187
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:34,529
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the literacy interventionists, maintaining social workers and adjustment counselors, the expanded school day staff under professional development and specialized training, which I talked about, building-based professional development, district-wide professional development, that is critically important for us to continue to sharpen our skills so that we can really provide the best education for our students.

188
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:52,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And summer programming, which is grant dependent, but we want to continue to provide summer programming, and we are going to continue to pursue any additional grants that Desi may offer for literacy, math, fine arts, and cell.

189
00:28:53,167 --> 00:29:01,194
[SPEAKER_01]: programs to our traditional array of summer programming options, and then under miscellaneous departmental supplements.

190
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:17,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned it before, but I'm going to stress once again that as part of the signed CBA with the teacher's contract, we have a challenge at the high school with the five day schedule

191
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:24,334
[SPEAKER_01]: on the vocational side and the comprehension comprehensive side, having a six day schedule.

192
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And although the two schools are merged and they are one school.

193
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:35,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still having a six day schedule and a five day schedule that do not speak to one another.

194
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:45,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have looked into high school scheduling consultants and the best rate that we received thus far is $64,000.

195
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:55,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at other options, but our reputable consultant is $64,000.

196
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:02,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is required as part of the negotiated contract.

197
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:22,022
[SPEAKER_01]: but we would need to have this schedule completed by the spring of 2024 in order for the schedule of the high school students, by the time scheduling comes along for us to have what the new schedule would look like for the day.

198
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:29,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that would involve minutes changing, how long the blocks are, and it's a very,

199
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,090
[SPEAKER_01]: critically important and comprehensive process.

200
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as part of the agreed contract.

201
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:46,474
[SPEAKER_01]: When we change the schedule at the elementary level, and we sunsetted the early release Wednesdays.

202
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:54,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And we added the half days as part of that sun setting of the early release Wednesdays.

203
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a need for for additional specialists.

204
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that is not.

205
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,382
[SPEAKER_01]: wish or want, it's something that is truly needed.

206
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:13,447
[SPEAKER_01]: We will need four additional specialists in order for the elementary schedules to function.

207
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:25,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highlighted those two sections in bold so you can just see that those are 6.0 FTEs that were added from last week to this week.

208
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:32,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as, as a result of looking at all of these.

209
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:45,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at what's before us, we realize that as a district, we're also going to be looking at where we can reconcile.

210
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:47,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a reconciliation process?

211
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is there waste?

212
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:55,760
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I know member Graham mentioned that about like if the subscriptions aren't being used.

213
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are areas for reconciliation,

214
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:05,750
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at those areas right now very carefully to make truly informed decisions.

215
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:14,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So, looking at our budgetary capacity, where we can find savings with those instructional materials.

216
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:34,818
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are areas where grade level strands need to collapse that if there is a very very low class size to really start looking at areas to reconcile, so that we are able to bring in all of the new things that we would like to bring in for next year.

217
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:40,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Identification of external funding sources as appropriate.

218
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:45,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Identification of revolving funds.

219
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, it is a funding source not to supplant, but to support work that is happening.

220
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:59,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes looking at potential reduction in positions where necessary.

221
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,472
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that we may need to be looking at.

222
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:14,780
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at identification of capital expenditures appropriate for one time funding sources, if that is something that we are able to look at.

223
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:23,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, possible deferral of some strategic priorities.

224
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that listed as well.

225
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:51,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So our FY 24 budget drivers, I shared this with you a year ago, not a year ago, I'm sorry, last week, but I want to share what we know our growing student needs, cell, social, emotional learning, and we also are stressing the importance of intervention.

226
00:33:54,234 --> 00:34:03,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biggest arrow, our rising costs and expenses, our new CBAs, our collective bargaining agreements, our MOAs.

227
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:12,714
[SPEAKER_01]: We've ratified the teachers, the nurses, the paras, our secretarial, carpenters, Kids' Corner.

228
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:23,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be determined, we are still working on our administrators, our admin, our custodians, our monitors, and cafeteria.

229
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:34,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And using special revenue funds, we are using ESSER, which is one time, but we're also using grants.

230
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:42,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And where necessary, not to supplant, but to supplement, we would use our revolving accounts.

231
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:46,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is just an additional budget driver.

232
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:51,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to reiterate that message.

233
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:59,808
[SPEAKER_01]: As a district, we are going to continue to look at keeping students at the center of all that we do.

234
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:07,438
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna keep students at the center of our decision making.

235
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna provide data to support student-centered learning.

236
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:21,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators, which I've highlighted before, we are still providing them with important, necessary professional development.

237
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:26,597
[SPEAKER_01]: We wish to continue to partner with our community to support our students.

238
00:35:28,453 --> 00:35:31,175
[SPEAKER_01]: families and caregivers to partner with the district.

239
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:36,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal is always to be preparing our students for college and career.

240
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:44,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to continue to thrive and create a true sense of belonging for all of our students.

241
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:49,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, tiered, multi-tiered system of support

242
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Tier one, addressing all students.

243
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Tier two, for our at-risk students.

244
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Tier three, for those that are our most vulnerable, our highest risk students.

245
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:09,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always keeping that in mind, that we're trying to meet the needs of all of our learners.

246
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:16,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of our strategic priorities are based on our strategic plan.

247
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:31,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And our priority number one is implementing implementing curricular assessment instructional strategies to support all of our learners priority to.

248
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:37,459
[SPEAKER_01]: is building culture through community engagement.

249
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:48,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Our priority three, looking at equitable supports for our students, both academic and cell, meeting the physical needs of our students.

250
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:59,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And priority four, looking at our infrastructure and providing supports for all of our students, safe and supportive learning environments.

251
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are our ACEs.

252
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:09,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my final slide is our Q&A ending with our students.

253
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:17,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am prepared to respond to questions from the committee.

254
00:37:20,086 --> 00:37:20,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor?

255
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russell?

256
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:23,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

257
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:28,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the presentation, I feel much more aware of our situation than last meeting.

258
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:35,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I have enough questions to keep everybody, the rest of us going for another hour.

259
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:43,213
[SPEAKER_00]: The budgetary priorities, those don't have a dollar figure listed anywhere and they're not included in any totals anywhere, am I correct?

260
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:47,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the budgetary priorities, they're not there.

261
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:49,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be with the...

262
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,544
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not mapped out for you yet.

263
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:55,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

264
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:03,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to translate savings on instructional materials to mean that PTOs go back to buying paper.

265
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes things sound very different than they do in real life.

266
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me what side you're on?

267
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on slide, forgive me, 19.

268
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:17,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about how to save money.

269
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,348
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list of things.

270
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:23,470
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely not a comprehensive list.

271
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,553
[SPEAKER_00]: These were things that I think many of us expected to happen in the next year.

272
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:30,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Director of Communications, that position I presume is gone.

273
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:38,277
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Director of Communications and the Finance position, they are still open.

274
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so those will need to be added somewhere as additional costs here as well?

275
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:59,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we hope to have them, the Director of Communications would, it would end up being like a, because that would not be perceived as a new, because we have a retirement that is coming, so that would, hopefully one would,

276
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:04,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the salary, though, is certainly going to be dramatically higher.

277
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:08,719
[SPEAKER_00]: The health curriculum, should we just give up on that for next year?

278
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,961
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for HECAT, we're still moving forward.

279
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm on the HECAT committee.

280
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:21,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Any curriculum we purchase, or there are free ones even that are not bad, they do nothing on their own.

281
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,073
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to require a vast amount of money to train the staff.

282
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of thousands is a minimum is my guess.

283
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:37,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know because we haven't gotten that far in the process, but there's no getting us to the point where we stop teaching harmful health curriculum, which is what we have right now in Medford.

284
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:46,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one of the professionals in our committee said, if we could just teach nothing, it would be an improvement over what we have as a curriculum.

285
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:55,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will say that it's probable the staff isn't following the curriculum and is doing better, but the approved curriculum right now is harmful.

286
00:39:56,146 --> 00:40:04,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't care what a new health curriculum costs, when the professionals in health education tell us what we have would be better if we just

287
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:11,871
[SPEAKER_00]: let kids watch YouTube all or play a video game in their class instead of learning what we think they should be taught.

288
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:15,032
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really startling.

289
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:17,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope the health curriculum makes it.

290
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:23,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it the theater teacher we heard very joyously about in the last meeting, it's not gonna make the list.

291
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:26,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are really thinking creatively.

292
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:32,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We would still like to have theater offered at the district.

293
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:33,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna look,

294
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:43,204
[SPEAKER_01]: With reconciliation, we're also gonna just look at potentially creatively looking at some of our existing staff.

295
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:49,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it might not end up being a 1.0, but we still wanna be able to offer it to students.

296
00:40:49,988 --> 00:41:02,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are in the process of trying to look at other ways where we would still be able to provide, offer our students this as another opportunity for them and look at.

297
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:04,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So that again is still,

298
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:10,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We're committed to providing the greatest amount of opportunities for our students.

299
00:41:11,204 --> 00:41:11,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

300
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask one more question and then I'll pause for my others.

301
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Let other people ask questions.

302
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,575
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are currently employed that are

303
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:35,704
[SPEAKER_00]: on expiring funds, because when I look at other districts, they're trying to do, you know, not most districts, but other districts are trying to do two and three year budgets, which I recognize part of that process is in fact, theoretical because the money doesn't come yet.

304
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:43,029
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're one year away from having everybody that we paid from out of ESSER being on the street.

305
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I care very much about them, I actually care

306
00:41:48,328 --> 00:42:00,354
[SPEAKER_00]: to a greater extent with the services that they're providing to our students that will just cease in need, they will stop completely, because they will not be employed here are we talking five people are we talking 50 people.

307
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:05,777
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recognize you may not have the number but if we could get the for the next meeting or in a report.

308
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:10,579
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people work for us that are paid for out of s or funds and.

309
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:27,386
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are their positions and what do they do, because I'd like to know that this is the next you know this is the next budget we're going to face but it's very relevant now because when we're making decisions about what to cut now.

310
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:32,649
[SPEAKER_00]: it matters if we're, you know, do we cut a little here?

311
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:39,153
[SPEAKER_00]: If next year we need to really just cut a big hunk of something off so that we can afford to keep these critical people.

312
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:47,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really get a, I don't have a good sense of who it is we're paying for an investor funds and what those positions are.

313
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:51,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will let my colleagues ask questions before I come back.

314
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:51,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

315
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

316
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:57,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

317
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:02,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also wondering about the new literacy curriculum.

318
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:05,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Same question that Member Ruseau just had about the health curriculum.

319
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:15,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We are absolutely going to need literacy coaches or some other kind of professional development to go with the new curriculum or, you know, it's

320
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be spending a lot of money on a curriculum that is not going to get fully implemented if teachers don't have the support they need.

321
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:28,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that also built into this budget or is that another thing that we're going to be trying to figure out how to make happen.

322
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:35,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So, with our partnership with Hill Hill does provide some coaching and counseling.

323
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:43,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Mr. Lucy you want to share a little of the supports that he'll has provided.

324
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,590
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a total number of.

325
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:55,291
[SPEAKER_01]: coaches just yet, is it something where we would need to add 2.0 literacy coach?

326
00:43:55,311 --> 00:44:07,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a hard number for you, but I do want you to be able to say from putting on a new program and providing professional development in training for teachers.

327
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I mean, as I've mentioned before to the membership, Hill for Literacy has been able to provide a level of coaching

328
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:22,505
[SPEAKER_05]: for now this year K through three staff, but predominantly it's been focused K to two.

329
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:32,907
[SPEAKER_05]: That will continue for next year, but in terms of what you're specifically speaking about, I don't think that's reflected right now in additional coaching positions for the district.

330
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:43,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We can certainly look creatively and it's a need down the road, but right now we have the helpful literacy piece.

331
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they provide coaching, would they provide coaching specifically around the new curriculum or they still providing coaching around equity because I've started looking at these curriculums they're massive as they all are.

332
00:44:57,387 --> 00:44:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many components and so many.

333
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:06,539
[SPEAKER_03]: places where teachers are gonna need some support and understanding, what do I implement?

334
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,940
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I need to kind of ignore?

335
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, without the coaching, I'm just really concerned.

336
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:19,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be spending a lot of money on a very necessary curriculum that is not going to be implemented correctly.

337
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear that and share that feedback.

338
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of the grant that we just received,

339
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:33,327
[SPEAKER_05]: which is wonderful, the high quality materials grant from the Department of Education.

340
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:41,296
[SPEAKER_05]: We received $200,000, which is the highest threshold that they gave out to municipalities.

341
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,078
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that on the website.

342
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of that grant also includes coaching.

343
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:50,484
[SPEAKER_05]: that comes along with part of the purchase of the program.

344
00:45:51,104 --> 00:46:01,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And Hill for Literacy is an approved vendor through the Department of Education, so they will be assisting us in implementing the new program.

345
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: The kind of coaching they provide, is it somebody that's actually housed in the building?

346
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:17,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you think of, obviously, when you think of a coach that we would hire as a school system, they would be, hopefully, in theory, we'd have one at each building to help

347
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:21,382
[SPEAKER_03]: across the grade levels, their home would be the building.

348
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the hope and the dream.

349
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:35,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten to that level yet as we're still selecting the program with Hill for Literacy, but I would guess that they're not going to be a dedicated person every single day of the week.

350
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:41,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the way the coaching model is with Hill for Literacy, they're at each building twice a month.

351
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:44,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice a month.

352
00:46:44,854 --> 00:46:45,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice a month.

353
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to do it for a new, a brand new literacy curriculum.

354
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:50,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you're working hard.

355
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, this is not coming at you, but I'm just going to say to the powers that be, that's not going to cut it for a brand new literacy curriculum.

356
00:46:57,762 --> 00:47:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not, especially when we're talking about implementing the science of reading.

357
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I know teachers are already learning that through ECRI, but

358
00:47:09,298 --> 00:47:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a whole new mass of materials.

359
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:19,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a whole new style of teaching or pedagogical shift twice a month.

360
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:22,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be for each school.

361
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:32,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not there yet because right now we're still reviewing the programs, but that will be the next level of work after we have selected a program.

362
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:33,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

363
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:34,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information.

364
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,409
[SPEAKER_07]: On slide 16,

365
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:43,548
[SPEAKER_07]: which covers some of the ways we plan to spend ESSER next year.

366
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:50,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Do these amounts include professional development?

367
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it looks like it does include the curriculum and health for literacy.

368
00:47:55,252 --> 00:48:06,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just seeking some clarification on whether the professional development associated with the new curriculum is on this page as an ESSER expenditure or not.

369
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:18,315
[SPEAKER_01]: For the restorative justice and RJ bystander, the approximate 100,000 does include professional development.

370
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:23,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Cushing, you can speak to the bystander intervention, if in fact.

371
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:30,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I was referring to the literacy curriculum and the Hill for literacy numbers on that slide.

372
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:31,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the 90,000.

373
00:48:32,024 --> 00:48:34,566
[SPEAKER_05]: The Hill for literacy will, yes.

374
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:38,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Hill for literacy will be in addition to

375
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:55,520
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever program we're going with, the professional development that's associated or comes within the six-year package cost, the Hill for Literacy is in addition to the professional development that the program will provide.

376
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:59,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And does the $800,000 on the first line include professional development?

377
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:00,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

378
00:49:00,585 --> 00:49:02,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That is recommended by the curriculum provider?

379
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That will come from the vendor, yes.

380
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:06,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm reading this slide correctly,

381
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:14,434
[SPEAKER_07]: we plan to pay for the curriculum and the recommended associated professional development for the literacy curriculum through ESSER next year.

382
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:15,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true?

383
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:25,842
[SPEAKER_01]: A portion of it, because that was where I was saying we were looking at where the ESSER money technically ends on September 30th.

384
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:50,052
[SPEAKER_01]: that if we were to take that 600,000 and potentially say we're going to pay 200,000 this year on answer and defer 200,000 to f y 25, because the money has to be spent by September, and you can't pre encumber a person's salary, so that if we were to set aside a little bit of money

385
00:49:50,712 --> 00:50:06,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It would need to be on a program so it would make sense like you could on July 15, you could make a $200,000 payment and be in compliance with what answer is like the rules, making that final payment before September 30.

386
00:50:07,017 --> 00:50:14,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's just a, I didn't even do it as a separate slide but the 3.2 million which is the current balance right now.

387
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:30,317
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like maybe we could set aside 750,000 so I, and I don't even know if the key cat team would have a recommendation potentially coming up for something so it could be.

388
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,721
[SPEAKER_01]: $750,000 set aside to help pay for a little bit of programming.

389
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:44,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had the $250,000 for the math, that was on the operating budget.

390
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:50,511
[SPEAKER_01]: But this literacy, we were trying to put it on the ESSER because it qualifies.

391
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:58,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, again, it will be up to the committee to decide, but this was one of the things we were just looking at.

392
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:00,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays has the floor.

393
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:03,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything further, Member Hays?

394
00:51:05,056 --> 00:51:05,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

395
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:07,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify.

396
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:13,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have one other question, but I just want to clarify, too, that there's the professional development.

397
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you're asking about the funding for that.

398
00:51:16,202 --> 00:51:21,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I'm specifically asking about, though, is coaching, which is different than the professional development.

399
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: The ongoing coaching that teachers need to have somebody in the building when they need to troubleshoot and

400
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:32,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not just a frivolous extra expenditure.

401
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:35,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really needed when you're implementing a brand new program like this.

402
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:40,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't implemented stuff like this in 10 plus years.

403
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:42,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I have information from the chair.

404
00:51:42,948 --> 00:51:46,189
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could ask you a question, then it seems like you know what would be needed.

405
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure Ms.

406
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Kalusi and Dr. Everton would as well.

407
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:54,033
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were implementing this, how long would teachers need coaching?

408
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we talking like the full year, are we talking multiple years?

409
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I would say at least a couple of years.

410
00:52:00,513 --> 00:52:02,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, at least three years.

411
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big program.

412
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:09,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, we're also looking at not, it's not just a continuation of what they've been doing before.

413
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: because when you get into that K to two piece, that's the science of readings.

414
00:52:14,038 --> 00:52:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And even beyond that, I mean, it is really, at least the one I started looking at now, it continues that piece of morphology.

415
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:29,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they're doing all of that already, but I think it's much more comprehensive than what we've had.

416
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just can't undervalue that having the coaches there to really make sure they continue to implement it.

417
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:39,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the teachers don't have the support,

418
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:43,150
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's when things start to fall apart.

419
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,950
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't have the support to do it.

420
00:52:46,531 --> 00:53:03,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The other question I had just in looking at slide 19, when we're talking about potential reduction in positions, which is a really huge and ambiguous statement, can you give us a little more clarity on what kinds of positions you're talking about?

421
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:04,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about teaching positions?

422
00:53:04,736 --> 00:53:05,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about

423
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:11,331
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly administrative positions or director positions, what kinds of things are you looking at?

424
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:16,915
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have to look at all, like we would have to look at it from soup to nuts.

425
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:29,043
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's redundancy or, again, I think I had said something about looking at class size, looking at, you know,

426
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:46,550
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if there could be a classroom that has like very very low enrollment numbers and then you know one school has a class size of this amount and another school has a larger amount could we look at.

427
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:50,513
[SPEAKER_01]: we just have to look at all of the possibilities.

428
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:59,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if redundancies were identified, you might say, you know, I don't need this, but I need to add that.

429
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:09,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, just as you're advocating right now and saying like, you're bringing on a new literacy program, we need to be able to have like

430
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,552
[SPEAKER_01]: literacy coaches to support the implementation of a brand new program.

431
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:27,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to add literacy coaches, we most likely need to look at where we could cut something just to bring about some kind of reconciliation.

432
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:32,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would be looking at the entire district.

433
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:34,907
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it just says potential.

434
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:50,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean guaranteed, but just based on what we are working with right now, what we're looking at, we're trying to look creatively and see what we can do.

435
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

436
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:53,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that this is tough.

437
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,240
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be some tough choices to be made.

438
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering at what point, though, do we begin to actually get down to the nuts and bolts of what you're looking at?

439
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:05,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we are at the end of April already.

440
00:55:05,483 --> 00:55:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm assuming you hopefully have already started looking at what kinds of positions you might consider.

441
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:14,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little concerned when I hear about class size.

442
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, obviously, if there's some that are very small, but I'm hoping we can

443
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:23,656
[SPEAKER_03]: start by looking at positions that don't directly affect students.

444
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:33,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that is one of the pieces that we always look at who's closest to the students and look at positions that don't directly impact students.

445
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is definitely taken into consideration.

446
00:55:37,313 --> 00:55:44,299
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm saying class size, I'm not talking about increasing class size to 35 students.

447
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:49,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you might have a classroom that has a very, very low

448
00:55:52,443 --> 00:56:07,794
[SPEAKER_01]: teacher student in one building, and then the same exact grade level in another building has a fuller portfolio, just looking at where we could kind of be more equitable.

449
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:11,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is part of the analysis.

450
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:25,206
[SPEAKER_01]: This week, having back-to-back meetings, and it was a short week last week, so we're still in the process of pulling numbers and trying to calculate.

451
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:36,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And with now having a clear anticipated allocation, municipal allocation, that also made us

452
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:47,581
[SPEAKER_01]: think differently and start saying, okay, we need to think creatively because this is, we have a proposed number.

453
00:56:48,141 --> 00:57:03,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to start looking at how we can reconcile, in what ways we can reconcile where possible in the areas, like all of the things that were being said, the positions that I said were definitely required.

454
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:07,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the positions member Rousseau was just talking about,

455
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:12,737
[SPEAKER_01]: those positions that we are wanting to add to our cadre.

456
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:24,324
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going, you know, it is going to go back to those scales, I probably should have, my scales will be back for the next one, saying that we're adding here.

457
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:31,846
[SPEAKER_01]: where is it that we could make a possible reconciliation if necessary, just being prudent.

458
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:42,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with the subscriptions, if during COVID, you know, we had hybrid, we had 1300 students that were remote.

459
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:50,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we had purchased a lot of online programs and platforms.

460
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:56,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of them just aren't having the usability that we thought would have continued post pandemic.

461
00:57:57,203 --> 00:58:01,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are getting the actual, Ms.

462
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:19,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Layden is calculating the actual hard numbers for us right now of usability of the programs for us to be able to make an informed decision and say, you know, we have 30% participation where, you know, during the pandemic, it was 100% or 17%.

463
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:26,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense to pay for an entire district if we're just not getting

464
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30,593
[SPEAKER_01]: we might keep something, but just keep it in a very limited capacity.

465
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:42,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So just looking for those areas where we're being fiscally prudent and wise in that regards.

466
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:45,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

467
00:58:46,385 --> 00:58:46,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

468
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:52,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the $74 million that is listed on slide 13,

469
00:58:57,688 --> 00:59:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So does that include the communications director?

470
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:02,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

471
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:10,818
[SPEAKER_01]: The communications director is that was, I never had it listed because, um, we have a retirement, so we.

472
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:11,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

473
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure I understand what's in and what is not.

474
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:17,644
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in, but I will be able to, yeah.

475
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it include the addition of an assistant principal at the high school to bring the numbers to four instead of three?

476
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that we're looking.

477
00:59:30,892 --> 00:59:41,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So, currently at the high school, as we look at it, there are technically for people that are sitting in the role title role of assistant principal.

478
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:46,140
[SPEAKER_01]: including the vocational side of the house.

479
00:59:46,680 --> 01:00:04,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at the high school very closely and at our May 1st presentation, May 1st meeting, Mr. Welch will be presenting a recommendation, his recommendations as well for a potential structure.

480
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:25,672
[SPEAKER_01]: for the high school, but there are other ways where we could get to the same amount of additional coverage, but might not be through, it could be that we add an additional assistant principal, it could be through the addition of a different position.

481
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

482
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:35,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So the high school isn't, the short answer is yes, the high school is included.

483
01:00:35,777 --> 01:00:44,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there, there could be more than one option that's presented to the committee that's presented as a potential structure.

484
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,781
[SPEAKER_07]: But the current $74 million does not include any additional staffing over what is there today?

485
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:55,602
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

486
01:00:56,202 --> 01:00:56,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

487
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:06,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And the $74 million does not include dollars associated with implementing our HECAT curriculum recommendation.

488
01:01:07,604 --> 01:01:12,507
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it definitely does not include the HECAT.

489
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:23,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And does $74 million contemplate the increased salary impacts of hiring three new principals and the set of dominoes that that could require?

490
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:32,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the 74 million would include what we were currently at right now.

491
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not include if it was some.

492
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there is some consideration there.

493
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:41,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes.

494
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:43,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But no.

495
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:45,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

496
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:52,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, if we have to pay one penny over what we're paying today, then that is not, that is not in the 74 million dollars.

497
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:52,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

498
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:53,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

499
01:01:53,596 --> 01:01:54,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, ma'am.

500
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, member McLaughlin.

501
01:01:56,325 --> 01:02:06,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to the chair, I'm curious if you'll clarify the dominoes that you mentioned that the high school principals effect could have, what were you referring to?

502
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:15,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I think every time we bring in folks at various levels, the people who have been at the district for 20 years or 15 years,

503
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:25,622
[SPEAKER_07]: look at the increased salary that we're paying to somebody who just walked in the door and say, what about me?

504
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:38,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a set of dominoes that happens and especially it is absolutely present right now in the marketplace because people are unwilling to work for the rates that they once were.

505
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:46,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have a really thin labor pool, we have a lot of market pressure and I think we have to be prepared.

506
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:53,490
[SPEAKER_07]: new high school principals are making at least $40,000 more than our high school principal makes.

507
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just a fact.

508
01:02:56,952 --> 01:03:01,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we want a high school principal, we're going to have to contend with that fact in some fashion.

509
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:07,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that creates a whole set of considerations that we need to be planning for.

510
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:27,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I will admit, I am finding it really hard to process what we're saying is our recommendation versus what we're saying is our doomsday scissors approach to get to the number that we are likely to receive from the city.

511
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:38,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like us to think about how to make it clear, like what do we believe that we need to run the district next year

512
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:46,393
[SPEAKER_07]: it's okay if that means like we don't need subscriptions but subscriptions is like not even close to remotely covering the gap that we're talking about here.

513
01:03:46,513 --> 01:04:01,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I would like on May 1st for the presentation to exclusively be about what is our recommendation because it's our job to advocate in front of the city and the mayor to tell the community what we need for our schools.

514
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:03,786
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't do that, nobody will do it.

515
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think it's really incumbent on us to lay that out thoughtfully so that

516
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:15,984
[SPEAKER_07]: when we look at that list and we say, yes, this is the number, we know that it means pre-literacy coaches.

517
01:04:16,324 --> 01:04:18,525
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that it means one theater teacher.

518
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:24,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that it means two FTEs for OT and speech therapy, like that we know what it means.

519
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:34,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So then when we have to start crossing things off the list, it's really clear like where we started and what hard decisions we had to make.

520
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:37,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Those hard decisions, 90% of our costs are people.

521
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:41,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So those hard decisions are about positions by and large.

522
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:53,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think on May 1st, we really need to have a crystal clear presentation that says, here's the dollar amount for our contractual obligations only.

523
01:04:53,745 --> 01:04:54,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are the additions.

524
01:04:55,366 --> 01:04:59,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what they each cost so that we really are clear what we're asking for.

525
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can get to work on the hard decisions, which

526
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: have to come.

527
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:14,833
[SPEAKER_07]: However, like we still don't know what the what the consolidated house and senate budget will be, right?

528
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:20,115
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the governor's proposal but we don't have house and we don't have the joint ways and means budget.

529
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:33,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Um what we do know is that the the state has given us a few million dollars and not all of that is slated to come via that 71 million dollars that we're anticipating being allocated.

530
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:33,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

531
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:38,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to think that there's an opportunity for us to make a case there.

532
01:05:38,592 --> 01:05:41,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city is sitting on $25 million of free cash.

533
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:53,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to think there's an opportunity to demonstrate to the community that there is a very good reason to dip into the giant pile of free cash to get us through what is another lean year.

534
01:05:53,302 --> 01:05:55,704
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my fourth year, my fourth budget.

535
01:05:55,764 --> 01:05:57,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the third one that's bad.

536
01:05:59,398 --> 01:06:08,285
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to talk about there, and we can talk about that at some point in time, but I think we can't do that unless we're clear on what it is that we thought we needed in the first place.

537
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:16,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think what's happening right now is all of that stuff is getting mushed together, and I think it's really hard to understand what we're trying to accomplish by doing that.

538
01:06:16,732 --> 01:06:21,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to make a motion that- I actually have a point of information on that too, excuse me.

539
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:22,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

540
01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:23,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

541
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:25,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in terms of the, so on slide four,

542
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:31,807
[SPEAKER_08]: if I'm understanding correctly, it's saying that May 1st, we're gonna have another budget meeting, right?

543
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:38,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in between that and the school committee request, there's gonna be a meeting with the superintendent's recommendations, right?

544
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:39,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's what...

545
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:53,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So May 1st, it'll be a budget meeting, and at the May 1st meeting, I will be presenting my formal recommendations to the committee.

546
01:06:56,034 --> 01:07:01,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the way that our schedule ended up being back-to-back meetings,

547
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:11,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a for a four day week, and we had a meeting last Monday so it really only left us three days and then we received the official.

548
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:16,417
[SPEAKER_01]: The anticipated allocation.

549
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,000
[SPEAKER_01]: When we had the anticipated allocation.

550
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:19,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I.

551
01:07:21,443 --> 01:07:27,829
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted the committee, just to be able to see that this is the anticipated number that we received.

552
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:36,957
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're thinking, just, you know, just between our ordinary expenses.

553
01:07:37,697 --> 01:07:43,441
[SPEAKER_01]: and our personnel expenses, we were anticipating a 6.8% increase.

554
01:07:43,461 --> 01:08:02,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to provide the committee with that number to say that we were thinking that 6.8% came up to about 4.7 million, which is why I was showing the approximate $74 million request.

555
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:05,478
[SPEAKER_01]: But we- I think I still have the floor, right?

556
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:08,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just that the point of information hasn't been answered.

557
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:09,960
[SPEAKER_08]: So may I ask again?

558
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

559
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:18,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm still not understanding on slide four, we have under budget meetings, we have April 3, April 10, and May 1.

560
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:29,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Then in between school committee request and budget meetings, there's a superintendent's recommendation TBD for a date.

561
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:33,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So that I'm confused by that when folks are saying,

562
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:41,076
[SPEAKER_08]: The may one meeting is going to be the superintendent's recommendation because this graphic on page for suggest that there's going to be.

563
01:08:41,946 --> 01:08:44,827
[SPEAKER_08]: time in between that for a meeting with the superintendent's recommendation.

564
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:46,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need that clarified.

565
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:52,768
[SPEAKER_01]: On slide five, I did, I tried to map out the objectives.

566
01:08:53,268 --> 01:09:07,171
[SPEAKER_01]: My slide five was an homage to you, Member McLaughlin, where you were just saying to kind of pass out what we were anticipating has been happening in terms of what the objectives have been thus far.

567
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:10,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the May 1st meeting,

568
01:09:12,913 --> 01:09:21,955
[SPEAKER_01]: My hope was to present my recommendations to you at the May 1 meeting that was going to give us time.

569
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:27,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have our community engagement meeting on April 26.

570
01:09:29,797 --> 01:09:37,945
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear from members of the community who want to provide feedback or things that they would love to see happen.

571
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:52,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted that meeting to happen and just gather that additional data so that I would be able to fold that in to my presentation on May 1st.

572
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:54,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we need to add,

573
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:59,562
[SPEAKER_01]: another meeting, we can always do that as well.

574
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:00,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

575
01:10:01,862 --> 01:10:03,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Grimm and then Member Kreatz.

576
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:04,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

577
01:10:07,824 --> 01:10:20,066
[SPEAKER_07]: On the budget priorities list, you do mention that we need four additional specialists for the elementary school, but it doesn't describe what they will do

578
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:21,909
[SPEAKER_07]: What will they do?

579
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides fill a spot in the schedule.

580
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:31,155
[SPEAKER_01]: We intentionally were vague on that one.

581
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:33,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at a lot of options.

582
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:43,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at STEM, we're looking at STEAM, we're looking at potential literacy.

583
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:46,505
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of options on the table.

584
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:48,086
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to look at

585
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:57,186
[SPEAKER_01]: which additional specialists will enhance the elementary schools the most.

586
01:10:58,486 --> 01:11:05,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just for right now, but like long-term.

587
01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:10,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of the conversation that I'm having with the central office team.

588
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:18,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons why I said STEM is we did invest heavily in FOSS.

589
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:34,993
[SPEAKER_01]: science, and we've just been thinking about stem and saying like we made a big investment in stem and are we providing students with the maximum amount of stem exposure as well so I.

590
01:11:35,954 --> 01:12:00,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have it fully defined for what that position is going to be just yet in terms of part of our greater strategy at the elementary level, but we know that we need an additional 4.0 FTEs so that one would be assigned to each school in order for the new schedule to work next year.

591
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:01,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information?

592
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:03,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Member Ruseau.

593
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:07,328
[SPEAKER_00]: When we keep saying specialists, we mean new teachers, right?

594
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:08,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers that are in the MTA.

595
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:09,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

596
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:10,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

597
01:12:10,129 --> 01:12:14,692
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the confusion, because specialists could be, I mean, anything.

598
01:12:15,773 --> 01:12:20,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't think it's clear that that, I don't know if Member Graham was trying to ask, like, are we talking about four new teachers?

599
01:12:20,995 --> 01:12:21,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're talking about.

600
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:30,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Four new teachers, four new teachers to cover an offering that we would be providing our students with at the elementary levels.

601
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

602
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:38,265
[SPEAKER_07]: If I look at page 15 and 16, if I add up the columns about FY 24, I get to about $2,000,000 and $2,020,000.

603
01:12:38,305 --> 01:12:40,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like we have 3.2 million.

604
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So does that mean that we only have anticipated ESSER spending

605
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:02,606
[SPEAKER_07]: with still about 1.1 million to go.

606
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:06,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just having a hard time making the math add up to 3.2.

607
01:13:07,108 --> 01:13:18,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's supposed to, but I can't tell if something is missing or if it's just that we haven't decided how to use that remaining $1 million yet.

608
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:31,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say to you we have slide 15 is again our best, our best estimate of where we think we are and we do have a few TBDs.

609
01:13:34,268 --> 01:13:44,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are looking on our end to see what has to be on ESSER, what could potentially be on operating, so that that's why there was a little

610
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:58,502
[SPEAKER_01]: a little wiggle room, not much, but our current ESSER, when we did that calculation, it was, we're at the 3.2 million as a balance.

611
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:01,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that is.

612
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:05,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're saying you're not sure, you're calculating 2.2 million.

613
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm calculating what we're planning to spend in FY24 to be 2.02 million.

614
01:14:14,164 --> 01:14:15,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have $3.2 million.

615
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:19,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that means there's still a million dollars untagged.

616
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:20,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

617
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:20,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

618
01:14:21,747 --> 01:14:22,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is correct.

619
01:14:23,148 --> 01:14:36,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were meeting, when I said the $750,000, when we were meeting and trying to say, could we carry a few of the programs onto the FY25?

620
01:14:37,293 --> 01:14:44,037
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to see if we didn't if we did not spend all 3.2 million right now during FY 24.

621
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:51,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we like squirrel away 750,000 to help pay for some of the programs and not people.

622
01:14:51,882 --> 01:15:00,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, you know, that would leave us with a little bit of extra cushion for FY 25 operating budget, because

623
01:15:01,287 --> 01:15:07,290
[SPEAKER_01]: as of September 30th, 2024, ESSER III is gone and it's not coming back.

624
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

625
01:15:09,091 --> 01:15:28,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And my last comment is a motion to, so I'd like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendation only include our request to the municipal government and that it refrain from talking about

626
01:15:30,854 --> 01:15:32,934
[SPEAKER_07]: the hard decisions that come next.

627
01:15:35,715 --> 01:15:36,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you state that one more time?

628
01:15:37,755 --> 01:15:58,300
[SPEAKER_07]: That the superintendent's recommendation, her presentation on May 1st will only contain our recommendation for the FY 24 budget or our request for the FY 24 budget and that it will not simultaneously seek to deal with

629
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:01,860
[SPEAKER_07]: decisions that might need to be made after the fact.

630
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

631
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, member McLaughlin.

632
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just some clarification on that.

633
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:18,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So, again, going back to the schedule of what we're talking about, if May one is the superintendent's recommendation and then we are gonna have a public meeting, right?

634
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we are gonna have a school committee meeting to discuss.

635
01:16:21,697 --> 01:16:25,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Um I just wanna clarify if through the chair, if member Graham is asking that

636
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:41,994
[SPEAKER_08]: what the superintendent presents on May 1 is her recommendation not backed into an allocation because we haven't really sort of asked for the allocation at this point, at that point.

637
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:43,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not really clear.

638
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys follow me?

639
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:47,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

640
01:16:50,499 --> 01:16:56,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess I'm asking for some clarity on what the motion is actually asking for.

641
01:16:57,972 --> 01:17:10,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I am asking that the presentation on May 1st be purely our request to the municipal government for what we believe we need in FY24 to operate Medford Public Schools in a responsible manner.

642
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:14,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So, when you say, may I check?

643
01:17:15,061 --> 01:17:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

644
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:15,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

645
01:17:15,622 --> 01:17:17,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So, when you say our, who is our?

646
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:18,703
[SPEAKER_07]: The school committee.

647
01:17:19,984 --> 01:17:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: But what they want is the superintendent's recommendation.

648
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,786
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still going to be deliberating their recommendation.

649
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not our recommendation.

650
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:27,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

651
01:17:28,456 --> 01:17:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

652
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:43,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And just from the floor, we're pushing into May, and there is has been an allocation so we do have to start making the tough choices or at least the planning has to be done by central administration is sooner than may one.

653
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:49,415
[SPEAKER_06]: point of order member Rousseau.

654
01:17:50,296 --> 01:18:08,386
[SPEAKER_00]: The committee decides what our process will be so receiving a memo that tells us what we're going to get for an allocation does not change what this body will do and we have a process that we have implemented for three years now and we will create a request that will say what we need to operate this district

655
01:18:09,346 --> 01:18:16,050
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of what the municipality is going to give us, that unless the committee decides to change our process, that's what we're going to do.

656
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:25,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a memo does not immediately decide that we don't have to do our jobs and that the superintendent doesn't have to tell us what's needed to make this district function and flourish.

657
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:28,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not related things.

658
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:37,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So I disagree very much that receiving that memo last Friday suddenly short circuits our process.

659
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:48,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from the chair I'm not I'm not saying it does it all but in the past you haven't had a number this soon to at least be able to somewhat plan, even if they ask as far more than what is allocated.

660
01:18:50,503 --> 01:18:51,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

661
01:18:53,164 --> 01:19:01,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I'm asking for is clarification between the superintendent's recommendation and the school committee's recommendation, because those could potentially be two different things.

662
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:15,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So the superintendent on May 1, if she's gonna share her recommendations with us based on the information that she's given us up to this point, then I would assume May 1 is what she's representing as the superintendent as her recommendation.

663
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:34,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the, according to the schedule, and this is what I'm trying to differentiate because I do, through the chair to member Ruseau's point, I do think that there is potentially a difference between what that school committee recommendation might be for the allocation and potentially what the superintendents might be.

664
01:19:34,344 --> 01:19:35,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is exactly the point.

665
01:19:36,464 --> 01:19:45,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm trying to get clarification on that motion because I'm just looking at our calendar and trying to find it for us when we're meeting.

666
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:51,552
[SPEAKER_08]: to decide what we're going to put forward our school committee request May 15th or June 5th.

667
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:58,774
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's a substantial amount of time between May one, when the superintendent's making her recommendations, we still have to have the public meeting.

668
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:02,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we decide what our allocation is not May one.

669
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:09,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess what I'm trying to get is I hear, I hear what I think people are saying, which is that we want a real

670
01:20:10,481 --> 01:20:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding of what our school needs in terms of not backing into a number.

671
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:14,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally get that.

672
01:20:14,864 --> 01:20:23,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And frankly, I agree with that, but I think I'm not sure that I understand the motion for May 1st, because I think that that's the superintendent's discretion.

673
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:27,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the school committee's job is to decide whether they accept that or not.

674
01:20:29,552 --> 01:20:37,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my ask is that when the superintendent makes that recommendation to us, it is not muddied with hard decisions

675
01:20:38,018 --> 01:20:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: that she has to work on in parallel.

676
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally fine.

677
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:49,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize that that's the reality, but we can't do our jobs unless we hear from her what she thinks this district needs to operate.

678
01:20:50,467 --> 01:21:00,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we can't do on May 1st is get something that is like a mishmash of what I need and what I know I'm gonna get, because then we can't do our job.

679
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:03,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just asking that the superintendent's recommendation

680
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:11,104
[SPEAKER_07]: be clear and distinct about what she is asking this city to provide on her behalf.

681
01:21:11,944 --> 01:21:19,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and then if we have things to add, things to change, that's what would happen, you know, after that meeting.

682
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:23,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, it by and large is going to be what she recommends.

683
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:31,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean that we think small things change year every year but there's we we can't make wholesale changes without the right data.

684
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:40,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I I'm just asking that we not muddy the water on May 1st with a bunch of stuff that has to come and maybe it comes on May 15th.

685
01:21:40,566 --> 01:21:45,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally fine with that but we need a basis that is clear and clean.

686
01:21:47,411 --> 01:21:48,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information there.

687
01:21:49,453 --> 01:21:51,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information that member has been waiting.

688
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:51,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

689
01:21:51,695 --> 01:21:51,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

690
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:52,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to understand.

691
01:21:52,936 --> 01:21:57,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So, is this is the 74 million that we're talking about in this meeting not

692
01:21:59,636 --> 01:22:04,218
[SPEAKER_08]: clarification in terms of what is needed versus what her recommendation might be?

693
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:11,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it doesn't contain any of the things on the needs slide, and it doesn't contain- You mean broken out?

694
01:22:12,221 --> 01:22:24,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this slide, slide 18, none of these things are in $74 million, nor is the HECAT, nor is- I knew the HECAT was, but none of these things are?

695
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,226
[SPEAKER_07]: None of the priorities are?

696
01:22:25,726 --> 01:22:26,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

697
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:34,099
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 74 professional development and the restorative.

698
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm sorry, I'm misunderstanding this.

699
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:40,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The ESSER expenses are different than the priorities.

700
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:54,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So none of the budgetary priorities are included, but they were included under ESSER, and so they're gonna be expiring 2024, so then they're not included in what the 74 million is that she's recommending.

701
01:22:55,385 --> 01:22:57,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the superintendent is recommending.

702
01:22:57,085 --> 01:22:59,166
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know, she's not recommending, she's talking about.

703
01:22:59,666 --> 01:23:00,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that accurate?

704
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,126
[SPEAKER_07]: That is my understanding.

705
01:23:02,146 --> 01:23:07,408
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I think we need a clear picture of what the ask is.

706
01:23:07,688 --> 01:23:16,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can say, yes, we agree with the ask or no, you have to add this to the ask, or maybe like, I know you want this thing, but we have to take it out of the ask.

707
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:23,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that is work we have to do, but we can't do it until we have just a clear picture of what that number, what those numbers are.

708
01:23:25,632 --> 01:23:26,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is no second on my motion.

709
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:27,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

710
01:23:30,455 --> 01:23:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: by Member Graham, seconded by Member Hays.

01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:37,000

[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

719
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:49,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

720
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:50,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McDone.

721
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:51,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

01:23:52,671 --> 01:23:53,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rissell, yes.

[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

724
01:23:54,832 --> 01:23:56,894
[SPEAKER_06]: No, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

725
01:23:57,334 --> 01:23:58,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

726
01:23:58,555 --> 01:23:59,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz.

727
01:23:59,656 --> 01:23:59,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

728
01:24:01,018 --> 01:24:03,760
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I wanted to thank you for adding the numbers to the slideshow.

729
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I did reach out to you to ask you to do that.

730
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:06,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very helpful.

731
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:10,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had questions and they were already answered.

732
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:16,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the same question about the specialists of 4.0 and then the reductions.

733
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:23,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going back to the motion that was just made, the question I have is, I guess I'm a little bit unclear.

734
01:24:23,735 --> 01:24:30,821
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the slide 18, where it has the budget priorities, it's bolded that we clearly,

735
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:39,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's critical that we get the OT and SLP 2.0 and then also the elementary specialists.

736
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:44,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm not understanding is like, so those are the budget priorities.

737
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:51,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to be funding those with the ESSER money and not the budget money?

738
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:54,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I just I'm not sure that's why.

739
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm just i'm not sure.

740
01:24:58,264 --> 01:25:09,837
[SPEAKER_01]: For the ot the SLP the specialist those who are thinking would be coming on on the official operating budget, so these are just other budgetary.

741
01:25:11,246 --> 01:25:18,351
[SPEAKER_01]: priorities that are needed, so we would want them on the regular operating, the general fund.

742
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:38,125
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not allocated, we weren't thinking about these for ESSER, and again, with this being year three, or the final year of ESSER, these positions we wanted to have on the operating budget, because ESSER, we just have it for one more year.

743
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I ask another question for clarification on that?

744
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:56,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the number for the 74 million, are these needs in there or we're going to have to build them into that number?

745
01:25:58,134 --> 01:26:07,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 74 million is, let me just go to the right side, is inclusive of how we've anticipated

746
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:14,119
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the colors the increase the fixed costs.

747
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,722
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we got to that three point.

748
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:18,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just find the right side.

749
01:26:19,184 --> 01:26:22,368
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1.4 in the 3.3 million.

750
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:29,315
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1.4 million is the ordinary expenses the non salary, all of the things that I was.

751
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:48,060
[SPEAKER_01]: The out of transportation those things which are non salary positions, and then the 3.3 million is for our settled CBAs are memorandums of agreement, our contracts, those personnel expenses so those are like guaranteed those aren't maybe

752
01:26:48,720 --> 01:27:06,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are guaranteed the 3.3 million is a guaranteed amount, so that 3.3 in personnel expenses, the 1.4 in you know the gas the electric and transportation and the cleaning contracts, all of those ordinary expenses.

753
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:08,531
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just giving the 4.7.

754
01:27:09,352 --> 01:27:21,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what I was trying to show was that ordinary expenses our personnel expenses alone with nothing really new was a 6.8% increase totaling 4.7 million.

755
01:27:25,848 --> 01:27:29,011
[SPEAKER_01]: which is where I just was saying approximately 74 million.

756
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:44,326
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not including the new positions of the elementary teachers, the four elementary specialists teaching positions, the occupational therapists, the speech and language pathologists.

757
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just six positions right there that we know

758
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:55,174
[SPEAKER_01]: we currently don't have right now, and their positions that we will need for next year.

759
01:27:55,734 --> 01:28:09,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that number is just letting you know, this is what our calculation is for Medford public schools to continue functioning the exact way that it is right now.

760
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:15,423
[SPEAKER_01]: just increased bills and all of the settled CBAs.

761
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we still have four more that we're working on.

762
01:28:20,084 --> 01:28:26,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So that number, the 3.3 million will go up by the end of the year.

763
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:29,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

764
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had one more question and it's on slide 19.

765
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:38,990
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the examples of the deferral of some of the strategic priorities?

766
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:41,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious about what those might be.

767
01:28:47,194 --> 01:28:50,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays was communicating with me earlier today.

768
01:28:50,415 --> 01:29:06,144
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some, there were some additional supplemental, I'm gonna just look at the list of what we had that was deferred from last year.

769
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:36,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally though, this is just deferral of some priorities that we wish we could afford, but we don't have the funding because right now it looks like the $74 million doesn't even include the $2 to $3.2 million you're going to use of ESSER funding.

770
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:41,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have a $5, $6 million budget gap just in the schools alone.

771
01:29:41,739 --> 01:29:45,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have a devastating cliff next year and the year after.

772
01:29:46,061 --> 01:29:49,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Devastating, if that was ever how we want to operate.

773
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:50,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree.

774
01:29:50,223 --> 01:29:51,223
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to do just

775
01:29:51,584 --> 01:30:06,616
[SPEAKER_06]: what you think you need on May 1, but at the same time, I respectfully ask that central administration do the hard work, and even if you don't present it till the 15th, that it be done, because you cannot use free cash to sustain a $6 million budget gap.

776
01:30:06,716 --> 01:30:07,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be devastating.

777
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:14,420
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of a deferred position was like we had something, a transportation coordinator.

778
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,181
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a deferred position that didn't end up happening.

779
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:31,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were other positions that we kind of really hoped for and just, you know, when we prioritized a year ago, that's one of the positions that was deferred.

780
01:30:32,605 --> 01:30:38,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the interventionists at that point in time ended up being deferred positions.

781
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:40,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

782
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

783
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:54,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be, I think we need to be really crystal clear with people using the word deferred is a really nice way of saying we're not able to fund it.

784
01:30:54,510 --> 01:31:00,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And many, if not all of the positions we deferred last year are not going to be funded this year.

785
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:05,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I understand correctly, you know, we were told in the past that

786
01:31:06,351 --> 01:31:08,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year might even be a more difficult fiscal year.

787
01:31:09,472 --> 01:31:21,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not really just deferring these were saying these, you know, and some of these were literacy interventionists at the high school career counselor at the high school math coaches, we had a lot of really.

788
01:31:23,874 --> 01:31:27,056
[SPEAKER_03]: These weren't, again, extraneous or extra things.

789
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: These were things that we really felt kids critically needed.

790
01:31:30,758 --> 01:31:44,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So people, the community needs to understand that we need to be clear that calling them deferred until a subsequent fiscal year means we can't fund them and we're not likely to fund them in the next, at least the next year or two.

791
01:31:45,387 --> 01:31:48,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that's spelled out clearly to people.

792
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:50,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

793
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can discuss overrides.

794
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:53,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's discussed in the city council,

795
01:31:54,753 --> 01:32:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to give you an example, Newton did a 90 or $100 million override for two new schools that passed.

796
01:32:02,295 --> 01:32:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: But their $10 million override for the budget school and general fund budget failed.

797
01:32:07,757 --> 01:32:14,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just something that we cannot depend on for the priorities that we would like to see on the city and school side.

798
01:32:14,878 --> 01:32:17,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have the same issues on the city side.

799
01:32:17,099 --> 01:32:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not even including public safety, 10 new positions being requested.

800
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:27,301
[SPEAKER_06]: plus another 10 covered by ARPA that is also gonna reach a cliff, but we are planning accordingly.

801
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:33,004
[SPEAKER_06]: We are gonna start not filling positions as they become vacated.

802
01:32:33,204 --> 01:32:45,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also making sure that anybody hired, it specifically says in their offer letter, this is a one year position paid for by ARPA that will not be covered after such and such date.

803
01:32:45,609 --> 01:32:49,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has to be done on the school side, just like we're doing it on the city side.

804
01:32:49,517 --> 01:32:51,798
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to have some serious issues.

805
01:32:52,078 --> 01:32:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, Member Ruseau.

806
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:55,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

807
01:32:55,339 --> 01:33:01,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree that we need to hear about that next step really quickly in the follow on.

808
01:33:01,621 --> 01:33:12,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to make a motion that the superintendent will present her plan to close the gap that we know will exist at our May 15th meeting.

809
01:33:16,826 --> 01:33:19,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Hays.

810
01:33:19,147 --> 01:33:19,888
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

811
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:20,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

812
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:20,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

813
01:33:20,989 --> 01:33:21,669
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

814
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

815
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:23,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

816
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, and then I know we have the Chief of Police here, who's here for 6 p.m.

817
01:33:27,212 --> 01:33:27,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

818
01:33:28,273 --> 01:33:37,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the cherry sheets, which is the state's, there's a set of different cherry sheets, but those are the amount of revenue the state plans to send to Medford.

819
01:33:38,859 --> 01:33:41,381
[SPEAKER_00]: In this year, Medford is getting a 20% increase

820
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:49,209
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll receive $3.76 million more that the state says is for education.

821
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:53,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities, cities do have the freedom to spend that money any which way they want.

822
01:33:54,172 --> 01:33:57,734
[SPEAKER_00]: The state could give us that 3.76 and the mayor could use it for pavement.

823
01:33:58,074 --> 01:33:59,295
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legal and allowed.

824
01:34:00,596 --> 01:34:13,143
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do find it very concerning that the state has believes we need $3.76 million more for education and we're only getting 45% of that in this new budget.

825
01:34:14,624 --> 01:34:22,430
[SPEAKER_00]: That 55% of the money that the state said here Medford, you need more money for education 55% of that money.

826
01:34:22,911 --> 01:34:38,944
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor is choosing to do something else with, and that is 100% her authority, and we can do nothing about it but I think it's really important, and this set $3.76 million is the governor's budget that usually goes up as the legislature

827
01:34:39,605 --> 01:34:42,327
[SPEAKER_00]: gets their hands on their proposed budget.

828
01:34:42,447 --> 01:34:45,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So this number is almost certainly just going to go up.

829
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:55,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I was very surprised to see that that's what the cherry sheet said and what the governor's budget said we should be getting more for education.

830
01:34:56,635 --> 01:34:58,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I think those numbers speak for themselves.

831
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:06,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to adjourn?

832
01:35:07,181 --> 01:35:07,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

833
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:13,111
[SPEAKER_06]: mission to turn by member Graham seconded by member laugh line all those in favor aye all those
