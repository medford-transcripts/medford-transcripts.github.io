[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli wishes to be recognized, and the petitioner is present at the rail.

89
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you very much, Mr. President.

90
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:28,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that as we've had discussions in the past, one of the biggest

91
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:41,621
[SPEAKER_15]: issues we've had with our public utilities and our utility companies is the work that they're, the, the, the, the road in the sidewalks that they're left after they perform work.

92
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:54,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we've asked for our, um, um, DPW director to report back to us and give us an idea of what in the past, what was, what has been done and what has been replaced and what hasn't been replaced.

93
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:54,473
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

94
00:07:56,052 --> 00:08:19,862
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the biggest concerns I've been hearing from our constituents is that where we've had excavation work being done, that there are, after the utilities leave, we have sinkholes and issues with our sidewalks that aren't being replaced the way that they were supposed to be.

95
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So where there was cement, there's now hot tub.

96
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,804
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is rampant throughout the city.

97
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:26,794
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be honest with you.

98
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:41,503
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is one of the things that I find appalling since I've been here in just this short year that our public utilities are coming in and we have these, these recommendations that they need to follow and they're not being followed.

99
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:54,270
[SPEAKER_15]: So I as one, I, I, I will not vote until I get a better understanding with meetings with the public utilities and a DPW director and making sure that somebody is overseeing these,

100
00:08:55,231 --> 00:09:01,154
[SPEAKER_15]: these entities and making sure that our streets are left the way they found them.

101
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:14,441
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know that it's probably not your doing with all of them, but unfortunately you're here tonight and I find it upsetting.

102
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:18,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, in this situation here, National Grid is not doing the digging.

103
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:22,068
[SPEAKER_20]: The contractor from 640 Bosnaf is doing the digging.

104
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Could you identify the owner of 640 Bosnaf?

105
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:37,975
[SPEAKER_20]: It's probably going to be an NEI general contractor from Randolph, Mass.

106
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:42,557
[SPEAKER_15]: No, is he working with National Grid?

107
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:43,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

108
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:52,284
[SPEAKER_20]: The, the contract is actually installing the conduit and, uh, we don't approve it until our trenches specter goes out and approves it.

109
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause it has to make sure it has to be a certain depth.

110
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, we have to fill it with flow bill fill and, um,

111
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,238
[SPEAKER_20]: and then we'll give it the approval for that.

112
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're not actually doing the digging.

113
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, but it's your job.

114
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:10,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So when the job is complete, you're coming in making sure.

115
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:13,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm going to give you just a personal example.

116
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:25,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe about six months back, at 10 o'clock at night, there was a private contractor fixing sidewalk and a street on a dead end.

117
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:29,817
[SPEAKER_15]: When I approached him at 10.30 because the neighbors were calling because they're waking their kid,

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,842
[SPEAKER_15]: as they were using the compactor, I said, what are you doing here?

119
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:39,587
[SPEAKER_15]: And they said, we were here because National Grid did some work and we were told to come here tonight to replace it.

120
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, would you like me to stop?

121
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, absolutely, I'd like you to stop.

122
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,394
[SPEAKER_15]: To this day, if you'd like to go in front of 18 Butler Street, it's not cement anymore.

123
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:55,800
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about an eight year old, eight year job of new sidewalks and new street, and it's now hot top there.

124
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,602
[SPEAKER_15]: So I haven't got an answer back from the DPW director,

125
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:03,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't talked to anybody from National Grid except for you right now because you're here asking for this.

126
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:23,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you weren't here asking for this, I wouldn't be able to explain the frustration I felt so far on this committee that, and this is, I mentioned it once, I got five phone calls from South Medford and Main Street that replacement has now turned into sinkholes and patches weren't filled the correct way.

127
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:27,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, again, I apologize that you have to be

128
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:36,734
[SPEAKER_15]: the bearer of this bad news with my aggravation toward it, but I don't know how my colleagues feel about it, but this is something that I feel strongly about, so.

129
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:44,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

130
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:48,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for your input.

131
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:56,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that you might be referring to a paper that I put forward asking the engineering division to provide us with a list of the permits that were issued to open up our streets to public utilities.

132
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:05,072
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as a report back as to the status of those streets, whether or not they were restored to the City of Medford standards or whether or not that work is still pending.

133
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:10,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen a number of problems, Mr. President, when it comes down to the private utilities in our community.

134
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:18,880
[SPEAKER_11]: If you drive down today, if you drive down Lawrence Road, you'll see a patch on the side of the road as you approach Forest Street that's an absolute disaster.

135
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,413
[SPEAKER_11]: You look at the work that they did on Doonan Street.

136
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:22,734
[SPEAKER_11]: They damaged private driveways.

137
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:31,720
[SPEAKER_11]: It took a year and a half for them to get out there after me screaming and yelling and beating my chest in order to get them out there to fix the private driveway that they damaged when they put their stabilization bars and their excavator down, Mr. President.

138
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:39,726
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that what's happening here is that the public utilities are getting a number of permits very fast and very furiously, and they're tearing up our city streets.

139
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:45,229
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're not able to keep up with the work that they're doing to make sure that it's done in compliance with our standard, Mr. President.

140
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:56,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a firm believer that if the public utilities are going to come into our community and tear up our street, that they should repave them curb to curb, as opposed to these, you know, 16-inch trenches that go down the middle of the street.

141
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:02,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I also know, though, Mr. President, that a lot of that stuff is dictated by state law as to what it is that they're required to do and what they're not required to do.

142
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:11,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I'd ask that the matter be held until we get a response from the engineering division relative to what I believe would be paper 16404.

143
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

144
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:32,367
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight that the paper be held in abeyance until a suitable response has been found and received by the council in response to the paper that was sent out several weeks ago, Councilor.

145
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I believe it was filed Mr. President in March or April and then reintroduced again two weeks ago.

146
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and still haven't been able to be provided that list.

147
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that, um, I put the paper forward, I think right after St.

148
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Patrick's day, um, requested an update right before the summer break.

149
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, didn't get it.

150
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Then requested another update again within the last three or four meetings.

151
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:55,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

152
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:57,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

153
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,487
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I know that you're not the fellow that,

154
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,227
[SPEAKER_11]: is responsible for restoring the ground, and you're the messenger.

155
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:12,114
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry to shoot you today, sir, but we have some priorities in this community that we need to take care of, and constituents that are expressing a great deal of frustration.

156
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,058
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go up Traincroft and Crocker Road right now, and you can see what a nightmare it is.

157
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the work you're doing.

158
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you coming down here this evening, but I'm not able to support the paper this evening, Mr. President.

159
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

160
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:26,546
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, Councilor, Vice-President Longueau-Kerr.

161
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

162
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,380
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.

163
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:37,285
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the utility companies need to do a better job, and I also think we need to have more oversight as a city, and it's something that we've been lacking.

164
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:41,907
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we're short-staffed, but there needs to be better checks and balances.

165
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:50,892
[SPEAKER_19]: And not only do we need to review it a first time, we need to review it six months later while we're still in a window to make the utilities companies come back to do the job right.

166
00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:00,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Regards to that being said, I don't know if I could ask a few questions on this paper specifically with regard for when you do come back or hopefully when we do get our answers.

167
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:09,225
[SPEAKER_19]: How long will this project take and what does it entail with regards to displacing people from their driveways, their homes, getting down the street?

168
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:23,687
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't believe on this particular petition, we're not going to go in front of any driveways, which is going right across the street from an existing pole in 1981 and it's going across in front of six 40 Boston that we proposed apartment building.

169
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:28,151
[SPEAKER_20]: So it won't affect any, um, driveways.

170
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,213
[SPEAKER_19]: And how long is the work going to take?

171
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, again, we're not doing the work.

172
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,570
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think probably depends what's in the street.

173
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,050
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be railroad ties.

174
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,571
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be, who knows.

175
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:42,911
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think maybe at least maybe a week depending upon good weather.

176
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:45,732
[SPEAKER_19]: And what will the hours of operation be?

177
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:50,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I would think it probably eight to three, I would think eight to four.

178
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:52,913
[SPEAKER_19]: So no, no night work.

179
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:53,734
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not doing the work.

180
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:59,795
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can't, you know, I'd have to speak to the contractor who's doing the work because we're not, National Grid is not doing the work.

181
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,902
[SPEAKER_20]: but you're going to, you're going to be there to petition the city.

182
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:08,303
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

183
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Private contractors cannot petition the city as a public utility.

184
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:12,325
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to do that.

185
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:13,526
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

186
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:13,986
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

187
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:17,168
[SPEAKER_10]: All set ma'am.

188
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

189
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:18,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you ma'am.

190
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:22,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice president of the chair recognizes council.

191
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:22,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

192
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:23,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President president.

193
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:24,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

194
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:31,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, maybe I don't have their, if I have their answer, but, um, who puts up the bond for these projects, national grade or the private contract?

195
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:34,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but why aren't we gonna hold?

196
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:35,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, let me rephrase that.

197
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:40,400
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we self-insure it, so I'll step back.

198
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,280
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think so.

199
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So a bond or someone, National Grid either puts up a bond that self-insures these projects.

200
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:53,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, why isn't the city going after National Grid's insurance company or a bond?

201
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,224
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it on file here.

202
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the avenue we should be going.

203
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,586
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll hire our own contractor to fix the shoddy work

204
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,459
[SPEAKER_07]: these private contractors are doing.

205
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:25,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if we could put that as an amendment to check into whether National Grid has a bond, a self-insured, and are we able to recover funds to repair the shoddy work that's done by private contractors and hire our own contractor to fix it correctly?

206
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like that question be directed to the office of the city engineer?

207
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:29,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yes.

208
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:30,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

209
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:39,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of a council night that the paper be held in abeyance as amended by Councilor Caraviello chair recognizes Councilman.

210
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:41,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

211
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:45,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank a council Scarpelli for raising this issue.

212
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:50,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Mike, my question is, and I don't want to put the city engineer on the spot,

213
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:58,304
[SPEAKER_01]: but she happens to be here tonight, is typically there's a statement at the end of these requests.

214
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:05,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And it states that upon review of the petition, the work can proceed forward provided the following requirements are met.

215
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very last sentence says, national grid contractors shall utilize city of Medford regulations and standards.

216
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:18,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that we know what the regulations and standards are for the city of Medford.

217
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And does that include having

218
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:21,499
[SPEAKER_01]: a clerk of the work.

219
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:30,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that include what council Lungo-Koehn mentioned about having a follow up, maybe three, six months, nine months after a road is repaved or so forth.

220
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:37,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's part of the procedures that's listed, but could the city engineer talk to that?

221
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that is required that would put the city on notice?

222
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:47,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

223
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:48,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

224
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not feeling very well tonight, so my voice might disappear.

225
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Cassandra Kudalitis, 29 Crystal Street, Melrose.

226
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:12,527
[SPEAKER_04]: The engineering standards and regulations and practices are general engineering practice that all cities and towns require from work such as this, which would be to backfill your trenches with good material, compact them appropriately,

227
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,139
[SPEAKER_04]: put in your base course of asphalt.

228
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what we do is we allow a project to winter over.

229
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So work that you will see done in 2016, these are the temporary trenches.

230
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:25,481
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not the permanent trenches.

231
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:32,803
[SPEAKER_04]: We want it to go through freeze-thaw cycles multiple times to get out any of the water, any of the voids that might be in the trench.

232
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:39,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we get into the spring of the following year, the utility company comes back and they do what's called a grind and inlay.

233
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:40,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So they key cut it.

234
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: and they grind and they patch a wider swath than what they did in the original trench patch.

235
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:50,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might have a narrow trench patch and the final one would be about four feet wide.

236
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:54,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're not able to get them to pave curb to curb.

237
00:19:54,915 --> 00:20:09,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mentioned that there are, the Department of Public Utilities has oversight over the public utility companies and they use National Grid electric and gas and Comcast like to refer back to those and say that they don't have to do more than

238
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: what is in those rules and regulations.

239
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: We do manage to get more than that, though, by going for the grind and inlay.

240
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:25,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the trench happens to be somewhat out from the curb, we'll ask them to restore from that outside location or inside in the street all the way over to the curb.

241
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:31,527
[SPEAKER_04]: If the street is less than five years old, they do have to pave curb to curb to restore it.

242
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the grind and inlay work that you'll see

243
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:42,779
[SPEAKER_04]: This year from last year's work looks good and is much better able to hold up over time.

244
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, we do go out.

245
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one person in the city who handles trench excavations and coordinates with the utility company and also does resident engineering work.

246
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,147
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes out and he follows up.

247
00:20:57,868 --> 00:20:59,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's multiple phone calls to National Grid.

248
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,510
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to come out and redo their trenches.

249
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the trenches you see out there that are in really poor shape

250
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: are older, they predate me.

251
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:11,549
[SPEAKER_04]: They predate probably a few years before me.

252
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:18,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the ones that I don't know to what extent our jurisdiction is over this period of time.

253
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to look into it.

254
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone to meetings with the chairwoman of the DPU.

255
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:28,395
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've talked about doing better with, you know, better coordination with these utility companies.

256
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I've voiced my concerns.

257
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:32,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very frustrating how they work sometimes.

258
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:34,977
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also very accommodating sometimes.

259
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:39,490
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're able to get, um, a good working relationship in certain locations.

260
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that answer your question?

261
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:42,810
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.

262
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so roughly in the course of a year, how many trenches, uh, dug in the city?

263
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:49,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good question.

264
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I couldn't.

265
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking hundreds, thousands?

266
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:54,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say hundreds.

267
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:55,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

268
00:21:55,373 --> 00:22:02,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have one person and that's their sole job to, uh, be, uh, the liaison with,

269
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Utility companies in the city?

270
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:05,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the hats he wears.

271
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:06,632
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the hats?

272
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,833
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the hats he wears, yes.

273
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's responsible.

274
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:17,678
[SPEAKER_01]: According to what Councilor Knight brought up, do you have any type of spreadsheet on where a trench is dug and the follow-up dates?

275
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my understanding is George Connolly, who's the person we're referring to, has been working on that.

276
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:24,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have a current

277
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:27,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something new that you're working on?

278
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:33,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was asked as part of the council resolution that went through the DPW director to do a tally.

279
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep a list, we keep a log of all the permits that are issued from all the contractors.

280
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:41,798
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the dig safe numbers, we have permit numbers, you know, trench excavation numbers.

281
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also track as-built drawings as they come in.

282
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a handwritten log.

283
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what he's doing is he's writing it all down.

284
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:53,282
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going through that list and pulling out the private

285
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,910
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, utility contractors, such as people who do water and sewer services.

286
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:00,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's looking for the public utility companies as requested.

287
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:10,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it safe to say over the last few years that every trench that has been dug, there's been a set of eyes from a city employee on that trench when it's finalized.

288
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:16,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized you put a, uh, an initial code down and so forth, but is it safe to say they've been checked off?

289
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,261
[SPEAKER_04]: For, I would say that he,

290
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,263
[SPEAKER_04]: He tours the area when it's over, particularly the public utility companies.

291
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there are other trenches.

292
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,725
[SPEAKER_04]: There's water and sewer trenches.

293
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:31,607
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another hat that he wears and he has to follow through with that.

294
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:44,294
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some work that's being done by, I don't wanna cast anybody and push anyone in front of the train, but there's also work done by city forces that we don't oversee and we don't check up on in engineering.

295
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:48,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's something that we have to talk about by having a policy.

296
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:58,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, it doesn't matter who's digging the trench, whether it's a city employee or a private contractor, there should be a set of eyes on behalf of the city.

297
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:07,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize the city workers, the city employee, but there should be someone in your office that oversees all trenches, whether it's a city job or not.

298
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:10,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We do do a lot of repair.

299
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:15,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a contractor on board that goes out and does a number of the water trenches.

300
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:23,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak to Highway because I'm not that familiar with the work that they do specifically, whether they just oversee their own work or if they have anybody else come in and do that for them.

301
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:24,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen these?

302
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:31,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume there were water lines that were replaced on Riverside Ave over the last several years.

303
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:36,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Go down Riverside Ave right now, and if your car doesn't bottom out, I'll be shocked.

304
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:38,205
[SPEAKER_01]: You must go over.

305
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:39,325
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a gully.

306
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:40,823
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three of them in a row.

307
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:44,465
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some chronically sinking trenches out there, and we do have them out.

308
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:45,545
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in real bad shape.

309
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:50,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And this council has been requesting that something be done with these gullies.

310
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:54,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not sure if there's a responsibility we can tag along to this.

311
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who dug it.

312
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,231
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure even if it was a waterline.

313
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a square patch for an individual waterline.

314
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:04,313
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe if you could check into that, too, Mr. President.

315
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:08,455
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been something that this council has requested for quite some time.

316
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:16,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also responding to your request on Riverside Avenue, I'm walking the street as I can to note defects and make recommendations.

317
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And the curbing too.

318
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: There's little curb reveal, I agree.

319
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:22,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

320
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places it's level with the street pavement.

321
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Nearly level, yes.

322
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

323
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:26,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

324
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:30,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

325
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:34,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So the motion of Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Caraviello.

326
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:35,333
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

327
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:37,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

328
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:39,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Carries.

329
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

330
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,442
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-783 offered by Councilor Marks.

331
00:25:50,162 --> 00:26:06,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor draft an ordinance requiring any retail or wholesale business which is made aware of an incorrect store price and that has the ability to communicate with customers through the offering of a store savings card or other method

332
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:12,577
[SPEAKER_10]: be required to refund or credit all customers who purchased an item incorrectly priced.

333
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:13,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

334
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:15,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

335
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:23,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to state that this is, I believe, a first of its kind ordinance in the entire country.

336
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:30,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a consumer protection ordinance that deals directly with the consumers.

337
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talk a lot about prevailing wage and so forth, and we've had discussions on a number of issues.

338
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:50,249
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue that I believe impacts anyone doing business with any of the retail wholesale stores in our community and outside of our community, but we can only create ordinances for our city.

339
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:59,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the issue at hand, Mr. President, and I think I've had discussions with, uh, uh, our legal counsel, Mark Rumley.

340
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:04,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he asked that I put something, uh, in the way of what, uh, we'd like to see as an ordinance.

341
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:09,176
[SPEAKER_01]: and then carefully craft an ordinance that would have some tea to it.

342
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:31,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm trying to get at, uh, by offering this consumer protection ordinance is that I believe, uh, there's, uh, um, a real issue, um, not only in our community, but in many communities of business establishments that may put an item, um, on sale in a store.

343
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:42,449
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't want to pick out any particular business, but I know when I go food shopping, I may have 75 items in my cart and I'll go through and you hear beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

344
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's, it's tabulating your items.

345
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was, it was beep, beep, beep, beep.

346
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, it, it tabulates your items.

347
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, in my opinion, Mr. President.

348
00:27:54,659 --> 00:28:13,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Many times stores may put an item on sale, buy one, get one free, and it's not until you get home or if you're really diligent in the store that you realize that you purchased an item that you should have got for free, the second item, or you purchased an item that was on sale

349
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,421
[SPEAKER_01]: for $3.99, and you paid $6.99.

350
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:20,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people may not even bother looking at their receipt.

351
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:23,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people may say, you know what, it's $1 or $2.

352
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't be bothered to go back into the store, wait in the customer service line.

353
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:34,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this ordinance is trying to do, Mr. President, it is if a store becomes aware.

354
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:42,192
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go into Stop and Shop, I'll pick out Stop and Shop, or I could CVS, or any other store that has reward cards.

355
00:28:42,915 --> 00:29:05,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I go in at 6.30 at night and I find out that I purchased something and there is an incorrect price on the item and I bring it to the store's attention, they should have the responsibility to go back into their system because if you have a means of communicating with your customer, you have an obligation

356
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:14,277
[SPEAKER_01]: to go back into the system, look at the SKU number, and figure out how many people purchased that item in the day, and then reach out to the person.

357
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:23,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it by possibly having some type of savings on their card.

358
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:25,241
[SPEAKER_01]: You can credit their card.

359
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:26,842
[SPEAKER_01]: You can offer coupons.

360
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:32,385
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a number of ways you could reach out to the customers to rectify the situation, Mr. President.

361
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:41,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I know stores are probably gonna be opposed to this, and I had a discussion with a store manager who said, you realize how many people come through this door?

362
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:54,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yes, I realize, and I think if you're a reputable store, you'd wanna make sure that every one of your loyal customers that might've purchased an item, purchased it at the right price.

363
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they have store recalls, I'll get something in the mail.

364
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:03,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I get this in the mail, 20% off, addressed to me in the mail.

365
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:05,566
[SPEAKER_01]: from a particular store in the city.

366
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,107
[SPEAKER_01]: You get checkout coupons.

367
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:08,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You get gas points.

368
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know who their customer is.

369
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,989
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who they're dealing with.

370
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I get e-mail savings.

371
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,911
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll send me coupons with e-mails.

372
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:21,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know how to get a hold of customers when they want to solicit their business.

373
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:28,958
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's a pricing error, they all of a sudden, now they put the blinders on and say, geez, how are we supposed to reach out to all these people?

374
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:30,379
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we supposed to control this?

375
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they have an obligation, Mr. President,

376
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:40,750
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, as a customer, uh, and as, uh, a business, uh, in the community, uh, treating people fairly.

377
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:48,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask that, um, this, uh, resolution be sent to the city solicitor.

378
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's expecting it.

379
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:54,055
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to send it to a subcommittee first, that's fine, but he is expecting it.

380
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:58,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can craft some language that's more appropriate than what I put together.

381
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also has some enforcement teeth to it.

382
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:09,544
[SPEAKER_01]: that would require stores, Mr. President, to do their best to reach out to customers that they're able to.

383
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:15,005
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have — maybe if you're paid by a credit card, they can credit your credit card on a certain item.

384
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:21,867
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a store savings card, they can reach out to you and possibly credit you that way, Mr. President.

385
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:23,508
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's long overdue.

386
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:28,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great public opportunity.

387
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:45,390
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I want to say, incentive for stores to communicate with their customers and not just say, well, that's, you know, the one comment I got back, well, what if it's in the store's favor?

388
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:56,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, as someone that's been a loyal customer to many stores, 99.9% of the time, it's in the store's favor.

389
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,657
[SPEAKER_01]: For whatever reason, I'm not making any accusations,

390
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's always in the store's favor.

391
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And my resolution clearly states that it would require a refund or credit.

392
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:15,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if it happens to be in the store favor, then, I mean, against the store, then that's the cost of doing business, Mr. President.

393
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:22,595
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you, in my experience, it's always in the favor of the store and not in the favor of the consumer.

394
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:29,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I would ask this be sent to City Solicitor Rumley for future

395
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinance and then be probably set to the appropriate committee for vetting and so forth.

396
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:41,584
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Marks that this paper be sent to the city solicitor for drafting.

397
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:50,551
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could, Councilor, tell us about does the city still employ a consumer protection advocate who goes out with

398
00:32:51,522 --> 00:33:00,446
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, the radar gun to, uh, test randomly, uh, products on shelves so that they're what, uh, is on the bar code.

399
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:03,768
[SPEAKER_10]: The charge, uh, equates to what, uh, the market price is.

400
00:33:03,988 --> 00:33:04,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

401
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:11,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm glad you mentioned that because, uh, the city does have two employees and I think they're regional employees.

402
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,973
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, uh, hired by the city.

403
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a number of cities and towns.

404
00:33:16,774 --> 00:33:18,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they told me that there was a grant.

405
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,681
[SPEAKER_01]: that was put forth some years ago.

406
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:26,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And that grant ran out, which allowed them to go in and do spot checks in stores.

407
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:37,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, I talk to Weights and Measures with the State Department, and they have a department, it's not really fully staffed, but they have a department that spot checks the whole state.

408
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:45,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And they keep a list of stores that may have a frequency of wrong prices.

409
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not done to the scale that it should be done.

410
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:57,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not being done in this community to any great effect, and I think it really needs to be looked at.

411
00:33:58,155 --> 00:34:05,458
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've heard people state to me that they went in, and this is a little different than an incorrect price.

412
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:16,343
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go in and buy something, and it has a skew on it, and the person, like fruit or something, will plug in a code, and they might buy two pounds of grapes, but the person plugged in

413
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:19,015
[SPEAKER_01]: a basket of flowers for $68.

414
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:22,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're only buying the two pounds of grapes, you'll probably pick up on it.

415
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:26,080
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're buying a lot of items, you may not pick up on that.

416
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:29,303
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the things I think really we have to be conscious of.

417
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:32,685
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit different scenario than just an incorrect price.

418
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:41,112
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a division of the state government that looks into pricing as well as gas stations.

419
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:44,725
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little behind on our gas station, the octane level.

420
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:52,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little behind on some of the checks that we do as a city, uh, to ensure that consumers get a fair shake when they go to the pump.

421
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's something that's, uh, is out there, but I don't feel comfortable.

422
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,634
[SPEAKER_01]: They're protecting me to be quite frank.

423
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:05,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Inspector Fusco, Jack Fusco, uh, worked through the board of health on a grant, uh, for consumer protection.

424
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,349
[SPEAKER_10]: with the gun to check the prices.

425
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,651
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think you're correct.

426
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:11,612
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct, actually.

427
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:12,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Mike Callahan.

428
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think it was Mike Callahan there.

429
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:16,635
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one that got the grant through.

430
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:18,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

431
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:19,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Great American.

432
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

433
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

434
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,623
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to second the resolve.

435
00:35:26,643 --> 00:35:28,204
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a good idea.

436
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:30,506
[SPEAKER_19]: I look forward to language on it.

437
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:35,129
[SPEAKER_19]: More often than not, you have families who are too busy to check their receipts.

438
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:45,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Or you have the other spectrum, people taking taxis or senior citizen transportation to get to the store, and they're not able to go back and try to get their money back.

439
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:51,224
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do know people who look at their receipts, and two out of 10 times, there's something wrong in your receipt.

440
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:56,608
[SPEAKER_19]: And the grocery store or the chain stores are making money from it.

441
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,790
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's probably thousands of the same mistake.

442
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,571
[SPEAKER_19]: So I agree.

443
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:02,332
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's definitely worth looking into.

444
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's one extra way to

445
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:10,408
[SPEAKER_19]: consumer protection and anything we can do with the consumer is a good step, a step in the right direction.

446
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:16,833
[SPEAKER_19]: So I look forward to, and I thank the city solicitor for drafting an ordinance and thank council Marks for putting it forward.

447
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:18,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

448
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam vice president chair recognizes council night.

449
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

450
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:28,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And this certainly sounds like a measure that I will be willing to support once I see a final draft from the city solicitor.

451
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:32,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I would be, I will be voting in favor of it this evening.

452
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,868
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I'd like to amend the paper and request that the solicitor,

453
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:41,988
[SPEAKER_11]: also request the input from our consumer advisory commission, which is the body that, um, you just mentioned in council and Mark's just mentioned as well.

454
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:59,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we have three individuals in the office, um, Patty Wright, Paula Keefe and Linda Petarino, um, that work in the office doing a lot of the consumer complaints and, um, they might have a system in place right now that works for them and maybe we can adopt that and bring it into kind of our ordinance, Mr. President.

455
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I asked that we, uh, seek their input and I'd move for approval on the paper.

456
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:16,635
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, seconded by Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn and amended by Councilor Knight.

457
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:18,876
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

458
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:20,277
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

459
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:23,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Carries.

460
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,361
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-784 offered by Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli.

461
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:30,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the holiday lights have adorned Medford City Hall for the past 20 years,

462
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:51,131
[SPEAKER_10]: whereas the holiday lights were created and manufactured by the Medford Vocational Technical High School students, be it resolved that the city administration find a new location for the holiday lights if they are not going to be part of the Medford City Hall holiday display and communicate to the residents where the long-term plans are for these holiday lights.

463
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:56,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Related to this, we got a communique from the mayor's office

464
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:04,882
[SPEAKER_10]: but given that I read so much last week, I'll allow council Scarpelli to give us a, um, uh, a synopsis of that response.

465
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:08,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel, if I will, if I can't, thank you, Mr. President.

466
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:08,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just read.

467
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:13,044
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a from, to the honorable president and members of the city council, city hall.

468
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:17,185
[SPEAKER_15]: They have Mr. President, city council, every guy has the resolution 16-seven 84.

469
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:21,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Please be advised the following formation on September, September 12th, 2016.

470
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:26,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I met with DPW commissioner, Brian Karen's highway foreman, Steve Tanaglia,

471
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:38,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Electrical Inspector Steve Randazzo and the principal of the Method Vocational Technical High School, Heidi Riccio, to discuss the upcoming lighting of City Hall and surrounding squares.

472
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:48,511
[SPEAKER_15]: I conveyed to those involved the construction schedule for the City Hall as well as the impact the former lights had on the interior office of City Hall.

473
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:56,632
[SPEAKER_15]: As the structures were supported through the windows into the building, leaving openings between the sash and the windows, in addition, DPW Commissioner Gerrans

474
00:38:57,053 --> 00:39:02,017
[SPEAKER_15]: has confirmed that there have been no light fixtures disposed of this year.

475
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:20,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Furthermore, we discussed possible options for the figures, such as Hormel Stadium's Royal Park and Route 60 Rotary, to name a few locations, after the reviewing multiple location installations currently taking place at Hormel Stadium on the rear side of the bleachers facing La Conte Rink.

476
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,333
[SPEAKER_15]: We will announce a lighting ceremony shortly in conjunction with the upcoming hockey game.

477
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:33,688
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to thank the vocational school students, faculty, and assisting in the preparation of the LED lights, as well as Steve Randazzo for his design on the building.

478
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:37,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the office.

479
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Sincerely, Stephanie Burke, Mayor.

480
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:50,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that those lights, I know that, just to add to that, those lights are on, from what I've been told, and the communication,

481
00:39:51,213 --> 00:40:03,901
[SPEAKER_15]: for a rededication is to give the, um, the vocational students and vocational school an opportunity to come back out and, and thank them for all their hard work in the past.

482
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:06,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

483
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:09,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, chair recognizes council Falco.

484
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

485
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I am happy to hear that, uh, this issue sounds like it's been resolved.

486
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:19,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we did definitely have some concerns last week as we exited the building.

487
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:19,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

488
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:24,906
[SPEAKER_14]: We, uh, council Scarpelli and myself noticed the lights were on the side of the dumpster.

489
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:28,849
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had some concerns that they were not going to be used and possibly thrown away.

490
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:37,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I know a lot of time, effort and energy has gone into this project throughout the years by the, uh, students and the staff up at the vocational school.

491
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:40,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, you know, I love those lights.

492
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:43,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you know, I think they'd become a part of the community.

493
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:47,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the, you know, I'm happy with the lights that are out front here tonight as well.

494
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:48,325
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um,

495
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,622
[SPEAKER_14]: The most important thing is they are being used somewhere in our community.

496
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:53,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Mel Stadium sounds like a nice venue.

497
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you know, especially if you want to drive up close, it's right there.

498
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:02,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so it's, uh, the bottom line is they being used again, um, here in the city.

499
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:14,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to see that, uh, you know, the, the, they were saved in, like I said, a lot of time, effort and energy went into those, went into the construction, uh, of those lights by the vocational students.

500
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:17,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad that, uh, they did find a location.

501
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:18,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

502
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:18,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

503
00:41:19,378 --> 00:41:19,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion?

504
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:23,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to accept the place file.

505
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:23,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion.

506
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, a citizen would like to speak.

507
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

508
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:28,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

509
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

510
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 281 Park Street.

511
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,541
[SPEAKER_06]: My family also saw the lights by the dumpster this weekend.

512
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm grateful that it was posted on Facebook.

513
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:42,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the mayor's office received a lot of calls on Monday morning.

514
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say that I'm glad the tradition lives on.

515
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:48,244
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter will be 21 next year and every year.

516
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,925
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll be 21 tomorrow, actually.

517
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:55,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing but and every year we've come out to see these lights.

518
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:59,874
[SPEAKER_06]: These are a source of pride to people that live in the city and Change is great.

519
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:18,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes we have to hold on to tradition They're at Hormel and were put up rather quickly from dumpster to Hormel But we're very grateful that they are not going to find their way into the trash and we hope that next year that we'll be able to place them in a more prominent position so that more people will be able to enjoy them and

520
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:21,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you and happy holidays.

521
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

522
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:22,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

523
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpello.

524
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:38,821
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, just to reiterate, the mayor's office, when contacted with the situation, the lights that were on the side of the building, next to the dumpster, were taking off the roof during construction.

525
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I believe that everything was in place to

526
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:48,875
[SPEAKER_15]: find a location for them.

527
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:53,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I, and I think that, uh, in other words, there was never, right.

528
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,041
[SPEAKER_15]: There was never a time to throw them away.

529
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:55,922
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was talking.

530
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:56,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I was told.

531
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,604
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

532
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:58,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

533
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:02,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Councilor, the chair recognizes citizen at the podium.

534
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:02,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

535
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

536
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:05,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

537
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:08,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Gina Muzo, 35 Parris Street in Medford.

538
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:14,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can appreciate that the lights were taken off the roof and put aside at the dumpster.

539
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:19,997
[SPEAKER_17]: As someone who works in the construction industry, I would say that that was really

540
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,756
[SPEAKER_17]: An unfortunate circumstance.

541
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:24,856
[SPEAKER_17]: At any point in time, those could have been taken away.

542
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:28,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

543
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:38,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Just so Jean understands, from what I was told, just so to eliminate any other discussion, if it helps, that from what I gathered, those weren't the same lights.

544
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,141
[SPEAKER_15]: It was something totally different.

545
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,421
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what I was told.

546
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:42,281
[SPEAKER_15]: So just so you know that.

547
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:42,562
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

548
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:42,962
[SPEAKER_15]: OK?

549
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:44,062
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

550
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:45,983
[SPEAKER_17]: So did those lights get thrown out?

551
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Are those not the lights that are displayed?

552
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:48,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

553
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:52,548
[SPEAKER_17]: So right.

554
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:00,454
[SPEAKER_17]: So the reason that I'm stepping up is that I'd like to raise two points for consideration.

555
00:44:01,383 --> 00:44:14,006
[SPEAKER_17]: The first that I understand that the building is under construction, there's renovations that are going to be underway, and that we've got a solution up that is a reasonable solution with the work that's going on.

556
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:22,128
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think in the review of the space as the construction continues, there's an opportunity to look at ways to retrofit those existing

557
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:29,429
[SPEAKER_17]: creations from the Vogue students that have been very emotionally contributed.

558
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:31,892
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a sentimental value, not for myself.

559
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:40,147
[SPEAKER_17]: don't have it personally, but I know that a lot of my fellow residents have expressed sentimental attachment to them.

560
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:47,148
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that as part of that effort, as we look at making renovations, we should look to see if they can be refit.

561
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:57,711
[SPEAKER_17]: And then my other suggestion would be if they can't stay on the building or on the grounds, maybe we could do something where different pieces get put in different places.

562
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:58,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe some could go

563
00:44:59,332 --> 00:45:00,232
[SPEAKER_17]: to the library.

564
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Some could go to Hormel.

565
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:08,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So it encourages people to traverse the city and look at them, rather than go down that freedom way just to Hormel.

566
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:10,816
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a fine solution for this year.

567
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:16,878
[SPEAKER_17]: But those would be two things that I would hope that folks could consider getting some of it, if not all of it, back.

568
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:28,382
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, if not, maybe encouraging folks to go out and investigate other things that are in our city by way of these beautiful displays that the students have created over the years.

569
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:29,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

570
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:34,170
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to receive in place on file by Councilor Scott Pell, seconded by Councilor Knight.

571
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:34,850
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

572
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:37,051
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

573
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:37,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Carries 16-787.

574
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:38,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Falco.

575
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:51,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Department of Public Works lower or reposition the no left turn sign at the corner of Tainter Street and Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.

576
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:52,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

577
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

578
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:57,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I received a calls from a number of residents on Tainter Street and Fulton Street.

579
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:02,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, when you come out of tainter and you're heading towards Fulton, uh, you cannot take a left.

580
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:09,474
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess increasingly, uh, you have, there are cars that are taking that left and going down Fulton street the wrong way.

581
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:11,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, which is very dangerous.

582
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:25,481
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very narrow street, but the no left turn sign is on a telephone pole that is to the right and it's really high and it's being, it's being blocked by a tree that's in a private property.

583
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:27,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So if good at the signs, the lower,

584
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:32,333
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, in the interest of public safety, uh, just, I just want to try to prevent an accident there.

585
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:39,936
[SPEAKER_14]: It's can be very dangerous intersection, especially after school when you have Roberts kids, uh, walking home, uh, kids that live in that area.

586
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:42,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could just have, uh, the DPW lower those signs.

587
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:46,217
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're in a, uh, view of the public.

588
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:46,718
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.

589
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:47,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

590
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:48,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Good on that motion.

591
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:49,358
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

592
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:50,539
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

593
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications from the mayor is 16 to seven 85.

594
00:46:55,057 --> 00:46:58,979
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Honorable President, members of the Metro City Council, City Hall, Metro-Maso, 2155.

595
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:08,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the following transfer.

596
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:15,009
[SPEAKER_10]: $10,000 to be transferred from finance permanent full-time salary count 010-1355110 to finance professional services-financial ordinary count 010-1355301.

597
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:33,546
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount of $10,000 is needed for the 2016 OPED, Post-Retirement Benefits Actuarial Evaluation Report.

598
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:53,352
[SPEAKER_10]: The purposes of the valuation are to analyze the current funded position of the city's post-retirement benefits program, determine the level of contributions necessary to assure sound funding, and provide reporting and disclosure information for financial statements, governmental agencies,

599
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:55,162
[SPEAKER_10]: and other interested parties.

600
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:58,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, your signature on file, Stephanie Ember.

601
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:03,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, presenting to us for this paper is?

602
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

603
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:10,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

604
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:14,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, honorable president and good evening, honorable Councilors.

605
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:15,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Your name and address for the record.

606
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia Dunley, finance director, city of Medford.

607
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:19,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, Alicia.

608
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:20,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

609
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:23,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell us a little bit about this paper?

610
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:23,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

611
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:33,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the OPEB report has to be done every two years and the last time it was done was in 2014 so I'm respectfully asking that we can get it funded for 2016.

612
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:38,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Councilor Marks.

613
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Mr. President.

614
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:44,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the 10,000 that's being transferred from a permanent full time salary account.

615
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an employee that left?

616
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:48,613
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we have $10,000 in that account?

617
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:51,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's because Ian Baker, the former auditor, retired.

618
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And the assistant auditor left.

619
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:54,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lag money.

620
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:57,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hired as finance director, and there's still an open position for assistant auditor.

621
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still some lag money within the salary count.

622
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:01,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So how much are we talking?

623
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,515
[SPEAKER_05]: How much lag money is in there?

624
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:03,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

625
00:49:05,095 --> 00:49:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Above about $20,000.

626
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,056
[SPEAKER_01]: After this $10,000, there's $20,000 left in that account?

627
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:10,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

628
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:11,776
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

629
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:13,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

630
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:14,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair awaits motion.

631
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:18,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Councilor Scott Paoli.

632
00:49:18,848 --> 00:49:20,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

633
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:27,430
[SPEAKER_11]: The OPEB report is a requirement of the state government?

634
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:28,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

635
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:29,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

636
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:35,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's related to establishing our obligation underneath the pension liabilities, is that correct?

637
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:36,252
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not for pension.

638
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,433
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for health insurance and for life insurance.

639
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:45,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's other post-employment benefits other than pension.

640
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:52,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

641
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:52,793
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

642
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:53,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

643
00:49:54,153 --> 00:49:54,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

644
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:55,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Counsel Scott Bell's motion.

645
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, do you wish to speak on this?

646
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:00,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

647
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:05,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll say it's on the motion for approval by council Scott Valley, seconded by council night.

648
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,295
[SPEAKER_10]: $10,000 requires a roll.

649
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:07,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, council max.

650
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:08,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

651
00:50:08,996 --> 00:50:12,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if Alicia can answer this or not, but uh, I think it was two weeks ago.

652
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:20,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought up a resolution regarding, uh, Aflac and there were a number of employees, I believe close to a hundred employees that um,

653
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, didn't have their secondary insurance for a period of time because of nonpayment of premium by the city.

654
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:28,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with that issue?

655
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, through the chair, I apologize.

656
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not familiar with that issue.

657
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not familiar with that.

658
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:34,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

659
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:41,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, maybe if we can get a response, it's been two weeks and we have not got a response on behalf of over a hundred city employees.

660
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:42,740
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a serious matter.

661
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very serious matter.

662
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:44,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Health insurance.

663
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:47,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we get some response from the administration.

664
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:47,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

665
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:49,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

666
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:54,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval, seconded by a council of council Scarpelli, seconded by council Knight.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

682
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:10,319
[SPEAKER_10]: With a vote of seven, the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Brainerd Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

691
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:53,603
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of this resolution is to promote economic development.

692
00:51:54,003 --> 00:52:00,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Among its goals is to assist the location and expansion of companies in Medford and to create new jobs.

693
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:09,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Also submitted for your information is a copy of the proposed TIF agreement and spreadsheet for the TIF.

694
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:16,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Representatives from Bianco Sausage along with various city department representatives will be in attendance at your meeting to answer your questions.

695
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:44,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Signature on Files, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor, December 1st, 2016, to the Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and City Councilors, be it resolved that the City Council of the City of Medford hereby approve the Tax Increment Financing Agreement, the TIF agreement, between the City of Medford and Bianco, Inc., and Bianco White, LLC,

696
00:52:45,395 --> 00:53:00,022
[SPEAKER_10]: in substantially the form presented herewith to the Metro City Council pursuant to General Law, Chapter 40, Section 59, and to authorize the mayor to take such action as is necessary to implement the TIF.

697
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:03,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Cecilia Yawes, Stephanie Annenberg, Mayor.

698
00:53:03,143 --> 00:53:10,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Presenting on behalf of the city is Clodagh from the Office of Community Development, who's patiently waited for us.

699
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:19,762
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could update, just for the information, we met in Committee of the Whole and met quite favorably on this measure last week.

700
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:33,571
[SPEAKER_10]: In our report out, we asked that the mayor consider adjusting this if it was within a sense that would make sense for the city to do.

701
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe there's been an agreement that rather than do this over a 20-year spread, is to do it over 10?

702
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

703
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:40,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

704
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:44,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Councilors, uh, chair recognizes, uh, Councilor Knight.

705
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:46,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

706
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:56,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as presented last week, uh, this is a, an opportunity for Bianchi sausages to be provided with some tax relief, um, in exchange for creating some jobs and keeping their business here in the community.

707
00:53:57,556 --> 00:54:04,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but with the approval, it also opens up an opportunity for Bianchi sausage company to, uh, gain access to some state funding.

708
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:09,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, that's where the real relief is, uh, from what I understand, Mr. President.

709
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:09,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

710
00:54:10,002 --> 00:54:15,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Absent the passage of a local TIF, they're not allowed to apply for the state relief as well.

711
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:24,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And looking at the paper, it came out of the committee of the whole that they paid about $3 million for the building over there, the old Hoffs Bakery site.

712
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:31,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Since that time, they've invested about another $3 million into the building, Mr. President, and based on the present proposal and the present TIF,

713
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:37,387
[SPEAKER_11]: The tax relief that will be generated over the 10-year period looks like it totals about $75,000, Mr. President.

714
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,148
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that I'm very comfortable supporting this evening.

715
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:49,530
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to bring 27 jobs to Medford, 10 new jobs to the city of Medford, and it's also going to allow us to maintain one of the larger businesses here in the community.

716
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,791
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for those reasons, it's something that I'll be supporting this evening, Mr. President.

717
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:53,791
[SPEAKER_11]: The President.

718
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:54,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

719
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:57,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I call the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

720
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:58,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

721
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:02,957
[SPEAKER_19]: good opportunity to get a good business in Medford.

722
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:07,818
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and I like council and I, I think the figures need to be made.

723
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:15,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, not only do they pay 3 million for the property, I think they put almost 4 million in improvements already and plan to invest 8 million in total.

724
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:25,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, there's also 27 jobs that are being brought from their old location to Medford with a commitment of 20 additional new jobs over the next five years.

725
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:26,822
[SPEAKER_19]: And,

726
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:28,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford residents.

727
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:41,254
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the wording in the contract is obviously not exactly what I'm going to say, but Medford will get preferential treatment and hopefully the applications from Medford residents will be looked at first so that we can hire within.

728
00:55:41,274 --> 00:55:46,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we also have many vehicles that we're going to bring in excise taxes for.

729
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:53,661
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, there is substantial amount of money being paid in taxes in this exemption over a 10 year period will be about $69,817.

730
00:55:57,335 --> 00:56:02,920
[SPEAKER_19]: which is a reduction of between $6,000 and $7,000 per year.

731
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:09,766
[SPEAKER_19]: We did do the lowest percentage, and again, this is for the exemption, so they can get the state exemption.

732
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:23,858
[SPEAKER_19]: We look forward to the business getting up and running in Medford, and I wish them good luck, and I think this is something not only to support a business that has already bought the property, but it's a good tool to use to entice other businesses to come into Medford, and I hope it's

733
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:27,895
[SPEAKER_19]: use more often so we can fill some of our vacant storefronts and things like that.

734
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:29,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, thank you.

735
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:30,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, madam vice president.

736
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:37,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by vice president Lungo-Koehn chair recognizes council.

737
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:38,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

738
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity, uh, to welcome the Bianco family, uh, to the city of Medford.

739
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:52,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it must have been a difficult decision to leave, uh, their other location after I think they said 40 years relocate here in Medford and, uh,

740
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:04,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I for one am quite happy that they've made the decision to come here, bringing jobs, their business, they'll be bringing cars will be coming here, their trucks will be here.

741
00:57:04,705 --> 00:57:07,166
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be collecting excise tax and a lot of other things.

742
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:14,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it was good because I'd hate to see that property that was there when Hoffs moved to expand.

743
00:57:16,089 --> 00:57:22,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't stay vacant that long and this fine company stepped in, bought the property.

744
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:29,101
[SPEAKER_07]: and they've expanded their business and, uh, many, many residents have, uh, you know, uh, looking forward to them opening.

745
00:57:29,682 --> 00:57:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, um, I think it was a great thing by the city to get this done.

746
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:37,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, again, I want to welcome to the community and hope they stay here for another 50 years.

747
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:41,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

748
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

749
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:50,180
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had as part of the committee report, um, uh, we want to get feedback from the safety gate,

750
00:57:50,886 --> 00:58:00,429
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone's familiar with the property, there's a safety gate in the back of the old Hoffs building where the fire department had access that was closed off to vehicular traffic.

751
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:05,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if we received any feedback regarding the safety gate.

752
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:06,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I can respond.

753
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:14,653
[SPEAKER_10]: This report's coming out, so once it comes out procedurally.

754
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:16,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Claudia, go ahead, I'm sorry.

755
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I consulted with the fire chief and with the director of the DPW.

756
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, yes, those gates were put in to prevent through traffic through the neighborhoods.

757
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:30,052
[SPEAKER_02]: They are supposed to be activated by the fire trucks.

758
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:36,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Cairns, the director of the DPW, is responsible for maintaining them.

759
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:44,501
[SPEAKER_02]: When I spoke to him, he sent someone out immediately to see what the problem was, and they're looking into getting the correct parts to fix the gates.

760
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:49,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We were told by one of the sons of Biaki that the gate was bent.

761
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was hit recently.

762
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:56,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They found that it had been obviously been struck, struck by a vehicle.

763
00:58:56,904 --> 00:59:04,326
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important issue because that provides access for the fire department in and around the building and also the neighborhood if need be.

764
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:09,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only other thing I'd like to say, Mr. President, and I welcome a Bianchi sausage, uh, to the city.

765
00:59:09,968 --> 00:59:11,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there'll be a good neighbor.

766
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:19,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they, uh, currently in Revere, uh, nestled within a neighborhood from, I've never seen it, but, uh, nestled in, uh, within a neighborhood in Revere.

767
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:29,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them, equally, they are in a neighborhood right now with neighbors on both sides and that they be mindful of that in the act of doing their business.

768
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:43,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also ask, Mr. President, that the city do a better job in promoting the TIF, because I've received several calls, actually, from local business owners that said, jeez, how do we get an incentive?

769
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:46,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may be looking to expand in the community.

770
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:48,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we take advantage?

771
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask that.

772
00:59:50,042 --> 01:00:08,776
[SPEAKER_01]: the mayor maybe get in contact with the Chamber of Commerce and have someone from her office explain what the TIF is, how you go about applying for a TIF, what are the benefits to getting a TIF, and what are the benefits for a community that accept the TIF.

773
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:17,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask that that be part of the paper also, Mr. President, that the mayor do outreach to local businesses in the community regarding the TIF.

774
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:19,725
[SPEAKER_10]: as meted by Councilor Marks.

775
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:20,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

776
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:22,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

777
01:00:22,227 --> 01:00:29,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to also point out that, uh, the, the, the Bianco sausage company was in Revere for a very long time.

778
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:36,959
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, the family is from Revere and, um, now that it's moved to Medford, uh, we've inherited one of the sons as well.

779
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And Louis is going to be Louis lives here in Medford as well.

780
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:45,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, uh, I just want to welcome you to Medford and, uh, congratulations on, uh, your new purchase.

781
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:48,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, this is something that I'm going to support this evening, Mr. President, but, uh,

782
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:50,953
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a family owned and operated business for three generations.

783
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:56,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems like a anytime that the business moves, a family member moves with it into the community.

784
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:58,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So a welcome aboard and thank you very much.

785
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam vice president.

786
01:01:00,777 --> 01:01:01,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, president.

787
01:01:01,837 --> 01:01:11,661
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we made it part of the committee report, but I just want to reiterate the annual report that is sent to the state that Medford get a copy, um, the clerk's office and OCD.

788
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:15,343
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to make that part of the report.

789
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:17,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So in approving this, we're approving the committee report.

790
01:01:17,752 --> 01:01:18,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Councilor?

791
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

792
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:22,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

793
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:24,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor, no.

01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:19,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President and Honourable Councilors.

823
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let the engineer, she knows more, explain this.

824
01:03:29,116 --> 01:03:37,682
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, my uncle was at Wheeler Field 75 years ago tomorrow, strafed by bullets, Japanese planes, survived.

825
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,131
[SPEAKER_04]: All of you are familiar with the PCE site in West Medford.

826
01:03:44,732 --> 01:04:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We have reached a milestone in that we have finished the design and we are getting ready to put the procurement together, which means that we would be hiring a contractor, a remediation contractor, to go out and treat the PCE to remove the contaminant below ground in the soil and the groundwater that lies beneath the parking lot and beneath

827
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: bargain spot liquors, and also is affecting 452 to 460 High Street and 7 Canal Street.

828
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We're requesting these funds so that we may proceed with the program, which is approximately a two-year or 18-month program for treatment, three rounds of in-situ chemical oxidation, follow-up monitoring,

829
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: for a period of about two years.

830
01:04:41,255 --> 01:04:48,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're highly hopeful that at that point in time we can start the closeout procedures for the site.

831
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:52,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions, please.

832
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:54,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

833
01:04:54,945 --> 01:04:55,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

834
01:04:56,345 --> 01:04:59,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Cassandra, I'm a little confused.

835
01:04:59,388 --> 01:05:00,348
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we actually going to be doing?

836
01:05:00,368 --> 01:05:04,131
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to start injecting chemicals into the ground at this point?

837
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:05,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

838
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a push drill, a small drill rig.

839
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are no bigger than a pickup truck.

840
01:05:12,947 --> 01:05:17,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the exact dimensions yet, but they push the oxidant into the ground.

841
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:22,171
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be treating two different locations vertically.

842
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:30,535
[SPEAKER_04]: One is in the soil layer, which is called the unsaturated zone above the groundwater table, and one is in the saturated zone, which goes down about 25 feet.

843
01:05:31,415 --> 01:05:33,076
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the success rate of this?

844
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:34,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly successful.

845
01:05:35,026 --> 01:05:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we've already done a bench test.

846
01:05:36,986 --> 01:05:44,549
[SPEAKER_04]: We took samples last winter and sent them out to a company to conduct a bench test using different kinds of oxidants.

847
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:49,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And the report came back that this chemical composition of sodium permanganate will work.

848
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:54,333
[SPEAKER_04]: In some spots of the parking lot, we have to add what's called a surfactant, which is like a soap.

849
01:05:54,934 --> 01:06:03,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It attaches to the PCE and draws it from the soil so that it can get into the dissolved part of the column.

850
01:06:03,788 --> 01:06:05,429
[SPEAKER_04]: and be eradicated more cleanly.

851
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And how quickly will this take?

852
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:08,171
[SPEAKER_07]: You said two years?

853
01:06:09,092 --> 01:06:13,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, two years, because we have one round of injections, and then we need to monitor.

854
01:06:13,715 --> 01:06:14,215
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to wait.

855
01:06:14,255 --> 01:06:17,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to give the occupant time to move through the groundwater table.

856
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:27,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, at the end of this two-year process, if I owned a piece of property there, what would my 21E read at the end of that?

857
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:32,748
[SPEAKER_07]: If it were to be successful, would I be able to sell my property and get a clean 21E?

858
01:06:34,397 --> 01:06:38,138
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have something that a sellable claim to 21e.

859
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:51,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the two of the properties of the three affected, in my opinion, are sellable 21e properties that the contamination is minor relative to, to, um, anything else.

860
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:54,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one at bargain spot, which is sitting on top of the plume.

861
01:06:54,044 --> 01:07:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an issue that the goal is for 18 months of remediation followed by two years of monitoring.

862
01:07:03,182 --> 01:07:05,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really about three and a half years.

863
01:07:05,163 --> 01:07:07,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So these people are going to have to suffer another three years?

864
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:15,749
[SPEAKER_04]: We're confident that each round of ISCO will make the problem smaller and smaller.

865
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking at a horizon of looking to sell or develop, you're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

866
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:30,018
[SPEAKER_07]: But my question is, so if I owned a piece of property there, I would have to wait another three years.

867
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:44,796
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted concentrations to be below reportable limits or be at what our goal is, which is 50 parts per billion, it is a very tiny amount of contaminant in the ground.

868
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:48,777
[SPEAKER_04]: One part per million is like 0.001 percent.

869
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:58,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you are saying is the people that own property over there, if they are looking to sell, they are going to need to wait another 3 years?

870
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are looking at----

871
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,341
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a conservative estimate.

872
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:09,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can't, we don't, we don't know how much of the contaminant is actually bonded to the soil.

873
01:08:09,683 --> 01:08:19,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there might be a layer of what's called dense non-aqueous phase liquid that is based on the dumping that occurred years and years ago, could have formed a small plume.

874
01:08:20,588 --> 01:08:30,432
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea being that if the monitoring shows drop levels, then the individuals who have the systems, the air purifying units in their buildings can start to shut them off.

875
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:35,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once they've started to shut them off, then there's no more indoor air hazard.

876
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:41,966
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rents, you know, are not as, they're not burdened if you're going to be renting out your basement to a tenant.

877
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:45,930
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking at developing your building, the concentrations are lower.

878
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever cleanup that you might have to do at the time if you want to move on earlier, it's less than what it would be today.

879
01:08:52,015 --> 01:08:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's getting better.

880
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:56,439
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can guarantee that it would be a clean bill of health.

881
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:57,580
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there might have to be,

882
01:08:58,332 --> 01:09:04,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, an activity and use limitation on the site, you know, for underground excavation, but it should be fairly minor compared to what we have right now.

883
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:06,234
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

884
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:16,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, are these, are these businesses being given any kind of, um, uh, tax breaks or anything, uh, seeing that they didn't cause, uh, this, um, are we, are we offering them anything?

885
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my understanding is that seven canal has requested one and I don't, I believe that the assessor has provided a tax break.

886
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the other two properties.

887
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Has he provided a tax break to them?

888
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so, if memory serves.

889
01:09:28,823 --> 01:09:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And what about the other buildings?

890
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they eligible for?

891
01:09:31,564 --> 01:09:32,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

892
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:33,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's not the city's fault either.

893
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:35,606
[SPEAKER_07]: They can be dated because the city didn't dump this there.

894
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We inherited this problem.

895
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:37,287
[SPEAKER_07]: We inherited the problem.

896
01:09:37,327 --> 01:09:37,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

897
01:09:38,388 --> 01:09:48,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I feel bad because for the people that own businesses over there, they're suffering some pretty good financial burdens.

898
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, for them to hold, they're going to have to hold on another two or three years.

899
01:09:56,215 --> 01:09:58,036
[SPEAKER_07]: and hope that this works.

900
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:01,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, is this a one-time figure of 900?

901
01:10:01,937 --> 01:10:03,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that cover the whole project?

902
01:10:03,777 --> 01:10:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you going to come back here asking for more money down the line?

903
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:09,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There is contingency in that number.

904
01:10:10,599 --> 01:10:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: What contingency is in that number?

905
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cost contingency in that number.

906
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's money.

907
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:18,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It's padded, in other words.

908
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:22,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a conservative estimate, the goal being that we don't have to come back and ask for more money.

909
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:27,513
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's about it for the moment.

910
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:33,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

911
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

912
01:10:37,396 --> 01:10:40,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

913
01:10:42,378 --> 01:10:42,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

914
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:47,760
[SPEAKER_19]: With regards to, you said the injections will be vertical.

915
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that because the main spot of the contamination is under a building?

916
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:54,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's under the building, yes.

917
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,103
[SPEAKER_19]: So is there going to be any effects to that building during or after injection?

918
01:11:02,503 --> 01:11:02,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

919
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:03,164
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

920
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:07,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They've already done a test of how much water you can pump into the ground.

921
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've measured the monitoring wells to see what any effects are.

922
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:15,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be a measured and steady process.

923
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:23,494
[SPEAKER_19]: And then do you have any breakdowns at all for the $900,000 with regards to the contingency?

924
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:24,274
[SPEAKER_19]: How much is that?

925
01:11:24,805 --> 01:11:28,446
[SPEAKER_19]: And when will the money be expended and on what specifically?

926
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a spreadsheet.

927
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:40,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I know you can't see it from here, but there's a number of different costs involved.

928
01:11:42,212 --> 01:11:48,734
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, we have a contingency of a factor of $100,000 in contingency for that includes

929
01:11:51,883 --> 01:12:05,131
[SPEAKER_04]: The pre-design investigation, the pilot test, the ISCO treatment of the unsaturated and saturated zones, ISCO treatment of the hot spots, ISCO treatment of the saturated zone, and ISCO reagents, which are the chemicals themselves.

930
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,372
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also costs.

931
01:12:07,392 --> 01:12:16,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to have our LSP of record be on this project, monitoring it, verifying the health and safety plans, being on the project at all times.

932
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:21,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's pre-construction engineering and permitting, remedial action work plan,

933
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:25,075
[SPEAKER_04]: The design that they're working on, permitting and bid support.

934
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Their costs in their construction observation and documentation, $35,000.

935
01:12:29,798 --> 01:12:35,281
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm going too fast, I'd be happy to make copies of this for anyone.

936
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:39,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Post-construction engineering and permitting, around $26,000.

937
01:12:40,264 --> 01:12:43,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the capital cost of $806,000.

938
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:46,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's the O&M.

939
01:12:46,268 --> 01:12:48,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the operating costs.

940
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:50,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Year one and two.

941
01:12:52,578 --> 01:13:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: estimated at $55,000, and then years three through five, which we're thinking that we'll have to do less monitoring, because we're doing the initial major push first, with the idea that the second round of ISCO will be less, and the third round of ISCO will be even less than that.

942
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second round of O&M, and this goes beyond years three, because we're being conservative, is approximately $16,000.

943
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at the year present worth,

944
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: total is $949,000.

945
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:30,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we still have some money left in the EPA grant, which will make up the difference from what we're requesting tonight.

946
01:13:42,703 --> 01:13:43,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

947
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:43,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the rundown.

948
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:47,006
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish we got, I mean, the mayor sent us this paper.

949
01:13:47,026 --> 01:13:50,729
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish we got more than a couple sentences and maybe got that

950
01:13:52,185 --> 01:13:54,246
[SPEAKER_19]: break down so we could review it over the weekend.

951
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,468
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's all my questions for now.

952
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:58,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

953
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

954
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, the chair recognizes Councilor Kara Biala.

955
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:05,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:14:05,934 --> 01:14:14,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Cassandra, can you give me another community and something in the area where this has been used that has been successful?

957
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it's been used in Newton.

958
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:19,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it's been used in Cambridge.

959
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:21,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be happy to provide

960
01:14:22,074 --> 01:14:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could, provide where it's been used and what status it's in and the success rate of it.

961
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:33,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the same type of chemical?

962
01:14:34,759 --> 01:14:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: There are different products on the market.

963
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,880
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, but what was used in Newton?

964
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:43,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the contamination in Newton in Cambridge, was it similar?

965
01:14:43,422 --> 01:14:44,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I believe so.

966
01:14:44,623 --> 01:14:45,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can get to you.

967
01:14:45,663 --> 01:14:46,824
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could, I'd appreciate it.

968
01:14:46,924 --> 01:14:48,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what the success rate.

969
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:50,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you had a contact person.

970
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Over in Cambridge and Newton, that would be appreciated also.

971
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:04,572
[SPEAKER_10]: All set?

972
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:05,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

973
01:15:05,712 --> 01:15:06,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

974
01:15:07,192 --> 01:15:08,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

975
01:15:09,033 --> 01:15:09,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

976
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a couple of quick questions.

977
01:15:11,734 --> 01:15:16,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible to get a copy of that report, the one you just read with the spreadsheets?

978
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

979
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:17,516
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, that'd be great.

980
01:15:18,276 --> 01:15:20,737
[SPEAKER_14]: With regard to when this actually happens,

981
01:15:21,606 --> 01:15:28,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any impact on the day-to-day going-ons in that parking lot with regard to people coming and going?

982
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,130
[SPEAKER_14]: How many trucks is it going to be?

983
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just one truck?

984
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:30,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it many trucks?

985
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:32,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it going to be shut down?

986
01:15:32,132 --> 01:15:32,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it off limits?

987
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to shut the parking lot down.

988
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,014
[SPEAKER_14]: It is down, OK.

989
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:35,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

990
01:15:35,754 --> 01:15:42,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any, I guess, type of hazard to anyone just being in the vicinity?

991
01:15:42,578 --> 01:15:45,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it just as long as the parking lot's shut down, we're fine?

992
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:49,342
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the parking lot is shut down and no one enters the parking lot, we should be fine.

993
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:53,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just one truck or is it many trucks?

994
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't yet know the number of the amount of equipment.

995
01:15:56,944 --> 01:15:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Each contractor will have a proposal.

996
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,545
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll submit to us and we'll review it.

997
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll give us a footprint, you know, what they expect to have on site, what they need for the drill.

998
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:13,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's one drill rig, but there'd be trailers and other pieces of equipment for them to mix and apply the chemicals.

999
01:16:13,929 --> 01:16:18,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we know, would this be happening during daytime hours between nine and five?

1000
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:19,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be during daytime hours.

1001
01:16:19,671 --> 01:16:19,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1002
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:21,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And ideally during the spring.

1003
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:28,007
[SPEAKER_04]: because the groundwater table is high and we don't expect as many people out and about in the early spring or mid-spring.

1004
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:29,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1005
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:30,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

1006
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:34,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

1007
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:35,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1008
01:16:35,713 --> 01:16:46,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Cassandra, do we have contingency plans for parking for the businesses that normally park there?

1009
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:50,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some ideas of contingency for parking.

1010
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:52,592
[SPEAKER_04]: that I would need to explore further.

1011
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:55,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I'd want to try to cover it.

1012
01:16:55,833 --> 01:17:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about perhaps parking at the funeral home the last time we went up for this discussion.

1013
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:02,014
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is this going to take?

1014
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:08,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first round is about a month's worth of occupation.

1015
01:17:09,996 --> 01:17:12,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just being conservatively about a month.

1016
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the contractor, we're putting out an RFP.

1017
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be reviewing proposals from contractors.

1018
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:23,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll tell us how much time they think they need for the performance that we're asking them to do.

1019
01:17:24,183 --> 01:17:26,503
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've, and the design is very specific.

1020
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:32,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, use this chemical, drill this many times, go this deep, you know, give us these results.

1021
01:17:32,224 --> 01:17:35,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's all of our pre-design work that explains what you should be finding.

1022
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:40,986
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have to come back and tell us what they're actually going to do and how they're going to do it.

1023
01:17:41,066 --> 01:17:45,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at maybe a month, maybe six weeks in the spring.

1024
01:17:45,907 --> 01:17:47,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when will they come back again?

1025
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't come back again, my understanding is, about six months later.

1026
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:53,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So probably until the end of the fall.

1027
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:54,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1028
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:55,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another six months after that.

1029
01:17:57,242 --> 01:17:59,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to be sampling.

1030
01:17:59,183 --> 01:18:06,905
[SPEAKER_04]: The DEP has actually volunteered to take some samples inside the buildings at 438 High Street and 452 High Street.

1031
01:18:06,925 --> 01:18:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do crab samples and look at the air quality in there.

1032
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:16,788
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be watching it all very closely and tracking the performance of this treatment process.

1033
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:25,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I could, um, put an amendment in there that, um, the city, uh, schedule a meeting with the local businesses down there.

1034
01:18:25,838 --> 01:18:27,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll, they know what's happening.

1035
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:38,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, as far as parking in timeframe of the project, because there are many businesses that rely on that parking lot, um, uh, for, uh, for their, their livelihood.

1036
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:45,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So I say if, if the mayor could schedule some type of meeting somewhere down there, um, before the project starts,

1037
01:18:46,386 --> 01:18:48,547
[SPEAKER_07]: to get up so all the businesses will know what's going on.

1038
01:18:48,587 --> 01:18:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We intend to.

1039
01:18:49,968 --> 01:18:56,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that this is very transparent, that there's solid city representation on site.

1040
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:01,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'll be me in a lawn chair or somebody else watching everything.

1041
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:12,060
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could also maybe work out something with Republic Parking during this time to maybe help the businesses out that are impacted.

1042
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,790
[SPEAKER_07]: especially in that square area.

1043
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:21,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1045
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1046
01:19:25,132 --> 01:19:26,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1047
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:34,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you anticipate the impact on operations opening and closing of the abutting businesses down there?

1048
01:19:34,573 --> 01:19:37,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Will there be periods of time where they're required to close the doors?

1049
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:44,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Will there be periods of time where they're not able to access their loading zones, loading docks, so on and so forth, if they're not coming in through that parking lot?

1050
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:50,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I think Boggins-Bartlick as his loading zone is actually attached to the parking lot in the back.

1051
01:19:51,138 --> 01:19:59,764
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you look at it in that regard, is the project going to cripple these local businesses at the beginning of the springtime?

1052
01:19:59,804 --> 01:20:04,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they going to be able to continue to operate absent the parking?

1053
01:20:05,688 --> 01:20:06,228
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one thing.

1054
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:13,773
[SPEAKER_13]: It's another thing if they're going to be forced to close their doors on certain periods of time while it's going on without being able to do notice and potential mitigation even

1055
01:20:14,295 --> 01:20:15,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I can respond to the bargain spot.

1056
01:20:16,297 --> 01:20:18,379
[SPEAKER_04]: The loading dock is not closing.

1057
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That loading zone, the alley between the two buildings would stay open.

1058
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:25,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can back in and drive out of that one.

1059
01:20:26,106 --> 01:20:32,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Snappy Patty's patio would not be open during the day while this is going on.

1060
01:20:33,532 --> 01:20:35,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, we do the work in the spring.

1061
01:20:36,074 --> 01:20:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, outdoor dining is not an issue.

1062
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:40,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1063
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:48,735
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, from the chair, is there any, uh, environmental concern that people will have?

1064
01:20:48,795 --> 01:20:52,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they notice a chemical aroma in the air anymore than they already do now?

1065
01:20:52,817 --> 01:20:54,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe not process.

1066
01:20:55,277 --> 01:20:56,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1067
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:59,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk, we'll talk to the public about the kind of chemicals that we're using.

1068
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:06,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have MSDS sheets and, um, there's going to be health and safety officers on site.

1069
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:07,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very strict health and safety plan.

1070
01:21:07,802 --> 01:21:09,023
[SPEAKER_04]: The contractor has to follow.

1071
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:09,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1072
01:21:10,922 --> 01:21:13,583
[SPEAKER_10]: This time the chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1073
01:21:15,823 --> 01:21:19,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassandra, what was the original state grant for?

1074
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:20,104
[SPEAKER_01]: How much was it?

1075
01:21:20,124 --> 01:21:20,704
[SPEAKER_01]: A half a million?

1076
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:23,165
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an EPA grant for $400,000, 400,000.

1077
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:27,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much do we have remaining of that 400,000?

1078
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:30,747
[SPEAKER_04]: We have about 200,000 left, 200,000 left.

1079
01:21:31,427 --> 01:21:33,628
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that this will go for an RFP.

1080
01:21:34,408 --> 01:21:38,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's to say that there's no bidders on this at the current 900,000?

1081
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't anticipate that, but if there was, we'd have to take a look at what we've established as our criteria and we propose it, you know, put it out again.

1082
01:21:51,277 --> 01:21:53,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1083
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:57,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen bids just recently come back that, uh, for whatever reason, there was no bids on it.

1084
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:02,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just concerned that this dollar amount is an accurate reflection.

1085
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:08,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, if it's not, uh, Mr. President, uh, will knowing that there's 200,000 in state grants,

1086
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:14,171
[SPEAKER_01]: can the city just tap into that money, or do they need approval from the council?

1087
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:16,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a question that needs to be answered.

1088
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:25,600
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sure, as there always are, as you wisely know, Councilor, stipulations on how grant money can be used, and there's strictures on that.

1089
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:37,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the engineer who's been in charge of these funds, or their allocation, can advise us and knows the parameters of those expenditures.

1090
01:22:39,468 --> 01:22:43,510
[SPEAKER_04]: where the money is available to us to spend on this project.

1091
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not enough money.

1092
01:22:45,311 --> 01:22:47,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do a short piece of it.

1093
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:50,094
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand that.

1094
01:22:50,114 --> 01:23:04,801
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is if just say, uh, RFP comes back and there's no bidders and all of a sudden now we move it up to a million, 100,000, uh, is the city going to take 200,000 of that and just poly on 900,000 and make the million one.

1095
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Can that, can that be done that way?

1096
01:23:06,922 --> 01:23:08,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you want to answer this question?

1097
01:23:09,135 --> 01:23:14,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We have $200,000 from the EPA specifically for cleanup activities.

1098
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always there.

1099
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:21,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the bids come back higher than the $900,000... I guess it's a legal question.

1100
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:28,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not if we approve $900,000 for the project and they get no bidders and then they have to put it out for a re-bid at $1.1 million.

1101
01:23:29,476 --> 01:23:34,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they use their 200,000 with our 900,000 or do we have to go through the whole process again?

1102
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:38,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's just a question that maybe can be answered another time.

1103
01:23:38,044 --> 01:23:39,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that could be answered here.

1104
01:23:40,606 --> 01:23:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned about excavation and if this is not successful, that anything at that lot for reuse,

1105
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:55,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say in three years from now we decide that there's still a fair amount of contaminants and so forth.

1106
01:23:56,666 --> 01:24:01,450
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying that that particular property could never be excavated for construction?

1107
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:04,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it could be excavated for construction.

1108
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:05,813
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's mitigated?

1109
01:24:06,573 --> 01:24:11,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's not mitigated, it's just the cost of removing the material and hauling it out of state.

1110
01:24:11,657 --> 01:24:16,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first report we got was to excavate and remove the material.

1111
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and use ISCO.

1112
01:24:19,437 --> 01:24:19,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1113
01:24:19,817 --> 01:24:19,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1114
01:24:20,037 --> 01:24:21,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you remember what that cost was?

1115
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:23,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It was over $2 million.

1116
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:34,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we had it peer reviewed, the consultant said, the other consultant said, you might be looking at more like $3 million and a lot, you know, in a longer timeframe for monitoring groundwater than you thought you'd think you'd need.

1117
01:24:35,024 --> 01:24:35,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1118
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:39,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first consultant we had thought it would be a way of removing it.

1119
01:24:39,326 --> 01:24:41,868
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was appropriate.

1120
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:46,090
[SPEAKER_04]: They were operating under an idea that the city was very aggressive about getting it cleaned up quickly.

1121
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:46,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know,

1122
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Digging it up and carrying it off is quicker than some other methods.

1123
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But the more you look into it, the more you realize the fragility of those buildings, the foundations are not that well supported.

1124
01:25:00,207 --> 01:25:01,428
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do a lot of shoring.

1125
01:25:01,469 --> 01:25:03,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very disrupting, very tight space.

1126
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:08,294
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about months of disruption as opposed to just one month of disruption.

1127
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:13,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got dirt being hauled off, dust going off site, all kinds of air quality issues.

1128
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: $2 million in climbing, potentially,

1129
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:21,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We regrouped and we said we have to look at a different approach.

1130
01:25:21,968 --> 01:25:28,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take more time if we need to and do a less invasive method.

1131
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a workable method.

1132
01:25:31,635 --> 01:25:35,037
[SPEAKER_04]: The chemicals might change, but they all do the job.

1133
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: They blast that PCE down to its daughter components.

1134
01:25:40,742 --> 01:25:45,565
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not left with a vicious subcomponent of that.

1135
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:46,506
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll break it down.

1136
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:47,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1137
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:52,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so to me, uh, we're going to spend 900,000.

1138
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:56,441
[SPEAKER_01]: How much has been spent to date, uh, on the remediation of this particular property?

1139
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:58,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been no money spent on remediation.

1140
01:25:58,662 --> 01:26:12,966
[SPEAKER_04]: The money's been spent on studying it, um, meeting the EPA requirements because EPA and giving us the money required that we do a lot of things that follow their regulations, like put out quality assurance protocol plans and that costs money to write those up.

1141
01:26:12,986 --> 01:26:14,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus the APCA.

1142
01:26:15,148 --> 01:26:16,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I should rephrase that.

1143
01:26:16,609 --> 01:26:19,251
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money has been spent by the business owners?

1144
01:26:22,073 --> 01:26:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, I couldn't tell you about the past, but currently the city is picking up the cost of monitoring at the businesses.

1145
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I know that.

1146
01:26:32,139 --> 01:26:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know what's been spent from the Canal Street business?

1147
01:26:37,022 --> 01:26:40,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Stephens has said he has spent, say, $60,000.

1148
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:43,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what Mr. Pompeo or Ms.

1149
01:26:44,007 --> 01:26:44,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Eng spent.

1150
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:45,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1151
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:54,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, you know, I, I, I'm glad we're moving forward on this, but I think we've been talking about this for what, four or five years now.

1152
01:26:54,911 --> 01:26:55,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1153
01:26:55,132 --> 01:27:02,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, I mean, it's, it's been a long time and I'm a little discouraged to hear that, uh, we're potentially talking about another three and a half years.

1154
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:12,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and, and I realized the appreciation, appreciate the fact that, uh, we can remediate this in a,

1155
01:27:14,406 --> 01:27:21,347
[SPEAKER_01]: a less intrusive way, I guess, by not digging and removing, but it's a far longer process.

1156
01:27:21,928 --> 01:27:37,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you just laid out in a process we'd hate to do to businesses, we're doing it in the square, right at the Craddock bridge, where we have a three and a half year project, almost four years of digging, dust, debris, and everything else under the sun.

1157
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:42,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't seem to be much mention about that particular business.

1158
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:43,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

1159
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:45,246
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and saying, well, what about the business?

1160
01:27:45,306 --> 01:28:03,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we are in West Medford and behind the liquor store saying, well, we don't want to really get in there and, you know, start ripping it up and digging it out and cutting it off, which to me, uh, may have been more expensive, but probably the better approach, uh, now that we're going on four or five years and another three and a half years.

1161
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's assuming it works.

1162
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,722
[SPEAKER_01]: As you stated, there's no guarantee.

1163
01:28:08,002 --> 01:28:08,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's guaranteed.

1164
01:28:09,259 --> 01:28:12,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could be here three years from now saying, what's the next step?

1165
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:16,844
[SPEAKER_01]: We've treated it with two or three different injections, and it's still not working.

1166
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:17,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know.

1167
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:19,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess none of us know.

1168
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:20,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's going to be the wiser?

1169
01:28:21,847 --> 01:28:27,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what else did I have written down?

1170
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:32,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would just say that the bench tests are promising.

1171
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bench test would be, you take a sample of the soil and the groundwater.

1172
01:28:37,532 --> 01:28:49,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's a scientific experiment on, we're going to take this real life condition, real soil, real groundwater, real contaminant, and apply the chemical and see what it does to it.

1173
01:28:49,364 --> 01:28:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And it worked.

1174
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:50,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1175
01:28:50,766 --> 01:28:56,091
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one particular, I know they drilled a lot of holes, but you're hitting up one particular spot.

1176
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:57,473
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if that's the hot spot.

1177
01:28:58,522 --> 01:29:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've got different hot spots, and it's like pincushion, these two hot spots, soil and groundwater.

1178
01:29:06,749 --> 01:29:09,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of different points being drilled.

1179
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:16,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I did say that there's a possible dean apple in the ground somewhere, which is like blobs of PCE.

1180
01:29:16,357 --> 01:29:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for the surfactant is to draw it out, detach it from the soil so that it will go into solution and then can interact with the oxidant and be annihilated.

1181
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:31,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We will know from the first round how it's going.

1182
01:29:32,866 --> 01:29:36,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't have to know two years from now whether or not this is working or not.

1183
01:29:38,508 --> 01:29:39,589
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first round is how long?

1184
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:45,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first round you start monitoring about three to four weeks after your injections.

1185
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:48,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're looking, you know, you're just tracking and seeing what your levels are.

1186
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,793
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going into the wells and you're drawing samples and you're testing it.

1187
01:29:52,413 --> 01:29:54,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have, I would think,

1188
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:58,184
[SPEAKER_04]: within six to eight months, a pretty good picture of how we're doing.

1189
01:29:59,385 --> 01:30:02,566
[SPEAKER_04]: These companies that do this kind of work are very conservative.

1190
01:30:02,866 --> 01:30:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: They really don't like to go out on a limb and make promises that they can't keep.

1191
01:30:07,349 --> 01:30:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to couch things in certain ways.

1192
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a civil engineer.

1193
01:30:11,511 --> 01:30:12,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a conservative person.

1194
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:17,075
[SPEAKER_04]: In my profession, I don't wildly promise results.

1195
01:30:17,815 --> 01:30:19,776
[SPEAKER_04]: But this works.

1196
01:30:19,856 --> 01:30:22,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been done before in multiple places.

1197
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:27,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, the conservative approach would have been to dig it up and cut it off.

1198
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,242
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been to me, the conservative approach.

1199
01:30:31,162 --> 01:30:32,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that's, that's my own opinion.

1200
01:30:32,964 --> 01:30:33,984
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my, that's my own opinion.

1201
01:30:34,004 --> 01:30:41,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, Mr. President, I just asked that we receive continued updates on this, um, from the city engineer and from the city administration.

1202
01:30:42,551 --> 01:30:44,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, ultimately I'm not sure who makes the call.

1203
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:49,636
[SPEAKER_01]: If in eight months from now, is it your decision to say, Hey, wait, enough's enough.

1204
01:30:49,676 --> 01:30:50,056
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent,

1205
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:54,203
[SPEAKER_01]: 500,000, we're not any closer to removing the contaminants.

1206
01:30:54,523 --> 01:30:55,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Who makes that final?

1207
01:30:55,844 --> 01:30:58,066
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a consultant that makes that decision?

1208
01:30:58,306 --> 01:31:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be doing it in concert.

1209
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:04,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have the DEP available to us.

1210
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:05,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our consultant.

1211
01:31:06,132 --> 01:31:07,073
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the EPA.

1212
01:31:07,774 --> 01:31:08,875
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're spending their money.

1213
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:11,116
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very interested in the outcome of this.

1214
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:13,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's me and other professionals in this building.

1215
01:31:14,019 --> 01:31:14,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1216
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the utmost faith and confidence in you.

1217
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:19,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we talked to the business owners.

1218
01:31:19,727 --> 01:31:26,513
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can feel this sense of frustration of, uh, you know, uh, how long this has been taken.

1219
01:31:26,533 --> 01:31:31,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, many business owners feel that they haven't been at the table during discussions.

1220
01:31:31,757 --> 01:31:42,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure you probably heard this or not, but, uh, they're very upset about the fact that they weren't privy to a lot of the dialogue and discussion, uh, or at least had some notification on what's happening.

1221
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:47,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all the abundance have been notified regarding this project and the lack of the pocket lot, uh,

1222
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, we went through that at the public meeting for the alternatives analyses when we had to write the ABCA, you know, analysis of various different alternatives.

1223
01:31:57,742 --> 01:31:59,642
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one of eight alternatives.

1224
01:32:00,322 --> 01:32:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a balance.

1225
01:32:02,042 --> 01:32:07,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a blend of, you know, effectiveness and cost and time.

1226
01:32:07,423 --> 01:32:10,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best choice looking at all these considerations.

1227
01:32:10,704 --> 01:32:13,505
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the abutters have copies of that report.

1228
01:32:14,145 --> 01:32:15,625
[SPEAKER_04]: They came to the public meetings.

1229
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:19,485
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me occasionally or talk to me and say, hey, what's going on?

1230
01:32:20,205 --> 01:32:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: They do express concerns.

1231
01:32:23,387 --> 01:32:24,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't dispute their concerns.

1232
01:32:24,969 --> 01:32:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're very valid.

1233
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:29,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be around as we work on this.

1234
01:32:29,972 --> 01:32:32,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a visible location.

1235
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:33,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very small site.

1236
01:32:37,438 --> 01:32:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't clean it, this won't go anywhere.

1237
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:42,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll still sit there like it is.

1238
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:48,894
[SPEAKER_04]: leaching into the street, getting into our, you know, maybe our water and sewer system trenches, who knows where it's going to go.

1239
01:32:48,914 --> 01:32:49,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have to do something.

1240
01:32:50,415 --> 01:33:04,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I would also ask as part of the report that, uh, if there's any cost incurred by any of the direct abutters of this particular location, that they receive reimbursement from, uh, the grant that is out there over $200,000 in state funding.

1241
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:14,650
[SPEAKER_01]: that I assume would be available to offset any cost that for any of the bodies directly affected by any of this work that's taken place.

1242
01:33:16,491 --> 01:33:16,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1243
01:33:16,831 --> 01:33:20,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Council max chair recognizes vice-president London current.

1244
01:33:20,952 --> 01:33:21,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1245
01:33:21,352 --> 01:33:21,892
[SPEAKER_19]: President Delaware.

1246
01:33:21,912 --> 01:33:25,453
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was going to say, where's the 200,000 come into play?

1247
01:33:25,493 --> 01:33:26,173
[SPEAKER_19]: That's left over.

1248
01:33:26,193 --> 01:33:29,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we expecting this to cost another 1.1?

1249
01:33:29,394 --> 01:33:29,534
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no.

1250
01:33:29,574 --> 01:33:30,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That 200,000 will be applied.

1251
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:36,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're asking for $900.

1252
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: We have $200.

1253
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:37,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We have $1.1.

1254
01:33:38,373 --> 01:33:40,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an outside number.

1255
01:33:42,054 --> 01:33:46,936
[SPEAKER_04]: With all things considered, we may not spend the $900.

1256
01:33:47,096 --> 01:33:49,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The $200 goes first.

1257
01:33:50,677 --> 01:33:52,778
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, $200 goes first, then the $900?

1258
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:53,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Follows, yeah.

1259
01:33:53,818 --> 01:33:55,719
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what will we do if we have remaining monies?

1260
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:59,380
[SPEAKER_19]: I would expect it would go back, right?

1261
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,101
[SPEAKER_05]: We could re-approve them, or approve to go back to home.

1262
01:34:03,126 --> 01:34:04,687
[SPEAKER_19]: put it back to water-retained earnings?

1263
01:34:05,627 --> 01:34:06,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1264
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:30,198
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, with regards, I think Council Member Marks touched upon it, with regards to the RFP that goes out, will there be a back-out clause if, so if testing after six months doesn't show improvement or enough improvement, will there be, I think Council Member Marks mentioned who can back out, but are we going to make sure we have a back-out clause?

1265
01:34:30,655 --> 01:34:32,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll have the ability to cancel the contract.

1266
01:34:33,017 --> 01:34:35,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That's standard language in our contracts.

1267
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:36,841
[SPEAKER_04]: With written notice, we can cancel.

1268
01:34:40,184 --> 01:34:42,085
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what if a company we hire goes bankrupt?

1269
01:34:42,105 --> 01:34:45,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't, you know, if something like that happens, we would be able to cancel.

1270
01:34:45,969 --> 01:34:50,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1271
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:51,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1272
01:34:51,634 --> 01:34:52,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Chair awaits motion.

1273
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:54,777
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a proposal.

1274
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:56,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Here before us.

1275
01:34:57,026 --> 01:35:10,471
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been amended by councillor Caraviello and councillor marks twice I believe there's a citizen that wishes to address us So if you would give the citizens some room to address us and sir, would you please state your name and address?

1276
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:11,451
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Robert Penter.

1277
01:35:11,471 --> 01:35:20,815
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at zero summit Road method mass at the outset I'd like to congratulate councillor Caraviello and coming the incoming president for next year and councillor marks I believe you the incoming vice president

1278
01:35:22,397 --> 01:35:27,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I have some concerns over this subject matter, because having served on the city council, I've been a part of this.

1279
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:31,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of my concerns reflect upon the following issues.

1280
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:40,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one, when we talk about the $900,000 that you folks are being asked to appropriate here tonight, first $200,000 supposedly is coming from the remaining amount.

1281
01:35:40,983 --> 01:35:45,445
[SPEAKER_12]: There is nothing in here that talks about change orders or this being a fixed fee.

1282
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:51,767
[SPEAKER_12]: So you really don't have anything in front of you that tells you that this is going to be a definitive number, because this number could escalate.

1283
01:35:52,627 --> 01:35:54,367
[SPEAKER_12]: if, in fact, things were to change.

1284
01:35:55,428 --> 01:36:00,529
[SPEAKER_12]: And if, in fact, this is a $900,000 project, why are you folks paying for it up front at 100%?

1285
01:36:01,149 --> 01:36:04,769
[SPEAKER_12]: If this is going to be a two-, three-year project, why wouldn't you be paying for it?

1286
01:36:04,829 --> 01:36:08,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Why wouldn't the city be proposing to make a payment over a three-year period of time?

1287
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:12,831
[SPEAKER_12]: That way there, according to the engineer, she's not guaranteeing anything.

1288
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:22,213
[SPEAKER_12]: But the fact of the matter is, if this thing doesn't work out, at least you have some leverage to go back to make sure that they do what they're supposed to do, or something needs to be changed to correct the problem.

1289
01:36:22,546 --> 01:36:23,427
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll take place.

1290
01:36:24,147 --> 01:36:38,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And also taking into consideration this is an excessive $1 million project, there doesn't seem to be any bond performance that seems to be being presented here, protecting the city's asset, which is its cash, which is that of the Medford public taxpayer.

1291
01:36:39,117 --> 01:36:41,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're looking at a cost factor.

1292
01:36:41,599 --> 01:36:45,741
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have anything in front of you that tells you that a bond performance is going to be had here.

1293
01:36:46,122 --> 01:36:51,285
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing telling you as to why you're paying it up front rather than over an extended period of time.

1294
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That, to me, would present a concern.

1295
01:36:55,082 --> 01:37:06,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I don't know if there was an enviro-forensic analysis that took place relative to the composition of what the problem is in the ground.

1296
01:37:07,608 --> 01:37:12,552
[SPEAKER_12]: These are specialist people who come in, and I'm quite sure that our city engineer is aware of these type of people.

1297
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:18,357
[SPEAKER_12]: They're experts, and they can tell you that what and if the city is using is the right treatment to be done.

1298
01:37:18,577 --> 01:37:19,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1299
01:37:19,638 --> 01:37:24,402
[SPEAKER_12]: The last time I know of a public hearing on this matter, because I attended it, was in August of 2015.

1300
01:37:25,043 --> 01:37:35,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And in that report that took place and presented in August of 2015, a public hearing was supposed to take place before this Medford City Council

1301
01:37:35,908 --> 01:37:43,533
[SPEAKER_12]: and for the people of Medford and for the people affected in the West Medford area to come forward to listen to what's being presented.

1302
01:37:44,093 --> 01:37:50,417
[SPEAKER_12]: You are being presented the lowest of the numbers as compared to the highest of the numbers to resolve this problem.

1303
01:37:50,617 --> 01:37:52,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you're aware of this, Councilor Caraviello.

1304
01:37:52,558 --> 01:37:55,099
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're aware of the fact, because you were there with me at the meeting.

1305
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:00,923
[SPEAKER_12]: This 900,000 figure is the lowest of whatever it's going to cost to remediate this particular project.

1306
01:38:01,463 --> 01:38:02,984
[SPEAKER_12]: The city of Medford and the taxpayers

1307
01:38:03,236 --> 01:38:07,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And those business owners, as Councilman Max has alluded to, deserve more and deserve better.

1308
01:38:07,258 --> 01:38:17,444
[SPEAKER_12]: To wait almost three years and hold your property up for almost three years cancels out any idea of the fact that the property can be sold and somebody would have to come in and deal with this.

1309
01:38:18,104 --> 01:38:24,588
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're going to go out for a bid, maybe the bid should go out and be inclusive of the fact that if somebody's going to come in and make a bid,

1310
01:38:24,928 --> 01:38:31,577
[SPEAKER_12]: to do this project, maybe the bid should include somebody wanting to buy the product, buy this particular subject matter.

1311
01:38:31,997 --> 01:38:34,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe that person who buys it will have to pay for it.

1312
01:38:35,341 --> 01:38:40,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Therefore, if we are going to go out of our way to pay to remediate this piece of property,

1313
01:38:40,996 --> 01:38:47,699
[SPEAKER_12]: And then once it's remediated, and if it's corrected properly, the business owners then go out and sell the property at a much higher rate.

1314
01:38:48,459 --> 01:38:50,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Who loses out on that particular deal?

1315
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And that particular deal, the city loses out.

1316
01:38:52,881 --> 01:38:55,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think your options need to be put both ways.

1317
01:38:55,502 --> 01:38:59,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe somebody coming in who wants to buy the property, or somebody coming in to remediate it.

1318
01:39:00,044 --> 01:39:01,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just see what's out there.

1319
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's offering whatever needs to be offered?

1320
01:39:03,705 --> 01:39:04,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1321
01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:10,648
[SPEAKER_12]: You also talked about the fact that you want to take this money

1322
01:39:11,588 --> 01:39:15,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And you want to take it from the Water Enterprise Retained Earnings Account.

1323
01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:24,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we all know that the enterprise account here in the city of Medford dates back to 1983, 1984, when the city of Medford first entertained it.

1324
01:39:24,219 --> 01:39:37,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know that the city of Medford's enterprise fund, its enterprise fund, is one that's considered, for its best practice, and for this fund, it's for water, sewer, and stormwater systems, period.

1325
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:39,632
[SPEAKER_12]: The law is very specific.

1326
01:39:40,312 --> 01:39:42,994
[SPEAKER_12]: when it turns around and tells you what it cannot be used for.

1327
01:39:44,115 --> 01:39:54,424
[SPEAKER_12]: The community may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries.

1328
01:39:55,005 --> 01:39:56,466
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a public safety issue.

1329
01:39:56,866 --> 01:40:03,232
[SPEAKER_12]: This public safety issue wraps itself around an environmental issue and maybe a public health issue, but it's a public safety issue first.

1330
01:40:03,822 --> 01:40:11,788
[SPEAKER_12]: This has got nothing to do with your infrastructure of water, stormwater, or infrastructure for any of these pipes that are going on.

1331
01:40:12,368 --> 01:40:17,572
[SPEAKER_12]: The City of Medford presently sits on over, I believe, close to $9 million in your free cash account.

1332
01:40:18,313 --> 01:40:26,759
[SPEAKER_12]: If the City of Medford wants to go forward and pay for this without disturbing that process of profit that you have almost $8.5 million in your water and sewer account,

1333
01:40:27,092 --> 01:40:39,577
[SPEAKER_12]: You have nothing presented before you tonight that talks about any kind of major infrastructure in this community, nothing more than fixing a parking lot that's been there for many, many years that the city's had control over.

1334
01:40:39,997 --> 01:40:47,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're doing a disservice not only to yourselves, but to the enterprise fund account, because that money is there for a specific purpose.

1335
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus the fact enterprise account, on an annual basis,

1336
01:40:52,148 --> 01:40:55,910
[SPEAKER_12]: The accounting needs to come forward as to tell you what they're going to spend their money on.

1337
01:40:56,691 --> 01:41:13,561
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you're getting a hit for $900,000 right now that was not put in any part of the budget, no public hearing has taken place, and the city administration wants you to go forward and spend this money on something that's going to take almost a three-year process, and you're paying up front.

1338
01:41:14,353 --> 01:41:17,594
[SPEAKER_12]: something that's not even going to be guaranteed by any kind of a bond performance.

1339
01:41:18,054 --> 01:41:21,816
[SPEAKER_12]: What if the contractor goes bust, goes, becomes bankrupt?

1340
01:41:22,356 --> 01:41:23,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Where does the city go then?

1341
01:41:24,357 --> 01:41:31,239
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you've got to protect your assets here and the assets is the taxpayer's money for what needs to be done.

1342
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:41,383
[SPEAKER_12]: More importantly, you know, when you sit here and you think about all the things you talk about on a daily basis, you know, things that you might, you may want to call this environmental.

1343
01:41:41,403 --> 01:41:42,523
[SPEAKER_12]: You may want to call it public health.

1344
01:41:42,543 --> 01:41:43,824
[SPEAKER_12]: You may want to call it public safety.

1345
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're taking money from an account that it shouldn't be coming from.

1346
01:41:48,580 --> 01:42:09,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless somebody can come up before this podium and explain to you that Medford's Water and Sewer account, its Water and Sewer Enterprise account, can legally transfer this money, for which the law under Chapter 44, Section 58, F and a half, and 44, Section 38 and 43 says that you can't.

1347
01:42:09,924 --> 01:42:13,625
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Department of Revenue also says that you can't.

1348
01:42:14,069 --> 01:42:18,671
[SPEAKER_12]: under the Bureau accounts under the guideline release of 08-101.

1349
01:42:19,071 --> 01:42:21,312
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot transfer this money.

1350
01:42:23,372 --> 01:42:24,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

1351
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:26,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the podium right now.

1352
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:37,277
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when we had this discussion a few years ago and then keep bringing it forward and we're going forward and we're bringing it forward for the next three years or whatever it might be, there's no guarantee here.

1353
01:42:37,557 --> 01:42:39,518
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no guarantee here that this is going to work.

1354
01:42:39,558 --> 01:42:40,018
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree.

1355
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,080
[SPEAKER_12]: with the city engineer.

1356
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:42,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing's guaranteed in life.

1357
01:42:42,381 --> 01:42:45,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the only thing that's guaranteed is we're all going to die someday.

1358
01:42:45,361 --> 01:42:51,783
[SPEAKER_12]: But while we're alive and while we're elected to do the people's business, maybe we should look at all our options that we need to have.

1359
01:42:52,403 --> 01:42:53,883
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to have that public hearing.

1360
01:42:54,183 --> 01:43:01,205
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to present it before the city, the people of the city, to the public, to the taxpayers over here, and to yourselves as to know what's going on.

1361
01:43:01,405 --> 01:43:05,726
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to know all your financial options and how we're getting to them and how you are getting to them tonight.

1362
01:43:06,266 --> 01:43:07,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, you've got $900,000 being asked to transfer.

1363
01:43:09,855 --> 01:43:11,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I would respectfully state that I would put that on hold.

1364
01:43:12,517 --> 01:43:17,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I would request if you want to take it out of free cash, if in fact it's that important.

1365
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:23,504
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really think you need to have that public hearing and to hear all the comments from all the people and to understand what the valuation is.

1366
01:43:23,725 --> 01:43:29,849
[SPEAKER_12]: And you need your city assessor down here because you're going to take the evaluations of the property today, right now, which can't be sold.

1367
01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:31,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them can't be sold.

1368
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:35,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And as it's going to be in three years, if in fact it is remediated, whether it can be sold,

1369
01:43:36,152 --> 01:43:43,459
[SPEAKER_12]: So that means the city of Medford is going to spend in excess of a million dollars, if not more, to make somebody else's property beneficial to be sold.

1370
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:45,862
[SPEAKER_12]: True, they did not cause the problem.

1371
01:43:46,342 --> 01:43:47,063
[SPEAKER_12]: But we need to look.

1372
01:43:47,123 --> 01:43:48,284
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at the short term.

1373
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:49,425
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking at the long term.

1374
01:43:49,465 --> 01:43:52,448
[SPEAKER_12]: And the long term tells me you need to have more of a discussion on this.

1375
01:43:52,808 --> 01:43:55,351
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been hanging around for a long period of time.

1376
01:43:55,991 --> 01:43:57,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you need another committee meeting.

1377
01:43:57,552 --> 01:44:06,415
[SPEAKER_12]: You definitely need that public hearing because that was part and parcel of the $100,000 cost that the city paid to have an outside consultant come in.

1378
01:44:06,756 --> 01:44:13,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you remember correctly, they also paid $5,000 for another company to come in to check over the $100,000 consultant's report.

1379
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:16,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So you really need to take a look at it.

1380
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:24,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And you really need to understand that you're buying the lowest of whatever was proposed to remediate the problem, hoping that it would resolve it.

1381
01:44:29,885 --> 01:44:30,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to meet you.

1382
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:41,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I just want to address some of his concerns, if that's okay with you, Mr. Chair.

1383
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you may.

1384
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,536
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, when we do a contract, we have- To the chair.

1385
01:44:46,556 --> 01:44:47,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, to the chair.

1386
01:44:47,296 --> 01:44:51,959
[SPEAKER_05]: When we do encumber a contract, it has to be for the full amount.

1387
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,561
[SPEAKER_05]: She can't just pay it in increments.

1388
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:56,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be encumbered for the whole amount.

1389
01:44:57,103 --> 01:44:59,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as for the legality of the retained earnings,

1390
01:44:59,782 --> 01:45:02,543
[SPEAKER_05]: It is legal, it is groundwater that is contaminated.

1391
01:45:03,064 --> 01:45:05,045
[SPEAKER_05]: She can legally use that.

1392
01:45:06,045 --> 01:45:07,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in violation of the law.

1393
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:08,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1394
01:45:09,467 --> 01:45:09,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1395
01:45:09,787 --> 01:45:10,828
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair awaits a motion.

1396
01:45:13,429 --> 01:45:16,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Ma'am, if you'd like to address the council, welcome.

1397
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1398
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:24,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Folks, would you give speakers some, uh, uh, breathing room around the podium so they don't feel encumbered or impressed upon.

1399
01:45:25,175 --> 01:45:25,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1400
01:45:25,793 --> 01:45:26,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1401
01:45:26,313 --> 01:45:28,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Gina Muzo, 35 Parish Street, Medford.

1402
01:45:29,214 --> 01:45:32,915
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I have a few points that concern me.

1403
01:45:33,955 --> 01:45:41,537
[SPEAKER_17]: As this dialogue went back and forth, we'd been talking about soil contamination and a plume in the soil.

1404
01:45:42,317 --> 01:45:46,378
[SPEAKER_17]: And just now, offhandedly, someone said, it's our groundwater.

1405
01:45:48,435 --> 01:46:05,867
[SPEAKER_17]: This troubles me because if we're going to start injecting chemical into the ground to hopefully treat against these PECs, there's nothing to say that we're going to just disturb them and push them further into the groundwater and further contaminate spaces that may not already have a plume.

1406
01:46:07,187 --> 01:46:11,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel that what we need to do is an assessment.

1407
01:46:11,891 --> 01:46:13,932
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to have a geological assessment.

1408
01:46:14,565 --> 01:46:19,989
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to have geoscientists involved, and they need to assess specifically the chemical.

1409
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:28,176
[SPEAKER_17]: They can assess specifically where that plume goes, and they can assess specifically how it enters into the groundwater.

1410
01:46:28,696 --> 01:46:35,782
[SPEAKER_17]: At the point where you're not just talking about soil, and you talk about groundwater, the implications of that

1411
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:42,711
[SPEAKER_17]: in that neighborhood, and not only that neighborhood, in abutting areas and under the water table becomes significant.

1412
01:46:43,231 --> 01:46:44,632
[SPEAKER_17]: This troubles me greatly.

1413
01:46:45,172 --> 01:46:51,476
[SPEAKER_17]: It troubles me greatly because I'm sure they've worked hard, but there's still a lot of unknowns.

1414
01:46:52,116 --> 01:47:03,363
[SPEAKER_17]: And to come up and say that the city is prepared to step forward and enter into a contract with the lowest bidder in a project that they're not sure how it's going to work,

1415
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:09,544
[SPEAKER_17]: troubles me significantly as a project planner, as a project manager.

1416
01:47:10,404 --> 01:47:12,105
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the right way to approach it.

1417
01:47:12,685 --> 01:47:17,307
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a taxpayer, to spend $900,000 on a project that we're not sure is going to work

1418
01:47:21,673 --> 01:47:42,921
[SPEAKER_17]: after already having a sunk cost of $200,000 plus an additional $200,000 surplus, this is a big project to have someone not have a clearer understanding when that clearer understanding can be attained with the proper consultancy services.

1419
01:47:43,762 --> 01:47:44,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1420
01:47:44,202 --> 01:47:47,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

1421
01:47:49,673 --> 01:47:53,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick correction here, I want to make my point clear.

1422
01:47:53,776 --> 01:48:07,104
[SPEAKER_12]: The Department of Revenue through its Bureau of Accounts indicates that every community with an enterprise fund establish a written internal policy regarding indirect cost allocations and should review this policy annually.

1423
01:48:07,124 --> 01:48:08,745
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an annually written report.

1424
01:48:09,365 --> 01:48:14,168
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an indirect cost to the normal water and sewer account.

1425
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:18,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And if in fact the new city auditor indicated that it's legal

1426
01:48:19,419 --> 01:48:20,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Show me a case.

1427
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Show us a city.

1428
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:21,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Strike that.

1429
01:48:22,302 --> 01:48:25,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Show you folks a case and a city where this has taken place.

1430
01:48:26,486 --> 01:48:35,234
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not within the guidelines as provided under the Massachusetts General Laws, and it's not provided in the Department of Revenue Bureau of Accounts guidelines.

1431
01:48:35,774 --> 01:48:40,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if she can produce a case that says that you can take that money from there, that's all well and good.

1432
01:48:40,299 --> 01:48:41,880
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said, I've yet to find it.

1433
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,161
[SPEAKER_12]: It's yet to be proven to me.

1434
01:48:43,422 --> 01:48:44,783
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it needs to be proven to you.

1435
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Because $900,000 is a lot of money to take out of a surplus account.

1436
01:48:49,143 --> 01:48:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you take that money out of your water and sewer account, the better question is, why are you sitting on $8.5 million when people throughout this whole community talk about water pressure problems up in the heights?

1437
01:49:00,131 --> 01:49:03,934
[SPEAKER_12]: They talk about groundwater problems in certain parts.

1438
01:49:03,974 --> 01:49:06,216
[SPEAKER_12]: You have storm drains that can't hold water.

1439
01:49:06,817 --> 01:49:10,119
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the projects you should be talking about if you want to talk about water and sewer account.

1440
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,943
[SPEAKER_12]: And this dollar amount was never mentioned anywhere in the accounting.

1441
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:17,866
[SPEAKER_12]: of this new proposal that's being before you here this evening.

1442
01:49:19,607 --> 01:49:24,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds great if you want to rectify it, but financing is another thing and you have the money in free cash.

1443
01:49:25,652 --> 01:49:29,294
[SPEAKER_12]: So why would you want to disturb an account that's there for a particular purpose?

1444
01:49:30,035 --> 01:49:34,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I respectfully disagree with the new director because she doesn't produce anything.

1445
01:49:34,478 --> 01:49:35,559
[SPEAKER_12]: She's just saying it's legal.

1446
01:49:36,179 --> 01:49:39,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if it's legal, they wouldn't write it in here that you can't use it for that purpose.

1447
01:49:40,262 --> 01:49:42,264
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no case to be proven that it can be.

1448
01:49:42,933 --> 01:49:45,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Once that's before you, I've got no problem, then the choice is yours.

1449
01:49:45,915 --> 01:49:51,138
[SPEAKER_12]: But I believe as it stands before you right now, you have an option to go another way to fund this if that be the case.

1450
01:49:51,438 --> 01:50:09,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I respectfully disagree that you can fund, you can negotiate a contract that does take place in segments, not all together up front, because there in itself presents no guarantee to the city of Medford or to you folks that your vote is really gonna be worth anything if that person or that company falls or goes bankrupt or whatever it might be.

1451
01:50:10,509 --> 01:50:11,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, sir.

1452
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:11,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1453
01:50:18,185 --> 01:50:18,625
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may.

1454
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:19,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1455
01:50:20,585 --> 01:50:22,886
[SPEAKER_04]: The RFP is not selecting a low bidder.

1456
01:50:24,066 --> 01:50:31,828
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we want to go out for an RFP and not a bid, so we can select the best qualified consultant, the best qualified contractor.

1457
01:50:32,608 --> 01:50:37,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Price is a consideration, but there'll be other criteria that will be used to evaluate this contractor.

1458
01:50:38,789 --> 01:50:45,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, the plume, as it was mentioned, the ISCO injections will start at the outside and work their way in.

1459
01:50:46,327 --> 01:50:49,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not pushing any water outside of the plume that's been defined.

1460
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cleaning from the outside in.

1461
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:57,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And third, the site has been studied quite thoroughly, soil and groundwater.

1462
01:50:57,992 --> 01:51:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've mentioned groundwater up here at the podium at least a few times as I've discussed the treatment process.

1463
01:51:06,576 --> 01:51:11,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's RFP, treat outside, work your way in.

1464
01:51:12,192 --> 01:51:14,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all layers.

1465
01:51:14,874 --> 01:51:17,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the vadose zone, which is the unsaturated zone.

1466
01:51:17,876 --> 01:51:20,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's groundwater table, down to 25 feet where we hit clay.

1467
01:51:21,578 --> 01:51:22,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very, very much.

1468
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:23,340
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1469
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's another citizen who would like to address us.

1470
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:27,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

1471
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:29,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1472
01:51:29,644 --> 01:51:30,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1473
01:51:30,164 --> 01:51:31,425
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is DJ Dabeningo.

1474
01:51:32,069 --> 01:51:33,729
[SPEAKER_16]: 470 High Street in West Medford.

1475
01:51:34,429 --> 01:51:37,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm one of the several businesses that utilizes that lot during the day.

1476
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:49,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Every January, I head up Main Street, I buy my business permit from Republic for the $100 for the year, which guarantees, not guarantees me, but allows me to park there for free during the day while I conduct my business.

1477
01:51:51,493 --> 01:51:58,654
[SPEAKER_16]: One of our policies in the square, kind of an unwritten rule, is the business owners don't really park in front of their businesses to allow spots for customers.

1478
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:06,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just was hearing that this construction is going to close down that lot for a period of four to six weeks during the day.

1479
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:12,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, during the day, those 30 to 35 spots, depending on how you want to count them, are always filled.

1480
01:52:12,986 --> 01:52:15,208
[SPEAKER_16]: There might be one or two where you can pull in, pull out.

1481
01:52:15,768 --> 01:52:23,352
[SPEAKER_16]: But for the most part, you're going to be now taking away 30 to 35 spots, which includes business owners who paid for a permit to park in that lot.

1482
01:52:23,813 --> 01:52:25,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I have cameras behind that building.

1483
01:52:25,373 --> 01:52:26,734
[SPEAKER_16]: I just pulled up the back lot.

1484
01:52:26,774 --> 01:52:27,975
[SPEAKER_16]: There's not a single car there.

1485
01:52:28,495 --> 01:52:35,217
[SPEAKER_16]: We just had National Grid construction go on in our street in front of my shop a couple of months ago that happened from 7 p.m.

1486
01:52:35,257 --> 01:52:35,997
[SPEAKER_16]: to 5 a.m.

1487
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:37,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Monday through Friday.

1488
01:52:38,117 --> 01:52:43,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was meant to non-disrupt the businesses in that area and allow on-street parking.

1489
01:52:44,179 --> 01:52:48,280
[SPEAKER_16]: At 5 or 6 o'clock, the police came in, they cleared out the cars, they started their construction.

1490
01:52:48,893 --> 01:52:49,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand.

1491
01:52:49,794 --> 01:52:55,338
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not opposed to this project, but when there's no cars here, why can't we have the construction overnight?

1492
01:52:55,898 --> 01:52:57,940
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it doesn't sound like it's going to be a loud thing.

1493
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe the little bit of drilling, a little bit of injecting of whatever.

1494
01:53:01,391 --> 01:53:16,759
[SPEAKER_16]: But it just really concerns me where now you're saying up towards of 12 weeks, business owners won't be able to park back there during the day when they have to utilize that lot where they're making deliveries, bringing products into their store, bringing them out of their store, their customers rely on it too.

1495
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:21,802
[SPEAKER_16]: So just please keep us in the loop as West Midford business owners, you know.

1496
01:53:21,822 --> 01:53:23,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1497
01:53:24,743 --> 01:53:26,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

1498
01:53:27,164 --> 01:53:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the engineer said the parking lot will be closed

1499
01:53:30,962 --> 01:53:32,703
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time, not just during the day.

1500
01:53:33,804 --> 01:53:38,367
[SPEAKER_07]: During that four to six weeks, it will be closed for day and night.

1501
01:53:38,968 --> 01:53:40,669
[SPEAKER_16]: The way I heard it is I thought it was going to be open.

1502
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: If I understood it right, it was a day and night project because they've been using chemicals and the contaminants.

1503
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:46,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1504
01:53:49,415 --> 01:53:50,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1505
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:59,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we would have the parking lot closed full time, but when there's no activity at night, the patio at Snappy Patty's could be open for business.

1506
01:54:00,602 --> 01:54:01,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1507
01:54:01,762 --> 01:54:12,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep in mind that we're asking that there be a representative from the city and the engineer's office who's familiar with the project to come down and address the local business owners.

1508
01:54:12,807 --> 01:54:18,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's clearly imperative for this to be a successful process.

1509
01:54:18,669 --> 01:54:19,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

1510
01:54:19,529 --> 01:54:24,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been speaking with Allie Fisk, who's the mayor's business liaison.

1511
01:54:25,171 --> 01:54:27,392
[SPEAKER_04]: She and I are beginning to talk about this project.

1512
01:54:27,412 --> 01:54:29,653
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to coordinate, so she's the

1513
01:54:31,115 --> 01:54:51,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Point person from the mayor's office as well as I've gone up and down the street handing out flyers talking to people letting them know It is you know it is unfortunately a disturbance But thank you very much citizen if you'd like to continue Yep, just just one more ad you know if there's something that can be worked out with the city with Republic to maybe lower that fee as we're now going to

1514
01:54:52,813 --> 01:54:56,555
[SPEAKER_16]: 12 out of 52 weeks out of the year, we now can't park in that lot now 24 hours a day.

1515
01:54:57,596 --> 01:55:07,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how that would pertain to Steve Pompeo, who actually owns some of the spots in that lot towards his building, whether that'd still be left open or if the whole thing gets shut down.

1516
01:55:07,721 --> 01:55:14,684
[SPEAKER_16]: But like I said, it's 30 to 35 spots that you're now gonna inconvenience to either push on the street or tell people to walk further to their businesses.

1517
01:55:15,265 --> 01:55:18,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So please keep that in mind when this comes time for this project.

1518
01:55:18,726 --> 01:55:18,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1519
01:55:20,346 --> 01:55:22,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lugo-Kearns.

1520
01:55:22,787 --> 01:55:23,407
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll yield.

1521
01:55:24,907 --> 01:55:25,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, citizen.

1522
01:55:25,948 --> 01:55:26,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1523
01:55:26,548 --> 01:55:40,872
[SPEAKER_17]: If I may, just through the chair, inquire from our city engineer what organization or consultancy conducted the study, and how would parties of interest get a copy of it for review?

1524
01:55:41,973 --> 01:55:42,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1525
01:55:42,493 --> 01:55:43,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1526
01:55:50,303 --> 01:55:52,464
[SPEAKER_04]: The consultant we hired is Brown and Caldwell.

1527
01:55:53,185 --> 01:55:57,147
[SPEAKER_04]: The consultant that reviewed Brown and Caldwell's reports was GZA.

1528
01:55:57,947 --> 01:56:04,851
[SPEAKER_04]: The DEP has also been involved, and I'd be happy to provide the release tracking number information for the DEP website.

1529
01:56:04,971 --> 01:56:07,772
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the reports are available online for review.

1530
01:56:10,374 --> 01:56:12,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mrs. Engineer.

1531
01:56:12,955 --> 01:56:15,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we could now, did you have something else?

1532
01:56:15,837 --> 01:56:17,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can actually read the release tracking number.

1533
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It's RTN3-28477.

1534
01:56:25,344 --> 01:56:26,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1535
01:56:26,304 --> 01:56:26,624
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1536
01:56:26,945 --> 01:56:27,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so very much.

1537
01:56:28,486 --> 01:56:29,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

1538
01:56:30,807 --> 01:56:35,610
[SPEAKER_19]: If our city engineer would just let us know the time frame of going out for an RFP.

1539
01:56:37,592 --> 01:56:47,018
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't believe we're under any time constraints, so do we have a couple weeks to review, obviously, the financial aspect of it, the studies, maybe

1540
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:52,845
[SPEAKER_19]: give a call to our city solicitor and make sure that money can be spent out of that account.

1541
01:56:52,905 --> 01:56:59,708
[SPEAKER_19]: I trust our auditor, but the language does sound a little confusing.

1542
01:56:59,788 --> 01:57:06,991
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could maybe cross our Ts and dot our Is, what are we looking for a time frame as far as we want to start in the spring?

1543
01:57:07,071 --> 01:57:09,272
[SPEAKER_19]: So do we have a month or so to?

1544
01:57:09,992 --> 01:57:11,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Easily a month or so.

1545
01:57:12,073 --> 01:57:16,515
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just issuing the task order to Brown and Caldwell to start the procurement.

1546
01:57:17,216 --> 01:57:20,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't expect to see anything from them to probably early to mid-January.

1547
01:57:21,879 --> 01:57:26,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have to finalize it, advertise.

1548
01:57:28,744 --> 01:57:33,187
[SPEAKER_19]: And then so you're expecting to go for an RFP end of January, sometime February?

1549
01:57:33,748 --> 01:57:40,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope for end of January to give us enough time to review it, hire the contractor, and get them started by early April.

1550
01:57:43,495 --> 01:57:45,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be ideal if we could do that.

1551
01:57:47,054 --> 01:57:47,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1552
01:57:49,335 --> 01:57:58,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, paper 16, Josh seven 89, uh, as amended by councils, Carfiello and council of marks share weights motion through the chair.

1553
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:11,007
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, it just was with us having getting a breakdown, probably hopefully in our Friday packet of the 900,000 talking to the city, you know, try to get a grasp of the law and make sure that it's coming out of the right account.

1554
01:58:11,047 --> 01:58:14,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I don't doubt that maybe it should come out of free cash.

1555
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:15,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

1556
01:58:15,918 --> 01:58:19,519
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could just have a couple of weeks to review the documentation, I don't know how my colleagues feel.

1557
01:58:19,879 --> 01:58:21,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this project needs to get done.

1558
01:58:22,821 --> 01:58:33,044
[SPEAKER_19]: This is one avenue, one way to do it, and it's obviously what the mayor's choosing to do, and our engineer believes it's the best avenue, and I don't doubt that, but if we could just have a little more time on it.

1559
01:58:34,045 --> 01:58:35,065
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so is there a motion?

1560
01:58:38,166 --> 01:58:39,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to table for a week or two.

1561
01:58:40,567 --> 01:58:43,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to table by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1562
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:51,807
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Councilors Caraviello and Marks, those amendments will stay in abeyance, of course, until the paper comes off the table.

1563
01:58:52,828 --> 01:58:55,110
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1564
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1565
01:58:58,933 --> 01:58:59,614
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

1566
01:58:59,634 --> 01:58:59,654
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-790.

1567
01:59:07,221 --> 01:59:17,326
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Honorable President, to members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and City Council, as I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following transfer.

1568
01:59:17,346 --> 01:59:23,269
[SPEAKER_10]: 563,593 to be transferred from sewer retained earnings to account 610-440-5255, sewer repair slash maintenance slash infrastructure.

1569
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:24,590
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount of 563,593 is needed to cover

1570
01:59:36,277 --> 01:59:41,639
[SPEAKER_10]: projected revenue deficit in the sewer department, as the rate structure does not support the costs.

1571
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:48,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Finance director Alicia Newley is present to answer any council questions regarding this matter.

1572
01:59:49,482 --> 01:59:53,284
[SPEAKER_10]: The remaining balance of sewer retained earnings after this transfer would be $4,207,779.

1573
01:59:53,444 --> 01:59:55,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

1574
01:59:55,565 --> 01:59:55,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Auditor.

1575
01:59:55,985 --> 01:59:56,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1576
01:59:56,765 --> 01:59:57,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1577
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:15,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Honorable President and Councilors, the city has been fortunate that revenues of the sewer enterprise operation have exceeded expenses in most of the last few years.

1578
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:23,746
[SPEAKER_05]: This has allowed the city to increase reserves in the sewer enterprise fund, and reserves, when used properly, are a good fiscal tool for management.

1579
02:00:24,046 --> 02:00:27,829
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps smooth out our operations and insulate the user from rate shock.

1580
02:00:28,449 --> 02:00:32,533
[SPEAKER_05]: In fiscal 16, the city elected not to increase the rates in the enterprise fund,

1581
02:00:33,428 --> 02:00:39,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Subsequently, a separate irrigation meter program was implemented, which had adverse impact on the sewer revenue.

1582
02:00:39,834 --> 02:00:50,723
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, the MWRA assessment was larger than anticipated, and these situations have reflected on the 2017 tax rate recap, a shortfall of 563,593.

1583
02:00:52,245 --> 02:01:00,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are requesting this be funded from the reserves that we have built up for exactly these such events, and we hope that the council endorses such actions.

1584
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:04,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1585
02:01:08,634 --> 02:01:10,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilors, Chair awaits motion.

1586
02:01:12,796 --> 02:01:13,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1587
02:01:14,076 --> 02:01:16,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Just if you could, you mentioned something about an irrigation meter.

1588
02:01:17,697 --> 02:01:17,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1589
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:19,798
[SPEAKER_05]: When did you say that took place?

1590
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:25,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly when that took place to be exact.

1591
02:01:25,219 --> 02:01:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they recently did that.

1592
02:01:28,248 --> 02:01:29,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently did what?

1593
02:01:29,408 --> 02:01:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Put in those irrigation meters.

1594
02:01:31,829 --> 02:01:32,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Dominic was here earlier.

1595
02:01:33,309 --> 02:01:34,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about this?

1596
02:01:34,389 --> 02:01:36,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you referring to a second meter outside?

1597
02:01:36,329 --> 02:01:36,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1598
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:43,531
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're, when you're watering your yard, that was done years and years ago, right?

1599
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:45,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was done four or five years ago.

1600
02:01:45,771 --> 02:01:48,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, we approved it four or five years ago.

1601
02:01:48,111 --> 02:01:49,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's what I was told.

1602
02:01:49,432 --> 02:01:57,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless I was told incorrectly, but I was told that that was one of the reasons for the shortfall was because we didn't increase the rate, but we had implemented that.

1603
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:04,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, recently we went back, we created a tiered system and then we went back.

1604
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:07,212
[SPEAKER_10]: That was around the same time we did the double meter thing, right?

1605
02:02:07,312 --> 02:02:07,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1606
02:02:07,492 --> 02:02:11,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tiered system didn't go into effect until I believe it was last year or the year before.

1607
02:02:12,054 --> 02:02:13,354
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a state requirement too.

1608
02:02:14,015 --> 02:02:14,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1609
02:02:14,695 --> 02:02:21,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, as part of the tiered system, uh, we had a tier one being rates from zero to a thousand or whatever it was.

1610
02:02:22,678 --> 02:02:25,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we found that, uh, it was actually losing money.

1611
02:02:26,599 --> 02:02:28,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the tier, the first tier that we set up,

1612
02:02:28,684 --> 02:02:33,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So we refocused the tear back to be zero to 1,200, I think it was.

1613
02:02:33,646 --> 02:02:34,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the exact numbers.

1614
02:02:35,487 --> 02:02:44,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may be the experience of losing some of the money that you're referring to, because I don't know that meter program to be anything.

1615
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:46,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the meter wasn't the big impact.

1616
02:02:46,252 --> 02:02:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was the MWRA assessment.

1617
02:02:48,593 --> 02:02:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: That MWRA assessment for the sewer was a difference of 523,997.

1618
02:02:51,774 --> 02:02:52,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1619
02:03:00,997 --> 02:03:14,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also mentioned too, and I know it's not part of this paper, but, uh, that the city is going to be looking at, uh, their I and I influent infiltration and also the leak detection program.

1620
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:20,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess there is a fair amount of money that's being lost through a leak leaks in the community.

1621
02:03:21,581 --> 02:03:24,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with any of that at all through the chair?

1622
02:03:25,323 --> 02:03:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've sat in a couple of water and sewer Commission meetings and they have told me about that that they want to do that leak detection study To regain and see where we're losing money where there are any leaks that are being caught that could be caught and save us much revenue Right.

1623
02:03:44,608 --> 02:03:54,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So so just just so I understand Over the last several years we had a lot of surplus in the enterprise accounts and

1624
02:03:55,065 --> 02:03:57,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, it was due to a number of factors.

1625
02:03:58,067 --> 02:04:14,098
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was when we remated the city, uh, we were estimating probably half the city and then we came to brand new meters in each home and we would get an actual, um, results, uh, which increased our revenue, uh, and created large surpluses in the accounts.

1626
02:04:14,758 --> 02:04:20,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, now that from what I hear, uh, they're running in deficit and, uh, this will no longer be the case.

1627
02:04:21,523 --> 02:04:24,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point are we going to have to revisit?

1628
02:04:25,337 --> 02:04:28,659
[SPEAKER_01]: because now we're able to take a half a million out of the account, and that's great.

1629
02:04:29,259 --> 02:04:35,143
[SPEAKER_01]: But at what point are we gonna have to revisit it when the surplus account dwindles down to next to nothing?

1630
02:04:36,103 --> 02:04:48,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the Chair, Councilor, we do have Dave Fox and Mr. Woodcock is working with the Water and Sewer Commission and looking at the rate structures and looking at the revenues and doing an analysis for them on that.

1631
02:04:50,792 --> 02:04:52,473
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know right now,

1632
02:04:53,218 --> 02:04:54,759
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't have anything back from them.

1633
02:04:55,020 --> 02:05:00,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't really answer, um, the question that you're asking me until we meet with them.

1634
02:05:02,005 --> 02:05:02,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1635
02:05:02,206 --> 02:05:07,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the deficit is not in the operating expense of the water and sewer department here in the city.

1636
02:05:08,571 --> 02:05:11,473
[SPEAKER_05]: The deficit is in the sewer department.

1637
02:05:11,513 --> 02:05:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the revenue forecast that they put, cause they want to keep the rate stagnant.

1638
02:05:15,356 --> 02:05:19,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're keeping the rate stagnant and your costs are increasing, it's going to cause a deficit.

1639
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:28,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so at this point, where July, August, September, October, November, we're five months into the fiscal year.

1640
02:05:29,466 --> 02:05:32,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And this deficit is incurred over the last five months?

1641
02:05:32,628 --> 02:05:34,769
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is a projected deficit.

1642
02:05:34,949 --> 02:05:35,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Projected deficit.

1643
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for the year.

1644
02:05:37,151 --> 02:05:37,551
[SPEAKER_01]: For the year.

1645
02:05:37,631 --> 02:05:40,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so if I don't plug that in, we will have that.

1646
02:05:40,693 --> 02:05:43,175
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there yet in the first five months, but we will be there.

1647
02:05:43,255 --> 02:05:46,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if revenues pick up in the next several months in the water and sewer accounts?

1648
02:05:48,771 --> 02:05:56,613
[SPEAKER_05]: The chances of that are very, very slim, and I wouldn't want to chance that happening, especially when it's a part of the tax recap as well as I stated.

1649
02:05:57,133 --> 02:05:58,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to put that in there.

1650
02:05:58,713 --> 02:06:02,254
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something I can just arbitrarily take out and say, well, it may happen.

1651
02:06:02,354 --> 02:06:05,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to plug it in for the math for the DOR.

1652
02:06:07,275 --> 02:06:08,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So just say it does happen.

1653
02:06:09,256 --> 02:06:13,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say we're able to recover the deficit money through the rates.

1654
02:06:15,207 --> 02:06:17,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that money be able to go back into the enterprise account?

1655
02:06:17,929 --> 02:06:18,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that money go?

1656
02:06:18,649 --> 02:06:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it would.

1657
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:20,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It would fall back into retained earnings.

1658
02:06:20,851 --> 02:06:21,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It would go.

1659
02:06:21,371 --> 02:06:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the rate would go right back into the account.

1660
02:06:24,533 --> 02:06:24,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1661
02:06:26,074 --> 02:06:38,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I also heard, um, and I don't want to reveal my source right now, but, uh, the city of methods looking into a connectivity charge for water and sewer rate payers.

1662
02:06:38,981 --> 02:06:40,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's done in the city of Somerville.

1663
02:06:41,603 --> 02:06:41,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

1664
02:06:42,448 --> 02:06:47,276
[SPEAKER_01]: They charge a rate to be connected to water and sewer, which we've never experienced before.

1665
02:06:48,058 --> 02:06:54,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay our bills, and we pay a heavy, hefty bill, but never had to experience a connectivity charge.

1666
02:06:54,488 --> 02:06:56,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anything about that at all?

1667
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:00,281
[SPEAKER_05]: through the chair, um, the water and sewer commission.

1668
02:07:00,341 --> 02:07:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I attended their meeting.

1669
02:07:01,502 --> 02:07:17,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should come from the water and sewer commission chair, Dominic, but that is something that they have been discussing because one of the things that the consultant, uh, David Cox and excuse me, David Fox and Mr. Woodcock said is we have some fixed costs that we have and we have variable revenues.

1670
02:07:17,949 --> 02:07:20,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have some fixed revenues to go against those fixed costs.

1671
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:22,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1672
02:07:22,631 --> 02:07:26,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And my last point that I know you're relatively recent to the city,

1673
02:07:26,822 --> 02:07:38,964
[SPEAKER_01]: but the intended purpose for the account as Councilor Penta mentioned in the past has always been to offset rates and also for infrastructure improvements.

1674
02:07:39,824 --> 02:07:49,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be honest with you, over the years, I've seen very little done with INI, although the city in flow and infiltration, although the city claims they're doing a lot with it.

1675
02:07:50,246 --> 02:07:55,227
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of catch basins that are hooked up directly to the sewer system.

1676
02:07:55,952 --> 02:08:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, first of all, illegal, that was done many years ago, but it's costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars a year to treat groundwater as raw sewage.

1677
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:10,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And then leak detection.

1678
02:08:11,381 --> 02:08:14,783
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of leaks throughout the city and a lot of hot spots.

1679
02:08:15,404 --> 02:08:20,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish we could see more of that money put towards actually trying to save the rate payers some money.

1680
02:08:21,488 --> 02:08:25,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any influence, I'd appreciate you bringing that word back,

1681
02:08:25,908 --> 02:08:39,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned this a million times, uh, that, uh, we really should be trying to, uh, save the rate payer, uh, any, any time we can with their water and sewer and I and I and leak detection is a major way of doing that.

1682
02:08:40,514 --> 02:08:40,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1683
02:08:40,935 --> 02:08:41,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1684
02:08:41,415 --> 02:08:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1685
02:08:42,855 --> 02:08:43,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1686
02:08:45,016 --> 02:08:46,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair weights motion.

1687
02:08:47,916 --> 02:08:49,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Citizen, please welcome.

1688
02:08:49,857 --> 02:08:51,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1689
02:08:51,739 --> 02:08:54,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, my name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1690
02:08:54,741 --> 02:09:02,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little bit confused here right now because I never remember sitting on this council in the month of December and voting on something that's projected as a deficit.

1691
02:09:03,246 --> 02:09:12,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you look at the sewer retained earnings like in the water retained earnings, I believe your budget is 50-50 in this past budget that you had, you did have a proposed increase of one.

1692
02:09:13,013 --> 02:09:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, sir, for one moment.

1693
02:09:14,434 --> 02:09:16,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Folks, would you please quiet down back there?

1694
02:09:16,832 --> 02:09:18,913
[SPEAKER_10]: so that the speakers might not be disturbed.

1695
02:09:19,994 --> 02:09:20,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1696
02:09:20,374 --> 02:09:21,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I beg your indulgence.

1697
02:09:21,215 --> 02:09:27,099
[SPEAKER_12]: If you looked at your budget that you just passed this past year, I believe that there was somewhat of a minimal rate increase there from the water and sewer department.

1698
02:09:27,159 --> 02:09:28,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, from the MWRA.

1699
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:32,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, your sewer charge is at 121% of your water rate.

1700
02:09:33,363 --> 02:09:41,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're at 121% of your water rate that the customer is paying out back out, but your water side is balanced, but your sewer side isn't balanced.

1701
02:09:42,549 --> 02:09:45,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Is somebody telling you that your budget proposal that was presented was inaccurate?

1702
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:54,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever gone through this before, making a paid on a deficit, a projected deficit, and you're not even what?

1703
02:09:54,817 --> 02:09:57,459
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just no more than six months into your budget?

1704
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:03,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So that means your budget that was presented to you that you guys and ladies passed was in deficit.

1705
02:10:03,704 --> 02:10:04,745
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a deficit budget.

1706
02:10:05,005 --> 02:10:06,006
[SPEAKER_12]: It was incorrect.

1707
02:10:06,727 --> 02:10:08,849
[SPEAKER_12]: You were operating with deficits in departments.

1708
02:10:09,349 --> 02:10:10,150
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't make sense.

1709
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:12,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I really think you need to take a second look at this.

1710
02:10:13,081 --> 02:10:15,182
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know she's new to the city of Medford.

1711
02:10:15,222 --> 02:10:21,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if she's new to this whole idea of where we're going with this and if you want to put this in a projection because you want to set a tax rate.

1712
02:10:21,585 --> 02:10:27,448
[SPEAKER_12]: But how do you set a tax rate on a deficit when you've already been here and you haven't even been programmed or been told?

1713
02:10:28,108 --> 02:10:33,110
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one thing this council has asked for over and over again on a monthly updated status report.

1714
02:10:33,411 --> 02:10:37,913
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were traveling down this road and you knew there was going to be a deficit, you should have been told.

1715
02:10:38,993 --> 02:10:40,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Not two weeks before Christmas.

1716
02:10:41,114 --> 02:10:42,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And to give the taxpayers once again,

1717
02:10:43,237 --> 02:10:53,104
[SPEAKER_12]: another Christmas surprise of taking money out of their surplus account that should be used, should be used only for water and stormwater drain construction here in the city of Medford.

1718
02:10:54,405 --> 02:11:01,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how this city is operating lately, but all I can tell you is this, this is a radical change in what it used to be, and it's not going in the right direction.

1719
02:11:02,471 --> 02:11:03,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1720
02:11:04,192 --> 02:11:09,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this time, I'd like to invite the next speaker up to share his name and address for the record.

1721
02:11:10,056 --> 02:11:12,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

1722
02:11:13,268 --> 02:11:14,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor.

1723
02:11:14,989 --> 02:11:21,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm not privy to much of this information, so I, I really don't have any comment.

1724
02:11:22,954 --> 02:11:34,120
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if a supermarket overcharges me $2 for an item, my shopping cart, it'd be nice to get that $2 back with treble damages, mind you.

1725
02:11:36,322 --> 02:11:41,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if, if, if, if some entity is charging me, the homeowner,

1726
02:11:42,285 --> 02:11:48,029
[SPEAKER_00]: a water bill in excessive totality of $8 million.

1727
02:11:48,049 --> 02:11:52,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see that gave them back to the customer also.

1728
02:11:54,213 --> 02:12:08,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and furthermore, what I don't understand is this tier one, tier two and tier three, I believe is designated for tier one, one family, two family, three family,

1729
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:10,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on consumption, actually.

1730
02:12:11,243 --> 02:12:12,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an assumption?

1731
02:12:12,223 --> 02:12:12,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumption.

1732
02:12:13,324 --> 02:12:13,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1733
02:12:13,744 --> 02:12:19,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a general ballpark number they go by, if I recollect without having a water bill in front of me.

1734
02:12:20,730 --> 02:12:23,331
[SPEAKER_00]: However, then there's the un-tiered rate.

1735
02:12:25,773 --> 02:12:30,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And I presume un-tiered has nothing to do with one, two, or three family homes.

1736
02:12:32,058 --> 02:12:38,723
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most likely commercial, businesses, General Electric, Metal Grimm Mall.

1737
02:12:41,004 --> 02:12:42,045
[SPEAKER_00]: business establishments.

1738
02:12:43,406 --> 02:12:53,032
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that commercial rate, I'd like to call it, sir, is lower than a three family rate.

1739
02:12:54,653 --> 02:12:59,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the people are getting it and not so nice ways.

1740
02:12:59,176 --> 02:13:03,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I still, and I brought this up numerous times in the past.

1741
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:05,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.

1742
02:13:06,361 --> 02:13:07,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1743
02:13:07,241 --> 02:13:08,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair weights emotion.

1744
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1745
02:13:16,589 --> 02:13:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a couple of questions from Ms.

1746
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:19,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Nunley, Mr. President, please.

1747
02:13:19,931 --> 02:13:35,061
[SPEAKER_11]: So through the chair, um, as I understand this right now, you're requesting, uh, an appropriation from the city council of 563,000 and some odd dollars to address a revenue shortfall.

1748
02:13:35,081 --> 02:13:38,343
[SPEAKER_11]: And you also stated that the water and sewer rates have not been raised.

1749
02:13:38,383 --> 02:13:42,606
[SPEAKER_11]: The sewage rates have not been raised for, was it two fiscal years?

1750
02:13:42,626 --> 02:13:42,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1751
02:13:45,070 --> 02:13:56,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've also said that right now the MWRA assessment came back in at $523,000 higher than what was estimated by the city of Medford?

1752
02:13:58,021 --> 02:14:00,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what the city estimated.

1753
02:14:00,083 --> 02:14:01,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know it came in 523,997 above this year.

1754
02:14:09,138 --> 02:14:09,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1755
02:14:09,698 --> 02:14:24,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause Mr. President, the way I'm looking at this is if in fact the water and sewer department estimated that they were going to have to provide, um, they were going to have to generate a certain portion of revenue for, for the, um, payment of the sewer portion of our MWRA assessment.

1756
02:14:24,527 --> 02:14:29,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And they based that on a figure, um, that was $523,000 less than what actually came back from the MWRA.

1757
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:39,051
[SPEAKER_11]: The revenue shortage for the fiscal year is really $40,000 based upon their projections.

1758
02:14:39,771 --> 02:14:40,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense to you?

1759
02:14:41,291 --> 02:14:42,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I understanding this correctly?

1760
02:14:43,512 --> 02:14:44,232
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

1761
02:14:44,352 --> 02:14:46,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just telling you what the change is that I've seen.

1762
02:14:46,772 --> 02:15:02,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I did the tax rate recap through the chair, there's a couple of things that go into that in addition to the MWRA assessment is also indirect costs, which I did not bring into this that I will bring to the committee for the whole.

1763
02:15:03,015 --> 02:15:03,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1764
02:15:05,135 --> 02:15:05,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1765

[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1773
02:15:14,262 --> 02:15:16,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, just so I understand it correctly too.

1774
02:15:17,084 --> 02:15:18,325
[SPEAKER_19]: When did the assessment come in?

1775
02:15:18,766 --> 02:15:19,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Like when did we figure this out?

1776
02:15:19,947 --> 02:15:27,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously recently the assessment, I pulled a purchase order report and looked at the encumbrance.

1777
02:15:27,553 --> 02:15:30,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know exactly when the assessment came in.

1778
02:15:30,335 --> 02:15:33,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I just based it off of the purchase order and the purchase order was created in

1779
02:15:35,532 --> 02:15:40,373
[SPEAKER_05]: July in 2016.

1780
02:15:41,074 --> 02:15:43,434
[SPEAKER_19]: So the assessment came in after we voted for the budget.

1781
02:15:46,135 --> 02:15:47,936
[SPEAKER_05]: July 2016 is when they did it.

[SPEAKER_10]: on Winthrop Street, the Winthrop Street end of West Street.

1866
02:20:45,053 --> 02:20:45,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor?

1867
02:20:46,049 --> 02:20:51,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, at the old location of Marty's Cater is at the corner of West Street and Winthrop Street.

1868
02:20:51,272 --> 02:20:57,055
[SPEAKER_11]: We're beginning to have a little bit of a problem with the wholesaler that is now in that facility.

1869
02:20:57,676 --> 02:21:05,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And ultimately they're running an operation, Mr. President, that goes seven days a week from at least seven in the morning until at least 11 at night.

1870
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:09,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what their permanent hours are, but it's more like two, three, four o'clock in the morning.

1871
02:21:10,243 --> 02:21:11,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's happening, Mr. President, is that,

1872
02:21:12,752 --> 02:21:22,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Their delivery vehicles, which are commercial in nature, are parking on the end of West Street in a 30-minute parking area for people that are patronizing Moulton's Restaurant or the old Pranzi's location.

1873
02:21:23,181 --> 02:21:30,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So that parking that was really for patrons of the restaurants after hours is now turning into commercial vehicle parking, where the trucks park there.

1874
02:21:30,146 --> 02:21:35,451
[SPEAKER_11]: They idle for long periods of time while they wait for the product to be prepared, prepped, loaded up, and put onto the truck.

1875
02:21:35,871 --> 02:21:37,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really causing an issue in the neighborhood.

1876
02:21:37,593 --> 02:21:39,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a quality of life concern, Mr. President.

1877
02:21:39,314 --> 02:21:41,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're asking the Traffic Commission to take a look at this

1878
02:21:42,026 --> 02:21:43,407
[SPEAKER_11]: address it in a serious fashion.

1879
02:21:43,547 --> 02:21:47,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm being commercial parking on the corner of West street and Winthrop street for the time being.

1880
02:21:49,149 --> 02:21:50,389
[SPEAKER_07]: After 11 PM.

1881
02:21:51,009 --> 02:21:54,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, I, I don't know why we have to limit it just to West street.

1882
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:59,313
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a, uh, there's a, there's a commercial parking being after certain hours of the whole city.

1883
02:21:59,813 --> 02:22:07,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should expand it to, you know, I, and I, I respect council and nights, um, for that, for those people over there.

1884
02:22:07,356 --> 02:22:09,517
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, it doesn't just go on over there.

1885
02:22:09,537 --> 02:22:10,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes on in many other,

1886
02:22:11,122 --> 02:22:11,862
[SPEAKER_07]: sections of the city.

1887
02:22:11,882 --> 02:22:14,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, then, uh, point of information is the present point.

1888
02:22:14,943 --> 02:22:19,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, this is a cause and effect, uh, resolution that I put forward.

1889
02:22:19,344 --> 02:22:23,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, got the phone calls caused me to put it forward because of the effect.

1890
02:22:23,784 --> 02:22:34,846
[SPEAKER_07]: As we look at that, if we could also look at other areas, uh, where the commercial parking, uh, ban should be in effect as amended off by councilor night for approval, seconded by councilor Caraviello.

1891
02:22:34,886 --> 02:22:35,607
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

02:23:29,167 --> 02:23:31,048
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Madam Vice President.

1908
02:23:32,028 --> 02:23:32,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't he our?

1909
02:23:33,028 --> 02:23:34,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no, he's not our Massport rep anymore.

1910
02:23:37,029 --> 02:23:37,929
[SPEAKER_19]: He was our Massport rep.

1911
02:23:38,547 --> 02:23:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, if I may, Mr. President, please, um, three to the, uh, the consular, um, Mr. Glenn has served an interim basis as the mass mass port rep.

1912
02:23:46,129 --> 02:23:47,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, well may have Burke was conducting her search.

1913
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:50,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he was the mass port CAC representative.

1914
02:23:50,711 --> 02:23:52,131
[SPEAKER_11]: They meet on a quarterly basis.

1915
02:23:52,672 --> 02:23:55,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he served in the position for a period of time that would have covered two meetings.

1916
02:23:56,453 --> 02:23:57,373
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the meetings was held.

1917
02:23:57,513 --> 02:23:59,474
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the meetings was canceled because of lack of quorum.

1918
02:24:01,354 --> 02:24:03,415
[SPEAKER_11]: He was at the meeting that was canceled because of lack of quorum.

1919
02:24:04,115 --> 02:24:06,276
[SPEAKER_19]: And through the chair to the city clerk, do,

1920
02:24:07,037 --> 02:24:12,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a responsibility to put this in the paper, advertise, and accept resumes?

1921
02:24:13,618 --> 02:24:14,779
[SPEAKER_19]: It's good we're discussing it.

1922
02:24:17,719 --> 02:24:31,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, first of all, your appointment will be to fulfill Cosmophobe's term, which is expired.

1923
02:24:35,139 --> 02:24:36,539
[SPEAKER_08]: 2018, maybe, something like that.

1924
02:24:36,859 --> 02:24:39,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think he still has a couple more years to go, I think.

1925
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:42,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a four-year appointment, I'm pretty sure.

1926
02:24:42,881 --> 02:24:43,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, three, yeah?

1927
02:24:43,981 --> 02:24:47,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might be next year or the year after.

1928
02:24:47,022 --> 02:24:48,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to complete his term.

1929
02:24:51,463 --> 02:25:00,585
[SPEAKER_08]: That's up to the will of the council, because I think the last time they did, when it first came about, they did take, they did interview a number of candidates.

1930
02:25:00,705 --> 02:25:03,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I think each council submitted their own

1931
02:25:05,763 --> 02:25:11,467
[SPEAKER_08]: and they brought them all in individually and, you know, and at the end.

1932
02:25:12,847 --> 02:25:18,231
[SPEAKER_19]: I just remember we made it public and then a number of people called and sent resumes in and then we discussed it as a whole.

1933
02:25:18,711 --> 02:25:25,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know if we made it, I don't know about the public part, but I just know that the, each of the councils did submit,

1934
02:25:26,488 --> 02:25:29,770
[SPEAKER_08]: back then, a person in an organization or something like that.

1935
02:25:30,051 --> 02:25:37,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't recall a public announcement, but I do recall Cosimo Fulpi's retirement from the board being very publicly notorious here.

1936
02:25:37,276 --> 02:25:38,637
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been quite a while, I think.

1937
02:25:38,817 --> 02:25:48,084
[SPEAKER_19]: If maybe we could ask them, however the mayor's office announces her vacancies, if maybe she would, her office through you could do it for us, and then we could consider.

1938
02:25:48,104 --> 02:25:51,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I think just on the website, when you look at boards and commissions, it just outlines vacancy.

1939
02:25:56,958 --> 02:25:57,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1940
02:25:57,338 --> 02:25:58,920
[SPEAKER_10]: We have motion for approval on the floor.

1941
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Counsel Max.

1942
02:26:00,901 --> 02:26:01,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1943
02:26:01,822 --> 02:26:15,853
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, from what I recall, how the council would, would handle this is that, uh, we'd set up a committee, the whole meeting and would ask each member of the council, if anyone approached them on the position or if they have anyone in mind, uh, to bring it to the committee, the whole meeting.

1944
02:26:16,334 --> 02:26:17,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we've done them in the past.

1945
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:43,901
[SPEAKER_11]: so i would respectfully ask that one of our nation is to present the same for us to make sure it's also night uh... i served on the council when mister will be was appointed uh... reappointed there was no process in asking at that point in time for anybody if they had any candidates if they had any but it was interested if they wanted to put forward any applications uh... secondly is a big difference between reappointment uh... and sexually i believe that the council also had made

1946
02:26:45,357 --> 02:26:53,605
[SPEAKER_11]: appointments previously during my tenure on the council without following that protocol for other matters that are under the council's purview, Mr. President.

1947
02:26:54,326 --> 02:26:56,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So for those reasons, the position has been vacant for some period of time.

1948
02:26:56,909 --> 02:27:00,472
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been something that sounds like it's been not on anybody's agenda or anybody's mind.

1949
02:27:00,512 --> 02:27:04,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a candidate in there that's going to be willing, capable, and able to serve the position.

1950
02:27:04,817 --> 02:27:05,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I'd move for approval.

1951
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:07,511
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval.

1952
02:27:07,531 --> 02:27:08,792
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a long point of information.

1953
02:27:08,812 --> 02:27:09,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1954
02:27:09,372 --> 02:27:10,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a long point of information.

1955
02:27:10,573 --> 02:27:11,713
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a point of information.

1956
02:27:11,733 --> 02:27:12,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

1957
02:27:12,714 --> 02:27:14,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost track of it myself.

1958
02:27:15,116 --> 02:27:15,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did.

1959
02:27:15,716 --> 02:27:16,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did.

1960
02:27:16,817 --> 02:27:19,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, you have the floor.

1961
02:27:19,258 --> 02:27:34,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I have nothing against the gentleman's name that was submitted to us, but I would say as the senior member of this council, and I'll correct my Councilor Knight that that has been the past practice of this council to get together as a council and we discuss names.

1962
02:27:34,943 --> 02:27:37,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may come up with the name that the gentleman offered.

1963
02:27:37,404 --> 02:27:39,905
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always been a process in place, Mr. President.

1964
02:27:40,505 --> 02:27:44,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this was open and notorious, it should have appeared on the agenda.

1965
02:27:44,486 --> 02:27:53,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, it would have been out to the general public that this name was being offered, not under suspension, Mr. President, at 830 at night or 9 o'clock at night.

1966
02:27:53,729 --> 02:27:57,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Under suspension, you're offering your name on a very important board, Mr. President, in this city.

1967
02:27:58,311 --> 02:28:00,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a board that pays, by the way, Mr. President.

1968
02:28:01,032 --> 02:28:04,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it deserves to be vetted out, Mr. President,

1969
02:28:04,593 --> 02:28:17,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think every member of this council deserves to take a look and see if they might have someone that may be interested or if someone reached out to them, uh, that may be interested in the position as no reflection on the gentleman that was offered.

1970
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:19,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, this is not a personal issue.

1971
02:28:20,121 --> 02:28:23,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of protocol and procedure of this council, Mr. President.

1972
02:28:23,743 --> 02:28:30,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would respectfully ask that we set up a committee of the whole Mr. President, uh, to discuss, uh, the matter of the appointment of the Hormel commission.

1973
02:28:32,527 --> 02:28:32,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1974
02:28:32,868 --> 02:28:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Counsel Max.

1975
02:28:34,222 --> 02:28:34,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

1976
02:28:35,382 --> 02:28:37,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President de la Rizzo.

1977
02:28:37,563 --> 02:28:42,525
[SPEAKER_19]: I also think it's important to advertise it somewhat, whether that be on our website or in the paper.

1978
02:28:42,545 --> 02:28:56,250
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure how the mayor does it when there is a vacancy that she appoints, but I think we need to ask her to do the same because we need to give everybody in the community an opportunity to come forward and request to be appointed to that committee.

1979
02:28:56,530 --> 02:28:57,550
[SPEAKER_19]: It is an important committee.

1980
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:03,212
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one that controls Hormel Stadium, and I think it's definitely something that needs to be vetted out.

1981
02:29:03,953 --> 02:29:05,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1982
02:29:05,334 --> 02:29:06,895
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

1983
02:29:08,757 --> 02:29:09,658
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1984
02:29:10,458 --> 02:29:10,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1985
02:29:11,659 --> 02:29:12,400
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1986
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:13,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call, Mr. President.

1987
02:29:13,701 --> 02:29:14,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

1988
02:29:14,942 --> 02:29:16,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

1989
02:29:16,063 --> 02:29:17,804
[SPEAKER_19]: I move to table the matter.

1990
02:29:18,845 --> 02:29:22,267
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to table, Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

1991
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:26,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Cariolo?

1992
02:29:26,371 --> 02:29:26,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1993
02:29:28,753 --> 02:29:28,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1994
02:29:30,214 --> 02:29:30,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Franco?

1995
02:29:30,814 --> 02:29:30,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1996
02:29:32,015 --> 02:29:32,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lange?

1997
02:29:32,756 --> 02:29:32,916
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1998
02:29:34,456 --> 02:29:34,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1999
02:29:35,877 --> 02:29:37,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2000
02:29:37,498 --> 02:29:37,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2001
02:29:39,179 --> 02:29:40,520
[SPEAKER_10]: No motive.

2002
02:29:42,842 --> 02:29:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative motion to table passes.

2003
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:52,930
[SPEAKER_10]: We will.

2004
02:29:53,671 --> 02:29:54,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2005
02:29:55,052 --> 02:29:58,855
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw finally papers on the hand of the clerk.

2006
02:30:00,136 --> 02:30:00,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, uh,

2007
02:30:02,907 --> 02:30:06,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by President Dello Russo on today, St.

2008
02:30:06,149 --> 02:30:15,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicholas Day, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Bernardino Bernie Stabile on his recent passing.

2009
02:30:16,574 --> 02:30:24,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that an appropriate memorial and dedication be erected by the mayor in recognition of his service to our nation.

2010
02:30:25,199 --> 02:30:30,882
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, from the chair, Bernie Stabile is a decorated veteran

2011
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:32,661
[SPEAKER_10]: in our community.

2012
02:30:32,821 --> 02:30:38,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Member of the United States Marine Corps for over 20 years, Bernie entered the Marines during World War II.

2013
02:30:38,944 --> 02:30:47,249
[SPEAKER_10]: He fought his way through the Pacific, earning the Bronze Star Medal and Presidential Unit Citation.

2014
02:30:48,289 --> 02:30:54,373
[SPEAKER_10]: While Bernie was fighting his way through the Pacific, island to island, his brother died on the beaches of Anzio.

2015
02:30:56,114 --> 02:30:57,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernie stayed in the Marine Corps.

2016
02:30:59,195 --> 02:31:01,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernie served our nation in the Korean War.

2017
02:31:02,417 --> 02:31:07,779
[SPEAKER_10]: He served our nation in the Vietnam War, a war that was tough for everyone to fight in.

2018
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:10,680
[SPEAKER_10]: No thanks here at home.

2019
02:31:12,141 --> 02:31:19,284
[SPEAKER_10]: When Bernie got out of the military in 1974, he didn't just give up.

2020
02:31:19,345 --> 02:31:20,945
[SPEAKER_10]: He continued to serve our nation.

2021
02:31:22,186 --> 02:31:25,047
[SPEAKER_10]: He was appointed to the United States Secret Service.

2022
02:31:26,128 --> 02:31:28,489
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a leader here in the Boston office.

2023
02:31:31,883 --> 02:31:35,184
[SPEAKER_10]: a legend in the Secret Service nationally.

2024
02:31:37,025 --> 02:31:41,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Generations of men and women who came up in the Secret Service learned from him.

2025
02:31:42,647 --> 02:31:54,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And there wasn't one president of the United States from his time in the Secret Service to the time of his retirement, some several years ago, that he wasn't part of their motorcade or their personal protection.

2026
02:31:55,952 --> 02:31:57,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernie is a great American.

2027
02:31:57,633 --> 02:32:08,857
[SPEAKER_10]: and a great citizen of Medford, a humble man, dedicated family man, and I think this community and our nation owes him a debt of gratitude.

2028
02:32:09,557 --> 02:32:15,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, please join us in a moment of silence.

2029
02:32:33,875 --> 02:32:34,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

2030
02:32:38,496 --> 02:32:40,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, Mr. President.

2031
02:32:41,296 --> 02:32:45,217
[SPEAKER_01]: This past Saturday, there was a horrific fire in Cambridge.

2032
02:32:46,097 --> 02:32:47,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 10-alarm fire.

2033
02:32:48,018 --> 02:32:51,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty communities, including the city of Medford, were called into action.

2034
02:32:52,439 --> 02:32:57,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fire consumed eight buildings and a number of cars in Cambridge.

2035
02:32:57,519 --> 02:33:00,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And, thank God, there was no fatalities.

2036
02:33:00,827 --> 02:33:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I would like to thank Engine 5 and Ladder 1 from the city of Medford, who went and did an exemplary job in showing what this community is all about when it comes to mutual aid and to assisting in a time of need, Mr. President.

2037
02:33:15,237 --> 02:33:26,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we could send accommodation to all the firefighters at Engine 5 and Ladder 1, Mr. President, thanking them for their assistance in that horrific fire in Cambridge.

2038
02:33:27,586 --> 02:33:27,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2039
02:33:27,946 --> 02:33:29,047
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight,

2040
02:33:29,768 --> 02:33:32,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2041
02:33:32,609 --> 02:33:33,309
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

2042
02:33:33,329 --> 02:33:33,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

2043
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:34,930
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

2044
02:33:35,410 --> 02:33:36,031
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

2045
02:33:36,511 --> 02:33:37,331
