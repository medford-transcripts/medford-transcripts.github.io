1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording in progress.

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,224
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's start the meeting.

3
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:07,986
[SPEAKER_05]: First is review of the minutes from May 20th, 2025.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That was emailed to everybody.

5
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the hearing at 338 High Street.

6
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Update from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

7
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Regional Public Health Grant Initiative.

8
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:26,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We also approve the Public Health Excellence LMA and designate

9
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,785
[SPEAKER_05]: and we went over the monthly reportable disease report slash update.

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve the minutes, say aye.

11
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:38,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

12
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:39,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny?

13
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second, Dr. Kladowicz?

14
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:41,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

15
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all in favor, Jenny Vitale?

16
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:46,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

17
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Kladowicz?

18
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, see, yes.

19
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, motion passes, minutes are approved, thank you.

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number one for today, go ahead, Mary Ann.

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:05,210
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so with us today is Danielle Evans, our senior planner for the city and her intern Christian.

22
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:22,441
[SPEAKER_08]: The city is undertaking a large rezoning initiative and the Community Development Board is actually looking for any input that folks may have, certainly from the community and from department heads, but also from all our boards and commissions as well.

23
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:36,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So I asked Danielle to join us today to kind of go over really what the three buckets are that they're looking at and what the impact could be and what kind of feedback they're looking to get from folks.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So Danielle, do you need me to?

25
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:47,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have like a presentation or anything.

26
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,237
[SPEAKER_03]: If folks want to

27
00:01:52,463 --> 00:02:11,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a zoning web page that we're trying to keep updated that has a lot of the presentations that the consultants created, as well as links to some of the draft maps and actual amendment language that's currently before the Community Development Board.

28
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:16,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, just to back up a little bit, this has been

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,942
[SPEAKER_03]: going on for, I think, the last year, rezoning the city in phases.

30
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's already been rezoned is the Mystic Avenue corridor has been rezoned.

31
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,767
[SPEAKER_03]: The Salem Street corridor has been rezoned.

32
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also added a green score, which is a metric that would apply citywide that regulates

33
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:52,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Like pervious, impervious surface, landscaping, trees, that sort of thing.

34
00:02:53,536 --> 00:03:03,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the first things I was surprised about was that there's actually no minimum pervious area requirements, even in the residential neighborhood.

35
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:07,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could pave an entire lot, and that's completely legal.

36
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, well, used to be, not anymore.

37
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:28,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure of everything that's under the purview of the Board of Health, if things like standing water, storm water, things like that, invasives that could be controlled by Green Score, things like that.

38
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:39,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the bigger things that's happening is kind of upzoning in different areas of the city, or that's what's proposed.

39
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:52,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have seen, you know, there's a lot of, you know, discussion on both sides about, you know, whether the city should change or not.

40
00:03:52,698 --> 00:04:02,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The current zoning is pretty broken, so we do need to update it and change it because there's a lot of nonconforming structures.

41
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the city was built out, and then they wrote zoning that made everything nonconforming, which doesn't make sense.

42
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to do anything to your house, you're going to have to go to the zoning board

43
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,280
[SPEAKER_03]: because you don't comply with the setback requirements or something.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:31,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to bring things into conformance, but then also kind of make updates due to changes to the city, like the green line extension.

45
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably doesn't make sense to have

46
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:45,763
[SPEAKER_03]: such low density allowed by a Green Line station that could be an opportunity to have some more denser housing there.

47
00:04:46,984 --> 00:05:01,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But the zoning is implementing the comprehensive plan that was adopted by the Community Development Board and was a long citywide process

48
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:13,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So the zoning is part of that implementation, but it's a very iterative process.

49
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:19,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's three, Chris, you're correct me if I'm wrong, there's three open public hearings before the Community Development Board.

50
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:27,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the Medford Square and West Medford Square, which is one bundled amendment.

51
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the residential zoning, which is,

52
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:53,259
[SPEAKER_03]: basically replacing the single-family one and two, the apartment zone, and the general residential zone, and replacing it with a new framework of neighborhood residential one, two, three, and then urban residential one and two, which have different

53
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:05,126
[SPEAKER_03]: lot size requirements, unit count, allowances, heights, setbacks, maximum ground coverage, things like that.

54
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the third one?

55
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we do not actually have a third open to public hearing.

56
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,311
[SPEAKER_03]: We're expecting one to be referred.

57
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:12,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the ADUs, yes.

58
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the accessory dwelling units.

59
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an existing ordinance

60
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:27,300
[SPEAKER_03]: regulating ADUs, but it's not compliant with the new state law through the Affordable Homes Act.

61
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:38,705
[SPEAKER_03]: They now, it's required that any single family district or any district that allows single families, so

62
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:50,251
[SPEAKER_03]: is allowed to have one ADU by right detached or as part of the structure, like within it or attached.

63
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:56,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to update our ordinance to align with that because our current ordinance is unenforceable.

64
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:02,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's very few things that we can regulate with that.

65
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question, Daniel, and a couple of comments.

66
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: One, in your opinion, is the outcome of these zoning regulations upgrade is to increase the population in the city?

67
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's to increase the population, but one of the, I think one of the goals is to

68
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:34,443
[SPEAKER_03]: increase housing production in certain areas where it would make sense.

69
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

70
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not looking for the goal.

71
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking for the result.

72
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:43,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the result from what I'm hearing is going to result in increased number of people that live in Bedford.

73
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's also to give housing choices.

74
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not.

75
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the initial question.

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to result in an increase in the population?

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

78
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what right now I have.

79
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:00,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in a single family neighborhood.

80
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:11,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And until recently, both large single family homes were occupied by one person because they didn't have a smaller unit that they could move to that would be available.

81
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:19,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have, you know, individuals that are living in large homes that a family could live in.

82
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have homes that are

83
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,219
[SPEAKER_03]: in roommate situations where those folks would rather have their own unit.

84
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have like four grad students that have to, you know, occupy, you know, a rental unit near Tufts, but they'd rather live in studios.

85
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be like, you could have four more units there with those folks living by themselves in their units.

86
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:48,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not, it's a little bit more complicated than,

87
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:54,795
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, more housing units means more population because household sizes are also decreasing.

88
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:01,978
[SPEAKER_03]: The population of Medford has decreased a lot over the years just because people aren't having such large families anymore.

89
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:10,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be you'd have like three or four kids at least, and now, you know, maybe two, lots of only children, no children.

90
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So the demographics are also switching.

91
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not quite the correlation.

92
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:22,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, mindful of the transitory college population, which doesn't count.

93
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:29,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think the end result of building more housing units would be an increase in the population.

94
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:38,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Mindful of that, is anyone keeping into account the needs for infrastructure that's gonna go along with this, i.e.

95
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:43,970
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic, parking, even the school system, and also taxes.

96
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:55,006
[SPEAKER_05]: If more units are going up on the same part of land and more people per that part of land, then increase need for city services.

97
00:09:55,647 --> 00:10:02,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the tax base gonna go up if people start adding structures to a certain piece of land?

98
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:06,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Compensate the city for the additional services.

99
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:11,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with Prop 2.5, the existing taxes for the existing assessed

100
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:26,349
[SPEAKER_03]: properties can only, is very limited in what it can go up, but new growth can be added to the top of that.

101
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:34,991
[SPEAKER_03]: The new growth is where you can increase your tax base, especially, we also were trying to focus on commercial tax base.

102
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:45,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So the upzoning of Mystic Avenue would allow a lot more new growth, hopefully.

103
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:48,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now it was only,

104
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:57,441
[SPEAKER_03]: like maximum two stories, one stories in some of these outdated industrial zone kind of areas.

105
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:07,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So hoping to capture the new growth there to take the pressure off of, you know, just the residents that shoulder, because I live in Medford too.

106
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a homeowner here.

107
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I have kids in the school too.

108
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:10,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So I,

109
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: can appreciate all those aspects.

110
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would just be mindful of the stresses to the infrastructure.

111
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:23,165
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of folks planning, you got to take that all into consideration as you move forward.

112
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:33,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so our DPW director was at the, was it this, which meeting was he at?

113
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:38,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed it because I was stuck with a delayed flight.

114
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So I missed that meeting.

115
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Community development board meeting on July 9th.

116
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:54,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And he spoke to the zoning impact on infrastructure in terms of water and sewer.

117
00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:04,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, as of right now, you can't say for sure that it will or will not impact.

118
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:05,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously, it will.

119
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:12,334
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't say for sure that it will have devastating impacts without because zoning is not

120
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:14,362
[SPEAKER_04]: a definite.

121
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:19,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It can happen from anywhere from when it's enacted or 30 years, 50 years from now.

122
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:28,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessarily going to be immediately impacting all these infrastructure things.

123
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, one thing is we do have large developments are subject to linkage fees.

124
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:40,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's a larger development, they have to pay into

125
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: various linkage accounts for those roads, police, fire, water, sewer, I believe, and then parks.

126
00:12:52,666 --> 00:13:04,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, those fees haven't been updated since the 90s, so we're actually trying to update the linkage study so that we can get approval from the state to actually increase those fees.

127
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It just turns out those studies are very expensive.

128
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:10,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

129
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:21,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And another thing you had mentioned about the green score, we absolutely are going to weigh in on anything that we see that's a threat to the health of the community, no matter what it is.

130
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:26,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that it's not in there doesn't stop us from weighing in.

131
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:34,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just try to incorporate a consideration of health issues into any of this planning, i.e.

132
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,096
[SPEAKER_05]: standing water.

133
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,896
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to let anyone just asphalt the whole thing.

134
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,757
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll step in and we'll stop that on the health grounds.

135
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,745
[SPEAKER_05]: they should know that right at the get-go.

136
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:49,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So although it's not officially on our plate, it is on our plate.

137
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:54,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be really good to know, Marion.

138
00:13:54,652 --> 00:14:01,016
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some regulations that kind of overlap with zoning that we might not be aware of?

139
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And who are enforcing those?

140
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have mosquito stuff.

141
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:10,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the rodent problem, all that stuff.

142
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it'll be relevant here.

143
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:17,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And even going forward with that, you know, talking about like heat islands and, you know.

144
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:20,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So these sites aren't off limits to us.

145
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: If we see something outrageous, we're not going to let it go.

146
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:31,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, the 101 building here, right at Emerson Street, the corner, these trees would set back, but no one's pruning the trees.

147
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:39,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So now there's a tree that's trying to take over the entire sidewalk and also the crossing.

148
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:52,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally obstructing the view of the Emerson Street sign, the streetwalk sign, and you can't even enter the crossing walk because the big branch of the tree's going to take your head off.

149
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kind of stuff.

150
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a street tree or a private tree?

151
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is a private tree that is taken over Main Street.

152
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:01,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one's keeping it.

153
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,243
[SPEAKER_05]: This is right across from the police station and the fire station.

154
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't even use the crosswalk.

155
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right in the middle of that.

156
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,827
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's obstructing all the city signs.

157
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:15,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the kind of stuff that we gotta watch for so we can take care of that.

158
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:21,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone on a bike's gonna go down that sidewalk and get decapitated someday.

159
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how low the tree is.

160
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:30,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that whole section is gonna be part of the DOT upgrades of that intersection.

161
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's captured in part of that.

162
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:35,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's gonna be a whole reconfiguration of that

163
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:36,937
[SPEAKER_03]: cluster.

164
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:42,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is to keep an eye on some of the private stuff impinging on the city stuff.

165
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:46,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's probably like, you know, it looks good.

166
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tree, but no one's pruning it.

167
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:52,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's taking over the the crosswalk and the light obstructing street signs.

168
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,032
[SPEAKER_05]: People try to take a right on that corner.

169
00:15:55,072 --> 00:16:00,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't see the oncoming traffic coming out of 50 miles an hour sometimes on Main Street.

170
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:01,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

171
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:14,152
[SPEAKER_08]: The other question I had, Danielle, about the affordable housing units, is that so part of the Greenland extension and all of that, is that that's all part of the zoning issues as well as trying to increase affordable housing?

172
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:29,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they get used, but I mean, is there- There's a couple of the sub-state mandates, mandated changes that kind of relate to how we're also responding.

173
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:54,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was the MBTA zoning, which basically any city or town that is served by the MBTA had to create a multifamily district and it had a numerical target and you had to prove that you were rezoning in a manner that would or could produce that many units.

174
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got that passed two years ago because we were in the first

175
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: around of that as a rapid transit community.

176
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:04,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's over in Wellington, and that's an overlay.

177
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:12,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has nothing to do with our inclusionary housing.

178
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:24,602
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually, the state had set a cap that is 10% of the units could be affordable at maximum 80% AMI, which is actually not

179
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:31,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ordinance is actually stronger than that.

180
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:48,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to do a feasibility analysis to prove that our existing inclusionary zoning, which has higher than 10%, wouldn't hurt housing production.

181
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:57,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So they reviewed that and found that we could keep our existing inclusionary zoning to apply to that district.

182
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:02,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So our inclusionary zoning is citywide, including that district, because we got permission.

183
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:16,792
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some updates to the inclusionary housing, but it needs to be studied because it does have impacts.

184
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:23,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And also this would be in conjunction with the linkage study because there was,

185
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,173
[SPEAKER_03]: the affordable housing trust would like to see a linkage payment go to the trust.

186
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:46,781
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do that, you need to make sure that the number of units that you're requiring and any payment that it doesn't basically grind things to a halt.

187
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if a project doesn't pencil out, they're not going to build it.

188
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So you end up with nothing.

189
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be careful about that.

190
00:18:55,413 --> 00:19:08,597
[SPEAKER_03]: how much we require, there's a, you know, it changes with the market and, you know, the interest rate climate and things like that.

191
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Balancing ethics.

192
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:12,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

193
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions or thoughts?

194
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:28,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody that's in the meeting is free to ask.

195
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:36,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to provide the links to the zoning page, which is being updated.

196
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,087
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also a viewer.

197
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can drop that link in.

198
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

199
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:45,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the Zoom.

200
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

201
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:51,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can get that in the minutes to the link area.

202
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also linked from the city website.

203
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:20,690
[SPEAKER_03]: This might open to a random property because I'm trying to figure out what the... But basically you can click on that link and you can kind of play around with the various layers to see current zoning and what some proposed changes are.

204
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:26,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe you can email it to Mariana, then she can forward it to us.

205
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

206
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

207
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,150
[SPEAKER_05]: The link.

208
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of a long link.

209
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

210
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:31,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

211
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:32,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's.

212
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You can cut and paste it in.

213
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might've created a tiny URL.

214
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I can email it out.

215
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:42,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

216
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:42,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

217
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:43,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Just email it.

218
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be easier.

219
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested in looking at it for sure.

220
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:59,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I guess other things that might be like before you are like, Dr. Platzowitz, I'm so sorry.

221
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had brought up population increases.

222
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:13,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So like from your perspective, is there other things that we should be concerned about like population?

223
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Just mindful of the infrastructure.

224
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I know with some of the immigration,

225
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:31,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the cities had difficulty because when the population comes up, maybe unexpectedly at times, there's other needs of that population need from the city that need to be taken into account.

226
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:40,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the city's not prepared for it, it can maybe turn into what we don't want, you know.

227
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:47,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But like rodents, like rats and stuff like that, I know- Oh yeah, just the need for more teachers.

228
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:56,375
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have more kids moving into these extra units, that's gonna put stresses on the school system.

229
00:21:56,455 --> 00:22:04,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So just mindful of when the people populate these looser zoning restrictions.

230
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that outcome's gonna be increased population.

231
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:14,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong, but that's what I would expect if you have more dwelling units.

232
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:36,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And- Yeah, I think it's not like a- Oh yeah, yeah, we'll come on it sequentially, but just to be mindful of that, because you got all the trash and water and sewer and schools, police, fire, people requiring services on all of them are gonna go up then, and they need to be ready to deliver.

233
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the other things is,

234
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:54,522
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is the mismatch between the household sizes and the household units, the unit sizes that we have now, like I was saying, we have, you know, a lot of seniors that are overhoused and would like, yeah.

235
00:22:54,542 --> 00:23:07,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they, you know, can't move because they want to stay in their community, but also it could be very limited because, um, you know, if they want to age in place, you know, they want to live on like one floor, have,

236
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: accessible units or an elevator served building someplace, but they don't need to be car dependent so they could walk around.

237
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:34,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping that some of this upzoning and some of the corridors near amenities would increase

238
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:43,040
[SPEAKER_03]: production of elevator served buildings that, I think those kick in at like four stories, I believe.

239
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:50,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it's not economical for a developer to have an elevator.

240
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:59,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd end up not having that type of housing stock for disabled folks or anyone with mobility challenges.

241
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:03,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So didn't have that density

242
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:18,153
[SPEAKER_03]: in some of these quarters where there's the services, so you could walk to a coffee shop or, you know, to a corner store, so they're closer and not as isolated from things.

243
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:24,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, is that anything like that something that your group focuses on?

244
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:33,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, certainly, yeah, isolation and seniors and mental health is just absolutely something we're looking at.

245
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be, yeah, that's great.

246
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:44,188
[SPEAKER_08]: If those are the types of things that are in the thought process when you're considering the zoning changes, that's great.

247
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,632
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously, yeah, more density, more trash.

248
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:54,135
[SPEAKER_08]: something that we battle with every day, the road initiative as well.

249
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:54,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

250
00:24:55,196 --> 00:25:06,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of that is with site plan review and having strict standards of how things can be handled, like how trash is handled.

251
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look into what the extent of zoning regulations can help alleviate your bad situations.

252
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: with trash and things like that.

253
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:29,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody doesn't touch everything.

254
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:36,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't cure all harms, but it is one tool.

255
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the linkage thing is great, mindful of not hampering the development process, but also mindful of benefiting the city itself and city government.

256
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:54,058
[SPEAKER_05]: to offset some of those other demands that we know are coming.

257
00:25:55,618 --> 00:26:00,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So that it's not a one way effort pays for it type of a deal.

258
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:01,959
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm trying to say.

259
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Some communities have heard to use those linkage fees pretty creatively too.

260
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:14,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Some would actually like funds job development training and things like that in the business.

261
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you could do a lot with those linkage fees.

262
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:17,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

263
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think the Somerville has it so that

264
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,023
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sort of kind of like an anti or a way to offset gentrification.

265
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:39,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have like a new company that comes in that is going to create high wage jobs, that's great.

266
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:48,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually they're bringing in people that have higher incomes and then could displace people that couldn't do those jobs that already lived there.

267
00:26:50,182 --> 00:27:10,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the affordable housing linkage comes in is create more affordable housing stock and then get the job training so that folks that are living there already might be able to get some skills so they could maybe have an employer in town now that they could be qualified to work for.

268
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's so many different ways that we can look at it.

269
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:15,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

270
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Daniel.

271
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:25,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate the update and all the information and I will circulate that link.

272
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:31,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I already did send, I believe, the links to the public hearing, public meetings that are coming up.

273
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

274
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:41,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next one, the next amendments that I expect that they'll vote on would be Medford Square in West Medford Square.

275
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And then

276
00:27:45,032 --> 00:28:00,763
[SPEAKER_03]: The residential, I don't expect any votes until the fall, because we're going through this whole input process, and then a whole new kind of draft is going to be created in response to that.

277
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:14,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have more particular input for the residential areas, there's ample time to provide some more input, as there'll be a whole new iteration that'll

278
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:23,618
[SPEAKER_03]: before, but if there's something like Medford Square, West Medford Square, those are more imminent if you wanted to.

279
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are commercial.

280
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:27,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

281
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Commercial.

282
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, mixed juice, yeah.

283
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Juice, OK.

284
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

285
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's coming up soon?

286
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:42,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the August 6 meeting.

287
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:43,172
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

288
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:44,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

289
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

290
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for joining us.

291
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Christian, as well.

292
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

293
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments.

294
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for what you guys do.

295
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:03,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, next on the agenda.

296
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Kathy, I see you joined us.

297
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:06,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see you.

298
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry I was late, Miriam.

299
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:16,197
[SPEAKER_07]: All of MGB internet is down at 1230 on the nose.

300
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:16,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bizarre.

301
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,338
[SPEAKER_07]: So sorry, I'm on my phone.

302
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:19,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my goodness.

303
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so if it drops off, something terrible happened.

304
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:22,919
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you, sorry.

305
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,340
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, no worries.

306
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,361
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we have an update from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

307
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:34,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And first off, I'd like to introduce to you Patrick Dunavant.

308
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,244
[SPEAKER_08]: He's our health equity coordinator.

309
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:48,075
[SPEAKER_08]: He's leading community liaisons in their efforts to do work around outreach and health equity and bringing issues to our attention.

310
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:58,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Patrick's working with them on creative ways to address the issues, either with outreach or education, or both, communication.

311
00:29:58,585 --> 00:30:03,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to have Patrick say hello, tell us a little bit about himself.

312
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:09,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is our board, Dr. Pradowitz, Jamie Votel, and Kathy Charbonneau.

313
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:12,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marianne.

314
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.

315
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:15,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to meet you.

316
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:38,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Marianne explained so well, my role as the health equity coordinator is supervising and supporting our team of community liaisons and some of our connectors who provide such an important bridge between both outreaching to communities that face access barriers around what services and supports are available

317
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:53,182
[SPEAKER_01]: through the city or through other avenues, sometimes the state, as well as serving as a way to amplify the voices of those communities to inform the city's policies and practices and the services that we provide.

318
00:30:54,303 --> 00:31:01,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I come to this work after spending a long time doing prevention coordination and prevention management

319
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:08,169
[SPEAKER_01]: around different health and social challenges, as well as doing some work around systems access.

320
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:09,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really excited.

321
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:14,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here about two months now, I think, three months.

322
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:25,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to be working with this great team and ways to sort of dig into both the similarities and the differences that the different communities are facing and building on.

323
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:27,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

324
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're happy to have Patrick.

325
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:37,327
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great work and Catherine, I don't know if there's anything to inform the board what's going on lately with.

326
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:44,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Patrick works under with Catherine in the office of prevention.

327
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

328
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we've been having microphone problems.

329
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:05,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of our most exciting updates is a new staff position we created here in Medford.

330
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to introduce Matisse Monti, who is our new prevention and wellness coordinator.

331
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:20,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And Matisse can talk about some of the things that she's been coordinating and one of the new grant initiatives we were just awarded.

332
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:27,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone, my name's Matisse.

333
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I, yeah, have been here maybe about a month now.

334
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:40,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of doing a lot with the youth, really trying to build up our youth programming in Medford.

335
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:49,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be working with the schools, trying to kind of lead a commission that is really talking about prevention.

336
00:32:51,137 --> 00:33:01,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I think predominantly a lot of what I'm going to do is around substance use, but kind of like the whole spectrum of youth prevention work.

337
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:10,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we got a grant from the Attorney General's office, and I've hired six youth

338
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:25,568
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with me for the next two months around kind of social media campaigns, events, really learning, doing peer education with the youth in the Medford community.

339
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:31,893
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we just had an awesome meeting today with those six youth.

340
00:33:32,873 --> 00:33:42,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to see what they're going to do and all the information that they're going to, resources that they're going to come up with, hopefully do some presentations for the high schoolers.

341
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:48,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the fall, probably I will be working on the YouthWorks grant.

342
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:59,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So hiring more youth and placing them into jobs and really doing professional development, in my opinion.

343
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:05,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I come from a background in harm reduction.

344
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:13,670
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a drop-in center for women and trans folks in the Mass and Cass area in Boston that are unhoused and using drugs.

345
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:20,792
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of experience around just substance use in general.

346
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:26,194
[SPEAKER_00]: My degree, my master's in public health, I focused a lot on LGBTQ health.

347
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:30,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's kind of where my expertise is.

348
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:38,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to work with the people that are going to be creating the world after us.

349
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:41,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really cool, cool position to be in.

350
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:43,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to be here.

351
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Matisse.

352
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to have you.

353
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you in a meeting this morning with the kids.

354
00:34:56,457 --> 00:35:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give you four minutes to tell me what you would do in some sort of icebreaker, sounds great.

355
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just say your work sounds super exciting.

356
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:25,263
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't, and maybe you have heard of this Brockton High and Brockton Community Health Center that have partnered on doing similar work, but specifically with the house high schoolers around leading leadership in health care, and then also stepping into other roles within health care.

357
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:32,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Might want to check that out and see if there's anything there you can learn and maybe implement here, but excited to hear the work that you're doing in Medford.

358
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

359
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:46,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then I did send you all the June monthly report, reportable disease update.

360
00:35:48,561 --> 00:36:00,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing too much that has changed as far as we still see that the flu, the coronavirus, we're still up there.

361
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:04,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have had a little bit of an uptick in

362
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:08,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Foodborne illnesses, not huge.

363
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:17,398
[SPEAKER_08]: But Josh is out there combating that for us with those restaurant inspections and making sure everyone's up to speed and up to code.

364
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:23,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do, you know, and it's this time of year as well when we would see a little bit more of an uptick.

365
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,903
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I say an uptick, it's, you know, just a couple of cases.

366
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:29,384
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a plague.

367
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:30,725
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're good.

368
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Any discussion on that?

369
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else have any thoughts?

370
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:36,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure.

371
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, other business.

372
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:55,035
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other business I have is like, uh, if, if the board agrees, I would like to, um, cancel August meeting and, um, take month of August, uh, break and we'll see you in September if, if the board's fine with that.

373
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:56,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

374
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:57,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.

375
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.

376
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,641
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

377
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:02,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh,

378
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.

379
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:07,441
[SPEAKER_08]: If no one else has anything, do we have a motion to adjourn?

380
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

381
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second?

382
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:13,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

383
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

384
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a roll call vote.

385
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:18,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny Vitale?

386
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

387
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Platowicz?

388
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:21,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

389
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathy Chapman?

390
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:23,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

391
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:25,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

392
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:26,335
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

393
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

394
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all very much.

395
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

396
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:29,517
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time.

397
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:30,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

398
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:30,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
