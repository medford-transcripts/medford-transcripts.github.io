1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,203
Recording in progress.

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,224
All right, let's start the meeting.

3
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:07,986
First is review of the minutes from May 20th, 2025.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,888
That was emailed to everybody.

5
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,470
We have the hearing at 338 High Street.

6
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:17,012
Update from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

7
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,454
We have the Regional Public Health Grant Initiative.

8
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:26,198
We also approve the Public Health Excellence LMA and designate

9
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,785
and we went over the monthly reportable disease report slash update.

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,986
Motion to approve the minutes, say aye.

11
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:38,206
Aye.

12
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:39,246
Jenny?

13
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,387
Do I have a second, Dr. Kladowicz?

14
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:41,887
Yep.

15
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,348
Okay, all in favor, Jenny Vitale?

16
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:46,348
Yes.

17
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,108
Dr. Kladowicz?

18
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,509
Yes, see, yes.

19
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,569
Okay, motion passes, minutes are approved, thank you.

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,450
Item number one for today, go ahead, Mary Ann.

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:05,210
All right, so with us today is Danielle Evans, our senior planner for the city and her intern Christian.

22
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:22,441
The city is undertaking a large rezoning initiative and the Community Development Board is actually looking for any input that folks may have, certainly from the community and from department heads, but also from all our boards and commissions as well.

23
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:36,370
So I asked Danielle to join us today to kind of go over really what the three buckets are that they're looking at and what the impact could be and what kind of feedback they're looking to get from folks.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,952
So Danielle, do you need me to?

25
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:47,235
So I don't have like a presentation or anything.

26
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,237
If folks want to

27
00:01:52,463 --> 00:02:11,328
So there's a zoning web page that we're trying to keep updated that has a lot of the presentations that the consultants created, as well as links to some of the draft maps and actual amendment language that's currently before the Community Development Board.

28
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:16,069
So basically, just to back up a little bit, this has been

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,942
going on for, I think, the last year, rezoning the city in phases.

30
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:32,485
So what's already been rezoned is the Mystic Avenue corridor has been rezoned.

31
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,767
The Salem Street corridor has been rezoned.

32
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:47,591
We've also added a green score, which is a metric that would apply citywide that regulates

33
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:52,676
Like pervious, impervious surface, landscaping, trees, that sort of thing.

34
00:02:53,536 --> 00:03:03,445
Because one of the first things I was surprised about was that there's actually no minimum pervious area requirements, even in the residential neighborhood.

35
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:07,569
So you could pave an entire lot, and that's completely legal.

36
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,613
So that's, well, used to be, not anymore.

37
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:28,653
So I'm not sure of everything that's under the purview of the Board of Health, if things like standing water, storm water, things like that, invasives that could be controlled by Green Score, things like that.

38
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:39,840
But one of the bigger things that's happening is kind of upzoning in different areas of the city, or that's what's proposed.

39
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:52,678
So you might have seen, you know, there's a lot of, you know, discussion on both sides about, you know, whether the city should change or not.

40
00:03:52,698 --> 00:04:02,341
The current zoning is pretty broken, so we do need to update it and change it because there's a lot of nonconforming structures.

41
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:08,722
Basically, the city was built out, and then they wrote zoning that made everything nonconforming, which doesn't make sense.

42
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:11,443
So you want to do anything to your house, you're going to have to go to the zoning board

43
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,280
because you don't comply with the setback requirements or something.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:31,304
So we're trying to bring things into conformance, but then also kind of make updates due to changes to the city, like the green line extension.

45
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,745
Probably doesn't make sense to have

46
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:45,763
such low density allowed by a Green Line station that could be an opportunity to have some more denser housing there.

47
00:04:46,984 --> 00:05:01,569
But the zoning is implementing the comprehensive plan that was adopted by the Community Development Board and was a long citywide process

48
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:13,058
So the zoning is part of that implementation, but it's a very iterative process.

49
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:19,603
So there's three, Chris, you're correct me if I'm wrong, there's three open public hearings before the Community Development Board.

50
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:27,270
So that's the Medford Square and West Medford Square, which is one bundled amendment.

51
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,555
And then there's the residential zoning, which is,

52
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:53,259
basically replacing the single-family one and two, the apartment zone, and the general residential zone, and replacing it with a new framework of neighborhood residential one, two, three, and then urban residential one and two, which have different

53
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:05,126
lot size requirements, unit count, allowances, heights, setbacks, maximum ground coverage, things like that.

54
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,688
And what's the third one?

55
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,390
Oh, we do not actually have a third open to public hearing.

56
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,311
We're expecting one to be referred.

57
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:12,853
Oh, the ADUs, yes.

58
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,295
Yeah, so the accessory dwelling units.

59
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,078
So we have an existing ordinance

60
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:27,300
regulating ADUs, but it's not compliant with the new state law through the Affordable Homes Act.

61
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:38,705
They now, it's required that any single family district or any district that allows single families, so

62
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:50,251
is allowed to have one ADU by right detached or as part of the structure, like within it or attached.

63
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:56,937
So we need to update our ordinance to align with that because our current ordinance is unenforceable.

64
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:02,042
And there's very few things that we can regulate with that.

65
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,706
I have a question, Daniel, and a couple of comments.

66
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:15,974
One, in your opinion, is the outcome of these zoning regulations upgrade is to increase the population in the city?

67
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,525
I don't know if it's to increase the population, but one of the, I think one of the goals is to

68
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:34,443
increase housing production in certain areas where it would make sense.

69
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,025
Oh, yeah.

70
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,386
I'm not looking for the goal.

71
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,108
I'm just looking for the result.

72
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:43,933
I think the result from what I'm hearing is going to result in increased number of people that live in Bedford.

73
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,036
Well, I think it's also to give housing choices.

74
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,698
Oh, it's not.

75
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,500
It's just the initial question.

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,702
Is it going to result in an increase in the population?

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,640
I don't know.

78
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,901
It depends on what right now I have.

79
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:00,343
I live in a single family neighborhood.

80
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:11,969
And until recently, both large single family homes were occupied by one person because they didn't have a smaller unit that they could move to that would be available.

81
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:19,713
So you have, you know, individuals that are living in large homes that a family could live in.

82
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,554
And we also have homes that are

83
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,219
in roommate situations where those folks would rather have their own unit.

84
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:38,042
So you might have like four grad students that have to, you know, occupy, you know, a rental unit near Tufts, but they'd rather live in studios.

85
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:44,564
So that could be like, you could have four more units there with those folks living by themselves in their units.

86
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:48,185
So it's not, it's a little bit more complicated than,

87
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:54,795
you know, more housing units means more population because household sizes are also decreasing.

88
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:01,978
The population of Medford has decreased a lot over the years just because people aren't having such large families anymore.

89
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:10,701
It used to be you'd have like three or four kids at least, and now, you know, maybe two, lots of only children, no children.

90
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,942
So the demographics are also switching.

91
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,023
So it's not quite the correlation.

92
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:22,266
Oh yeah, mindful of the transitory college population, which doesn't count.

93
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:29,267
I would think the end result of building more housing units would be an increase in the population.

94
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:38,569
Mindful of that, is anyone keeping into account the needs for infrastructure that's gonna go along with this, i.e.

95
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:43,970
traffic, parking, even the school system, and also taxes.

96
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:55,006
If more units are going up on the same part of land and more people per that part of land, then increase need for city services.

97
00:09:55,647 --> 00:10:02,173
Is the tax base gonna go up if people start adding structures to a certain piece of land?

98
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:06,177
Compensate the city for the additional services.

99
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:11,713
Well, with Prop 2.5, the existing taxes for the existing assessed

100
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:26,349
properties can only, is very limited in what it can go up, but new growth can be added to the top of that.

101
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:34,991
The new growth is where you can increase your tax base, especially, we also were trying to focus on commercial tax base.

102
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:45,634
So the upzoning of Mystic Avenue would allow a lot more new growth, hopefully.

103
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:48,015
Because right now it was only,

104
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:57,441
like maximum two stories, one stories in some of these outdated industrial zone kind of areas.

105
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:07,689
So hoping to capture the new growth there to take the pressure off of, you know, just the residents that shoulder, because I live in Medford too.

106
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,610
I'm a homeowner here.

107
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,031
I have kids in the school too.

108
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:10,131
So I,

109
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:15,122
can appreciate all those aspects.

110
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,203
Yeah, I would just be mindful of the stresses to the infrastructure.

111
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:23,165
A lot of folks planning, you got to take that all into consideration as you move forward.

112
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:33,168
Yeah, and so our DPW director was at the, was it this, which meeting was he at?

113
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:38,250
I missed it because I was stuck with a delayed flight.

114
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,631
So I missed that meeting.

115
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,232
Community development board meeting on July 9th.

116
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:54,240
And he spoke to the zoning impact on infrastructure in terms of water and sewer.

117
00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:04,168
And he said, as of right now, you can't say for sure that it will or will not impact.

118
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:05,649
Well, obviously, it will.

119
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:12,334
But you can't say for sure that it will have devastating impacts without because zoning is not

120
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:14,362
a definite.

121
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:19,927
It can happen from anywhere from when it's enacted or 30 years, 50 years from now.

122
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:28,013
So it's not necessarily going to be immediately impacting all these infrastructure things.

123
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,498
Also, one thing is we do have large developments are subject to linkage fees.

124
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:40,622
So if it's a larger development, they have to pay into

125
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:51,245
various linkage accounts for those roads, police, fire, water, sewer, I believe, and then parks.

126
00:12:52,666 --> 00:13:04,288
Granted, those fees haven't been updated since the 90s, so we're actually trying to update the linkage study so that we can get approval from the state to actually increase those fees.

127
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,929
It just turns out those studies are very expensive.

128
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:10,650
Yeah.

129
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:21,994
And another thing you had mentioned about the green score, we absolutely are going to weigh in on anything that we see that's a threat to the health of the community, no matter what it is.

130
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:26,635
So the fact that it's not in there doesn't stop us from weighing in.

131
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:34,036
So I would just try to incorporate a consideration of health issues into any of this planning, i.e.

132
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,096
standing water.

133
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,896
We're not going to let anyone just asphalt the whole thing.

134
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,757
We'll step in and we'll stop that on the health grounds.

135
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,745
they should know that right at the get-go.

136
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:49,388
So although it's not officially on our plate, it is on our plate.

137
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:54,151
That would be really good to know, Marion.

138
00:13:54,652 --> 00:14:01,016
What are some regulations that kind of overlap with zoning that we might not be aware of?

139
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,817
And who are enforcing those?

140
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,439
Well, we have mosquito stuff.

141
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:10,082
We have the rodent problem, all that stuff.

142
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,966
Yeah, it'll be relevant here.

143
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:17,488
And even going forward with that, you know, talking about like heat islands and, you know.

144
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:20,349
So these sites aren't off limits to us.

145
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,211
If we see something outrageous, we're not going to let it go.

146
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:31,795
Speaking of which, the 101 building here, right at Emerson Street, the corner, these trees would set back, but no one's pruning the trees.

147
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:39,418
So now there's a tree that's trying to take over the entire sidewalk and also the crossing.

148
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:52,877
It's totally obstructing the view of the Emerson Street sign, the streetwalk sign, and you can't even enter the crossing walk because the big branch of the tree's going to take your head off.

149
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,758
So that kind of stuff.

150
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,299
Is this a street tree or a private tree?

151
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,741
Yeah, this is a private tree that is taken over Main Street.

152
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:01,802
And no one's keeping it.

153
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,243
This is right across from the police station and the fire station.

154
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,024
So you can't even use the crosswalk.

155
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,205
It's right in the middle of that.

156
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,827
and it's obstructing all the city signs.

157
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:15,331
So that's the kind of stuff that we gotta watch for so we can take care of that.

158
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:21,135
Someone on a bike's gonna go down that sidewalk and get decapitated someday.

159
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,457
That's how low the tree is.

160
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:30,322
I think that whole section is gonna be part of the DOT upgrades of that intersection.

161
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,284
I think that's captured in part of that.

162
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:35,286
So there's gonna be a whole reconfiguration of that

163
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:36,937
cluster.

164
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:42,702
My point is to keep an eye on some of the private stuff impinging on the city stuff.

165
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:46,065
Yeah, that's probably like, you know, it looks good.

166
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,006
It's a tree, but no one's pruning it.

167
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:52,750
And now it's taking over the the crosswalk and the light obstructing street signs.

168
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,032
People try to take a right on that corner.

169
00:15:55,072 --> 00:16:00,056
They can't see the oncoming traffic coming out of 50 miles an hour sometimes on Main Street.

170
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:01,337
Yeah.

171
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:14,152
The other question I had, Danielle, about the affordable housing units, is that so part of the Greenland extension and all of that, is that that's all part of the zoning issues as well as trying to increase affordable housing?

172
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:29,724
I know they get used, but I mean, is there- There's a couple of the sub-state mandates, mandated changes that kind of relate to how we're also responding.

173
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:54,620
So there was the MBTA zoning, which basically any city or town that is served by the MBTA had to create a multifamily district and it had a numerical target and you had to prove that you were rezoning in a manner that would or could produce that many units.

174
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,722
So we got that passed two years ago because we were in the first

175
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,213
around of that as a rapid transit community.

176
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:04,094
So that's over in Wellington, and that's an overlay.

177
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:12,737
And that has nothing to do with our inclusionary housing.

178
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:24,602
They actually, the state had set a cap that is 10% of the units could be affordable at maximum 80% AMI, which is actually not

179
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:31,838
Our ordinance is actually stronger than that.

180
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:48,221
So we had to do a feasibility analysis to prove that our existing inclusionary zoning, which has higher than 10%, wouldn't hurt housing production.

181
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:57,203
So they reviewed that and found that we could keep our existing inclusionary zoning to apply to that district.

182
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:02,887
So our inclusionary zoning is citywide, including that district, because we got permission.

183
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:16,792
There will be some updates to the inclusionary housing, but it needs to be studied because it does have impacts.

184
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:23,094
And also this would be in conjunction with the linkage study because there was,

185
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,173
the affordable housing trust would like to see a linkage payment go to the trust.

186
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:46,781
But if you do that, you need to make sure that the number of units that you're requiring and any payment that it doesn't basically grind things to a halt.

187
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:50,663
Because if a project doesn't pencil out, they're not going to build it.

188
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,444
So you end up with nothing.

189
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,285
So we have to be careful about that.

190
00:18:55,413 --> 00:19:08,597
how much we require, there's a, you know, it changes with the market and, you know, the interest rate climate and things like that.

191
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,217
Balancing ethics.

192
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:12,718
Right.

193
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,040
Any other questions or thoughts?

194
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:28,640
Anybody that's in the meeting is free to ask.

195
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:36,786
I'm happy to provide the links to the zoning page, which is being updated.

196
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,087
But there's also a viewer.

197
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,429
And I can drop that link in.

198
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,671
Let's see.

199
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:45,993
Into the Zoom.

200
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,094
Sure.

201
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:51,418
And we can get that in the minutes to the link area.

202
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,926
And this is also linked from the city website.

203
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:20,690
This might open to a random property because I'm trying to figure out what the... But basically you can click on that link and you can kind of play around with the various layers to see current zoning and what some proposed changes are.

204
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:26,449
Or maybe you can email it to Mariana, then she can forward it to us.

205
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,230
Sure.

206
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:27,750
Yeah.

207
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,150
The link.

208
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,673
It was kind of a long link.

209
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,193
That's why.

210
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:31,293
Yeah.

211
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:32,014
So there's.

212
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,656
You can cut and paste it in.

213
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,939
I think we might've created a tiny URL.

214
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,441
I can email it out.

215
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:42,182
Yeah.

216
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:42,602
Yeah.

217
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:43,283
Just email it.

218
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,805
It'll be easier.

219
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,987
I'm interested in looking at it for sure.

220
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:59,531
Yeah, so I guess other things that might be like before you are like, Dr. Platzowitz, I'm so sorry.

221
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:05,315
So you had brought up population increases.

222
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:13,620
So like from your perspective, is there other things that we should be concerned about like population?

223
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,522
Just mindful of the infrastructure.

224
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,503
I know with some of the immigration,

225
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:31,524
Some of the cities had difficulty because when the population comes up, maybe unexpectedly at times, there's other needs of that population need from the city that need to be taken into account.

226
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:40,008
And if the city's not prepared for it, it can maybe turn into what we don't want, you know.

227
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:47,631
But like rodents, like rats and stuff like that, I know- Oh yeah, just the need for more teachers.

228
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:56,375
If we have more kids moving into these extra units, that's gonna put stresses on the school system.

229
00:21:56,455 --> 00:22:04,279
So just mindful of when the people populate these looser zoning restrictions.

230
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,882
I would think that outcome's gonna be increased population.

231
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:14,627
I could be wrong, but that's what I would expect if you have more dwelling units.

232
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:36,243
And- Yeah, I think it's not like a- Oh yeah, yeah, we'll come on it sequentially, but just to be mindful of that, because you got all the trash and water and sewer and schools, police, fire, people requiring services on all of them are gonna go up then, and they need to be ready to deliver.

233
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,506
And I think one of the other things is,

234
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:54,522
you know, is the mismatch between the household sizes and the household units, the unit sizes that we have now, like I was saying, we have, you know, a lot of seniors that are overhoused and would like, yeah.

235
00:22:54,542 --> 00:23:07,972
And they, they, you know, can't move because they want to stay in their community, but also it could be very limited because, um, you know, if they want to age in place, you know, they want to live on like one floor, have,

236
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:17,972
accessible units or an elevator served building someplace, but they don't need to be car dependent so they could walk around.

237
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:34,324
We're hoping that some of this upzoning and some of the corridors near amenities would increase

238
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:43,040
production of elevator served buildings that, I think those kick in at like four stories, I believe.

239
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:50,405
Otherwise it's not economical for a developer to have an elevator.

240
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:59,791
So we'd end up not having that type of housing stock for disabled folks or anyone with mobility challenges.

241
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:03,833
So didn't have that density

242
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:18,153
in some of these quarters where there's the services, so you could walk to a coffee shop or, you know, to a corner store, so they're closer and not as isolated from things.

243
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:24,238
I don't know, is that anything like that something that your group focuses on?

244
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:33,338
Well, certainly, yeah, isolation and seniors and mental health is just absolutely something we're looking at.

245
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,540
So that would be, yeah, that's great.

246
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:44,188
If those are the types of things that are in the thought process when you're considering the zoning changes, that's great.

247
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,632
I mean, obviously, yeah, more density, more trash.

248
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:54,135
something that we battle with every day, the road initiative as well.

249
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:54,615
Yeah.

250
00:24:55,196 --> 00:25:06,060
So part of that is with site plan review and having strict standards of how things can be handled, like how trash is handled.

251
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:17,125
You can look into what the extent of zoning regulations can help alleviate your bad situations.

252
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,174
with trash and things like that.

253
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:29,639
Nobody doesn't touch everything.

254
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:36,844
You can't cure all harms, but it is one tool.

255
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:50,274
I think the linkage thing is great, mindful of not hampering the development process, but also mindful of benefiting the city itself and city government.

256
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:54,058
to offset some of those other demands that we know are coming.

257
00:25:55,618 --> 00:26:00,819
So that it's not a one way effort pays for it type of a deal.

258
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:01,959
That's what I'm trying to say.

259
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,361
Some communities have heard to use those linkage fees pretty creatively too.

260
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:14,322
Some would actually like funds job development training and things like that in the business.

261
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,102
So it's, you could do a lot with those linkage fees.

262
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:17,883
Yeah.

263
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,583
Cause I think the Somerville has it so that

264
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,023
it's sort of kind of like an anti or a way to offset gentrification.

265
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:39,413
So if you have like a new company that comes in that is going to create high wage jobs, that's great.

266
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:48,500
That's usually they're bringing in people that have higher incomes and then could displace people that couldn't do those jobs that already lived there.

267
00:26:50,182 --> 00:27:10,547
So that's where the affordable housing linkage comes in is create more affordable housing stock and then get the job training so that folks that are living there already might be able to get some skills so they could maybe have an employer in town now that they could be qualified to work for.

268
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,507
Yes, there's so many different ways that we can look at it.

269
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:15,928
Great.

270
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,549
Thank you, Daniel.

271
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:25,396
I really appreciate the update and all the information and I will circulate that link.

272
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:31,561
And then I already did send, I believe, the links to the public hearing, public meetings that are coming up.

273
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,944
So.

274
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:41,450
So the next one, the next amendments that I expect that they'll vote on would be Medford Square in West Medford Square.

275
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,511
And then

276
00:27:45,032 --> 00:28:00,763
The residential, I don't expect any votes until the fall, because we're going through this whole input process, and then a whole new kind of draft is going to be created in response to that.

277
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:14,092
So if you have more particular input for the residential areas, there's ample time to provide some more input, as there'll be a whole new iteration that'll

278
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:23,618
before, but if there's something like Medford Square, West Medford Square, those are more imminent if you wanted to.

279
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,240
And those are commercial.

280
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:27,121
Yeah.

281
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,041
Commercial.

282
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,142
Yeah, mixed juice, yeah.

283
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,683
Juice, OK.

284
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,105
Great.

285
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,186
And that's coming up soon?

286
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:42,731
I think it's the August 6 meeting.

287
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:43,172
OK.

288
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:44,475
Yeah.

289
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:46,677
All right.

290
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,019
Thank you very much for joining us.

291
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,320
And thank you, Christian, as well.

292
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,400
Appreciate it.

293
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,822
Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments.

294
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,624
Thank you so much for what you guys do.

295
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:03,169
Okay, next on the agenda.

296
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,431
Hi, Kathy, I see you joined us.

297
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:06,572
Nice to see you.

298
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,775
Yeah, sorry I was late, Miriam.

299
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:16,197
All of MGB internet is down at 1230 on the nose.

300
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:16,957
It's so bizarre.

301
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,338
So sorry, I'm on my phone.

302
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:19,558
Oh my goodness.

303
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,959
Yeah, so if it drops off, something terrible happened.

304
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:22,919
But thank you, sorry.

305
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,340
OK, no worries.

306
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,361
All right, we have an update from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

307
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:34,683
And first off, I'd like to introduce to you Patrick Dunavant.

308
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,244
He's our health equity coordinator.

309
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:48,075
He's leading community liaisons in their efforts to do work around outreach and health equity and bringing issues to our attention.

310
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:58,004
And then Patrick's working with them on creative ways to address the issues, either with outreach or education, or both, communication.

311
00:29:58,585 --> 00:30:03,349
So I want to have Patrick say hello, tell us a little bit about himself.

312
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:09,262
And this is our board, Dr. Pradowitz, Jamie Votel, and Kathy Charbonneau.

313
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:12,227
Thank you, Marianne.

314
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,228
Good afternoon, everyone.

315
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:15,208
It's a pleasure to meet you.

316
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:38,994
And as Marianne explained so well, my role as the health equity coordinator is supervising and supporting our team of community liaisons and some of our connectors who provide such an important bridge between both outreaching to communities that face access barriers around what services and supports are available

317
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:53,182
through the city or through other avenues, sometimes the state, as well as serving as a way to amplify the voices of those communities to inform the city's policies and practices and the services that we provide.

318
00:30:54,303 --> 00:31:01,407
I come to this work after spending a long time doing prevention coordination and prevention management

319
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:08,169
around different health and social challenges, as well as doing some work around systems access.

320
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:09,669
And so I'm really excited.

321
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:14,030
I've been here about two months now, I think, three months.

322
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:25,414
I'm really excited to be working with this great team and ways to sort of dig into both the similarities and the differences that the different communities are facing and building on.

323
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:27,134
So thank you very much.

324
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:29,635
And we're happy to have Patrick.

325
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:37,327
That's great work and Catherine, I don't know if there's anything to inform the board what's going on lately with.

326
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:44,233
So, Patrick works under with Catherine in the office of prevention.

327
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,301
Can you hear me?

328
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,568
Okay, we've been having microphone problems.

329
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:05,793
So one of our most exciting updates is a new staff position we created here in Medford.

330
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:11,376
And I'd like to introduce Matisse Monti, who is our new prevention and wellness coordinator.

331
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:20,321
And Matisse can talk about some of the things that she's been coordinating and one of the new grant initiatives we were just awarded.

332
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:27,518
Hi everyone, my name's Matisse.

333
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,140
I, yeah, have been here maybe about a month now.

334
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:40,128
I am kind of doing a lot with the youth, really trying to build up our youth programming in Medford.

335
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:49,656
I'll be working with the schools, trying to kind of lead a commission that is really talking about prevention.

336
00:32:51,137 --> 00:33:01,427
I think predominantly a lot of what I'm going to do is around substance use, but kind of like the whole spectrum of youth prevention work.

337
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:10,757
And yeah, we got a grant from the Attorney General's office, and I've hired six youth

338
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:25,568
to work with me for the next two months around kind of social media campaigns, events, really learning, doing peer education with the youth in the Medford community.

339
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:31,893
So yeah, we just had an awesome meeting today with those six youth.

340
00:33:32,873 --> 00:33:42,240
And I'm really excited to see what they're going to do and all the information that they're going to, resources that they're going to come up with, hopefully do some presentations for the high schoolers.

341
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:48,124
And then in the fall, probably I will be working on the YouthWorks grant.

342
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:59,172
So hiring more youth and placing them into jobs and really doing professional development, in my opinion.

343
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:05,387
Yeah, I come from a background in harm reduction.

344
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:13,670
I worked at a drop-in center for women and trans folks in the Mass and Cass area in Boston that are unhoused and using drugs.

345
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:20,792
So I have a lot of experience around just substance use in general.

346
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:26,194
My degree, my master's in public health, I focused a lot on LGBTQ health.

347
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:30,195
So yeah, that's kind of where my expertise is.

348
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:38,697
And I'm really excited to work with the people that are going to be creating the world after us.

349
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:41,458
So I think it's really cool, cool position to be in.

350
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:43,359
And I'm excited to be here.

351
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,860
Thanks, Matisse.

352
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,820
Happy to have you.

353
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,581
I saw you in a meeting this morning with the kids.

354
00:34:56,457 --> 00:35:01,829
I'm going to give you four minutes to tell me what you would do in some sort of icebreaker, sounds great.

355
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:07,550
I would just say your work sounds super exciting.

356
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:25,263
If you haven't, and maybe you have heard of this Brockton High and Brockton Community Health Center that have partnered on doing similar work, but specifically with the house high schoolers around leading leadership in health care, and then also stepping into other roles within health care.

357
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:32,269
Might want to check that out and see if there's anything there you can learn and maybe implement here, but excited to hear the work that you're doing in Medford.

358
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,710
Welcome.

359
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:46,280
Okay, and then I did send you all the June monthly report, reportable disease update.

360
00:35:48,561 --> 00:36:00,825
Nothing too much that has changed as far as we still see that the flu, the coronavirus, we're still up there.

361
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:04,386
And we have had a little bit of an uptick in

362
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:08,413
Foodborne illnesses, not huge.

363
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:17,398
But Josh is out there combating that for us with those restaurant inspections and making sure everyone's up to speed and up to code.

364
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:23,161
But we do, you know, and it's this time of year as well when we would see a little bit more of an uptick.

365
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,903
But when I say an uptick, it's, you know, just a couple of cases.

366
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:29,384
It's not a plague.

367
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:30,725
So we're good.

368
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,166
Any discussion on that?

369
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,467
Anyone else have any thoughts?

370
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:36,039
Well, sure.

371
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,402
Um, other business.

372
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:55,035
The only other business I have is like, uh, if, if the board agrees, I would like to, um, cancel August meeting and, um, take month of August, uh, break and we'll see you in September if, if the board's fine with that.

373
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:56,357
Sounds good.

374
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:57,698
Sounds good to me.

375
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,299
Sounds good to me.

376
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,641
All right.

377
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:02,362
Uh,

378
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:04,759
I think that's it.

379
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:07,441
If no one else has anything, do we have a motion to adjourn?

380
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,183
Motion to adjourn.

381
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,624
Do we have a second?

382
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:13,745
Second.

383
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,126
Thank you.

384
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,467
Take a roll call vote.

385
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:18,609
Jenny Vitale?

386
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,150
Yes.

387
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,511
Dr. Platowicz?

388
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:21,971
Yes.

389
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,252
Kathy Chapman?

390
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:23,893
Yes.

391
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:25,574
Motion carries.

392
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:26,335
All right.

393
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,075
Motion to adjourn.

394
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,116
Thank you all very much.

395
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:28,716
Thank you.

396
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:29,517
See you next time.

397
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:30,137
Thank you.

398
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:30,938
Take care.
