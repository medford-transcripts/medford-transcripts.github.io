00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:39,711
[SPEAKER_04]: That's tonight.

18
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: be it further resolved that based on the budget ordinance and discussions with the administration, the city council and city administration will follow the following budget schedule for fiscal 26.

19
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,751
[SPEAKER_04]: By March 13th, councilors submit individual budget recommendations.

20
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:58,052
[SPEAKER_04]: March 18th at 6 p.m., committee of the whole meeting to discuss budget recommendations.

21
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:08,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow night, March 19th at 6 p.m., there's a joint meeting of the city council and the school committee in the chambers to receive a financial update and discuss the fiscal 26 budget process.

22
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:18,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Tuesday, March 25 2025 assuming we report out recommendations tonight, the city council will have a collective recommendation to send to the mayor.

23
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:23,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year we also sent everyone's individual recommendations so all of that will be included.

24
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: From April 15th to May 21st, the council would hold preliminary budget meetings with department heads.

25
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:35,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And by Friday, May 31st, the mayor would submit a comprehensive budget proposal to the city council.

26
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:41,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a list of the draft schedule of the meetings from April 15th to May 21st.

27
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:50,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are Tuesday, April 15th, Tuesday, April 29th, Wednesday, April 30th, Tuesday, May 13th, Tuesday, May 20th, and Wednesday, May 21st.

28
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,686
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have budget recommendations from everybody except for me.

29
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will move through that.

30
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick overview.

31
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially what we did last year is individual councilors discussed their budget proposals, and then we, the councilors made a motion to include some of them in a joint proposal that came from the council as a body as a whole, and then we submitted

32
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:29,580
[SPEAKER_04]: that joint recommendation, collective recommendation, as well as the individual recommendations from individual Councilors.

33
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that can basically be our process again.

34
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:37,765
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone else wants to make a motion to do it differently, I think that's totally fine.

35
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can go around, if folks wanna signal in or raise their hands on Zoom and share what their recommendations are for the budget for fiscal 26.

36
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Councilor Leming and I'll recognize Councilor Leming.

37
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears.

38
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:05,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the, I believe the shortest submitted recommendation of anybody here.

39
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:10,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And my recommendation is also reflected in that of several other Councilors.

40
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:25,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just to allocate funding for a therapeutic recreation specialist and a office manager for Medford Recreation Department, which follows several meetings that this

41
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:42,711
[SPEAKER_06]: body had on the topic, the likely impact of that would be $125,000 a year, although that would likely be determined by the mayor and Kevin Bailey.

42
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:45,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only other

43
00:12:47,073 --> 00:13:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that the only other priority that I had that was particularly on my mind, but I'm not sure if this would be a budget request per se, so it wasn't included, was ensuring that enough capital earmarks are available to create either a nexus study for the new affordable housing

44
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:21,498
[SPEAKER_06]: linkage program or about $150,000 for a study to overhaul the entirety of the capital improvements program.

45
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:24,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of the linkage buckets that the city has.

46
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:37,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm not sure if that would be a budget request or if a free cash earmark would go under that, but that's what I have.

47
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:38,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

48
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

49
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to go next?

50
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

51
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:51,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

52
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:56,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to focus on safety in the city.

53
00:13:56,584 --> 00:14:06,827
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first request is something that a couple of other Councilors recommended, which is adopting the suggestions of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

54
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:08,307
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't

55
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:10,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a dollar amount attached to that.

56
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:12,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it would all cost there.

57
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they are relatively reasonable requests.

58
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:22,717
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that is a significant spend would be hiring the

59
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:29,070
[SPEAKER_00]: hiring somebody in DPW whose focus would be, or no, no, no.

60
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think it's DPW.

61
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the traffic person who would focus on traffic engineer whose focus would be on walking, biking and transit.

62
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:46,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's already a position that's somebody who was hired at one point.

63
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,667
[SPEAKER_00]: is an open position right now.

64
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not a crazy reach.

65
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,670
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of these are crazy reaches.

66
00:14:56,671 --> 00:15:04,234
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second one is something that is was not recommended by other Councilors and is something that people may not be aware of.

67
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:08,476
[SPEAKER_00]: But our new fire chief let me know that

68
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:14,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Medford doesn't have a dive team on in the fire department.

69
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:17,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, surrounding towns and cities do have dive teams.

70
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,991
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good number of boat clubs.

71
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:26,339
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of waterways in Medford and lacking a dive team is a sort of whole

72
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,962
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity in our public safety.

73
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:49,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we had a very notable drowning in the summer of 2019, I believe, 10 of our firefighters took it upon themselves and began the training to become certified for underwater search and rescue.

74
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,511
[SPEAKER_00]: But to have a full dive team, you need 12 people.

75
00:15:52,631 --> 00:16:05,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, Chief Evans did, went and got an independent estimate for what it would cost to train, fully train, finish the training of the 10 people who started the training.

76
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have two more steps to go and do a full training for two more people.

77
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:12,322
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the equipment that it would take, and it would cost 123, I think.

78
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:19,267
[SPEAKER_00]: 123 22 yeah about $123,000 so I think that's well worth it.

79
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:22,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be.

80
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:29,534
[SPEAKER_00]: An excellent sort of commendation to the people that started that training and.

81
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:36,670
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just be general, um, best practice for the city to have that kind of resource.

82
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:42,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I just think it's a boost morale.

83
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good for everybody in town.

84
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,234
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

85
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:50,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

86
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.

87
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President.

88
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Please forgive me.

89
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:03,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long week and I appreciate taking my email today.

90
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:23,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that before I had a few questions that as I go through, I think the administrative assistant for the Recreation Department, I think it would be cost efficient considering we're using members of that department that are making upwards close to $100,000 to spend probably a third of their time

91
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:33,779
[SPEAKER_03]: doing clerical work that could be done with maybe even a part-time employee or a full-time administrative assistant.

92
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be a huge plus for that department in the city.

93
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the

94
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:46,786
[SPEAKER_03]: The role of the, um, the therapeutic position for the recreation department.

95
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: As the director mentioned, we have a person that's already working for the department that's trained and licensed.

96
00:17:55,893 --> 00:18:01,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But having that person freed up to do those positions, I think would be a huge.

97
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:11,161
[SPEAKER_03]: add to our community, especially as we focus on adding so many of our new programs for children with disabilities.

98
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:27,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that really stretching or adding a role as another program supervisor in that department to free that person up would be a huge success for us.

99
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:38,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think the other piece that was has been mentioned, I know that tomorrow will be another meeting at five o'clock with the parents that have came and talked with us to this council and subcommittee.

100
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:47,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that having an inclusion specialist within the city, whether we look at it as a part time role to start and then as a full time role, I think that

101
00:18:48,492 --> 00:19:11,951
[SPEAKER_03]: the if we listen to the parents they really talked about adding that position that we need something similar to that in recreation but having that position city-wide where it's not looked at just as programming but for our students with disability as they age out and become adults and we look into

102
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:19,035
[SPEAKER_03]: offering assistance and whether it comes to job assistance or housing.

103
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the position that's really that I've heard that talking to the residents is something that's super important.

104
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that something that I'm a little perplexed why my colleagues didn't bring any, at least all of them we shouldn't but haven't, but I think we should all really focus on

105
00:19:40,806 --> 00:20:03,423
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing a city solicitor assistant city solicitor and I think having the assistant city solicitor like we asked for that's working with the with the the city council directly I think is important I think that when you put that position out with such a low number we're not going to get qualified or even any applicants as we can see that we're on we're working close to four years now but

106
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:15,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think increasing that line to bring in a qualified city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, especially when you see the money that we're wasting and using on outside council.

107
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:27,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other piece that, you know, where residents have questions legality wise and they don't have an access to anybody at city hall to help them navigate.

108
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:32,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, it's caused some disturbance within our community because

109
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:43,602
[SPEAKER_03]: A simple attorney talking to a resident, um, could have stopped a lot of negativity and, um, and what was going on with been going on and dividing this community.

110
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I had just got off the phone a little while ago with a representative from the fire department.

111
00:20:50,004 --> 00:21:02,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that not understanding or knowing what the, um, hiring processes we're hearing that there's going to be a huge class going out soon for the fire department.

112
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that I'll bring up.

113
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that they're in the works with that.

114
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

115
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:19,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that put in funding our police department and looking at the avenues that we wanted that we were looking forward to make it the police department that everybody's proud of.

116
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they've done such a great job, but.

117
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:29,121
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I'm hearing, it's not the fact that we're not hiring, the fact that there aren't enough people to hire.

118
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:40,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think all of us have talked about the increase in the past for DPW because of, you know, I know the mayor's, the override was put in and it'll be interesting to see what this $500,000 for this

119
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,010
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to save our streets and sidewalks.

120
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that's something that we hear calls about every single day.

121
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:55,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure all of you do, but making sure that we work with our commissioner to fill the needs and the DPW department.

122
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, I know that I believe in last year's budget, we cut the line substantially for the abatement process and

123
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:19,035
[SPEAKER_03]: especially after the override and our most vulnerable members of the community that reached out to me looking for support with tax relief and looking at different abatement.

124
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:35,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to look at that line and make sure that we give the assessor enough support that if people are applying that our homes are assessed correctly and our, especially our most vulnerable members of this community, which mostly are seniors, homeowners,

125
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:43,570
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't being pushed out of their homes because we're not giving them enough avenue to support them.

126
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that my list is long, and I appreciate you listening, Mr. President, and to my fellow councilors, so thank you.

127
00:22:51,892 --> 00:23:00,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, and I will make sure that your list is included in the packet that goes out after the meeting.

128
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:00,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

129
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

130
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, and then Councilor Tsengh, and then Councilor Collins.

131
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:06,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

132
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:07,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

133
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do support many of the other items that other folks have brought up.

134
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to talk about the two that I put in that have been projects that I have been working on for quite a few months.

135
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of them is about the volunteer tree planting program.

136
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:30,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been working with folks in Trees Medford and also

137
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to tons of volunteers about this program.

138
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:46,928
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have the DPW commissioner come in to the committee to speak about what it would take to get this program off the ground.

139
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me just say a little bit about why it's important that, you know, we do lose about twice as many trees as we plant every year.

140
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we live, we, you know, a third of Medford is the fells.

141
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:58,753
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lots of trees.

142
00:23:58,793 --> 00:23:59,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you

143
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:22,008
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, live in the kind of northern part of Ward 6, you feel like there's lots and lots of trees, but if you live south of the river, you really, and especially if you've lived there for a long time, I talk to many people who say that they have lived on their street for decades, and it used to be a canopy of trees, and you look now, and it is barren.

144
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,770
[SPEAKER_02]: This depresses home prices.

145
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:34,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes us to have heat islands, makes people pay more for heating in the winter, for cooling in the summer.

146
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:37,699
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many reasons.

147
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't clean our air from pollution.

148
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many reasons why we need to be replacing these trees.

149
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:57,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdotally, you can just see on my street, not that my street is any more important than anyone's street, but on my street, you can see these little squares where there used to be a tree planted in front of every house.

150
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, on the whole block, there is one remaining tree.

151
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really believe that with our small budget in Medford, with our small budget and our mighty residents, mighty in their willingness to volunteer, I think that we can solve this problem with very little addition to the budget.

152
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can do it through activating our community and getting people involved in community events, meeting their neighbors,

153
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And the DPW commissioner said that all it would take would be one staffer, like a halftime staffer, who was a volunteer coordinator.

154
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my first request.

155
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:49,763
[SPEAKER_02]: My second request is a halftime person involved in housing to run a home sharing program.

156
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:52,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I've been meeting with our housing person

157
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: and other, you know, many other residents.

158
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:58,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been meeting for months.

159
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:08,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We have met with people who run the sort of national home sharing organization that helps people start home sharing programs in their cities.

160
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a little bit about the idea behind home sharing.

161
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: In our city, according to our senior center, I hope I am not incorrect if I'm not wrong.

162
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:30,077
[SPEAKER_02]: What they said is that we have a larger percentage of seniors, people over 65 than we have ever had in Medford.

163
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is that many of those people live in houses that have four or five bedrooms.

164
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:37,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And

165
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:57,326
[SPEAKER_02]: As I have talked to seniors, both of the senior center, you know, as I was knocking on doors people that I, you know, interact with some of these folks that I've been meeting with many many seniors here in Medford would like to downsize or they are worried about aging in place.

166
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:08,510
[SPEAKER_02]: but they either, the rent is getting hard to, sorry, they could use a little bit more financial security or they need a little help around the house.

167
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not the only city facing this kind of issue.

168
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:22,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really interlocked with our housing crisis because 50 years ago, we had 9,000 more people living in the city with less housing.

169
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:27,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So our problem is that we have fewer people

170
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:29,313
[SPEAKER_02]: per bedroom.

171
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one person living in a three-, four-, five-bedroom house, and that isn't how it used to be, and that isn't how it could be.

172
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:45,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can really help both our seniors to help them to age in place help them to be financially comfortable.

173
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can also help our housing crisis by helping to solve this problem.

174
00:27:51,801 --> 00:28:01,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a lot of other cities are doing is they're starting a home sharing program and it's a matchmaking service a very hand holding personalized matchmaking service that ensures

175
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:12,574
[SPEAKER_02]: that older folks who have extra bedrooms can find a person who usually it's some mixture of financial payment.

176
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,336
[SPEAKER_02]: They call them hosts and guests, kind of like Airbnb.

177
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:18,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mixture of financial payment and service.

178
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can help take out the trash.

179
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:25,965
[SPEAKER_02]: They can help do a few things around the house for someone who is older and needs a little bit of help.

180
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:37,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this program could be really successful in Medford and it could solve a lot of our sort of interlocking problems that we have that are basically because of demographics.

181
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:46,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's something that again, I think would be a very big impact for a very small amount of money.

182
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:46,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

183
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:49,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

184
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:50,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

185
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears.

186
00:28:58,213 --> 00:28:59,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my audio coming through okay?

187
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:02,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little quiet.

188
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane, do you think you could turn up the Zoom audio a little bit?

189
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:08,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can do that.

190
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:09,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for showing me.

191
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:12,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

192
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:12,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.

193
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,281
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?

194
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:14,621
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

195
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:15,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.

196
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:21,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much to my fellow councillors for your comments so far.

197
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:29,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to be at the beginning of another budget process again with you all, and I'm grateful for all of everybody submitted, I think.

198
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:34,140
[SPEAKER_01]: very additive and thoughtful preliminary budget recommendations.

199
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, you know, the work ahead of us is funneling down the request from the Council into a tight, succinct list that we can hope to

200
00:29:45,768 --> 00:30:02,494
[SPEAKER_01]: fit into the overall operating budget of things that we think are the most critical and most needed by the community this year, and I think that we're off to a strong start because I see a lot of overlap between a lot of different Councilors, based on the comments and feedback that we've all been hearing from residents over the past year and longer than that so I'll quickly summarize.

201
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:10,120
[SPEAKER_01]: The priorities that I submitted ahead of this meeting, and I'll skip the entire preamble.

202
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:23,550
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes without saying, but I think it is worth saying out loud that we cannot permit any reduction from the school committee's budgetary request for Medford Public Schools.

203
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very important to me that we prioritize meeting that this year, as we always prioritize meeting that.

204
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, prioritizing meeting the library department budgetary request and maintaining at least level service and hours of operation.

205
00:30:38,932 --> 00:31:01,677
[SPEAKER_01]: In parallel with what some other Councilors have mentioned about prioritizing the funding recommendations, the funding asks from the Medford Bicycle Advisory Committee, I'd like to see us fund one additional traffic engineer for a total of two within the Department of Traffic and Transportation to focus on walking, biking, transit, and the implementation of a vision zero and complete streets policy.

206
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:08,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get too into the details here, obviously, that there's a lot of ground that such a position could cover.

207
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:18,700
[SPEAKER_01]: But other councillors have said a lot in this meeting about things, kind of things we can fund where we'd see a very big return on impact.

208
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:29,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is one of them, because these are the people who, if we're able to get them inside of City Hall, could help us out not just with responding to constituent concerns and doing things with the resources that we already have,

209
00:31:29,602 --> 00:31:38,046
[SPEAKER_01]: but also applying for state and federal grants that would help us do the transformative road design and pedestrian and bicycle safety projects that we already know that we need.

210
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:48,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also mention funding a therapeutic recreation and inclusion specialist and an office manager for metric recreation.

211
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:57,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard a lot from the families of youth with disabilities about where these two positions would fit into the puzzle when it comes to making

212
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:06,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford recreation and just not even recreation, but participation citywide, more accessible for people with and without disabilities.

213
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:15,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's incredibly important that this year we start putting things into the budget that will move us closer towards a fully accessible future for Medford.

214
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:29,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I also recommend that we increase the budgeted amount for our city solicitor salary so that we can, God willing, this year fill that position, which I know we are all very, very keen to see that filled.

215
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:38,481
[SPEAKER_01]: My estimate was that infusing $36,000 into that line item would bring this into competitiveness with our neighboring municipalities.

216
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:46,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if we've received yet the classification and compensation study that could give us further guidance on what that should be raised to.

217
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:58,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I'll just mention similar to in previous years, I'd like to see us maintain all grant funded personnel in the health department, the Office of Outreach and Prevention, the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

218
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:06,335
[SPEAKER_01]: aligned with what I said about Medford's Bicycle Advisory Committee's funding recommendations.

219
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:21,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see us increase our capital spending earmark for expanding our network of separated protected bike lanes, completing the bike master plan, and doing design studies for Vision Zero and Complete Streets policies.

220
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:26,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one, I think, is small dollars compared to things like salaries.

221
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:45,016
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we should also be putting more money into installing and maintaining road safety equipment interventions, everything from bike racks and flex posts to increased signage, as well as planning new crosswalks where we already know that we need them, such as on Salem Street.

222
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me, just finding my notes that I toggled away from.

223
00:33:55,216 --> 00:34:02,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to co-sign recommendations that I've heard so far from a couple other councillors that I haven't mentioned.

224
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:09,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad that Councilor Lazzaro brought up the dive team training for the Medford Fire Department.

225
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that a lot of recommendations from many councillors have all been circling around safety improvements that will have such a vast qualitative impact.

226
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:22,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Improvement for the people of Medford.

227
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:49,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we should really be focusing this year on things that will make life safer for the people of Medford so I think that talking about accessibility improvements talking about pedestrian cyclist and driver safety improvements talking about trainings that we can fund for our First responders that they can do a better job and do the do the job that they want to be doing making life ever safer for Medford residents is where we should be focusing in this budget cycle and

228
00:34:51,092 --> 00:35:00,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to just quickly co-sign the idea from Councilor Leming, funds to help us jumpstart our affordable housing linkage and update our linkage fees program.

229
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:15,857
[SPEAKER_01]: These are funds where if we invest them now, we can see a return on investment from, we can make it so developers in our community are paying into these funds that we already know that we need and that will manifest in better funding for infrastructure and better funding for affordable housing.

230
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:17,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

231
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and I'll go to Councilor Tseng.

232
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:26,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

233
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.

234
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:43,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice to hear all of my fellow Councilors bring in such important details and such important ideas from different walks of our city, from different facets of what our city government does.

235
00:35:44,463 --> 00:35:47,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to start from the basics.

236
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to co-assign my fellow Councilors

237
00:35:51,407 --> 00:36:01,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendations, particularly with regards to public safety and our infrastructure, making sure that pedestrians, cyclists and drivers all have safe roads to operate on.

238
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:19,237
[SPEAKER_05]: with regards to the investment in our accessibility and our inclusion when it comes to the activities that our children and teenagers have in Medford.

239
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:31,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means the therapeutic recreation specialist and full-time office manager for Medford Rec, which would also help a lot with the youth commission idea, which I'll talk about later.

240
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:39,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I would also co-sign, um, Councilor Collins and Scarpelli's, um, idea.

241
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:49,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, their recommendation to increase the budgeted amount for the city solicitor's salary to, um, make sure that we are competitive with neighbouring municipalities.

242
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, general infrastructure spending when it comes, uh, I'd like to co-sign, um, ideas for general infrastructure spending as well.

243
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:04,684
[SPEAKER_05]: to make sure that we're doing the basics of city government, making sure that we are filling our potholes, fixing our streets.

244
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:12,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with that being said, I would like to take this moment to also thank Bedford voters for passing

245
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:20,188
[SPEAKER_05]: the prop two and a half question last year, which will allow us to get a step forward on that.

246
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:32,112
[SPEAKER_05]: This budget process year after year really shows us as a city council and shows the city as a whole how budget constrained municipalities, including Medford are.

247
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And that vote in the fall really helps us this year to maintain financial stability, even with ongoing challenges

248
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:54,189
[SPEAKER_05]: that we face, including this random cuts to federal funding, and what most economists and what most business leaders predict will be rising cost of living.

249
00:37:56,866 --> 00:38:14,702
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I would also like to do support the council, what Councilor Collins said in her memo about meeting the school committee's budgetary requests for the Medford public schools and meeting the library department's budgetary requests as well.

250
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: We have these two amazing resources that so many Medford families rely on.

251
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:28,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's really paramount that we keep that at the front of our bucket, our items, our priorities going into this budget.

252
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:38,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember how crucial it is to our government's responsibility that we make sure that those services are well and up and running.

253
00:38:39,704 --> 00:38:41,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, with regards to some of the ideas that

254
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:49,158
[SPEAKER_05]: that I brought up in my memo that haven't really been covered yet.

255
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:57,400
[SPEAKER_05]: A number of our projects as a city council have been going through the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

256
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And the two biggest ideas that are reaching a decent amount of progress

257
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:11,524
[SPEAKER_05]: For us to consider putting it in the budget would be the Human Rights Commission and the Youth Commission.

258
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:32,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to make sure that they operate well, to make sure that the representation on these two bodies are balanced, that we attract enough candidates of diverse experiences to serve on these commissions, and to make sure that they can carry out the day-to-day functions that we would expect

259
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:41,955
[SPEAKER_05]: a human rights commission, a youth commission to do, such as community events, reports, studies, a youth summit.

260
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:49,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I've suggested asking for $15,000 for the HRC and $20,000 for the youth commission.

261
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:54,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And these numbers come from discussions with city staff, with community leaders, and

262
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:05,328
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last two years about what our needs are and what logistically we need to get these two projects over the finish line.

263
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, some other stuff that I put in was making sure that we had a plan to update our city's financial software.

264
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:22,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Councilor Collins mentioned that in her memo as well.

265
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:26,187
[SPEAKER_05]: in more detail than I did.

266
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a thank you Councilor Hollins for that.

267
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:43,599
[SPEAKER_05]: To make sure that we have the financial and assessing staff that we need, if we're looking at the tax reforms like the residential exemption, which I know Councilors want to discuss more.

268
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we want to give ourselves that option, we need the staffing for it.

269
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:49,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that

270
00:40:50,663 --> 00:41:07,517
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the complaints I hear from city staff, too, is about how the systems, in terms of tech systems that we have at City Hall, and don't ensure that departments do what they promise to do on time.

271
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:16,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think a great example of that is oftentimes HR needs more modern resources and technologies to be able to do their job well.

272
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:20,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I put that in my memo as well.

273
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:31,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And one issue I hear a lot from residents is the need for a real plan to address our child care crisis.

274
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:44,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a financial strain on Medford families who have to organize child care and to not be able to find it and to have to go to different communities and fight with different

275
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:46,784
[SPEAKER_05]: and families from different communities on that issue.

276
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:53,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we've been making some progress on it, but we really do need to be making more progress on that.

277
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:59,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I view budget season as a time to also ask for more concrete plans for things.

278
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:07,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is a good chance for us, even if it doesn't make this budget, to ask for more concrete plans for the city administration on this issue.

279
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: My last kind of bucket of recommendations centered more about maintaining funding.

280
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:17,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So making sure that things aren't cut.

281
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So maintaining our investments in the community liaisons program and potentially expanding it to include an Asian American community liaison.

282
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was talked about last year and I think we made some progress back then and it's kind of stalled out.

283
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:39,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's one thing to raise during our budget meetings this season.

284
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:53,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to make sure that we are maintaining or improving our translation services and affordable housing trust because we know those two issues are going to be really paramount and really, really crucial in the next few years.

285
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:56,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of Medford residents

286
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:17,024
[SPEAKER_05]: worried who are worried about what's happening at the national level and how that's going to affect us, want our city to be providing the day-to-day resources and the day-to-day services that they can access, and to make sure that we are also just making progress on road prevention.

287
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:23,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last item on in my memo that hasn't been mentioned yet, but thank you all.

288
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.

289
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any more discussion?

290
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:35,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Do folks wanna talk about any of the items?

291
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to keep a list here of the things where I heard multiple Councilors raise the same items.

292
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:50,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy to go over that, but I wanna go back to other Councilors first, Vice President Collins.

293
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:53,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears.

294
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:57,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also trying to keep a list of suggestions that were made by multiple Councilors.

295
00:43:59,631 --> 00:44:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll quickly run through mine, and if yourself or other Councilors hear ones that are missing, I'd welcome to hear that.

296
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:22,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The notes I was taking, it sounds like from many of us, there was a shared priority around the citywide therapeutic inclusion recreation specialist, the office manager for Medford Recreation,

297
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:31,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Prioritizing the suggestions of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission as it pertains to both city staff and increasing infrastructure and signage.

298
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,501
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those, of course, being a rather larger spend than the other.

299
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:42,865
[SPEAKER_01]: The request from the fire department on training for a fire department dive team.

300
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:59,813
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the salary line item for a city solicitor, meeting the Medford Public Schools and Medford Public Library budgetary requests, the nexus study for affordable housing linkage, and to update the linkage fees program.

301
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:13,983
[SPEAKER_01]: and maintaining our grant-funded positions, notably the Community Liaisons Project, as well as other grant-funded positions in Outreach and Prevention, Planning, Development, Sustainability, and the Health Department.

302
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:18,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that I missed a few, and I'd welcome additions to that list.

303
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:34,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a great list, I think it's an ambitious list, and I think that these are all things and more that we absolutely should be funding this year as soon as possible because these would provide such an incredible return on investment for Medford residents.

304
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:58,515
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond the realm of what is quantifiable because of course we're talking about important educational experiences for kids in Medford, we're talking about important recreational experiences for all people in Medford, we're talking about safety improvements for all people in Medford, and we're talking about the city being better resourced to provide the type of services that Medford residents deserve and also expect from our city.

305
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:04,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be my short list for recommendations to come out of this meeting that we could push forward in additional meetings.

306
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,264
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course I'd welcome discussion, modifications and additions to this list from my fellow Councilors.

307
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:17,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

308
00:46:19,538 --> 00:46:21,059
[SPEAKER_04]: My list might've been a little bit shorter.

309
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:33,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely had the therapeutic, and I'm gonna say who specifically mentioned them mainly in their written documents, or if they spoke them out loud, it doesn't mean we don't all support these things.

310
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:44,922
[SPEAKER_04]: But I heard the therapeutic recreation specialist and office manager in the recreation department, and that was Councilors, Leming, Scarpelli, Collins, and Sang all mentioned that.

311
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,878
[SPEAKER_04]: with an estimated cost of 125,000.

312
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:59,686
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the increase in funding for DPW and engineering, including a focus on the Bicycle Commission recommendations.

313
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:14,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Councilor Scarpelli mentioned the funding for DPW staff and Councilors Lazzaro, Sang and Collins mentioned funding for the Bicycle Commission recommendations and Councilor Callahan recommended an additional staff position in the DPW.

314
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, um, five folks mentioned that.

315
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Department, um, increasing funding for the city solicitor position.

316
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:30,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Councilor Scarpelli Collins and saying Councilor Collins provided an estimate of $36,000.

317
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:42,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the fire department dive team, uh, from Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Collins also mentioned it in her, uh, comments and that's $122,900.

318
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,144
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 or 93, one of those numbers.

319
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:53,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a general, kind of two more general items.

320
00:47:53,407 --> 00:48:04,754
[SPEAKER_04]: One was maintaining funding at level service and level staff levels for the schools, the library, community liaisons, translation services, rodent prevention, and grant funded positions.

321
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was Councilor Collins and Tseng.

322
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was also

323
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: updating the city's financial software, which was Councilors Collins and saying, and then I think everything else was, um, folks, individual, um, recommendations.

324
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound right?

325
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:36,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I, did anyone advocate for something that, um, advocate for one of those things that I didn't mention your name or hear something else mentioned where there were at least two Councilors who were advocating for it?

326
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

327
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:09,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm happy to take these recommendations from this meeting and put together a document to go on the agenda for next week's meeting that's kind of a collective summary of those top six priorities.

328
00:49:10,674 --> 00:49:28,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if councilors, you know, either want to stick with the letter or document that they send in, or if they want to write something up that can go in a packet that will go to the mayor about their specific priorities, we can include that as well for next week's regular meeting and send that along to the mayor.

329
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:36,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously everyone has to vote for it, but that would be the, I think the next steps here.

330
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion?

331
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Vice President Collins.

332
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:48,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears.

333
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I don't want to, I'd be happy to make the motion, but only if there's no other discussion or ideas from the fellow councilors.

334
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:56,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that process sounds good.

335
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It closely mirrors what we did last year.

336
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:03,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel comfortable with this shortlist going forward.

337
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:07,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it represents a lot of the ideas that we've all talked about.

338
00:50:07,877 --> 00:50:14,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'd be good to have this kind of top six compiled for our next meeting and sendable to the mayor.

339
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:19,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I would request that the individual budget memos submitted by Councilors also be included in the packet.

340
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:27,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to make that in the form of a motion if there isn't any other discussion from Councilors.

341
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:29,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd second that.

342
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:30,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

343
00:50:31,706 --> 00:50:44,009
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to take these six recommendations and I will put together a memo and then we can change the wording at the regular meeting next week.

344
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone can submit any changes and thoughts around it.

345
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also if folks wanna submit or resubmit or change or amend their initial letters and submit those for the packet as well, that's acceptable.

346
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go over the six again, but I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro first.

347
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:05,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick question about the logistics of how to submit our materials.

348
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:08,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like us to email them to you?

349
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:10,017
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you like those submitted?

350
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:15,941
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to amend anything that you submitted, you can send it to the clerk and that would be great.

351
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:19,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll attach that all to the agenda item.

352
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:25,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, I'll just attach whatever you already sent.

353
00:51:29,228 --> 00:51:53,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So the six items were funding a therapeutic recreation specialist and office manager in the recreation department, increasing funding for the DPW and engineering, including around the bicycle commission priorities, increasing funding for the city solicitor, funding a fire department dive team, maintaining funding and level service and staffing,

354
00:51:55,294 --> 00:51:59,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna say that's a general principle and then I'll also list the specifics.

355
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:05,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any of us, I think we all, is it fair to say we all support that there's a level of service and staffing in every department?

356
00:52:07,747 --> 00:52:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'm seeing a thumbs up from Councilor Lazzaro.

357
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:14,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

358
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:17,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

359
00:52:21,495 --> 00:52:29,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm, like, curious if we are suggesting increases in the budget in six places and don't cut the budget anywhere.

360
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:35,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious, how do we, like, you know, how do we grok that?

361
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:43,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that doesn't add up to me unless there's, like, obviously the money from the Prop 2.5 is spoken for.

362
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:44,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

363
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:45,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

364
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:50,094
[SPEAKER_02]: for level funding, everything, and then we're asking for increases.

365
00:52:50,494 --> 00:52:52,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm trying to understand how we get to that.

366
00:52:53,677 --> 00:53:04,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think level service, just from my one perspective, you know, you can make arguments that you can provide the same services moving things around.

367
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the two and a half plus, I mean, we don't know what the revenue estimate is yet, so that's another piece of, we're starting kind of here, and then we'll hear what the budget discussions are, but I do see Vice President Collins.

368
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:20,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bearson.

369
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:24,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really good question.

370
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:30,157
[SPEAKER_01]: A question that's, you know, always on our minds and probably on the minds of residents as well as we approach budget season.

371
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:34,221
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that advocated two years ago for increased

372
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: powers of the council during budget time so that we could have a seat at the table for that kind of question exactly.

373
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:51,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have the power to make those decisions when it comes to how that reallocation process happens in the budgetary process.

374
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:58,799
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to, we don't have a seat at the table when it comes to getting in the weeds and saying this is exactly how we square that circle.

375
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:07,047
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get to the end of the budget process and we're trying to do everything that Medford residents deserve with a finite pool of money.

376
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:19,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this stage, I do think it is valuable to put on the table and to emphasize everything that we know Medford residents deserve as prioritized as much as we are able to do.

377
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:44,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through the process, through our budgetary meetings with department heads, through our back and forth with the mayor to get that better understanding of what is possible, both financially and politically this year, and give us a clearer idea of if we are in a position of having to advocate for a small set of priorities, to be empowered to say, all right, given what's on the table,

378
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,222
[SPEAKER_01]: these are our non-negotiables and try to make sure as best as we can that those happen for the good of the community.

379
00:54:52,282 --> 00:55:04,847
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a higher level question but just to reinforce that the city council doesn't, you know, I'm sure that we all would love the jurisdiction to get into the weeds and be able to talk reallocation and

380
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:08,772
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing exactly how these things play out in the line items.

381
00:55:10,013 --> 00:55:20,419
[SPEAKER_01]: For myself, I think it's valuable to start on the principles and to start saying, we know that all these things are things that we want and things that we believe the community wants.

382
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that we don't deserve anything.

383
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that residents don't deserve anything less than what they're already accustomed to.

384
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:29,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start the conversation there.

385
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:31,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the process of the budget,

386
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:32,825
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to continue to have.

387
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:34,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Discussions in public meetings.

388
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:38,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Um let's see how let's see how close we can get to making that real in budget.

389
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks I'll go to Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming.

390
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Um, just a super quick

391
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:59,663
[SPEAKER_02]: actually make the decisions about reducing line items.

392
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that when we're like we we also can't tell the mayor what to add either, you know, and and so I think this is our opportunity to do that.

393
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just say that I

394
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:23,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is something to be said for us making those thoughts known in some way.

395
00:56:23,024 --> 00:56:32,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, for folks who've been on this city council longer, if this forum is exactly the way to do that or if there are better ways to do that.

396
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:39,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do hope that keep everything the same and then add all of these other things.

397
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect that is less likely to get us any of those extra things.

398
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is our opportunity to make these kinds of requests.

399
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's my thinking.

400
00:56:52,477 --> 00:56:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

401
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:56,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

402
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

403
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

404
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:02,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't catch it the second time.

405
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:13,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Were anything related to the studies for the capital improvements project or the nexus study in the six items?

406
00:57:16,855 --> 00:57:30,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have, I had under DPW, I had a couple items around the capital plan and increasing capital spending that I was gonna try to figure out how to word.

407
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:32,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have the nexus study.

408
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:38,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say we did receive, or I received an email.

409
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:40,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we all did.

410
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:48,162
[SPEAKER_04]: about the McCormick Avenue parcels as relates to funding the NEXUS study today, earlier today.

411
00:57:48,182 --> 00:57:51,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I only had it coming from you, Matt.

412
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:58,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So I only included things that had at least two people on it, but if anyone else also mentioned the NEXUS study and I missed it, I can include that.

413
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:03,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, just a super quick question.

414
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:05,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The next study is the linkage fees related one.

415
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's linkage fees and inclusionary, but Matt, you can explain it.

416
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:18,367
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, sorry, if I may, it's a little bit complicated.

417
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:27,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So the McCormick Avenue parcels, my understanding of that, and I'd have to go back through my email to check on the status of it.

418
00:58:28,392 --> 00:58:30,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't check it fully today.

419
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: But the McCormick Avenue one, my understanding is that that would fund the one for the affordable housing bucket.

420
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:44,124
[SPEAKER_06]: only, and that would probably be around like $80,000.

421
00:58:45,464 --> 00:59:08,550
[SPEAKER_06]: But in order to update all of the linkage buckets, the four that we have, as well as the new affordable housing trust, one that would cost around $150,000, which would have to come from free cash, and that wouldn't be under the DPW, that would probably be that would

422
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, probably be under planning.

423
00:59:11,118 --> 00:59:18,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm also again, not sure if this would be like a line item on the budget because this would be a 1 time thing, but I.

424
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:23,463
[SPEAKER_06]: would personally like to see it included on this list.

425
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: One, just because it prioritizes that in the mayor's eyes.

426
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:35,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, because this is something where it's definitely an investment.

427
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:36,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's $150,000 that once it's

428
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:59,281
[SPEAKER_06]: like once the studies are done and linkage fees are updated, that would end up bringing in a lot more money every year from developers, especially once the zoning is all done with, and they just have a lot more, there's like, they have a lot more options for building.

429
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do think it's important to get that done.

430
01:00:05,224 --> 01:00:05,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Council Member.

431
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:06,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to Councilor Callahan.

432
01:00:08,284 --> 01:00:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to add my support for the solicitor, which is already on there.

433
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:15,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And also this study for the linkage fees, even though it's one time, I would love to see it added.

434
01:00:15,688 --> 01:00:15,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

435
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt, just so I'm understanding it here, and it sounds like I was understanding it wrong.

436
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:30,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had to do one study that was going to help us price out affordable housing, like inclusionary zoning.

437
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:43,754
[SPEAKER_04]: link all the linkage fees and maybe even TDM, but it sounds like those are three separate studies or at least no, I'm kind of Yeah, it's I've had a lot of discussions with planning about this.

438
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:53,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I could, you know, I could talk with you a bit about this, but TDM is something that is

439
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:59,056
[SPEAKER_06]: something that probably would have to be its own study at a certain point.

440
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:10,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really just trying to, you know, push for that as hard as I can during, like, just to be included in the ordinances during the planning, during the planning and permitting committee processes.

441
01:01:11,025 --> 01:01:14,668
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, just to kind of, just to kind of

442
01:01:15,348 --> 01:01:16,569
[SPEAKER_06]: prioritize some things.

443
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:21,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really only pushing for those at this point, but I do want to see what comes up with that.

444
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:27,935
[SPEAKER_06]: But my understanding is that TDMs previously have been like their own transportation specific studies in other communities.

445
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:36,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it was explained to me by the planning department was that they

446
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:45,051
[SPEAKER_06]: are really trying, they're really trying to prioritize just the affordable housing nexus study just to get that revenue stream in.

447
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:52,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And they know that it's only an $80,000 study in order.

448
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:56,483
[SPEAKER_06]: They know that it's only an $80,000 study.

449
01:01:57,223 --> 01:01:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they're kind of making that lower ask.

450
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:15,112
[SPEAKER_06]: But in order to update all of the linkage buckets, including the HT, they said that that would require a different sort of study, which would cost probably around $150,000, and they probably wouldn't like use that.

451
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:25,820
[SPEAKER_06]: money immediately because there are some complications with updating the other linkage buckets.

452
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:40,013
[SPEAKER_06]: But at this point, I am comfortable just making that ask so that if later in the year, you know, they do think it's beneficial to try to conduct a study to update all the linkage buckets, then they would

453
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: they would be able to.

454
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:53,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a little bit complicated, but I would, at the very least, like to emphasize the importance of just getting all of those linkage fees updated as soon as possible once the zoning is done.

455
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:55,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

456
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

457
01:02:57,138 --> 01:03:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like maybe we need to get all of the heads in a meeting at some point.

458
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put this in, Councilor Callahan put their name behind it.

459
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:15,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But also it sounds like we need to get all the heads in the room around the specific studies.

460
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:20,156
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to update these specific buckets and make sure that we fund all of them.

461
01:03:21,296 --> 01:03:25,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be great to use, to do that as soon as possible.

462
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:28,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll put that in and I'll wordsmith that.

463
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything, so I had the maintaining the level service.

464
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:45,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And the specific list was for the schools, library, community liaisons, translation services, road and control, and grant funded positions in the planning and health departments.

465
01:03:46,028 --> 01:03:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had updates to the city's financial software that that should be a priority.

466
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I've added in the nexus study for the linkage, all the linkage fee categories.

467
01:03:57,091 --> 01:04:00,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just including affordable housing and inclusionary zoning in there as well.

468
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:05,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there, so those are the seven and we had a vice president Collins motion.

469
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:09,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to put one other thing out there.

470
01:04:09,048 --> 01:04:10,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I didn't submit a memo.

471
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:28,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we discussed and I believe we passed a B paper about the need for funding for the residential exemption.

472
01:04:29,813 --> 01:04:41,724
[SPEAKER_04]: and that that needed to be funded at budget time in order for the assessing department to have the capacity to move us towards having a residential exemption.

473
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe we voted seven to zero to try to do that this year.

474
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:51,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

475
01:04:52,863 --> 01:05:08,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a, you know, the budget is a piece of that, a big piece of that project, getting a residential exemption, getting the city in a position where if the council were to vote for a residential exemption in December, there's enough capacity to actually implement that.

476
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:15,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and that's basically been what the justification has been the whole time is if we don't have that

477
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:17,838
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done the prep work, so we can't vote it.

478
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:25,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we voted, I think it was Councilor Scarpelli's B paper around, we need that, we wanna do that this year.

479
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Collins.

480
01:05:32,314 --> 01:05:34,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears, for bringing that up.

481
01:05:35,236 --> 01:05:36,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you raised that.

482
01:05:37,038 --> 01:05:41,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't thinking about that when I was putting together my memo, but I'd be happy to put that forward at this time.

483
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we all want to be in a position where if we do take a vote and approve a residential exemption this year, we want to be able to implement it.

484
01:05:49,328 --> 01:05:54,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interim assessor made it very clear that he would need increased capacity in his department.

485
01:05:55,553 --> 01:06:01,016
[SPEAKER_01]: starting early in the fiscal year to be able to do that so that residents could see the effects of it.

486
01:06:01,216 --> 01:06:12,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be happy to forward that at this time to also include that as a funded priority increased capacity for the assessor's department so that they'd be able to implement a residential exemption if one is approved.

487
01:06:12,163 --> 01:06:18,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that dovetails with some other notes that were raised by some of my fellow Councilors around capacity for the assessor's department.

488
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:19,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

489
01:06:21,538 --> 01:06:23,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, Councilor Scarpelli.

490
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President for bringing this forward.

491
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:29,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this was an initiative that we looked at our most vulnerable.

492
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:37,421
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at that as being one of the avenues that we can use to support our seniors.

493
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:44,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I would second that as one of our very important issues that we all supported.

494
01:06:44,622 --> 01:06:45,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

495
01:06:45,622 --> 01:06:46,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing that forward.

496
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:49,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

497
01:06:49,863 --> 01:06:50,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

498
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I will happily third that with my support, thank you.

499
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:57,773
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I will include that as well.

500
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:04,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Ted mentioned, sorry, go ahead.

501
01:07:05,238 --> 01:07:06,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's seven items.

502
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this will be the eighth item.

503
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Ted mentioned two staff positions, so I will work around that initial discussion as I work up this memo for next week.

504
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,643
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, any further discussions?

505
01:07:29,864 --> 01:07:40,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none on the motion of vice president Collins a seconded by Councilor Tseng Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

506
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And not coughing.

507
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:42,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

508
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:45,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan, vice president Collins.

509
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

510
01:07:46,991 --> 01:07:49,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

511
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:49,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

512
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:51,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

513
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:51,908

520
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:23,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Mr. President, if I can just, I know that tomorrow I don't know what Councilors were invited, but I know that there's a five o'clock zoom with the parent organization dealing with the, um, next steps for the inclusionary specialist.

521
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:25,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, I believe our meetings at six now.

522
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:28,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I was first, I thought it was when I was away.

523
01:08:29,321 --> 01:08:33,085
