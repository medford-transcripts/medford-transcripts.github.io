[SPEAKER_08]: MASC Delegate Assembly Report.

40
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:15,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

41
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:20,307
[SPEAKER_13]: On Wednesday, November 2nd, I had the opportunity to attend the Mass.

42
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Association School Committee Delegate

43
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:23,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Assembly in Hyannis.

44
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:27,070
[SPEAKER_13]: The meeting began at 3.15 in the Ballroom in the Conference Center.

45
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:37,475
[SPEAKER_13]: There were representatives from school committees across the state in attendance to review and take action on the four items brought forward for the 2016 MASC Resolutions Committee.

46
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:41,617
[SPEAKER_13]: The Delegate Assembly overwhelmingly supported each resolution.

47
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,619
[SPEAKER_13]: As your delegated, I voted in the affirmative on each item.

48
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:52,143
[SPEAKER_13]: As directed by my fellow members in the school committee, I and several other delegates from communities across the state emphasize the importance

49
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:59,257
[SPEAKER_13]: of ensuring the funding of the foundation budget, Resolution 1, be sufficient to cover all communities.

50
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,257
[SPEAKER_13]: The key words were equitable and adequate.

51
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:06,519
[SPEAKER_13]: It was recognition that all communities must benefit from any increased funding of the foundation budget.

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,240
[SPEAKER_13]: This is especially true since funding must come through the legislature back to our cities and towns.

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,862
[SPEAKER_13]: If communities are left out, then there won't be enough votes on the floor of the House or the Senate, and there won't be an appropriation that we can live with.

54
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Resolution two dealt with tax reform.

55
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:26,270
[SPEAKER_13]: This was seen as an important way to fund the foundation budget.

56
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:34,334
[SPEAKER_13]: There was great support for charter school reform, also a lot of anticipation for the ballot question and the charter cap lift was expressed.

57
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:38,977
[SPEAKER_13]: The resolution on social and emotional well-being of students was heartily endorsed.

58
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,038
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the main theme of the conference.

59
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:44,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish to thank you for the opportunity to serve as your delegate.

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,762
[SPEAKER_13]: It is important that Medford have a voice in MASC decisions.

61
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. Skerry.

62
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:50,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

63
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:50,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

64
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:58,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file this report?

65
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved by Mrs. Van der Kloot, seconded by Ms.

66
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:01,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

67
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:02,864
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

68
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:04,204
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

69
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

70
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:06,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

71
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

72
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:10,226
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to thank my colleague for attending and voting for us.

73
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:13,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I also attended and we had the opportunity to talk down there.

74
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:21,468
[SPEAKER_17]: And as usual, it was, you know, interesting to hear people's discussion about the various different resolutions.

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,248
[SPEAKER_17]: So thanks, Bob.

76
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:23,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

77
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:23,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

78
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of committees.

79
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,630
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

80
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Community participation.

81
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:34,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone that wishes to speak?

82
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:35,292
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

83
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of superintendent.

84
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:38,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on project 351.

85
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

86
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:45,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this project has been going on for a number of years.

87
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:51,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year, once again, the governor's office and through its project 351

88
00:03:52,432 --> 00:04:02,376
[SPEAKER_10]: is sponsoring student ambassadors from our middle schools to attend a project activity on Martin Luther King Day and then do a year of community service.

89
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:11,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to call on our two principals, Paul DeLaver and Jake Edwards, if he's here, to introduce these students and talk a little bit about the program.

90
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeLaver.

91
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everyone.

92
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,606
[SPEAKER_15]: My student is in route.

93
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:25,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I was hoping that maybe I could postpone my speech until he arrives.

94
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,690
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's okay.

95
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:29,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

96
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:30,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

97
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table seconded by Ms.

98
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

99
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:33,433
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

100
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,134
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

101
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:36,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

102
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve service learning trip to Dominican Republic.

103
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

104
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:53,492
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have representatives from the company that runs the trip and our deputy superintendent is prepared to answer any questions you may have.

105
00:04:54,312 --> 00:05:03,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember last year we had a trip to Ecuador and we then had a trip to Washington and we had some things we have to do, but we've worked on making sure that these things are in place.

106
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So let them present and then you can ask any questions you might have.

107
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:07,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly.

108
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:17,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So this evening we have Tori, who was one of our, Tori Glasser was one of our guidance Councilors, and Courtney from EF, which is the company that's sponsoring the trip.

109
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:23,769
[SPEAKER_11]: This trip, as the superintendent said, we had a similar, or Tori ran a similar trip two years ago, was very successful.

110
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting that some of the siblings of those students who went on the trip two years ago want to go on this trip.

111
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:34,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So Tori put together the report, giving you the details of the trip.

112
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Courtney's here to answer any questions on the company side.

113
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:43,253
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have any questions about it, we'd be more than glad to take them for you.

114
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:44,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Skerry.

115
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Mayor, I'd like to thank Ms.

116
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Glasser for her efforts on behalf of our students.

117
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:57,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we all know, there was a slight problem the last time a group trip was planned in Washington due to national security.

118
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:02,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to make sure that all the students know that they do have to buy insurance.

119
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just wondering if through you,

120
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:10,076
[SPEAKER_13]: So you've met a mayor to the representative of the company, what the cost of that, uh, trip insurance is.

121
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:11,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was $155.

122
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:15,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it was outlined for them.

123
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, it was mandatory for every student.

124
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's part of the total.

125
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,499
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure they know upfront that they,

126
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,623
[SPEAKER_13]: they do have to purchase insurance just in case.

127
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:24,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

128
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And I outlined that.

129
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:25,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

130
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:26,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

131
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:34,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Tori's also communicated with the parents several times, so it's crystal clear as to what the, you know, liability is and all of that.

132
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:41,519
[SPEAKER_13]: So we wanted to make sure that they wanted to make sure that everything was, I didn't want to take them out of the country without them getting the insurance.

133
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't an option for me.

134
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:43,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

135
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:43,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

136
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:44,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

137
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:45,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss Cugno.

138
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:46,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

139
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:47,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

140
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,968
[SPEAKER_03]: The trip was very successful a couple of years ago.

141
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard a lot from the students that participated.

142
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:54,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really nice to hear.

143
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe just a point of interest is that when we spoke about the trips, especially outside of the country, or even within the country, I believe we had, as a school committee, had said that one of the mandatory things was to have insurance.

144
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:11,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

145
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:19,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the question is at what point, to what point do the kids get a refund if anything does happen?

146
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the insurance kick into that or do you work with the insurance company to do that?

147
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It all depends on the reason behind the cancellation.

148
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:33,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So our insurance, the $155, covers tour cancellation for medical reasons.

149
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:38,260
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, if they were hospitalized and they received documentation that they couldn't travel.

150
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It also covers things such as if their parents were deployed or loses their employment.

151
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:52,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as they're able to provide the documents that go in line with the insurance policy, then they will receive a refund within six weeks of their cancellation.

152
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:53,445
[SPEAKER_03]: A full refund?

153
00:07:54,105 --> 00:08:06,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Minus the $95 initial deposit and the amount that they pay for the insurance as long as they're canceling the reasons underneath the insurance policy okay, and what about if there is a situation like unfortunately there was a situation because of

154
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: of safety reasons basically, that was the bottom line.

155
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that would be covered?

156
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:12,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

157
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:25,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We have something called our peace of mind policy and it's actually a free policy on everybody's account and it basically states that if there's something going on in the world and you don't feel comfortable and confident with your decision to travel, you work with EF to come up with other arrangements.

158
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're able to

159
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:32,712
[SPEAKER_06]: tweak an itinerary to avoid a certain city, we're able to push back travel dates or change your destination altogether.

160
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:37,515
[SPEAKER_06]: This obviously was something that really came into effect with things that happened over the last year.

161
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:43,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We've worked with every single school district on an individual basis to figure out what would be best for their group.

162
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Some groups kept their plans as is.

163
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Others decided to make those tweaks as needed.

164
00:08:50,492 --> 00:09:04,585
[SPEAKER_03]: If you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?

165
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't do refunds.

166
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,208
[SPEAKER_06]: What we did was future travel vouchers.

167
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the schools did in that case is they were able to sell those to those individual students for future travel years.

168
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,116
[SPEAKER_03]: What about if we have a senior?

169
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a future travel plan, like a voucher, so that they would be able to utilize it for the underclassmen.

170
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:35,972
[SPEAKER_06]: When changes are happening last minute, you know, one main part of EF is that we want to make educational travel affordable and accessible to as many students as possible.

171
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:42,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really encourage planning early so that we can secure the best prices and pass those directly on to the students.

172
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:48,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the event that there's cancellations last minute, we work really closely with the airlines to be able to provide an option.

173
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, you know, giving a full refund,

174
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,883
[SPEAKER_06]: for a variety of different reasons is not an option.

175
00:09:53,923 --> 00:10:05,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been able to secure these future travel vouchers, which has made school districts that we work with across not only Massachusetts, but the United States as a whole, happy in that sense.

176
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, thank you.

177
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:07,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

178
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just looking.

179
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a price?

180
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

181
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I not see it?

182
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:16,663
[SPEAKER_05]: The back, total ship cost.

183
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:28,565
[SPEAKER_05]: 2880.

184
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:28,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That's including the deposit and the insurance.

185
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I apologize.

186
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,987
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

187
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:33,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

188
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an idea of how many students will be participating?

189
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 20 registered students.

190
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:45,030
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and did you open that up to the vocational and Curtis tough students as well?

191
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:50,012
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, 20 students and you'll have enough chaperones, I'm assuming.

192
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:50,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

193
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:51,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

194
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And what grade levels?

195
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:55,930
[SPEAKER_05]: They are grades 10 through 12.

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was open to anyone at the high school last year.

197
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninth graders who are now 10th graders signed up.

198
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:08,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So some parents did have questions about middle schoolers coming, but we just kept it at the high school, so they're in grades 10 through 12.

199
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:13,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think those are two different groups of different abilities.

200
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

201
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:17,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was most comfortable with students being in the grades.

202
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

203
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

204
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:21,063
[SPEAKER_12]: This cuts.

205
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:21,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

206
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:22,825
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

207
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it sounds like a great trip.

208
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:34,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to know I was looking on the website and some of the questions it said, you know, were to make sure, you know, where the embassy is, where the hospital is.

209
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,917
[SPEAKER_12]: So do you know and are you close to these?

210
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:43,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So with all of our programs, we have a full-time EF field director that's with the group 24-7.

211
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:47,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only are they with them while they're on the program, but they're locals of the area.

212
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:57,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And so whenever we are contracting out these NGOs and international charities that we partner with, we make sure that they're in close proximity to the nearest hospitals and clinics.

213
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:06,053
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one other item I read, and I don't know if this is true, but it said that if somebody was going to be hospitalized,

214
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,342
[SPEAKER_12]: The hospital would only take cash and it might cost up to $100,000.

215
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:17,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that the insurance that you're getting is only up to $35,000.

216
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:18,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wasn't sure.

217
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:22,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know, like I said, this is the internet.

218
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:32,038
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just Googling information on how safe is traveling to the Dominican Republic and just different types of things you could click on.

219
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:39,717
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I wasn't sure if there was any factual information about that.

220
00:12:41,180 --> 00:13:04,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have, what we can do is submit the entire policy for the medical side of things, if that's what you're, I'm not sure what you cited, so I wouldn't be able to speak to that specifically, but we partnered with one company for our global travel protection plan, and we've been using them, as a company, we've been in business for 50 years, and we've been using them exclusively, and so they're usually handling our student groups.

221
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,767
[SPEAKER_06]: We also, being a large global company,

222
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:12,252
[SPEAKER_06]: in the event that something like that did come up, we are there as well.

223
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:15,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, we could never expect for a student to pay $100,000 out of pocket.

224
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:21,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I didn't know if, like, the hospitals only accepted cash and, you know, there wasn't that available.

225
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:26,684
[SPEAKER_06]: There's situations, you know, in the event that that came up, that's why we're there on the ground.

226
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:40,753
[SPEAKER_06]: We would never put, you know, a student in a situation where they would, you know, in the event that they needed medical attention, the question would never be, do you take credit card or cash and say, you see this student and we'll handle all of that on our end.

227
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:47,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Ecuador, I did have two students that had to go to a clinic and they didn't, no money came out of their pockets.

228
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:51,020
[SPEAKER_08]: It was covered as a part of the fund.

229
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:51,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

230
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:52,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

231
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:53,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

232
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:54,545
[SPEAKER_17]: First, Ms.

233
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Glasser, thank you for organizing this and working with our students.

234
00:13:58,168 --> 00:13:59,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have a couple questions.

235
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm curious whether it's a private charter airline or a regular airline?

236
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:05,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular.

237
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:06,795
[SPEAKER_06]: We use all the major airlines.

238
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:08,116
[SPEAKER_17]: All the major ones.

239
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:12,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the Zika virus an issue in the Dominican Republic?

240
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:18,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, there's a travel alert for Zika in all the Central and South America.

241
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:26,772
[SPEAKER_06]: What we do do is, in the event that that moves to a warning, we would throw in our peace of mind policy, which would allow you to make those changes.

242
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:36,936
[SPEAKER_06]: What we've learned from following the CDC very carefully, there's no advisory about not traveling to the Dominican Republic or to Central America unless you are pregnant.

243
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:44,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in that case, they say to speak with your health care provider, and take extra precautions around where and when.

244
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no advisory telling US citizens not to travel to these countries.

245
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,945
[SPEAKER_17]: My last question is, I'm just curious.

246
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:55,867
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like you're going to be staying in the Central Mountain region at some point.

247
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Where are you staying?

248
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,510
[SPEAKER_17]: What sort of accommodations are the kids in?

249
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:00,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

250
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, if you wouldn't mind, I can grab.

251
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:03,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought some sample hotels.

252
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you just quickly some of the things that we look for when we're contracting hotels.

253
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, safety and security.

254
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:15,148
[SPEAKER_06]: That really is in the forefront of our mind with all of our programs.

255
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they willing to take student groups?

256
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they room three to four students per room, private rooms with private bathrooms?

257
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:37,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally went on this program two years ago with a team of educators and administrators from across Massachusetts, and I can tell you I stayed in all the same hotels that your groups will be staying in, and they really are wonderful hotels for students.

258
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:47,457
[SPEAKER_06]: We make sure that they are obviously, as I mentioned before, in a safe area, and in an area where kids will have something to do after they come back from their service.

259
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:56,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll have a common room where they'll be able to do their reflection, or some of the hotels may have a pool that they can enjoy after hours.

260
00:15:56,284 --> 00:16:00,228
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me just grab the sample hotels, and I can pass those around so that you can see.

261
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:00,428
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

262
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:08,315
[SPEAKER_17]: As you're doing that, I'll just mention that I also went on a service trip to the Dominican Republic about five, six years ago, and it was an incredible experience.

263
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:23,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what, to give Massachusetts as a whole kind of a little shout out is the reason why we created these service learning programs was really because of educators and administrators having the need and want for programs that would provide students with skills.

264
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,480
[SPEAKER_06]: service, and also leadership development.

265
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:37,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So EF as a whole, you know, we've been in business for 50 years now, and it was about 10 years ago that we put together a administrator roundtable focus group and said, what should we be thinking about as a company?

266
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:38,123
[SPEAKER_06]: What should be next?

267
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:42,304
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we offer to help you prepare your students to be global citizens of the world?

268
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And what came out of that meeting was service learning.

269
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:51,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now we have not only service learning in the Dominican Republic, but in seven other countries.

270
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:53,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all in different types of service buckets.

271
00:16:54,387 --> 00:17:13,006
[SPEAKER_06]: educationally focused service learning, environmental and community development, where students can receive five hours up to 25 hours of service, which if your school has that built into your graduation requirement, they will receive a certificate after they get back outlining those hours of service that they received while on one of these programs.

272
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe there's a motion.

273
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,292
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll second the motion.

274
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

275
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:24,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Cugno.

276
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go back to the safety part of it.

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that there's a chaperone that comes from the area.

278
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:34,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they, he, she,

279
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:36,548
[SPEAKER_03]: stay at the hotel?

280
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:37,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

281
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:45,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are with our field directors are local of the area and they are with the group 24 seven from the second they land at the airport to the second they go back to the airport to head back home.

282
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, we have the, obviously the leadership chaperone team here, but in addition you have this local expert who's with the group the entire time.

283
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

284
00:17:54,076 --> 00:18:03,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great because they're able to provide the local knowledge and insider perspective to all things related, not only to service learning in the Dominican Republic, but the Dominican Republic as a whole.

285
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

286
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:09,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the peace of mind, um, add the portion of that.

287
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an extra coverage by any chance monetary coverage on that as far as like

288
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: As my colleague was saying, if God forbid, someone has to go to the hospital.

289
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:20,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if there's extra coverage on that?

290
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:24,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So our peace of mind policy is different than our global travel protection plan.

291
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have a lot of different things that we throw out there.

292
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:38,538
[SPEAKER_06]: But our peace of mind policy is a free policy, basically, on everybody's account, basically saying, if there's something going on in the world and you don't feel comfortable and confident with your decision to travel, we'll work with you to tweak the arrangements.

293
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Our global travel protection plan

294
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,641
[SPEAKER_06]: is more or less our travel insurance.

295
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:48,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the medical and accidental, the baggage and property, tour cancellation and interruption, and flight delay.

296
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:56,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the 155 that all the students from Medford, actually, they have that already built into their program.

297
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:04,529
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group that went out for an educational piece of it.

298
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:08,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more a group of students after they graduated high school.

299
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: that did go down to have a nice time before college.

300
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:21,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital.

301
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that.

302
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always making sure that there's extra coverage and make sure that there is the insurance that's part of it.

303
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:37,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But knowing that there's actually a chaperone that's part of the local part of it, that's a huge part.

304
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:45,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unfortunately with that particular group, there was no one from the agency that they had used or the group that they had used.

305
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:46,959
[SPEAKER_03]: that was actually down there.

306
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a great piece to this.

307
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:59,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's why we continue to see schools partner with EF is obviously we pride ourselves on being able to offer the lowest prices in the industry, but that's not why people continue to travel with us.

308
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:01,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is our safety and security behind our programs.

309
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:04,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a giant worldwide network.

310
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:08,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We have over 500 schools and offices with over 40,000 staff worldwide.

311
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:18,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So no matter where we're sending students on programs, not only will they have that one tour director, but we have a local office of people there able to help in the event that something comes up.

312
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:19,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

313
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:44,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So just one really nice thing, our tour director in Ecuador, she was with us the whole entire time, and she also knew the needs of the community, so at the end of the trip she asked the students, they all get EF backpacks, and she said, if there's anything you don't want to take back, you don't want to keep this backpack, if you have extra clothes you brought that you're not going to use, and a lot of the kids donated some of the things they brought with them, and they're like, yeah, I don't need this, let me donate this, let me make some more room for souvenirs, so they got to give back in another way to the community.

314
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:45,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

315
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:51,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, all the students will receive an EF backpack and whether they choose, that's a great idea actually about donating it.

316
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:57,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've been with EF for 10 years now and I'm a product of traveling abroad at a young age.

317
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:03,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the opportunity to travel to Australia and New Zealand when I was in high school and it really formed me and molded me into who I am.

318
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:19,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think allowing this program is obviously wonderful, but I do want to just highlight, as I said before, I did travel down to the Dominican Republic two years ago, and I was so inspired, and this has never happened in my ten years, that I tried to get a student group organized in my own community to go down to the Dominican Republic.

319
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:27,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was just what I saw and what I experienced and what I felt after I left just made me want to do more and be a better person.

320
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know, I'm really excited to see your students go, but also encourage them to come back and share with the school committee, as it seems like they did with Ecuador, to make you all part of this, because you're all, you know, doing your part in helping them see the world and become better global citizens.

321
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:44,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

322
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:44,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

323
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,663
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor for approval.

324
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

325
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:48,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Scurry.

326
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

327
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,501
[SPEAKER_08]: To approve the service learning trip to Dominican Republic.

328
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:01,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

329
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:03,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

330
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:12,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for suspension of the rules to report back on item one, report on, I'm sorry, report on project 351.

331
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everyone.

332
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:25,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

333
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:26,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for having me back.

334
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:36,698
[SPEAKER_15]: As you know, Project 351 is a community service project where representatives from the middle school meet with the 351 districts.

335
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,945
[SPEAKER_15]: It's done over the Martha Luther King weekend as well, and they develop a service project

336
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:46,103
[SPEAKER_15]: that comes back to the community.

337
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:59,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And the process in picking an ambassador is opening it up to the school, getting teacher recommendations, and I'd like to introduce Marvin Michelle, who is going to be representing the Andrews Middle School this year for Project 351.

338
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:06,428
[SPEAKER_15]: I just briefly want to read off what's said about Marvin, and you can definitely ask him any questions that you'd like.

339
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:12,710
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great pleasure to announce that the Andrews had nominated Marvin Michelle to serve as our ambassador for Project 351.

340
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Marvin has been enrolled in the Andrews since the fall of 2013.

341
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:25,546
[SPEAKER_15]: He distinguished himself immediately as a person who was most filled with passion, enthusiasm, and excitement being a student at the Andrews Middle School.

342
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Our initial impression of him did not abate as the years progressed.

343
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:38,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Marvin has earned great respect from the faculty by being critically open-minded about expanding the parameters of the overall operation of school.

344
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:47,034
[SPEAKER_15]: He has a quality that makes him motivated and motivates others, and his dedication and accountability do not sway either way.

345
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,818
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been actively engaged in the community activities in which he's been involved in outreach and organizing.

346
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:57,841
[SPEAKER_15]: These activities have allowed him to demonstrate and refine skills that will benefit any community.

347
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:01,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Marvin is an optimistic person who finds solutions in times of crisis.

348
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:03,825
[SPEAKER_15]: His fellow students look for him for advice.

349
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:05,855
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's also fun to be around.

350
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:09,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Work gets done, but at the same time, new avenues of thinking are opened.

351
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:14,198
[SPEAKER_15]: He pursues the goals of his groups with passions without letting his own needs or interests get in the way.

352
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:20,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Marvin is an exceptional person who has earned the school recognition for commitment to others and his service to the community.

353
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:29,424
[SPEAKER_15]: His cooperative spirit, his compassion for the well-being of all, and his flexible style make him an outstanding person who is destined for significant accomplishments.

354
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,985
[SPEAKER_15]: And everything that

355
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:35,853
[SPEAKER_15]: said is definitely true about this gentleman that is next to me.

356
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:39,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm honored to have him represent the Andrews for Project 351.

357
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:42,598
[SPEAKER_15]: And ask him anything you'd like.

358
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:44,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, Marvin.

359
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful job.

360
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:51,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also want to congratulate Josephine Rizzo, who was selected from the McGlynn Middle School as well.

361
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:53,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But would you guys like a picture?

362
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I take a picture of you two?

363
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:54,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

364
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that OK, Marvin?

365
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:55,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

366
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:56,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Get close.

367
00:24:57,635 --> 00:24:58,095
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

368
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:58,776
[SPEAKER_16]: This is great.

369
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you tweet it, and then I can retweet it, and then we'll be good.

370
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:03,000
[SPEAKER_08]: We got it.

371
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So Marvin, you make sure you come back and tell us all about it.

372
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:10,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

373
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:10,567
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

374
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:14,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a report on your experience, and we'll see you on MLK Day.

375
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:16,133
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be speaking on that day as well?

376
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

377
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:17,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

378
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:18,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

379
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Cugno.

380
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:26,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had the pleasure of participating in that day a few years back and it was just a wonderful, wonderful day.

381
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:35,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for you to come back and tell us all about it because it's probably something that you're not expecting because it wasn't what I was expecting of that day.

382
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:41,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see the amount of students that are there and to see the students that represent not only us,

383
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:47,042
[SPEAKER_03]: but really cities and towns across the state of Massachusetts and to work together for such a wonderful cause.

384
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very proud of you and for the other student, Josephine, but really looking forward for you to come back and share what you did that day with us.

385
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

386
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

387
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

388
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive and place on file this report.

389
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:09,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

390
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:09,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

391
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:10,481
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

392
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:11,662
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

393
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:12,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

394
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on Veterans Day program.

395
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:24,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Director of Humanities, Dr. Piazza, and the Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccardoli, to tell us about Veterans Day.

396
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:33,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

397
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:34,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

398
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:43,285
[SPEAKER_01]: To commemorate Veterans Day, the Humanities Department and the Office of the Veterans Services worked collaboratively together to sponsor the Veterans Speaker Program.

399
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:50,731
[SPEAKER_01]: In its 16th year, the program provides all of our high school students with the opportunity to interact with veterans.

400
00:26:51,291 --> 00:27:01,900
[SPEAKER_01]: The veterans visit the classrooms to discuss their combat and non-combat experiences, and the program is enormously rewarding for the faculty, the veterans, and the students.

401
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,066
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, our Veterans Day speaking program took place on Thursday, November 10th.

402
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:14,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It was co-coordinated by Director of Veterans Services, Ernest Lindsey, myself, and our lead social studies teacher, Nicholas Kane.

403
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:19,496
[SPEAKER_01]: The day began at 7.30 in the morning in the superintendent's conference room.

404
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:30,345
[SPEAKER_01]: We had donuts and coffee that was generously donated by Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford, and then we had sandwiches and various salads for the veterans provided by food services.

405
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:40,320
[SPEAKER_01]: As a special touch this year, we had Noah Kreatz, a junior student at the Medford Vocational Technical School, organize his exhibit of war memorabilia.

406
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:48,924
[SPEAKER_01]: He had helmets, uniforms, and newspapers with headlines of World War I and World War II, and the veterans very much enjoyed seeing this.

407
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very special touch to our program.

408
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:56,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the day, we had 16 veterans this year visit over 45 classrooms.

409
00:27:57,187 --> 00:28:00,589
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to discuss their time within

410
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:07,848
[SPEAKER_01]: their combat and non-combat experiences, and it was a wonderful experience for the students.

411
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:13,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of our veterans are graduates of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical School.

412
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:21,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them have come for years, and they selflessly donate their day off from work often, and we're very grateful to them for that.

413
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:29,419
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's program really provided students with an authentic experience for the opportunity to learn more about what they're studying in school.

414
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:41,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I failed to mention that Mayor Burke and school committee crets were able to come and see some of the presentations.

415
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:46,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to watch many of the presentations this year, too, and it was very touching and very moving, so it was a great day.

416
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:53,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to sit in on acting Sergeant Charlie Huntnett of the Medford Police Department's presentation, and he did a fabulous job.

417
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,383
[SPEAKER_08]: The kids were engaged, and he had a slideshow, a PowerPoint going on.

418
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very interesting and a lot of good questions from the students.

419
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:04,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Miss Kreatz.

420
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thank you.

421
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, thank you everybody for the program.

422
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:09,624
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, it was a great program.

423
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:10,244
[SPEAKER_12]: I enjoyed it.

424
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:15,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, Noah just wanted to say he really enjoyed it and looks forward to doing next year's program.

425
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

426
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:16,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

427
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,310
[SPEAKER_12]: We want him back.

428
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:31,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, Mr. Benedetto, um, for you, Madam, um, Bamberg to the superintendent, um, Mr. Belson, can we send a letter to all the veterans and, um,

429
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,441
[SPEAKER_07]: with our appreciation.

430
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:42,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

431
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,366
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already gone out.

432
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:44,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe last.

433
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:44,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.

434
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:52,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And the classes write the thank you notes, which is even more special to the veterans because they kind of in those 56 minutes, they really

435
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:54,699
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a nice rapport with the students.

436
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:57,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the students enjoy writing it as well.

437
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So, absolutely, we do do that.

438
00:29:58,782 --> 00:29:59,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

439
00:29:59,142 --> 00:29:59,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

440
00:29:59,422 --> 00:29:59,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

441
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:06,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman who stormed the beach at Normandy this Veterans Day.

442
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:06,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

443
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:10,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And boy, it's amazing some of the stories that these people have.

444
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:16,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very grateful for the years of service, and I'm very grateful that they share their experiences with our children.

445
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:22,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you please tell Mr. Kane how happy we are that he and you run Ann Bernadette?

446
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:24,763
[SPEAKER_07]: run such a great program for our students.

447
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:25,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

448
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:28,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ernest Lindsay, he did a fabulous job as well.

449
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll send along the thank yous.

450
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:38,149
[SPEAKER_07]: That interactive learning and learning across age is really something that students remember forever.

451
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: It was wonderful.

452
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,011
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great day, as it always is.

453
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:41,971
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was wonderful.

454
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:42,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

455
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:43,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for your work on this.

456
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:44,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

457
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:44,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

458
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:45,413
[SPEAKER_17]: van de Kloot.

459
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I was just thinking, I remember Charlie when he was in high school.

460
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:59,149
[SPEAKER_17]: and I remember him at the pep rally, and it's so nice to have seen how he's grown and matured and now is giving back to our community in so many ways.

461
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,651
[SPEAKER_17]: There's something very special about it.

462
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:13,003
[SPEAKER_17]: I also just want to mention that while I was not able to attend, I know about Noah's interest in World War II memorabilia, and it's truly phenomenal, and so I'm really appreciative to him

463
00:31:13,923 --> 00:31:22,207
[SPEAKER_17]: son of school committee member Kathy Kreatz that he is sharing that with people and I just think that's fantastic.

464
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:29,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very powerful as the veterans were coming out to actually see the memorabilia and just to watch their eyes and see the reaction.

465
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:34,073
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very special touch to the day which is always a great day.

466
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

467
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:36,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

468
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:36,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

469
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:38,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Promotion by Ms.

470
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot to receive and place on file this paper.

471
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:41,754
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

472
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,235
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

473
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:44,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

474
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:47,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve reasonable use policy.

475
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:48,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

476
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:49,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember members of the committee.

477
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:58,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the advance of technology requires that we improve our policy with regard to use of technology.

478
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:01,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the current policy is attached to the cover page.

479
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:02,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the acceptable use.

480
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:10,815
[SPEAKER_10]: policy, but it's much thinner than the one that we have developed since that time.

481
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:18,697
[SPEAKER_10]: However, tonight we have Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena with us who work on our technology.

482
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:20,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan is the network administrator.

483
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:22,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Richard is the director of media and technology.

484
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'd like to table it tonight because some additional information has come to our attention from the ACLU and some other groups.

485
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,022
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to match up the

486
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:39,371
[SPEAKER_10]: information to make sure that we've covered all the bases and make sure that there's nothing that we've missed.

487
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,554
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be careful that different groups have different issues.

488
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:47,996
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some other things that are moving forward, but we do want to address this as an issue.

489
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:52,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So what you have in front of you, look it over and give us any feedback you have.

490
00:32:53,579 --> 00:33:01,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will continue to research some of the latest stuff that's come out only this past week and determine whether or not we've missed anything that

491
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:04,682
[SPEAKER_10]: we think should be included or something that should be worded differently.

492
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:09,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena are here if you have any preliminary questions.

493
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:11,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, I recommend we lay it on the table.

494
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:12,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Ms.

495
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:17,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz to lay this paper on the table until our next school committee meeting, seconded by Ms.

496
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:17,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

497
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:19,848
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

498
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:21,228
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

499
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:22,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

500
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:24,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you both for coming.

501
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:31,585
[SPEAKER_08]: report on joint M a S C M a S S conference.

502
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:38,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, um, conference was great, but our deputy superintendent is going to issue this report to you.

503
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:41,352
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of attachments and you'll find at the back.

504
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:44,435
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a financial accounting that was asked for the previous meeting.

505
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:53,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson, the M a S C M a S S conference that's held annually was held this year in hyenas from November 2nd to the 5th.

506
00:33:55,372 --> 00:34:02,496
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a variety, a large variety of workshops that took place that focused on important current topics in education.

507
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:12,001
[SPEAKER_11]: School committee members, Paulette van de Kloet, Robert Scarry, and Anne-Marie Cugno attended various segments of the three-day conference.

508
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:18,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent Bellison, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, and myself also were in attendance.

509
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:22,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we try to do at these conferences, because as you can see from the

510
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:23,869
[SPEAKER_11]: full agenda I gave you.

511
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,411
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of things going on simultaneously as we try to divide and conquer.

512
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:34,735
[SPEAKER_11]: So we kind of, you know, make a plan where we attend different things and come back together and share as much information as possible.

513
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:35,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes it more efficient.

514
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:43,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the highlights from the workshop, there was a section or segment, a workshop on the new MCAS 2.0.

515
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,683
[SPEAKER_11]: We learned some new things about it.

516
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:50,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being called the Next Generation MCAS.

517
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:56,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it will be administered to all students this year, grades three through eight.

518
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:05,215
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that they are moving more and more towards total computer-based testing, as each year it's going to accelerate.

519
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:13,261
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, as you know, we are asked to test online, test by computer, the students in grades four and eight.

520
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:15,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that Andrews is going to do all the grade levels.

521
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:17,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the subsequent year,

522
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:21,278
[SPEAKER_11]: the different groups, the different grades increase.

523
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:28,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is in the PowerPoint slides that I've attached from Jeff Wilson, who's deputy commissioner for DESE.

524
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,141
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very ambitious, I think, program.

525
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:38,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, all, everyone should be testing on computers, all the different subjects and all the different grade levels by 2019.

526
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:41,183
[SPEAKER_11]: That's their ambitious goal.

527
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,123
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna score using four levels.

528
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:47,244
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the old advanced, proficient, needs improvement and warning.

529
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:57,157
[SPEAKER_11]: We understand from that meeting it's partially meeting expectations, not yet meeting expectations, meeting expectations, and exceeding expectations.

530
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:59,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we've been told.

531
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:04,482
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that we did learn is there's still a lot of questions to be answered.

532
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:11,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, are they going to test the same science subjects at the high school?

533
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:11,667
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't sure.

534
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:15,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they going to add a social studies test?

535
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:19,871
[SPEAKER_11]: to the MCAS cohort of testing, they're not sure.

536
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:29,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they're also saying, should we move the high school competency determination, the graduation requirement, and move that to a grade 11 test?

537
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:31,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was still a lot of questions.

538
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:43,468
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some, there were many people from the western part of the state that really were quite upset with the ambitious rate of accelerating this computer-based testing because

539
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,905
[SPEAKER_11]: They were saying that they don't have the infrastructure.

540
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:51,809
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actually, you know, we're trying to get there, but we're well ahead of those communities.

541
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:58,773
[SPEAKER_11]: They told us stories that, you know, sometimes kids are sitting outside the library in snowstorms trying to access the Wi-Fi.

542
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:03,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, how they're going to bring everybody in the state to this level so quickly remains to be seen.

543
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:12,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Other workshops, again, as Mr. Skerry pointed out, the focus of the conference was social and emotional.

544
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:16,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And we attended sessions dealing with that.

545
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:23,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Sheila Dennery, who works with Children's Hospital and the Boston Public School, discussed her work with teachers.

546
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:30,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that's very interesting is that in teacher training today, there's really nothing on social-emotional.

547
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:39,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So teachers are going into classrooms where they may have a lot of training in behavior management and other pedagogy, but very, very little in social-emotional.

548
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're trying to turn that around.

549
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:48,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And so Sheila's working with Boston teachers in providing PD for the teachers on how to deal with students in the classes.

550
00:37:48,562 --> 00:38:01,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing I felt that was really encouraging is they're putting together an online program called TAP that we'll all have access to down the road so we can actually plug our teachers into this online training and so they'll have the benefit of it as well.

551
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:04,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a very interesting session.

552
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,952
[SPEAKER_11]: As well, Jessica Minahan is always very interesting and she

553
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:15,497
[SPEAKER_11]: has a wealth of very practical suggestions for dealing with students who are having issues in the classroom.

554
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:16,658
[SPEAKER_11]: She's written several books.

555
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:22,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Her PowerPoint slides are attached as well to the report.

556
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:32,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Many sessions dealt with legal updates as well as some of the issues that schools are currently dealing with.

557
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:36,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we had the opportunity to

558
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:49,702
[SPEAKER_11]: meet with many vendors, some of them we already are working with, School Brains was there, we had an opportunity to talk with them and there's one issue that I wanted to resolve and they were very attentive to that.

559
00:38:50,722 --> 00:39:02,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We also, the superintendent talked with people on technology and the idea that there's additional funding that we might be able to tap into, so that was very beneficial.

560
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:02,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And,

561
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:14,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, some of the other vendors, I won't go through all of them, but again, there's a great deal of information that can be gleaned just by visiting the different booths at the conference.

562
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:21,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I've attached, again, the full agenda for the conference.

563
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:22,983
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see all the various workshops.

564
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:32,645
[SPEAKER_11]: The slides from the MCAS 2.0, slides from Jessica Minahan's presentation.

565
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:37,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the superintendent, you've attached some additional things as well.

566
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:40,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anyone has any questions that I can answer.

567
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:42,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

568
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

569
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

570
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't really have questions.

571
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:53,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I guess on the record as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS.

572
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:59,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just wanted to be on record that again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers.

573
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: They just kind of always put the cart before the horse.

574
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:07,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that.

575
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

576
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have, they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because you can't, it's not fear.

577
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:22,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fear to our students that are graduating.

578
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:29,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about park because they came and they spoke about it.

579
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, they had no answers to the questions.

580
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:36,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was on the board of DSC,

581
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:40,885
[SPEAKER_03]: on working with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers.

582
00:40:41,425 --> 00:41:01,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.

583
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:04,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Well the high school test the grade 10 will remain

584
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,365
[SPEAKER_11]: what they call the legacy MCAS, which is the old MCAS.

585
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:15,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, through, you know, the year 2002, 2021 will be the first cohort of students.

586
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:20,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are our eighth graders now that will have to take the next generation for competency determination.

587
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:30,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And the feeling was that will give these kids in the grade eight, because they don't take the test in grade nine, an opportunity to at least experience the test before they have to take it for real.

588
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again,

589
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:40,520
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a fast pace, and this is the only time I can remember that we have put in place a test that hasn't been piloted for a couple of years.

590
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,601
[SPEAKER_11]: The original MCAS test, that was piloted for two or three years.

591
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're just saying, here it is.

592
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:46,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't even have worked out.

593
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:50,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a problem with some of the categories that they're going to rate the kids.

594
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,203
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that mean exactly?

595
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:57,304
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, meeting expectations versus not yet meeting.

596
00:41:57,924 --> 00:41:59,245
[SPEAKER_11]: How many do they not have to meet?

597
00:41:59,305 --> 00:42:00,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very vague still.

598
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:06,728
[SPEAKER_11]: And for them to be going this quickly and putting this in place, we have to just see what happens.

599
00:42:06,768 --> 00:42:10,289
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to advise that we have a large, a long window for testing.

600
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:17,350
[SPEAKER_11]: The English can be pretty much all, take place all during the month of April, and the math during May.

601
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:23,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to suggest that when we schedule these tests, we don't schedule it for the first week in April.

602
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:30,273
[SPEAKER_11]: We wait and see what's happening around the Commonwealth to see if there are some problems, and we'll schedule like it's starting the second week in April.

603
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:32,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And the same with the math.

604
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great.

605
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All our students are going to take this exam online.

606
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:46,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great for our administrators.

607
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to, you know, get the test scores back.

608
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:54,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line

609
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:57,380
[SPEAKER_03]: for technology is huge.

610
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's huge across this whole state.

611
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:02,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only the state, but it's going to be across the nation.

612
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:06,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this.

613
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the way I feel about it, I said it a few years back, is that I basically feel

614
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:36,182
[SPEAKER_03]: that if we don't have the proper technology and honestly I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best but when you do go to a conference like that or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board it's something that they really need to start thinking about because technology I mean look at your own homes

615
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:41,826
[SPEAKER_03]: or where you work, if you're working outside of the school system, it's constantly, constantly changing.

616
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:45,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail.

617
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:51,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil.

618
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:54,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's almost like the technology.

619
00:43:54,694 --> 00:44:00,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I will be, I will say it again, that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city.

620
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:09,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We've tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money.

621
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:19,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe that, um, the governor had given us was like a hundred

622
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,511
[SPEAKER_03]: million dollars or something like that.

623
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like a lot of money.

624
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:30,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state I mean it ended up being what like ten thousand dollars or something if that.

625
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:36,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So again this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.

626
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:40,605
[SPEAKER_11]: We are being very proactive in planning for this.

627
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:50,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We visited a group of us visited the Burlington public schools which have been kind of trying to do the online stuff early on and we've learned a lot of tips.

628
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,537
[SPEAKER_11]: as to things that worked and things that didn't work.

629
00:44:53,577 --> 00:45:00,002
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to be very proactive in getting as much information as possible as we move into this.

630
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:01,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

631
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:03,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

632
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:04,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

633
00:45:04,726 --> 00:45:05,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your report.

634
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate it.

635
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like there was a lot of great topics in here and I saw some that, you know,

636
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:17,872
[SPEAKER_07]: that Kathy Medaglio, the Director of Special Education might benefit from learning from.

637
00:45:17,892 --> 00:45:24,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how that, how the information from this conference gets to our department heads.

638
00:45:25,034 --> 00:45:26,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that through you, like?

639
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:27,694
[SPEAKER_11]: At our meetings.

640
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:35,396
[SPEAKER_11]: We had, we haven't had our meeting, we have our next administrative meeting on December 6th, yeah, December 6th.

641
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:42,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we do, things that are most urgent, I mean some of the MCAS stuff is already out because that was important to get a jump on that.

642
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:48,029
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we usually do is we share this information at the next administrative meeting.

643
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:51,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Kathy, we see every Monday morning if there's anything critical.

644
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:59,437
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a lot of workshops around special education, the safe school issues, gay, lesbian, the gender issues.

645
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,580
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a huge topic as well.

646
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:09,665
[SPEAKER_11]: So it all gets disseminated more quickly to those who are directly involved, but eventually to all the administrative staff.

647
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:16,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know I'm, I'm pushy and I asked for this report and I also asked how much we pay on this conference.

648
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:20,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have great respect for it for one reason.

649
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:30,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the, a lot of the money that came into our school department for our science labs came from, um, your, your team attendance.

650
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:40,944
[SPEAKER_07]: at the conference because Mr. Belson came back from one of the conference with this idea and about the grant and he was on fire to make sure that that happened.

651
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:43,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we have our science labs because of it.

652
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:51,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do see value in it, but it as also as my job, I need to make sure that we're, we're using funds appropriately.

653
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I always ask how much we pay for it, how many people are going, is it a value?

654
00:46:58,061 --> 00:46:59,782
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the money actually paying for?

655
00:46:59,922 --> 00:47:01,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the right people going?

656
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:06,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're just straight out and honest and communicate.

657
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: We do pay.

658
00:47:07,968 --> 00:47:12,110
[SPEAKER_07]: We do spend $3,500 to send people to this conference.

659
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:19,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And I trust in the administrative team's judgment that this is necessary and helpful for our district.

660
00:47:19,856 --> 00:47:23,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do believe that the $13 or $14 million we spent on our labs

661
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: that was 60% funded by the federal government was because of this conference.

662
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:31,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

663
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:32,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Bellson?

664
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:33,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

665
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:34,846
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you bring back this year?

666
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:35,567
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the big things?

667
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:46,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one of the things that, you know, was in here that you should notice is the fact that we've identified through tier two of the E-rate about 700,000, it could be as much as 800,000 that we can access.

668
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:50,556
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll start applying for that after the first year when the window opens.

669
00:47:51,217 --> 00:47:51,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a match.

670
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,659
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 60% of the cost of what we pay.

671
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do our capital plan,

672
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:05,043
[SPEAKER_10]: we can hope to get as much as $800,000 against the capital plan for technology enhancements, which will be well worth the thing.

673
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:09,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's a couple of other technology items in here that also are fundable.

674
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:12,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was a, probably the biggest financial takeaway.

675
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing was to look at roofing.

676
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:20,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I mentioned it in here a little bit, uh, because obviously we were looking at roofing going down, down the future.

677
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:23,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the roofing applications now are,

678
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:30,021
[SPEAKER_10]: very, very good and they're less expensive than some of the previous roofing and they can be done much more quickly.

679
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:33,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So becoming familiar with that is a real important thing.

680
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:39,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there are some legal things that are coming up that are really questionable that we need to get in front of.

681
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:51,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you know that we just had an election and that with that election, ESSA is, you know, is going to be looked at by a new administration, how it's going to be implemented, how it's going to be changed.

682
00:48:51,614 --> 00:48:53,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, some of those things were talked about in great length.

683
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, there are things that are still unknown.

684
00:48:55,941 --> 00:49:00,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you know, we, we just can't know, but people are speculating on them.

685
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:06,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's a lot of takeaways from this that you just can't do when you're not talking to people face to face.

686
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:09,834
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're talking to somebody over the telephone, the conversations, they're good, but they're not great.

687
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:17,120
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're talking to somebody face to face over a cup of coffee, you can get an awful lot of information, especially if they're working on this, uh, on a regular basis.

688
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:18,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

689
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:19,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

690
00:49:20,563 --> 00:49:21,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

691
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:23,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You all set?

692
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:27,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm sorry, just... Oh, those are... Oh, thank you, probably.

693
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:28,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

694
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just want to know about the MCAS.

695
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:37,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there any discussions about rolling it out to the schools?

696
00:49:37,346 --> 00:49:42,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, any plans on how they're going to handle it where it's really not determined?

697
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:48,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, are there any workshop sessions for students and to get them acclimated?

698
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:55,895
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it just seems like, you know, we don't know what it's going to be like, you know, well, you know, our, our directors are on top of this.

699
00:49:56,195 --> 00:50:01,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we know the types of questions will be pretty much park-like questions.

700
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:18,832
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have already, I know that, um, Dr. Kieser and Mrs. Joy have put out some practice materials for teachers and also, um, Jeff Wilson, the deputy commissioner, uh, mentioned that there will be some practice tests coming out.

701
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:28,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But they better get them out quickly because, you know, and again, there are still some unknowns, but I think we have a good handle.

702
00:50:28,844 --> 00:50:30,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not just sitting by waiting.

703
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:31,965
[SPEAKER_11]: We're out there trying to work.

704
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:46,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also, one of the other important pieces to this is that our technology curriculum, we want to make sure that teachers who are teaching the technology are teaching the kids the skills they need to

705
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,061
[SPEAKER_11]: to be successful.

706
00:50:48,101 --> 00:50:56,324
[SPEAKER_11]: We found from Burlington experiences and other communities that many children who took the online testing simply didn't know how to use the tools.

707
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:03,606
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to make sure that they're not going to be, you know, graded down because they can't use the computer itself.

708
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:11,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're working with the technology department to make sure that the skills they need are, they practice ahead of time.

709
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:25,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you also think that, because I know sometimes parents will ask or they wonder if more time is spent doing MCAS than on regular education and curriculum.

710
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:42,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think, you know, with the testing that's going to go on, like mostly in April and May, you know, will it be more extensive and will there be, will it be, you know, stressful for the students with the regular coursework and the MCAS and the

711
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:45,250
[SPEAKER_12]: the prep work, and I'm just curious.

712
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're gonna try to contain it.

713
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:56,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when we do our meetings next month, we're going to recommend that the principals try to contain it in as few sessions as possible.

714
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think it's gonna be any more at the grade levels three through eight.

715
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:10,790
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm concerned about is down the road with the high school, because if we had gone with the park, which was an option, it would have been an 11th grade test, but that test was designed

716
00:52:11,315 --> 00:52:14,237
[SPEAKER_11]: to determine if kids were college ready.

717
00:52:14,717 --> 00:52:25,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we had gone the park route and taken that assessment at grade eight, grade 11, then those youngsters, many of them, would have to take the ACCUPLACER, which is the placement test for the state colleges.

718
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:36,970
[SPEAKER_11]: But now they're talking about, Jeff Wilson was talking about having a 10th grade test, which would be the competency determination test, and then having this 11th grade test as an additional one.

719
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,672
[SPEAKER_11]: That bothers me because so many of the kids who

720
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we don't have a lot of kids that don't pass in 10th grade, but they've got to take the retest as juniors.

721
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:55,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing, too, if they move the whole test in high school to grade 11, that's problematic, too, because if a student doesn't pass in grade 11, they have a very limited opportunity to retest.

722
00:52:55,615 --> 00:53:03,538
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if a student doesn't pass in grade 10, they have two opportunities in grade 11 and two opportunities in grade 12 before graduation.

723
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,800
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we test in grade 11, they're only going to have two opportunities in grade 12.

724
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:15,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, to me, the high school testing is problematic and how they're going to do the science down the road.

725
00:53:15,164 --> 00:53:17,426
[SPEAKER_11]: They may not have a chemistry option.

726
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:20,429
[SPEAKER_11]: It might just be introductory physics and biology.

727
00:53:21,189 --> 00:53:22,651
[SPEAKER_11]: But these decisions haven't been made.

728
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:24,812
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can only speculate.

729
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

730
00:53:26,554 --> 00:53:27,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It frustrates me, too.

731
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:30,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not knowing the answers, but thank you.

732
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:32,639
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to be proactive.

733
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:37,343
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to visit other communities, see what the problems are computer-wise.

734
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:44,910
[SPEAKER_11]: technology-wise, and then our directors are pretty savvy with the content, and they've been working with teachers on that, so.

735
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:46,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

736
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:47,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

737
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:48,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

738
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:53,233
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, I was at the conference and spent quite a bit of time there.

739
00:53:53,753 --> 00:54:04,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the only thing which was unfortunate was that more members of the committee were not able to come this year, because it's not only about talking about the

740
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:10,143
[SPEAKER_17]: the issues at hand or attending the different conference sessions.

741
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:15,405
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also about networking, talking to other school committee members, having a chance to talk about issues

742
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,412
[SPEAKER_17]: with your colleagues while you're there.

743
00:54:20,713 --> 00:54:25,299
[SPEAKER_17]: It's difficult because, for me, it was three days off from my own job.

744
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,304
[SPEAKER_17]: But it is really worthwhile in the long run.

745
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:36,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that next year that more people will be able to attend.

746
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:36,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

747
00:54:40,284 --> 00:54:40,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

748
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:40,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Cugno.

749
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, definitely agree with my colleague.

750
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all the reports and everything that you brought.

751
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as, uh, if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on.

752
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:00,849
[SPEAKER_03]: on their website.

753
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:03,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and again, I can't reiterate it enough.

754
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:06,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they sound like an old record.

755
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Paulette and I both sound like old records, been saying it for 12 years.

756
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:13,752
[SPEAKER_03]: The date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year.

757
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online.

758
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:29,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can get the information, but sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as

759
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:49,844
[SPEAKER_03]: My colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other, and you do bond, and you do, you know, over the years, become friends, and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way are you going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial.

760
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:54,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will get off my soapbox, but, again, look at the date for next year.

761
00:55:54,326 --> 00:55:55,286
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a surprise.

762
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes every year, just like Thanksgiving.

763
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we all take our vacation time.

764
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:07,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go.

765
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it's very beneficial.

766
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:10,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

767
00:56:11,274 --> 00:56:12,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

768
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:15,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

769
00:56:15,276 --> 00:56:16,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a question.

770
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned school brains and how you got to speak to the vendor when you're down there.

771
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted, um, not directly to you, but to the superintendent, an update to make sure we're still on track and how it's going.

772
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:29,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick update.

773
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not on the agenda, but since you mentioned it, it doesn't hurt to ask.

774
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:34,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're making good progress.

775
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:42,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, a couple of tweaks here and there, but I think we've broken through the initial gridlock of trying to get some of that stuff to happen.

776
00:56:42,868 --> 00:56:45,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you start to see things take fuller shape in the next little while.

777
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And are all the teachers now trained and up and using school brains?

778
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:54,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they have to use so far, which was the gradebook, the attendance.

779
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:58,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not heard any grumbling, so that's a good sign.

780
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I hear things that people were unhappy.

781
00:57:01,888 --> 00:57:13,657
[SPEAKER_11]: The one issue that we talked to the vendor about had to do with the health services and Tony Vento had expressed to me some issues and they were going to hopefully they did get in touch with her right away afterwards and work them out.

782
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:25,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I haven't heard, I think the teachers are comfortable unless I am missing something in parents on, on ready to be put online.

783
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Ms.

784
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:30,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

785
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on, they finally got on.

786
00:57:34,904 --> 00:57:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that the high school you've been on.

787
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:40,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So parents are definitely on.

788
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the elementary schools, Mr.

789
00:57:44,768 --> 00:57:49,330
[SPEAKER_10]: elementary elementary, you know, it was going to be a little bit later because they're in a different position right now.

790
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:55,693
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't get report cards the same way the, uh, the others do, but, uh, we'll roll that out, uh, fairly soon.

791
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:57,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Diane can answer that specifically.

792
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,175
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

793
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:01,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Some parents have asked me in the recent past.

794
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:05,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought I'd just ask since someone mentioned it.

795
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,619
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two guests.

796
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul has been very helpful with, um, the school brains.

797
00:58:11,862 --> 00:58:12,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if you want to,

798
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:15,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there were some issues initially with people.

799
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,244
[SPEAKER_11]: getting parents getting registered but I'll let you speak to that.

800
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:32,971
[SPEAKER_15]: So the plan that we had implemented was we all sent out letters with usernames and passwords so the system allowed us to create usernames and passwords for families.

801
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:41,255
[SPEAKER_15]: We made sure you look because what happens in the system sometimes kids were just registered for the Andrews but then you had several siblings as well.

802
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:44,577
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would say the families that have

803
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:51,361
[SPEAKER_15]: multiple siblings in different schools, including elementary, have that access right now.

804
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,904
[SPEAKER_15]: But the elementary is a different version.

805
00:58:55,464 --> 00:59:04,990
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, like the grade books that we're using for the high school and the middle school have values, while the elementary report card does the standards base.

806
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:10,454
[SPEAKER_15]: So the most that you're really going to see for an elementary student will be mostly attendance.

807
00:59:11,895 --> 00:59:12,676
[SPEAKER_07]: They're about homework.

808
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like teachers posting homework.

809
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:26,797
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the middle and high school, because this is a two way communication via putting your assignment in there, grading your assignment, and then the parent has the ability to do that.

810
00:59:27,637 --> 00:59:34,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I'm not in the elementary world and as as much as I am for the middle and high school, but that's being posted.

811
00:59:35,262 --> 00:59:36,043
[SPEAKER_15]: from what I see.

812
00:59:36,283 --> 00:59:37,924
[SPEAKER_15]: And like Ms.

813
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:39,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno said, those letters have gone out.

814
00:59:39,365 --> 00:59:45,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had plenty of parents that have contacted me, very happy and excited that they're able to view things.

815
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:49,112
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they run into problems, I've been more than able to help them through it.

816
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:54,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to thank you for taking this on and helping our community.

817
00:59:54,336 --> 00:59:54,877
[SPEAKER_15]: It was important.

818
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:56,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is very important.

819
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And your time and expertise is appreciated.

820
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,021
[SPEAKER_15]: My pleasure.

821
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:01,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

822
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:02,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz.

823
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just want to share a point of information I've been on.

824
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:13,473
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see the full calendar, absence days, assignments.

825
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:18,816
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a link directly to the teacher, the grades.

826
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:22,658
[SPEAKER_12]: They matched up to the report cards that we just got at the high school.

827
01:00:22,678 --> 01:00:28,321
[SPEAKER_12]: I needed to have another person added to my profile, sent an email.

828
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:30,442
[SPEAKER_12]: The profile got updated.

829
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really been really smooth.

830
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't even access it from my phone.

831
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:37,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's mm-hmm

832
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:50,284
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's another good point of the system is, as Coretta said, the fact that we only had information of what was given to us from our old system, which probably needs to be updated as well.

833
01:00:50,324 --> 01:00:56,269
[SPEAKER_15]: So parents that do have the ability to get on have that ability to also adjust things like they've changed their email.

834
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That happens all the time kind of thing.

835
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:07,218
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have that ability to do it and we can look and improve changes that are being made so that we have the updated information as well, which helps us as well on our end.

836
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:36,079
[SPEAKER_02]: very good so the elementary you will definitely be able to see the attendance as well as the standardized report cards but we're going to open up open up that parent portal piece probably at the beginning of the in January 2017 we just kind of wanted to wait to see how the middle school in the high school roll out and then I'll send a memo home to all families and let them know absolutely sure

837
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:53,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've had to import the report cards into school brains from the elementary end.

838
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a little bit difficult because it didn't always transition the way we wanted it to.

839
01:01:58,306 --> 01:02:00,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're continuing to work on that.

840
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:06,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it is now, I'm just getting emails that the reading stages weren't put in the right places.

841
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have to get to work on that tomorrow.

842
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:09,236
[SPEAKER_02]: But Paul has been a lifesaver.

843
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:10,517
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been working very hard on this.

844
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:13,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

845
01:02:13,638 --> 01:02:14,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

846
01:02:14,378 --> 01:02:14,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

847
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:20,280
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor for, to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

848
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno, seconded by Ms.

849
01:02:22,361 --> 01:02:22,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

850
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:23,901
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

851
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:25,262
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

852
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

853
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:32,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on legalization of marijuana with recommendation for legislative modifications.

854
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

855
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:34,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

856
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:37,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, as you know, the,

857
01:02:38,137 --> 01:02:48,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Marijuana question passed the ballot in this past November by about 54% of the voters who actually voted.

858
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:55,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the big questions, obviously, is there isn't enough regulatory guidance.

859
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:59,971
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look at some of these ballot questions, they're very blunt instruments.

860
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:02,172
[SPEAKER_10]: They can only ask for one thing up or down.

861
01:03:02,952 --> 01:03:09,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't really spell out all the things that are inside that need to happen in order to make it work well.

862
01:03:10,295 --> 01:03:16,857
[SPEAKER_10]: The Speaker of the House, the Senate President, and the Governor have all expressed their concerns, the Attorney General.

863
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:22,520
[SPEAKER_10]: about the lack of regulatory assistance that they have going forward.

864
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:32,523
[SPEAKER_10]: But they can't do much between now and January because they're in an informal session and all you need is one legislator to object and the matter can't be discussed.

865
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously there are people that don't want to talk about it right now.

866
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:46,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So I expect that in January, uh, the legislature will take this up in earnest and the governor will fall quickly and there'll be a lot of support for regulatory, uh,

867
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:47,457
[SPEAKER_10]: help.

868
01:03:48,418 --> 01:03:55,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, currently it's under the state treasurer, Deborah Goldberg for implementation, but it's unfunded.

869
01:03:56,506 --> 01:03:57,667
[SPEAKER_10]: She has no funds for it in order.

870
01:03:57,687 --> 01:04:01,531
[SPEAKER_10]: She have any appointees to her commission and this is scheduled to go in effect December 15th.

871
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:01,631
[SPEAKER_10]: So

872
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:06,253
[SPEAKER_10]: There's obviously some concerns about that.

873
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:09,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of different concerns that we have.

874
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:14,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, the medical marijuana piece is better regulated, and that's already in place.

875
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,363
[SPEAKER_10]: But the recreational marijuana issues are not regulated at this point.

876
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:32,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So what basically I'm saying, it's imperative that school committees, school officials urge the legislature and the governor to take the necessary action to prevent the misuse of this substance.

877
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we talk about opiates, we talk about all these things.

878
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:43,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I look at marijuana as a gateway drug, especially when young people can get access to it.

879
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:53,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the minimum age is 21, but if a 21-year-old has it, I'm not sure that he or she is going to keep it from their friend who is 16 or 17.

880
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:54,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a feeling that

881
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,311
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there were issues associated with that.

882
01:04:57,412 --> 01:05:03,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So here are some of the things that I would want to write to our legislators on behalf of the committee.

883
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:05,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And there may be others that we can add to it.

884
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:10,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first is to provide a local opt-in provision.

885
01:05:10,442 --> 01:05:11,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, it's opt-out.

886
01:05:11,863 --> 01:05:15,606
[SPEAKER_10]: And in order to do it, you have to schedule a referendum vote that could be a year later.

887
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:23,873
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to make them put it opt-in, which means you have to, as a community, decide to actually accept the rule for your community.

888
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:26,466
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one.

889
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:34,572
[SPEAKER_10]: It would mirror the Colorado law, which is currently in place, and we think that's a good piece to have.

890
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:42,858
[SPEAKER_10]: 70% of the communities in Marijuana ban their local areas for distributing it, so that's just an idea.

891
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:46,301
[SPEAKER_10]: The second thing is substantially increase the tax rate.

892
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:47,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now it's 3.75.

893
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:54,109
[SPEAKER_10]: At that rate, while it might generate some money, it won't generate enough money for enforcement.

894
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,229
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't generate enough money for control.

895
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:04,892
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't generate enough money for data collection, for the kinds of things that have to go forward in order for us to modify and improve the law as we go forward.

896
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:17,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So we think that the legislature should increase that tax, maybe even double it, in order to ensure that there's sufficient funds to regulate recreational marijuana.

897
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,910
[SPEAKER_10]: We think they should eliminate the homegrown provision.

898
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:27,792
[SPEAKER_10]: The provision as it currently stands will not adequately be enforced.

899
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:41,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's to know who's going to go in whose home, and to get warrants to go in people's homes to see if they've only got six plants, or how they're using it, or whether they're putting it in brownies, or whether they're putting in these kinds of things and distributing it in ways that cannot be easily detected.

900
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:47,475
[SPEAKER_10]: The other piece on this is that the way the marijuana is grown today,

901
01:06:48,457 --> 01:06:51,219
[SPEAKER_10]: The intensity of it is much stronger than it was years ago.

902
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:58,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't know if it's going to be spiced or spliced, if you will, with other substances in certain venues that may be at home.

903
01:06:58,683 --> 01:06:59,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't control it.

904
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:09,150
[SPEAKER_10]: So we think the homegrown piece needs to be looked at in order for us to protect underage students and underage people.

905
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,961
[SPEAKER_10]: or anyone in particular.

906
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:18,507
[SPEAKER_10]: We think they need to strengthen the Control Commission to better understand the impact and to effectively regulate the industry.

907
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:25,493
[SPEAKER_10]: The Commission should have a staff that collects data to inform future modifications that may be necessary to protect public safety.

908
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:33,859
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have data out there as to what's happening, whether there's connection between recreational marijuana use and other drug use, you don't know what's going on.

909
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:37,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know if you're helping or hurting what's happening.

910
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:43,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So the initiative petition process, like I say, can be a valuable part of the democratic system.

911
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:47,339
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it's a very blunt instrument, and it needs to be refined.

912
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,061
[SPEAKER_10]: We obviously

913
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:53,089
[SPEAKER_10]: will respect the will of the people, as we do with all initiative petitions.

914
01:07:53,129 --> 01:07:56,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And the legislature very rarely overturns the will of the people.

915
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,431
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no reason why they can't modify it and refine it.

916
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the interest is there on the part of the leadership.

917
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:19,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'd like to do is draft a letter to our legislators on behalf of the committee and the school department administration with these suggestions and hope that they will take action as swiftly as possible at the turn of the year when the legislature goes back into formal session.

918
01:08:20,032 --> 01:08:24,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval of the recommendations made by the superintendent by Ms.

919
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:25,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno, seconded by Ms.

920
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:25,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

921
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:26,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote.

922
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:29,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

923
01:08:29,999 --> 01:08:33,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd want to see any such letter before we approve the letter.

924
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd want to see a draft of that.

925
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:36,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I can bring that to you.

926
01:08:38,884 --> 01:08:41,226
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion that the letter be drafted.

927
01:08:41,846 --> 01:08:42,607
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

928
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,028
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

929
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:45,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

930
01:08:49,308 --> 01:08:52,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on Medford Public Schools disciplinary statistics.

931
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:58,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So the state just released the disciplinary statistics from 2015-2016.

932
01:08:59,216 --> 01:09:03,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford is well below the numbers for the state on average.

933
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:07,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I've given you some of the reports that I was able to download offline.

934
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,242
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do a little bit more analysis, but we're well below.

935
01:09:10,802 --> 01:09:23,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave you some categories that would give you some ideas about different areas, whether it be substance abuse, marijuana, physical theft or assault or anything of that type for you to look over.

936
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:29,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do a bigger report going forward, but I wanted you to have something to look at.

937
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:35,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some of our initiatives in terms of providing additional programs for youngsters, rather than sending them home, have worked.

938
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll continue to work, and we need to strengthen them going forward.

939
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:46,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think those things are positive steps for us, and I think it shows in the results, and we'll continue to show in the results going forward.

940
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:47,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job.

941
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:50,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

942
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:58,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, when I was reading through some of this, um, the, the student group that really, um, stood out to me as high needs.

943
01:09:59,526 --> 01:10:02,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is, what is exactly the definition of high needs in this?

944
01:10:03,028 --> 01:10:07,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, high needs as a, as a conglomerate group, it could be economically disadvantaged.

945
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:09,592
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be special needs could be ELL.

946
01:10:10,393 --> 01:10:17,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it's, it's a grouping that sort of as an omnibus for all the different groups that are identified as disaggregated groups.

947
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:18,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, we try to, uh,

948
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:22,298
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, understand that.

949
01:10:22,338 --> 01:10:27,699
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes it's hard to know who's in the group because you don't know who they've included in the group.

950
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:37,121
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's pretty much the youngsters who fall into groups like special needs, EOL, economically disadvantaged and some other groups that might be lesser known.

951
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:49,964
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really feel like this, this data is, it's extremely helpful in supporting our children that are having disciplinary issues and identifying the first step for helping them.

952
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:56,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I'm glad that you're going to look at this data a little more closely and whatever plans you come up with.

953
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd really like a report back on it.

954
01:10:59,134 --> 01:10:59,815
[SPEAKER_10]: We will do that.

955
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:05,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you know, we've talked about this as adding programs, these, you know, opportunities for opportunities for change and things like that.

956
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:11,563
[SPEAKER_10]: There are alternative insights which keep kids from being, let's say sent home and given some additional help or counseling.

957
01:11:11,603 --> 01:11:13,544
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what we're pushing towards.

958
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:14,985
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're going to try to keep doing.

959
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, budgets permitting obviously.

960
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:18,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I think that that,

961
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:20,468
[SPEAKER_10]: reflected in our numbers.

962
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:44,393
[SPEAKER_07]: In my experience working within schools is that a lot of disciplinary issues are based on either social emotional or the fact that they're struggling academically and they would rather act out in a behavioral way rather than have their peers or even their teachers lose respect for their abilities or you know they just want to stay

963
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:54,161
[SPEAKER_07]: In control and that's how they act out so that nobody sees that they're struggling academically so identifying those students That's why the emphasis on social emotional

964
01:11:55,748 --> 01:11:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

965
01:11:56,308 --> 01:11:56,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

966
01:11:56,968 --> 01:12:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Cugno, I just threw you to the superintendent.

967
01:12:00,409 --> 01:12:06,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school.

968
01:12:06,971 --> 01:12:14,354
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a.

969
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:35,865
[SPEAKER_03]: One-on-one type of situation the opportunities to change right and then last year he was talking about this year of this academic school year that they had started another program Nexus and that was the one I I forgot the name of it So I apologize, but I would like an upgrade an update on that if possible to say we've been on We've been in school for a few months.

970
01:12:35,905 --> 01:12:37,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to know like numbers.

971
01:12:37,966 --> 01:12:38,746
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?

972
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:42,308
[SPEAKER_10]: You know probably halfway through the year Let's give it a half a year to really

973
01:12:42,852 --> 01:12:46,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.

974
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:46,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

975
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:47,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

976
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

977
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:48,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

978
01:12:49,174 --> 01:12:52,555
[SPEAKER_17]: In looking at the data, there's one thing to me which is a little unclear.

979
01:12:53,435 --> 01:13:01,158
[SPEAKER_17]: It uses the entire population, 4,529 students, but it doesn't break it down into levels.

980
01:13:01,298 --> 01:13:07,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, so you could assume or jump to the conclusion that all of these things are taking place

981
01:13:08,063 --> 01:13:09,884
[SPEAKER_17]: at the high school, which there are not many.

982
01:13:09,944 --> 01:13:11,225
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be clear about that.

983
01:13:12,046 --> 01:13:18,050
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's not necessarily true, or perhaps I don't have the data that tells me whether they're high school or middle school.

984
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,331
[SPEAKER_10]: We will break it down further.

985
01:13:19,491 --> 01:13:24,415
[SPEAKER_10]: This came out just at the end of the week, and we just sort of wanted to get it out because it was being announced.

986
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:28,057
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same token, we have more time to break it down now.

987
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:35,022
[SPEAKER_17]: So the data, as far as I'm looking at it, would be more helpful if we were to break it down between elementary, middle, and high.

988
01:13:35,563 --> 01:13:36,003
[SPEAKER_17]: We can do that.

989
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:38,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

990
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:43,064
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to get a further report broken down by elementary, middle school, and high school.

991
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:44,104
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

992
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:44,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

993
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:45,726
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

994
01:13:45,966 --> 01:13:46,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

995
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:50,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive and place this report on file.

996
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,031
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

997
01:13:51,411 --> 01:13:51,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

998
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:52,813
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

999
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:53,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1000
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:59,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on school system guidance on national election results.

1001
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:00,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

1002
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:08,733
[SPEAKER_10]: So I received a number of phone calls from a number of you and others with regard to the election results that took place on November 8th.

1003
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:19,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And school systems around the Commonwealth and around the country received multiple inquiries from parents and citizens regarding classroom discussions about the recent national election results.

1004
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:30,122
[SPEAKER_10]: And concerns were raised about some teachers or staff who might introduce their personal opinions and feelings into what might be considered a very charged current

1005
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:32,492
[SPEAKER_10]: topic leading to possible conflict.

1006
01:14:35,174 --> 01:14:37,976
[SPEAKER_10]: As we know, elections are a fundamental element of democracy.

1007
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:43,722
[SPEAKER_10]: The process of elections and the substantive issues are a legitimate part of citizenship education.

1008
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:49,366
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't eliminate either process or substance from our schools and our classrooms.

1009
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:55,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And naturally, discussions must be age appropriate and devoid of any hostility for expressions of opinion.

1010
01:14:56,307 --> 01:15:00,791
[SPEAKER_10]: There can be no discussions that are racist and discriminatory towards any group.

1011
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:06,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And adult personnel must ensure that inappropriate comments are not introduced or perpetuated.

1012
01:15:07,778 --> 01:15:19,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So on Wednesday morning, November 9th, I sent out an email to principals, which is listed here, and I wanted to read it so if the public did not see it, they understand, because you've asked me sometimes.

1013
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:20,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Do people know this?

1014
01:15:20,573 --> 01:15:26,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we try to put it out, but obviously not everybody reads everything that we have.

1015
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:30,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wrote, colleagues, last evening, citizens elected a new president of our country.

1016
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I recognize this election was extremely contentious and polarizing.

1017
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:39,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Undoubtedly, there are many strong feelings among faculty, staff, and students.

1018
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:45,150
[SPEAKER_10]: It's extremely important that we do not engage in divisive discussions that can inflame feelings and behaviors.

1019
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: As educators, we must strive to help our students understand

1020
01:15:48,963 --> 01:15:54,944
[SPEAKER_10]: that we have a democratic process and that we need to go forward in a constructive way to support our country and our people.

1021
01:15:55,644 --> 01:15:57,205
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no room for hate messaging.

1022
01:15:57,825 --> 01:16:04,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Our students must learn that in this country, we accept the constitutional process that transfers power after a legitimate election.

1023
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:07,347
[SPEAKER_10]: This does not mean there can be no discussion of the election.

1024
01:16:07,827 --> 01:16:11,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Any discussion must be respectful and constructive.

1025
01:16:11,508 --> 01:16:13,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your attention to this guidance, and I signed it.

1026
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:18,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Our principals were expected to instruct their faculty and staff of the above expectation.

1027
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:25,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've not received any information from principals that inappropriate discussions have taken place in our classrooms at this time.

1028
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll continue to emphasize this.

1029
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:30,794
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll continue to allow people to discuss the electoral process.

1030
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:32,215
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to discuss the electoral college.

1031
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to discuss popular votes.

1032
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:35,258
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to discuss states.

1033
01:16:35,318 --> 01:16:37,619
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to look at reasons why people vote.

1034
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:38,200
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing.

1035
01:16:38,643 --> 01:16:49,777
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no room in the schools, in the classroom for adult personnel to encourage students to be hostile about any result or in the light we have, we have to get on with business.

1036
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:55,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the message that's out there and we'll continue to monitor what takes place over the next while.

1037
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:57,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1038
01:16:57,749 --> 01:17:17,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And even Thursday when we attended the veteran ceremony that was spoken about earlier this evening, it was made clear that to stay away from this topic, the students and the teachers have all been kind of addressed through this email, and that let's just deal with the Veterans Day topic at hand and not delve into the high emotions that have been running.

1039
01:17:17,858 --> 01:17:20,419
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think one of your lines in here really sums it up.

1040
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:22,420
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no room for hate messaging.

1041
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:30,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that message is loud and clear from not only the superintendent, but the city, school committee members, et cetera.

1042
01:17:30,124 --> 01:17:37,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just really need to strive to raise it up, raise the level of conversation up, and treat all people equally.

1043
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:38,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1044
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:44,960
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to receive and place on file this report, all those in favor?

1045
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:45,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1046
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:46,561
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1047
01:17:46,861 --> 01:17:47,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1048
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:53,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve graduation date for MHS and MVTHS class of 2017.

1049
01:17:53,185 --> 01:17:54,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's our standard.

1050
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our standard.

1051
01:17:58,389 --> 01:17:59,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be June 7th.

1052
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:00,070
[SPEAKER_10]: June 7th at the Gancher.

1053
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:06,382
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 p.m.

1054
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,304
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Wednesday evening.

1055
01:18:08,944 --> 01:18:10,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark your calendars, people.

1056
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,708
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, we do this in part this early, and I'll tell you why we do it.

1057
01:18:13,748 --> 01:18:26,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only to help people plan, but once we walk into a day, if it snows, we still can get the days in, you know, even if the even if the there aren't 12 days between graduation and the last day for seniors.

1058
01:18:26,859 --> 01:18:30,942
[SPEAKER_10]: So we walk in with the state in case we have extra snow days and the like.

1059
01:18:30,982 --> 01:18:32,143
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we do it so quickly.

1060
01:18:32,947 --> 01:18:35,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this date for graduation?

1061
01:18:35,748 --> 01:18:35,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1062
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:38,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1063
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:38,970
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1064
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1065
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: You moved it for us.

1066
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Skerry moved it for us.

1067
01:18:43,212 --> 01:18:43,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1068
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:43,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1069
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:45,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

1070
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:45,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1071
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:46,854
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1072
01:18:46,874 --> 01:18:48,475
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1073
01:18:48,695 --> 01:18:49,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1074
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:50,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one.

1075
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:52,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have old business, but it wasn't listed?

1076
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:54,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we do have old business.

1077
01:18:54,177 --> 01:18:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1078
01:18:54,457 --> 01:18:55,278
[SPEAKER_10]: There's two items there.

1079
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:58,880
[SPEAKER_10]: One is the crossing guards, and the other is how it's paid.

1080
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not listed for us.

1081
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:07,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to place negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda, authored by Ms.

1082
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1083
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:10,833
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1084
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,114
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1085
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:14,375
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be placed at the end of the agenda.

1086
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:20,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Old Business is an update on the crossing guard issue that was raised at the last meeting.

1087
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It had to do with the Felsway location, in particular,

1088
01:19:24,163 --> 01:19:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Two locations on the Felsway actually, one at the base of Fels Ave and one at the base of Fulton Street.

1089
01:19:29,245 --> 01:19:34,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the superintendent has been in touch with Mr. Representative Donato.

1090
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:45,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I spoke with Commissioner Roy of the DCR and he said that he had the engineers go out and they do not see any issues with extending the time limit on the push button.

1091
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:51,573
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that that was too, people complained that it was too short to get across the entire Felsway, which is quite a wide road.

1092
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So he said that that will be addressed.

1093
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:55,916
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to call me back to give me an exact date.

1094
01:19:56,837 --> 01:20:01,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him about the crossing guards, and he said that they're really trying to get out of the crossing guard business.

1095
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:11,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did mention that there could be a couple of locations that may be lower visibility, that if possible, if he could relocate a crossing guard that's currently in Medford.

1096
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:21,134
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe to this location, and then we could potentially change the bus route to address the fewer children that are affected in a different location.

1097
01:20:21,614 --> 01:20:26,738
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to go back to the drawing boards and talk to his people to see if that's a possibility.

1098
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:27,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Ms.

1099
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:29,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz, you have an update as well?

1100
01:20:30,321 --> 01:20:31,702
[SPEAKER_12]: A similar update.

1101
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:39,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard from Matt Hartman in State Senator Jalen's office, and she, you know, with some good news that they are going to

1102
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:48,314
[SPEAKER_12]: add some additional time on to the crossing light, where you cross over at the corner of Fulton Street and Felsway.

1103
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:53,799
[SPEAKER_12]: They're adding on an additional seven seconds to give people more time to get across.

1104
01:20:54,419 --> 01:21:04,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I would still recommend that you cross over to the next island, press the next button, and then cross over, rather than trying to make it all the way across five lanes.

1105
01:21:04,888 --> 01:21:06,970
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just for safety, it's just a good idea.

1106
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:11,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't get a date on when that's going to happen, but he's going to be calling back.

1107
01:21:11,553 --> 01:21:13,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll get the word out.

1108
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:22,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Representative Donato emailed me back today saying his meeting is scheduled for next for the first week in December with DCR.

1109
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:24,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's going to do it.

1110
01:21:24,524 --> 01:21:28,447
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, on this particular thing, my handwriting undoubtedly, uh,

1111
01:21:29,648 --> 01:21:33,011
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get Donahue to speak up for us as well.

1112
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:54,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever Donny was name and address of the record, please.

1113
01:21:54,654 --> 01:21:55,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1114
01:21:55,735 --> 01:21:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 21 Park Street.

1115
01:21:57,677 --> 01:21:59,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I want to ask a question through the chair.

1116
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:04,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that there actually is a button to push in the middle of the road.

1117
01:22:04,365 --> 01:22:08,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you get stuck on the island and run out of time, I think you're stuck on the island.

1118
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:09,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1119
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to throw that out there that I don't believe there is a button in the middle.

1120
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:20,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the added time will be sufficient to get across the entire cycle because right now it's what, 12?

1121
01:22:21,254 --> 01:22:26,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also hoping that if they wish to get out of the crossing guard business that maybe we'll consider getting in the crossing guard business.

1122
01:22:26,595 --> 01:22:33,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are in the crossing guard business and we would have to do an MOU, memorandum of understanding, in order to take over their location.

1123
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:36,403
[SPEAKER_08]: or their street in particular.

1124
01:22:36,883 --> 01:22:38,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have to review that.

1125
01:22:38,643 --> 01:22:43,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we didn't build that into this year's budget, but we certainly will take a look at it for next year.

1126
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:49,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your consideration.

1127
01:22:54,048 --> 01:22:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to address that here?

1128
01:22:56,601 --> 01:23:02,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Greenspan, we also have a report that was asked for in regards to the American International College.

1129
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:04,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent would like you to address it.

1130
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:16,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have a copy of it, you know, that you requested this and it takes a while for us to get answers from ethics, but there was a question about a potential conflict of interest in regards to American International College, AIC.

1131
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:23,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Greenspan wrote a lengthy report to this committee dated November 14th, 2016, in which he

1132
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:28,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to thank you, Mayor?

1133
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:55,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Belson did contact my office a while ago, informing me that the committee had asked some questions as to whether or not there was a potential conflict of interest in connection with the school district leasing facilities to American International College and teachers or administrators working for the college.

1134
01:23:56,017 --> 01:24:03,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, after review of the statutes and some of the regulations, uh, I've written a report to the committee dated November 14th.

1135
01:24:03,924 --> 01:24:20,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I've concluded, uh, after reviewing the sections of the statute, the conflict of interest law and, uh, the regulations promulgated by, uh, the ethics commission, uh, that there would be no conflict of interest, uh, for our teachers or administrators to work for AIC.

1136
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:33,242
[SPEAKER_00]: These issues and questions are very fact-specific based on the facts that I've received from the superintendent, which are in the report.

1137
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:39,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the superintendent is involved with the negotiations, maybe with the business manager.

1138
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:44,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers do not have any preference in terms of the hiring process.

1139
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:49,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the regulations which I attached to the report

1140
01:24:49,938 --> 01:25:08,012
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, specifically provides, uh, that a public employee can hold an additional paid position, uh, with the, with a second employer where the only impediment to the employment arises because the second employer occupies premises pursuant to a contract or agreement with the public agency.

1141
01:25:08,753 --> 01:25:15,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so based upon that regulation and a review of other sections of the statute, uh, it's my opinion that there is no conflict.

1142
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:18,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Greenspan.

1143
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:20,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1144
01:25:20,632 --> 01:25:21,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1145
01:25:21,213 --> 01:25:22,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your report.

1146
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so did this report go through the state ethics commission?

1147
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:31,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that was what was requested at the time that the report was asked for.

1148
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:35,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with the commission.

1149
01:25:35,164 --> 01:25:40,288
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not issue the opinion, but I did speak to an attorney at the commission.

1150
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:44,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, did he email you his, um, his,

1151
01:25:45,171 --> 01:25:55,696
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not write an opinion, but they did reference to me that regulation that was attached, but there was no written opinion from the Ethics Commission.

1152
01:25:56,036 --> 01:25:58,477
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding was that the committee wanted an opinion from me.

1153
01:25:58,537 --> 01:26:03,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know they wanted a- No, it was to get an opinion from the State Ethics Commission.

1154
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:08,082
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what was requested, but I have no problem with this.

1155
01:26:08,182 --> 01:26:14,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're open and honest with all dealings, with any businesses that are also renting

1156
01:26:14,773 --> 01:26:27,842
[SPEAKER_07]: community schools, and that it's out there so that there is no impression by anyone in our community that anything is other than forthright.

1157
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:32,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really the request.

1158
01:26:32,973 --> 01:26:43,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Intent because I have great respect for the people that work in our community But we just need to make sure everybody in our community understands where we stand We're open and honest years.

1159
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:51,163
[SPEAKER_07]: We run this international college school in our building Some of our administrators and some of our teachers are employed there.

1160
01:26:51,683 --> 01:27:00,488
[SPEAKER_07]: We are well aware of it They only work for them at those hours and not during school hours that we're renting them at the same rent and

1161
01:27:00,918 --> 01:27:05,981
[SPEAKER_07]: and time and usage as we rent to other people, just because our employees are there.

1162
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:07,302
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no deals given.

1163
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:10,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want it to be clear.

1164
01:27:10,384 --> 01:27:12,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, honestly, that's what I'm looking for.

1165
01:27:12,345 --> 01:27:20,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Communication, transparency, and putting it all on the table so that there's no little innuendos or questions asked.

1166
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:24,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they are asked, we can stand up here and answer them directly and honestly.

1167
01:27:24,932 --> 01:27:26,173
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the intent of

1168
01:27:26,656 --> 01:27:28,257
[SPEAKER_07]: of requesting this information.

1169
01:27:28,317 --> 01:27:32,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know sometimes it seems like there's more behind it, there really isn't.

1170
01:27:33,859 --> 01:27:42,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So given this, are we charging them the exact rate or we're charging other people that are using the same time and amount of our facility?

1171
01:27:43,002 --> 01:27:50,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So by our rules, people who have extended use of our facilities can negotiate some of the rates, that's by our rules.

1172
01:27:50,905 --> 01:27:52,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we take about $60,000 a year from them

1173
01:27:54,194 --> 01:27:57,855
[SPEAKER_10]: for about five sessions of maybe 20 courses that are run during the year.

1174
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:02,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty consistent with what our revenue would be.

1175
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:06,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And we obviously update it over time as they use facilities.

1176
01:28:06,857 --> 01:28:08,557
[SPEAKER_10]: If they use more facilities, we'll charge them more.

1177
01:28:08,577 --> 01:28:10,838
[SPEAKER_10]: If they use less, we'll obviously modify it down.

1178
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So we consider that consistent.

1179
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:19,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So in your opinion, the people that work for this program

1180
01:28:20,147 --> 01:28:24,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not interfering with their day job and their day job's not interfering.

1181
01:28:24,891 --> 01:28:31,217
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, at this point in time, I don't think there's anyone in our faculty or administration that's actually teaching a course right now.

1182
01:28:31,757 --> 01:28:37,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, it happens sporadically, but if it happens, it could happen.

1183
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:40,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just teaching, it's administrating, too, as well.

1184
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, same thing.

1185
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:46,610
[SPEAKER_10]: The only contact that we do with them is through our offices to set up the contract for use.

1186
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:47,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after that,

1187
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:57,641
[SPEAKER_10]: If they want someone or the person has to be selected by them, by the way, we don't have any, any, let's say ability to influence who they select.

1188
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:01,202
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so I don't tell them who to tell you who can teach.

1189
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:07,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so I feel like the intent of my request has been fulfilled.

1190
01:29:08,705 --> 01:29:11,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for the report and thank you for your time.

1191
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:12,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Greenspan.

1192
01:29:13,143 --> 01:29:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1193
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:15,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to receive.

1194
01:29:16,824 --> 01:29:17,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

1195
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:19,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

1196
01:29:19,245 --> 01:29:20,125
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1197
01:29:20,845 --> 01:29:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1198
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:22,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1199
01:29:24,106 --> 01:29:26,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, wanted to make an announcement?

1200
01:29:26,046 --> 01:29:27,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple of quick things.

1201
01:29:27,307 --> 01:29:30,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I want to pass this out to each of you.

1202
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:36,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this is a, um, something that I want to pass it down.

1203
01:29:36,489 --> 01:29:39,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that I acquired yesterday when I was in Newport.

1204
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:40,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

1205
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:56,217
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good timing kind of thing, because what it is is a letter from George Washington to the first Jewish synagogue in America in Newport, Rhode Island.

1206
01:29:56,277 --> 01:30:06,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's also references to Washington speaking to other congregations of other denominations in 1890, 1790, rather.

1207
01:30:10,931 --> 01:30:21,700
[SPEAKER_10]: It's particularly appropriate because Washington at the time was asked whether or not there would be any discrimination in America against religion.

1208
01:30:22,661 --> 01:30:39,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you read the letter from Washington, which is perhaps one of the most famous letters of all time, and I wanted to share it with you because I've got copies, he basically said that in this country, he's going to get the actual

1209
01:30:40,574 --> 01:31:01,666
[SPEAKER_10]: wording that there would be no toleration of bigotry and there would be no allowance for discrimination.

1210
01:31:02,446 --> 01:31:09,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very useful kind of thing because it predates the signing of the Bill of Rights by one year.

1211
01:31:13,274 --> 01:31:23,319
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1791, New Jersey, on the same date as yesterday, the 19th of November, was the first state to sign the Bill of Rights.

1212
01:31:24,559 --> 01:31:37,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we go through a period where we sometimes hear people saying things about hatred and other issues that we talked about tonight, it goes right back to George Washington, who says basically,

1213
01:31:39,883 --> 01:31:47,626
[SPEAKER_10]: For happily, the government of the United States will give bigotry no sanction, and to persecution no assistance.

1214
01:31:48,426 --> 01:31:59,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It requires that only they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving all the occasions of their effectual support."

1215
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:02,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's basically saying, no bigotry, no discrimination.

1216
01:32:03,571 --> 01:32:09,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's absolutely totally appropriate at this time as we see some of the hateful activity that sometimes has found its way

1217
01:32:11,182 --> 01:32:12,502
[SPEAKER_10]: into our country in recent times.

1218
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:14,283
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just thought you might enjoy it.

1219
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:17,403
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also some listings of other congregations that he spoke to.

1220
01:32:18,363 --> 01:32:33,426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's quite impressive that this place survived as long as it is in its original form, pretty much original form, going through several periods where it was not allowed to exist by different groups, by the British and by others.

1221
01:32:33,466 --> 01:32:37,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So just something that you might have and could use

1222
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:38,513
[SPEAKER_10]: in your work.

1223
01:32:38,813 --> 01:32:39,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1224
01:32:39,934 --> 01:32:42,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing that I just want to mention is in your folder.

1225
01:32:44,116 --> 01:32:50,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Susan Altman, who did the mural at the Roberts, also did a mural for the Family Network recently.

1226
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Gorgeous, beautiful.

1227
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,961
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get a chance, go take a look at it.

1228
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we can't say she did the mural.

1229
01:32:55,702 --> 01:32:56,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids did the mural.

1230
01:32:56,582 --> 01:32:58,984
[SPEAKER_08]: The families all put the mural together.

1231
01:32:59,044 --> 01:33:00,044
[SPEAKER_10]: She guided the mural.

1232
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:01,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was really terrific.

1233
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:02,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw it the other day.

1234
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:07,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, it shows a transformation of, you know,

1235
01:33:08,298 --> 01:33:13,563
[SPEAKER_10]: of how things work, how families work and transform themselves, how communities transform themselves.

1236
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,765
[SPEAKER_10]: It's quite, quite something to be seen.

1237
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:21,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be displayed in the family network, uh, in this hole in the wall that they had.

1238
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the hole in the wall project.

01:36:50,831 --> 01:36:57,034
