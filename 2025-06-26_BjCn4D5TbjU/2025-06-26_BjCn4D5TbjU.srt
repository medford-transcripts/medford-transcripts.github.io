1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:05,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I think that we have most everybody here.

2
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And Andre may join us a little bit later.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,653
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, before we get the meeting going, I should say that I understand.

4
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:25,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So Andre, I believe is not no longer the chair has, you know, his term formally ended at the end of last month and

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: We may see him on another board.

6
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:35,704
[SPEAKER_06]: But I haven't spoken to anybody ahead of this meeting about facilitating the meeting.

7
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:45,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And unless, Jackie, unless you were expecting to facilitate the meeting, in which case, happy to cede the floor to you.

8
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:51,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to manage until we get to kind of some of the election pieces later.

9
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of want to put that out to the members.

10
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

11
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was a little confused on that part without there being a chair.

12
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:10,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know if I was supposed to take over, but I know I also have not touched base with you prior to this meeting, so I prefer if you just go ahead and facilitate for this evening.

13
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, absolutely.

14
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:17,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, sorry for not being more communicative before this point.

15
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:24,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, we're going to open the meeting at 6.05, and I'm just going to read the governor's order here.

16
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

19
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will just call a quick roll.

20
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,098

[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd.

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

24
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,182
[SPEAKER_06]: David Bloomberg here.

25
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:05,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus on Jason.

26
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:06,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

27
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:10,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And our newest member, which I'm excited.

28
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we'll get to introduce tonight.

29
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Hedeman here.

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so maybe we take a moment just to say hello to Emily.

31
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to the board.

32
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very excited to have you.

33
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:41,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if you had any interest in making a brief introduction about yourself, feel free, but I also don't want to put you on the spot.

34
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:43,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

35
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:46,056
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys will learn soon enough that I'm not very shy.

36
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:49,684
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Emily Hedeman.

37
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in the Wellington Riverside neighborhood.

38
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a renter, I work in renewable energy.

39
00:02:57,369 --> 00:03:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two dogs, and I moved to the city of Medford in August of 2021.

40
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:09,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a very, very new resident, and I'm excited to contribute to the city of Medford.

41
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,848
[SPEAKER_05]: because I feel like it's already given me so much as a resident.

42
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for the opportunity to be on the board, to serve with you, fellow board members, and let's get the meeting started.

43
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

44
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:22,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Emily.

45
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:31,838
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, so first item on the agenda has to do with the approval of minutes from January 5th, 2022.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have any comments about the minutes?

47
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

48
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I would entertain a motion for approval.

49
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Amanda, this is Dave.

50
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, David.

51
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to offer a motion to approve the board's minutes of the meeting held January 5th, 2022.

52
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

53
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second?

54
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Christy my second?

55
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:07,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

56
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll do a roll call vote.

57
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jackie Furtado?

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

59
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:16,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd?

60
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:18,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

61
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:20,388
[SPEAKER_06]: David Bloomberg?

62
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

63
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:23,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Klaas Andreasen?

64
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:24,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

65
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:29,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, Emily, I think because you weren't there, you may not get to vote on this one.

66
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Either that or I'm going to abstain.

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,550
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So abstain.

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I believe we have our that's passed.

70
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:42,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, everybody.

71
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,626
[SPEAKER_06]: We can move along to the next item.

72
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me pull up my notes here.

73
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a public hearing.

74
00:04:53,727 --> 00:05:14,615
[SPEAKER_06]: for the proposed amendment to chapter 94 zoning to alter the zoning district designation of the area of land bounded by Boston Avenue to the southwest, North Street to the southeast and the MBTA railroad tracks to the northeast and the Summerville border to the northeast from industrial I to office 202.

75
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the proponents are available tonight.

76
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:21,436
[SPEAKER_06]: to speak to their position.

77
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:27,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And staff is also available to walk the board through this zoning change in more detail.

78
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:32,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Would the board like to hear from petitioners first?

79
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Amanda, if I can interrupt.

80
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:35,848
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Dave.

81
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:36,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

82
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to be employed by Cummings Properties.

83
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,293
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hear from Cummings Properties tonight.

84
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:47,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't continue to hold any financial interest in the organization.

85
00:05:47,566 --> 00:06:01,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be best practice to recuse myself from the deliberations tonight because of the small size of the parcel and so much of it being comprised of land owned by Cummings.

86
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:09,532
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will mute myself and eliminate the video during the discussions.

87
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:11,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

88
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, David.

89
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, this is Jackie vice chair.

90
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:27,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So, with David refusing himself, do we have enough to vote on it, I know the DNA is not feeling well tonight but if she's still on the board I thought she was in the same position as Andre with her.

91
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:28,523
[SPEAKER_03]: term expiring?

92
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:36,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we will have enough people to vote tonight as there's still four folks, which is a majority of the seven board members.

93
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:41,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And regarding Deanna, I'm glad that you brought that up.

94
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:45,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had misunderstood in thinking that the

95
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:52,886
[SPEAKER_06]: once the term limit was up June 30th, that board members could no longer serve on the board.

96
00:06:53,606 --> 00:07:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I've been informed by Alicia, who has actually reached out to legal counsel about this in the past, if a position is not yet filled, the current board member can continue as an on hold status until that position is filled.

97
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:12,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they can continue to vote in that interim.

98
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've spoken with Deanna

99
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:18,349
[SPEAKER_06]: ahead of now and she's comfortable moving forward with that.

100
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

101
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:39,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so perhaps maybe I believe I see Mike Avini on the call as well as John Walsh who are proponents who had put this petition forward originally.

102
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I invite Mike first to speak about this if you would like.

103
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:47,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

104
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:48,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

105
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:49,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Amanda.

106
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:51,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

107
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:58,573
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Michael Avani I'm an architect with Cummings properties on behalf of Simmons properties for the benefit of the Cummings Foundation.

108
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having us here tonight.

109
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:09,982
[SPEAKER_01]: For clarification, the request that Cummings properties and Simmons properties has before.

110
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,652
[SPEAKER_01]: the City Council and then subsequently the Planning Board.

111
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:21,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It is separate and distinct from the, although the same different property from Mr. Walsh's property.

112
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:35,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here tonight seeking the Community Development Board support regarding our petition that is before the City Council, seeking to change the zoning designation of the properties at 196 and 200 Boston Avenue from industrial

113
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,222
[SPEAKER_01]: to the newly created office to zoning district.

114
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:48,888
[SPEAKER_01]: As such, we, we asked the recording in progress can recordings in progress.

115
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:54,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked the board to consider our request and provide a positive recommendation to the city council on this matter.

116
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:58,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

117
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:05,518
[SPEAKER_01]: the planning, the community on the board here is familiar with the zoning change.

118
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:20,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know at this point if you have any questions specific to our petition regarding the zoning change and our request to be put into the 02 zoning district, but I'd be happy to answer any questions.

119
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:24,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Mike.

120
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:33,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I might ask, before we go into questions, if John Walsh would like to provide any testimony as well.

121
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you, Amanda.

122
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, members of the Planning and Development Board, Metric residents, ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:50,832
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is John Walsh, and I am a petitioner for amending the zoning map to include four parcels located on Boston Avenue.

124
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:57,185
[SPEAKER_07]: all would be within the newly created Office 2 zoning district.

125
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: As the petition reflects, the parcels are 222, 230, 236 Boston Avenue, and 67 North Street.

126
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the president and treasurer of Elizabeth Grady Properties and the managing member of 236 Boston Avenue LLC, 67 North Street LLC,

127
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,556
[SPEAKER_07]: and I have the authority to make all decisions.

128
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:34,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The parcels mentioned are currently located in the industrial zone and comprise approximately 1.4 acres.

129
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:48,609
[SPEAKER_07]: The sites are contiguous and in close proximity to the newly constructed Medford Tufts Greenline Station, which will allow for convenient access to additional public transportation to the site.

130
00:10:50,355 --> 00:11:01,137
[SPEAKER_07]: With the progressive creation of a new zoning district by the council and the planning board, the site is now poised for life science, among other research and development companies.

131
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:20,081
[SPEAKER_07]: The conversion of these fossils from industrial to O2 would allow for more modern buildings, a substantial increase in tax revenue, gainful employment within the city, and create a mixed use area of opportunity

132
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,350
[SPEAKER_07]: which doesn't currently exist in that area.

133
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, along with more green space.

134
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:38,281
[SPEAKER_07]: The property locations clearly seem to comport with what was intended by the city planning board and city council in creating the O2 district.

135
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:49,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And in conclusion, I would respectfully request approval of this petition as an amendment along with Cummings properties at all, the zoning map.

136
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would thank you for your consideration.

137
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, John.

138
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome, Miranda.

139
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:03,049
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

140
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:12,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think maybe what I'll do is we'll share the map that we have that shows these locations.

141
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you'll just give me one moment.

142
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:32,107
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, can folks see this?

143
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Vic, are you gonna?

144
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:39,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

145
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,223
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Victor Schrader.

146
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the director of economic development.

147
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Walk us through these slides.

148
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:53,468
[SPEAKER_08]: We pulled these together just to show the board and the public what's being considered this evening.

149
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The properties highlighted in red are those owned by proponent John Walsh.

150
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:03,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the four properties that he mentioned in his opening remarks.

151
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, if you flip

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,921
[SPEAKER_08]: to the next one.

153
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:14,604
[SPEAKER_08]: We just pull pull them at parcel maps that can move on.

154
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:20,307
[SPEAKER_08]: This is showing the if you go back up actually.

155
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:22,668
[SPEAKER_08]: This the red.

156
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:27,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Boxer John Walsh's property, the light lighter red.

157
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide.

158
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:51,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the parcels, the four parcels that Mr. Walsh mentioned in the corner of Boston Avenue and North Street.

159
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:52,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide.

160
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:04,397
[SPEAKER_08]: This slide represents the entire industrial district, so it includes properties owned by Mr. Walsh and incoming properties as they are today.

161
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:13,636
[SPEAKER_08]: That encompasses the entire area that would be changed from industrial to office, too.

162
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide.

163
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, parcel map.

164
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's all.

165
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, I think it might be helpful for the public and the board to show the table.

166
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:43,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you go off this slide, I was actually, there's a bunch of stuff on the top that sort of looks like it might be parcel lines, but I think that what that was was easements, right?

167
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:54,519
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to state definitively that there is one parcel that is fully owned by Cummings, and then there are the five owned by John Walsh, there's four, five.

168
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are all of the entirety of the owners of the parcels in this industrial district.

169
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:10,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to be explicit that there is not somebody else's property that's getting grouped in here or anything like that.

170
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just looking at the top there.

171
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,391
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a bunch of lines.

172
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe those are easements, right?

173
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are not.

174
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Avini, I think, can speak to that, or he's giving me the thumbs up.

175
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I'd be happy to, if you don't mind.

176
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:38,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, what we're seeing on the screen, the lot N05-7 is what we call 200 Boston Ave, which is formally known as 200 Boston Ave, currently known as, formally known as 200 Boston Ave.

177
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:42,368
[SPEAKER_01]: The N05-6 is a little piece of the 196 Boston Ave lot.

178
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So that lot kind of straddles,

179
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,795
[SPEAKER_01]: that building in the lot straddle some of OEM metric.

180
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:54,978
[SPEAKER_01]: We just like the whole of the properties that are managed by the company to be included in this.

181
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would indeed be the two lots.

182
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:04,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, the dash lines you see are the ones that go kind of from Boston out to the train tracks, if you will.

183
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,922
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an MWRA easement.

184
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the curved one is, but

185
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're 100% accurate.

186
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to clarify that we do have two pieces of property there.

187
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:26,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to be very explicit to everybody that there is no discussion of properties owned by somebody other than the two entities here this evening.

188
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

189
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:46,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And saying that also, Alicia and Victor, can you actually explain to the board and for the public purposes, and I believe someone asked this in the chat, can you back up a little bit and give us the difference between industrial and office two, especially with someone asking if it is going to have any effect on green line extension?

190
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming that means because usually industrial has less public interaction where offices, commercial would have more.

191
00:16:55,263 --> 00:17:02,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm guessing that's maybe a transportation sort of question, but if you can just back up and explain that for the record.

192
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, thank you very much.

193
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That's in fact what Victor was going to next.

194
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:14,704
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the table showing the industrial zoning and the office two zoning.

195
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Victor's prepared to speak to that.

196
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:23,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there are a couple of different distinctions between Office 2 and industrials.

197
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:31,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the most significant are in the dimensional table, what is allowed to be built in each district.

198
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see I included some of the other commercial districts just to give you context.

199
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:42,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But Office 2 is the top line, and this is what

200
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,804
[SPEAKER_08]: the zoning ordinance.

201
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:52,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So really we just pulled pulled it out and simplified it a little bit for this context.

202
00:17:54,546 --> 00:18:00,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently in the industrial district, there's a high restriction of 30 feet, two stories.

203
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:05,830
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see some front, side, and rear setbacks.

204
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:13,113
[SPEAKER_08]: The lot area, and this is a minimum permitted, is 10,000 square feet and above.

205
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the frontage of an industrial lot and industrial district must be 35 feet in order to be built.

206
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:25,769
[SPEAKER_08]: In the office too, we've increased the height in the stories.

207
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:36,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Really the intention is to allow for more modern office buildings, mixed-use office buildings specifically, and to accommodate lab, which

208
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,622
[SPEAKER_08]: and life science uses which have different requirements than traditional office buildings.

209
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,043
[SPEAKER_08]: They need higher floor to ceiling heights.

210
00:18:48,704 --> 00:19:04,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we feel we've accommodated those in the height here and the stories while also trying to maintain some sensitivity to the context of the neighborhood and the buildings that are already in the district.

211
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:20,529
[SPEAKER_08]: The existing Cummings building on the site 200 Boston Ave is, correct me if I'm wrong, but around 60 feet to the roof, not including rooftop mechanicals.

212
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:25,531
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going a little beyond that here, but really just one floor.

213
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:32,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's important to mention that

214
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:33,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

215
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:43,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout Medford any relief from these dimensional requirements is typically by variance the new zoning permits.

216
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Relief by special permit.

217
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a slightly different process.

218
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,617
[SPEAKER_08]: But any large-scale projects that are above 10,000

219
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:00,405
[SPEAKER_08]: the zoning requirements.

220
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:07,709
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as ask for relief by special permit 3rd if they're not meeting any of these zoning requirements that are that are here.

221
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,970
[SPEAKER_08]: These dimensional requirements.

222
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,571
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some differences in uses as well.

223
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, we we're trying to.

224
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Transition this or the zoning.

225
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,575
[SPEAKER_08]: The office to district

226
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:37,179
[SPEAKER_08]: commercial office with first floor retail or restaurants to fit into the neighborhood a little bit better.

227
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:44,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Office 2 District allows for office, it allows for lab.

228
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: It also allows for retail and restaurants and consumer services.

229
00:20:50,977 --> 00:21:02,080
[SPEAKER_08]: The industrial district was, as you would imagine, focused more on auto uses, storage, wholesale, manufacturing, those types of uses.

230
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of those have gone away or would go away if the Office 2 district was approved here.

231
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:12,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So those aren't allowed in the Office 2 district.

232
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all I had in terms of a comparison.

233
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,725
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone has any questions on that, I'm happy to answer them.

234
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:35,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Jackie,

235
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:36,674
[SPEAKER_08]: there.

236
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:42,036
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the question in the chat about would there be any effect on the green line extension.

237
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:49,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And not to our knowledge, this none of these properties kind of impedes on the rail line there.

238
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,320
[SPEAKER_08]: There has been contemplation of

239
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:11,361
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't believe that there would be any impact to the possibility of that given this change.

240
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:23,428
[SPEAKER_11]: So before that we get to board questions, I think it would actually be helpful to just highlight, I feel like there's an elephant in the room question.

241
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:28,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, it's literally, oh, I shouldn't have referred to you guys as elephants, I apologize.

242
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:42,802
[SPEAKER_11]: that one of the questions is what the city's three comprehensive plan to understand why what zoning change, we would like to see where, and we, it would be premature to make zoning changes in advance of that.

243
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,644
[SPEAKER_11]: However, there are market forces at work here.

244
00:22:46,725 --> 00:23:04,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is one of those, so it happened that, I'm gonna tell you, it was chance that our comprehensive plan consultants are in fact here this evening to talk to us about the comprehensive plan and what is in it at the same night as that we're having this public hearing on a zoning change.

245
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:09,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had asked them if asked, they are prepared, they could say a few words about it.

246
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,253
[SPEAKER_11]: But we basically saw this from the offices.

247
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: This is some stuff that we know people really would like to do.

248
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:21,156
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been talking to Mr. Walsh for quite a while about how he would like to develop his property.

249
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:27,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Cummings, as you're aware, had brought a project forward and then had trouble with the zoning board.

250
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:43,556
[SPEAKER_11]: As recently as the last Zoning Board meeting, the Zoning Board had actually, a project came in front of them and their big question is, why aren't you changing the zoning first and then rather than asking us for these variances?

251
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:48,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically the answer is that the market is moving so fast and there are opportunities right now.

252
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:52,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd like to take advantage of these opportunities.

253
00:23:52,864 --> 00:24:05,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, this zoning change is very much in line with what we are seeing from the comprehensive plan, what we are seeing from the public comments, from the research that's being done.

254
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:16,776
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't wanna speak too much for our comprehensive plan consultants, but I did say to them, is this in line with what we're seeing coming out of your thing?

255
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:34,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And it didn't make sense to us to wait for a couple of months when these property owners would really like to actually move on their properties now and to make them wait unnecessarily for a zoning change that would be

256
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,509
[SPEAKER_11]: very reasonably come from us later.

257
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:46,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It also feels better to us that if a zoning change is to come from the property owners, then it's not the city doing it to them.

258
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It's them saying, this is how we'd like to see our development go.

259
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:58,599
[SPEAKER_11]: So Brie and Emily, we haven't introduced you yet, but would you guys be comfortable in saying if the board would like you to?

260
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm seeing some nods.

261
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that okay with the board?

262
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:08,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to hear from the comprehensive plan consultants about this matter?

263
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:12,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Or do you have other questions first?

264
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:18,184
[SPEAKER_05]: No other questions.

265
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little curious about the current uses of the site.

266
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe another attendee echoes that question, but

267
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:36,805
[SPEAKER_05]: just seeing what's there, it looks like there's a big building and a couple of small buildings.

268
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more curious about the small buildings.

269
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me what's going on there now?

270
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:45,468
[SPEAKER_07]: This is John Walsh.

271
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:46,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, John.

272
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:46,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

273
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the owner of Walsh.

274
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so the building at 222 Boston Avenue houses the Elizabeth Grady Company.

275
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:05,459
[SPEAKER_07]: In the front building at 230 Boston Avenue, that's warehouse and distribution storage.

276
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: The building next to it is used for storage as well.

277
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:15,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's 236 Boston Avenue, I'm sorry.

278
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:20,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And then 67 North Street that sits on the corner of Boston Avenue and

279
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:36,862
[SPEAKER_07]: North Street was a upholstery company in which the gentleman actually passed away, and a monument company next to it, and the two families.

280
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:46,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, John.

281
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:48,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that background.

282
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:48,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

283
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily, are you familiar with 200 Boston Ave?

284
00:26:57,547 --> 00:27:00,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like Mike to speak to that?

285
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:01,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be helpful.

286
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

287
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:08,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.

288
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:11,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you, Emily and Victor.

289
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:19,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so 200 Boston Ave currently is, it was formerly, from what I understand, a mattress factory.

290
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:23,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this beautiful kind of cast in place concrete

291
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,874
[SPEAKER_01]: old mill building from around the 1920s.

292
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:30,476
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been repurposed now.

293
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:36,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It is filled with life science companies, predominantly life science companies.

294
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,681
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a gym downstairs.

295
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:46,205
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point in time, the Medford Public Library moved there while their main facility was being renovated.

296
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:50,508
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some accessory office spaces there as well.

297
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:58,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Our highest and best use for that building would continue the life science program.

298
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:02,471
[SPEAKER_11]: is.

299
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:03,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Emily.

300
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:04,694
[SPEAKER_11]: You may not be aware.

301
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:07,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So Cummings had put together a proposal.

302
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:16,907
[SPEAKER_11]: The building in front is a parking lot, and they had put together a proposal to make that a second life science lab building.

303
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:22,212
[SPEAKER_11]: And that proposal had trouble with the zoning.

304
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:31,018
[SPEAKER_11]: basically it went through this board, it went through site plan review, and then it did not get the zoning variances that it requested.

305
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:36,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So they actually had tried to put Build Life Science there.

306
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:41,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will sort of add to that, part of the reason for moving is that

307
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:52,342
[SPEAKER_11]: This city would like to see new development we'd like to see increased taxes, we'd like to, without having to raise the taxes on our current residents.

308
00:28:53,062 --> 00:29:04,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So, newly developed buildings additional buildings would bring in significant new growth revenue to the city, and the longer we push that down the longer we wait for that to happen.

309
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,669
[SPEAKER_11]: which is part of why we're bringing that forward now.

310
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:18,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Those of us who work in the city are very aware that there was a difficult budget discussions over the past few months with this question about where's the revenue coming from?

311
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:19,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Revenue comes from new growth.

312
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

313
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:22,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I add something.

314
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,102
[SPEAKER_07]: This is John Walsh.

315
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,565
[SPEAKER_07]: May I add some color to what you just stated?

316
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:31,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, John.

317
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:43,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The currently, from a tax liability perspective on the four buildings that I own, the annual taxes are $100,126, with an assessed value of $5,598,700.

318
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,814
[SPEAKER_07]: For the change on that site for a future, a complete stabilized analysis, the assessed value on that property would bring in

319
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:04,940
[SPEAKER_07]: property taxes.

320
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:14,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on around a couple 100,000 square feet similar to Cummings, the tax liability of the tax proceeds to the city would change from $100,126 currently.

321
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:14,462
[SPEAKER_07]: $2,900,000 per

322
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:35,382
[SPEAKER_05]: to work out in your favor.

323
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:39,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else was to move forward smoothly.

324
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: What sort of timeline are you looking at in terms of either completing additional construction on the site with life science or redevelopment of the site with the smaller structures on it?

325
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you asking me, John Walsh, the question?

326
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's both.

327
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:08,857
[SPEAKER_05]: These are separate projects, but we're proposing the rezoning together, essentially.

328
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

329
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:25,572
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may speak first, if you don't mind, is I've had a plethora of inquiries from life science companies over the past two years.

330
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,014
[SPEAKER_07]: that we initially broached this with the city.

331
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:39,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say, as I mentioned, there's a number of companies that are anxious to move forward imminently, when I say imminently, this summer.

332
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:45,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but no LOI or anything in hand at this point?

333
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:48,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I have four LOIs in hand.

334
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:49,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, perfect.

335
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:50,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

336
00:31:55,893 --> 00:32:02,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it sounds like the Cummings redevelopment would also accelerate pretty quickly based on the plans you guys have.

337
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:04,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

338
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:18,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had been, as mentioned earlier, we had been in front of the Community Development Board twice last year and brought this project through.

339
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:24,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time we had a tenant who was looking to expand

340
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,518
[SPEAKER_01]: We really had a lot of interest in it.

341
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:34,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequently, when we didn't get to where we needed to be, we kind of back-burnered it a little bit.

342
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:42,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And just recently, as the last month, we have continued to think about how this could happen again.

343
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:46,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, again, more clients in the building that would like to expand.

344
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:51,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is definitely something that is on our front burner.

345
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:53,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Schedule-wise, it certainly isn't

346
00:32:54,373 --> 00:33:03,645
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't it this summer project uh construction takes a little time but we you know if we could if we have the interest in this um we could

347
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: we could move as soon as first quarter of next year, really to kind of get shovels on the ground.

348
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:19,438
[SPEAKER_01]: That is if everything goes well and that'd be kind of the soonest construction date.

349
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:25,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Mr. Walsh had mentioned, people are chomping at the bit for this type of space.

350
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:32,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pretty optimistic that this is something that could really work.

351
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

352
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:35,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any more questions.

353
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:42,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess, sorry, I keep thinking of things that would be helpful for the board.

354
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:50,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So when the Cummings project was being considered, they did a public meeting outside of the public hearing process.

355
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:56,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a lot of interest and support in seeing a life science building there.

356
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,627
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people who would love to be able to walk to work.

357
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,368
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some concerns.

358
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:10,435
[SPEAKER_11]: They tended to be concerns that were involved not having a thorough understanding of what kind of life science would be allowed in Medford.

359
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:19,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And that we have rules and the ones that you would be scared of are not allowed to be in the city of Medford.

360
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:21,623
[SPEAKER_11]: There's plenty of interest from the ones that

361
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,943
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody would be comfortable with.

362
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,284
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go into more detail if that's helpful.

363
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:30,204
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also just want to be clear that this would change the zoning.

364
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:49,488
[SPEAKER_11]: So if either or both property owners proposed a project that was then allowed as of right, the size of those buildings would still require them to come through site plan review for this body to work with the look, the feel, the shapes, the details.

365
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:50,669
[SPEAKER_11]: on it.

366
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And if either of them still wanted any variances, they would still have to go to the zoning board for variances.

367
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:02,785
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we've basically heard from the zoning board is

368
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:11,245
[SPEAKER_11]: a height variance should be coming through as a zoning change first, which is why they're coming here first for the zoning change.

369
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:19,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And this board will make a recommendation and ultimately it is the city council that will actually vote on it.

370
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:30,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be clear for anybody who is listening, any decision by this board is not an actual change or denial of zoning, it is a recommendation

371
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:34,663
[SPEAKER_11]: to the city council who is still the decision maker on this request.

372
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:37,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn it back over to you.

373
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:41,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia just to clarify under the office to district.

374
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Any relief from dimensional relief.

375
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:50,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they want to go a little higher than what's allowed in the district or a little wider.

376
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all by special permit.

377
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Variance under the office to

378
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:16,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So are there other other questions from the board?

379
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:23,782
[SPEAKER_11]: There are also members of the public that we can open it up to.

380
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:33,325
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are no questions from the board, then we should open, this is a public hearing.

381
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:38,126
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll wanna open up to the public for any questions.

382
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:50,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so if any members of the public would like to provide a comment, you can do so by raising your hand and I'll call on you and you can unmute.

383
00:36:51,913 --> 00:37:02,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'll put the office email in the chat in case you'd like to provide anything in writing that way before the end of the hearing.

384
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

385
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:14,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Kayla.

386
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:24,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm curious, I've heard a little bit about the Walkland Court redevelopment, which is the property to the north owned by the Medford Housing Authority.

387
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:39,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any chat, talk about how large those, I mean, I don't know when that project would be happening, but I'm curious whether the heights would sort, for anyone that's concerned about the height differential in the O2 district versus

388
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:45,444
[SPEAKER_14]: industrial district, like what is the relationship across those properties kind of as a whole.

389
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:58,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Kayla actually I looked at the latest walk on court plan yesterday, thinking this might come up and they do propose to

390
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:05,109
[SPEAKER_08]: higher density buildings along the southern edge of that, of their property.

391
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was shown in the plans that I found was five stories.

392
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:19,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are residential, so that in terms of total height, they'll be a little shorter, but five stories is what they're showing there.

393
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

394
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Six stories, five stories.

395
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:26,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

396
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:32,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kayla, I'm sorry, could you provide your full name and address for the record?

397
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure Kayla Bachman at 604 Fulton Street.

398
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:37,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

399
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:45,525
[SPEAKER_06]: EB, I saw you might have been interested in providing a comment.

400
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:51,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sorry, I was trying to rename myself there.

401
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:52,506
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Elizabeth Bale.

402
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:56,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, just your address for the record as well?

403
00:38:58,026 --> 00:38:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: 34 Emory Street.

404
00:38:59,567 --> 00:38:59,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

405
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:05,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yeah, so I just had a couple of things as I put in the chat earlier.

406
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:11,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to know whether the existing structures were nonconforming or whether there was anything nonconforming about them.

407
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:22,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also just wanted to, um, say again for the record that I am concerned that nothing about changing the zoning or

408
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:40,763
[SPEAKER_13]: the projects that are considered will interfere with eventually extending the green line as was the preferred alternative to Route 16, Mystic Valley Parkway as the terminus.

409
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:43,826
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are my concerns.

410
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:44,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

411
00:39:51,576 --> 00:40:01,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will just say that we've looked at, we don't see any way that the zoning change would impact a potential Green Line extension.

412
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:09,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And all of the property that has been thought of with relation to that is not in this zoning district.

413
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,668
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, most if not all of it is actually in Somerville.

414
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:19,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I can't speak to the building of any buildings because there are no buildings proposed.

415
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:24,489
[SPEAKER_11]: This does still require correct me if I'm wrong, Victor, a 15 ft setback.

416
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:34,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that shouldn't be cause any difficulty if the green line extension were to go forward.

417
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:46,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess I just want to say that when we were very heavily meeting about the extension with the preferred alternative to mystic Valley Parkway.

418
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:58,152
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a lot of concern about 200 Boston have because it actually extends into an area that the fire.

419
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:14,779
[SPEAKER_13]: department had some problem with the amount of clearance with the tracks and, um, and they had an adjustment they wanted to make with the building might have precluded, um, something to do with the extension.

420
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:20,182
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want people to be aware of that and that it's a concern.

421
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for for bringing that up.

422
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:31,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

423
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to hear that people are still pushing for it.

424
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:43,356
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have.

425
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:53,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say that, Amanda, that we have some, if there are no more public comments here, we have some letters from the public.

426
00:41:53,954 --> 00:42:00,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I'm happy to share, so we have two letters that, I put them both in the meeting materials folder.

427
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me pull up, and I can read them into the record if folks want.

428
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll do that, since there's only two.

429
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and so this is from the Medford Chamber of Commerce President, Maury Carroll.

430
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:26,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in summary, it's a letter of support.

431
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can just read a segment here.

432
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:34,279
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Chamber of Commerce is expressing its support for additional life science development in the city of Medford.

433
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:44,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand that life science companies and developers have specific requirements relating to building design, such as increased ceiling height, large floor plates, additional storage, and preferred building amenities.

434
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:53,067
[SPEAKER_06]: that may not be in alignment with existing land use policy, the newly created Office 2 District was specifically created to encourage this type of development.

435
00:42:54,007 --> 00:43:06,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I may just summarize here that it says the chamber is ready to work with the city, city officials, staff, and stakeholders to create an environment that fosters, supports, and encourages development of this type.

436
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:13,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe that doing so will ultimately support existing Medford businesses and attract additional economic development to the city.

437
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:23,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one additional letter that was submitted by Ken Kraus of 50 Mystic Street.

438
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:34,508
[SPEAKER_06]: This letter is to register my support for the proposed amendment to the city of Medford zoning map to change the zoning district designation from industrial to office two.

439
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:45,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The office to zoning category created in the city's recently complete zoning regulations update is appropriate for this area, given its current uses and proposed additions.

440
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:53,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Long past are the days when the site was home to industrial operations such as the Union Paste Company, American Wool and Company, and Container Corporation of America.

441
00:43:54,323 --> 00:44:02,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the last three decades, the site has been transformed into largely office use and increasingly laboratory and life science space, with more of the latter planned soon.

442
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:11,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to just summarize some of the points here.

443
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward, in addition to approving their petitions, I would suggest that the Community Development Board encourage both proponents to work closely together as their future projects unfold, especially in the area of transportation demand management and efforts to minimize the volume of automobile traffic to the site.

444
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:41,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Some possible collaborative measures could include publicly supporting and making a financial contribution to advancing plans for the Green Line station proposed to be constructed next to the site.

445
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposing reductions in bus service to the site, such as the MBTA's current plans to eliminate

446
00:44:47,714 --> 00:45:12,335
[SPEAKER_06]: route 80 bus, supporting the ongoing efforts of the Mystic River Watershed Association and Department of Conservation and Recreation to enhance the bicycle and pedestrian network in the area with connections to West Medford commuter rail station, considering ways to minimize parking and share parking areas, electric vehicle charging stations, and shared covered bicycle parking areas, initiating the creation of

447
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:31,209
[SPEAKER_06]: a nonprofit transportation management association, such as the Charles River TMA, in conjunction with the City of Medford Chamber of Commerce and Tufts to provide and promote sustainable transportation options for commuters and residents to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility and air quality.

448
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your consideration.

449
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:43,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just checking our email and it looks that we have not received any additional comments.

450
00:45:54,549 --> 00:46:00,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So do any members of the board, do you want to hear from the comprehensive plan consultants?

451
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to offer a motion?

452
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any questions?

453
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,342
[SPEAKER_03]: this is Jackie vice chair.

454
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have a question overall with the zoning change over there.

455
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:19,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the industrial seems to have phased out over there, but the U-Haul that sits there, how would these align with the U-Haul that's right around the corner?

456
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to figure it out.

457
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:32,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I do need to see it more comprehensively and would like to know what the members of the comprehensive team thinks.

458
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:42,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So to be clear, the U-Haul is in Somerville, and we have no impact over Somerville zoning.

459
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:43,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

460
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:51,703
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's actually another Cummings building between this property and the U-Haul.

461
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:52,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

462
00:46:55,706 --> 00:47:01,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, I can speak to the comprehensive plan if it's appropriate at this point.

463
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:01,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

464
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Emily.

465
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:09,706
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the record, my name is Emily Ennis, I'm principal of Innes Associates and one of the team members, the comprehensive plan.

466
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:16,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of my role on the team is the analysis of zoning so we'll talk with you more tonight.

467
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:29,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Later on, but prior to this meeting, Alicia and Amanda reached out to us let us know what you'd be discussing and asked the team, if we felt that this would be appropriate.

468
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:52,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Given what we've heard on the comprehensive plan to date and what we were proposing for the city's review, and so we took a look at the plan to change the zoning districts the area was in and considered the goals of the comprehensive plan especially in relationship to new uses to job creation and workforce development.

469
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:59,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And in our opinion, this is consistent with the themes and the goals that have been developed through this planning process.

470
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to answer any further questions and obviously look forward to going into more depth later on.

471
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Emily.

472
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:23,372
[SPEAKER_11]: is the board.

473
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:24,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

474
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:27,714
[SPEAKER_11]: The first motion that we would actually need would be to close the public hearing.

475
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:32,816
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there could be deliberation if you Desire.

476
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make a

477
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:51,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

478
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado?

479
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:53,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

480
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:55,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd?

481
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:56,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

482
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:58,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Klaus Andreasen?

483
00:48:58,972 --> 00:48:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:00,812
Great.

485
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions from the board?

486
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:24,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

487
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:25,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

488
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:27,776
[SPEAKER_06]: If interested in.

489
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:37,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would entertain a motion to, um, recommend to City Council that this zoning be.

490
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:44,968
[SPEAKER_06]: The zoning designation of industrial be changed to vote.

491
00:49:44,988 --> 00:49:45,929
[SPEAKER_06]: If folks were looking for

492
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:56,699
[SPEAKER_04]: that the zoning be changed from industrial to office two.

493
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,361
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I miss?

494
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:03,583
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.

495
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:04,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

496
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a second?

497
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:08,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Jackie.

498
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I am seconding the motion.

499
00:50:13,148 --> 00:50:13,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

500
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:14,969
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a roll call vote.

00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:16,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Jackie Furtado?

502
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:17,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

503
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,531

00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:19,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

505
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:20,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Hedeman?

506
00:50:24,135 --> 00:50:24,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

507
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure whether I was unmuted or not.

508
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And class Andreessen.

509
00:50:29,357 --> 00:50:29,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

510
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,358
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and that motion is passed.

511
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:35,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everyone for your time on that.

512
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Procedurally Amanda has a, um,

513
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:49,647
[SPEAKER_11]: city council with the recommendation.

514
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:55,049
[SPEAKER_11]: We are actually, we should put it from the chair or an acting chair.

515
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:58,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that's later on the meeting, but that's kind of, that's it.

516
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:06,053
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually on the city council agenda for Tuesday night, this coming Tuesday for anybody who is interested in seeing that.

517
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:11,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And we anticipate sending them this document tomorrow morning or tonight.

518
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

519
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:17,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

520
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:24,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the members of the board and the members of the public and the members of the planning department.

521
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:30,840
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate all the effort you've put into this and we look forward to moving forward.

522
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:32,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

523
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:35,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time this evening.

524
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:36,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

525
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:43,681
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so our next item on the agenda is...

526
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:52,025
[SPEAKER_06]: our informational presentation and discussion of the comprehensive plan draft materials.

527
00:51:53,806 --> 00:52:01,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So we actually, we have here tonight, you've already heard a little bit from Emily Innes and also Brie Hensholdt.

528
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:04,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They're part of a consultant team that we've been working with.

529
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:07,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to see the floor to them.

530
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:13,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can introduce yourselves and yeah, get us started.

531
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:15,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great.

532
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:17,930
[SPEAKER_00]: We are happy to jump right in.

533
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:23,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a presentation to share that kind of informational update about the comprehensive plan.

534
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:28,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Brie Hensold with Agency, Landscape, and Planning here with Emily.

535
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,861
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll introduce you to the broader team and everyone who's helped shape this as well.

536
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Alicia, do you want to comment or you want me to just jump right in?

537
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:46,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the board has been getting regular updates from us, and they actually asked for this presentation.

538
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:53,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, I just missed, is it you or Emily who is giving the, there, I just made you both co-hosts.

539
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, sounds good.

540
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I will screen share.

541
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:05,620
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, could you just clarify for the board if you'd like them to jump in with questions or wait to the end or?

542
00:53:06,823 --> 00:53:07,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

543
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:11,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would be happy to take questions as they arise.

544
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take them.

545
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:19,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And Amanda, if you see hands that we miss or comments or anything like that, feel free to interrupt.

546
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:21,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Will do.

547
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:22,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

548
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:29,346
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you're all seeing my screen now.

549
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:36,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to share with you the status of the Medford Comprehensive Plan, the Citywide Plan.

550
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:38,328
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really glad to be here tonight.

551
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:44,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Really glad that the great planning team has been bringing you along and is giving us this chance to

552
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:53,437
[SPEAKER_00]: share the draft recommendations and get any of your feedback before this goes out to the community for feedback again next week.

553
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:57,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we head into the fall, we'll be looking ahead to an approval schedule.

554
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:11,105
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plan that's really been shaped by the community as well as a really dedicated steering committee that includes community members from all neighborhoods, different roles,

555
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:18,008
[SPEAKER_00]: youth, community leaders, business owners, residents, parents, environmental advocates.

556
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:26,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a very committed steering committee that has been with us for five meetings and a lot of time at public meetings as well.

557
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:33,477
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Jackie Furtado as part of the steering committee, who is also a connection to tonight.

558
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,269
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been introduced to me.

559
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a planner, and I'm joined by Emily Innes, our planner and project manager.

560
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:53,562
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some additional experts on the team, Arup for transportation and resilience consulting, economic development experts and CARP strategies.

561
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:59,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had kind of visualization and technology support who really helped us with engagement.

562
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:05,935
[SPEAKER_00]: which we needed more than we knew, because a lot of our engagement was online, thanks to COVID.

563
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:11,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to really have an interactive conversation with the community, thanks to having that support.

564
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:16,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the heart, really, I think this has been done hand in hand with the planning team.

565
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:21,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really grateful to their leadership throughout this.

566
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:32,164
[SPEAKER_00]: The project has been shaped over the better part of a year and a half now, and we've had really significant engagement all along the way.

567
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:47,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, we've had five steering committee meetings, four community engagement milestones, including going to Circle the Square most recently and sharing the recommendations with kind of a steady stream of community who passed by.

568
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I met some of you that day as well.

569
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So really appreciate that.

570
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after tonight,

571
00:55:54,030 --> 00:56:04,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Heading into next week, we're getting ready to share a draft online and a survey to get some additional input on how everyone's ideas have shaped up into the final plan document.

572
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:11,952
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll then be heading into the fall for approvals and there'll be more conversations at that time too.

573
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:18,685
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to give a little glimpse into what the extent of the engagement has looked like.

574
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:21,748
[SPEAKER_00]: We were lucky to kick off heading into a summer.

575
00:56:21,788 --> 00:56:31,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though there were a lot of restrictions on in-person gathering, we were able to get out and about at public events and get a lot of one-on-one conversations.

576
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:37,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time last summer talking to people about their community, what they loved, and hearing firsthand.

577
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:49,690
[SPEAKER_00]: did a lot of outreach to spread the word through postcards, comment cards at City Hall, and then 15,000 residents were reached via mail, direct mail.

578
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:57,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this dedicated plan website, and we also have had two versions of an online map to capture feedback.

579
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:00,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really engaged with that, which was fun.

580
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some of the outcomes from that in a moment.

581
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:09,664
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had videos to update people along the way and continue to show the content on community media.

582
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:27,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of focus groups too, steering committee meetings, like I said, and these public meetings, but the focus groups really let us hear firsthand from experts in everything from history to development to natural systems.

583
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:34,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got to learn and dig deep from those who are very engaged with all of those systems on a daily basis.

584
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,693
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a glimpse at that online map, the first one that we put out there.

585
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:52,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really fun is that it created this conversation where we had over 1000 comments, where people would make a comment about what they loved or a problem that they wanted to see the plan address.

586
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:59,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other folks could comment back on it and either second it or offer an alternative.

587
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:00,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

588
00:58:00,756 --> 00:58:06,259
[SPEAKER_00]: We really looked and scrutinized kind of all of these comments that came in throughout the course of the last year.

589
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:18,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see in the final plan that we think that they've really shaped the recommendations and we've tried to communicate directly how this feedback ties into those final recommendations.

590
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:25,771
[SPEAKER_00]: We did analyze everything and try to understand it and look for patterns too.

591
00:58:25,992 --> 00:58:28,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned some really interesting things I think

592
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:33,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that you may know, too, as those who care for Medford.

593
00:58:33,804 --> 00:58:41,108
[SPEAKER_00]: People talked a lot when they were talking about special places, about the natural systems and the river and the opportunity there.

594
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:44,790
[SPEAKER_00]: When we heard about issues, we heard a lot about Medford Square.

595
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:47,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Medford Square is the most talked about place within Medford.

596
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:52,255
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about transportation and we also heard about some flooding issues.

597
00:58:53,258 --> 00:59:06,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideas kind of mirror those issues too, but we were interested to see that there was a lot of consensus about places and then also some opportunities for change and thinking about improvements to environmental systems.

598
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:16,150
[SPEAKER_00]: We really kind of, as we develop the plan, tried to work hand in hand with the community so that they were always

599
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,794
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to brainstorm and improve the ideas with us.

600
00:59:19,854 --> 00:59:42,880
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a glimpse into our final public meeting that was online, where we took a test with the community and showed how their ideas and their recommendations might change a series of places around the city so that they could see the reality of a zoning change or a recommendation for flood mitigation and where that might impact their daily lives.

601
00:59:45,901 --> 00:59:47,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll pass it over to Emily for a little bit.

602
00:59:47,842 --> 00:59:48,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

603
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:48,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Brie.

604
00:59:49,503 --> 01:00:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: So taking a step backwards and understanding that the community input is helpful to us as we start to think about how we put this together under Section 81D of the Massachusetts General Laws.

605
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:11,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So you see on the left-hand side these images of the seven out of the nine elements that are in 81D.

606
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:25,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And so our challenge is to look at those elements that were established under the enabling legislation, understand how feedback from the community works into into those and is impacted by them and has an impact on them.

607
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:30,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And then figuring out how do you how do you pull all this into a plan.

608
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:41,573
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things about the way the elements were developed that the history of comprehensive planning is originally in land use, and it has morphed from that.

609
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:46,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you look at the 81D elements, you see all of these components of land use.

610
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:51,797
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some missing, so things like climate resiliency, public health,

611
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:52,997
[SPEAKER_09]: energy.

612
01:00:53,438 --> 01:01:00,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All of these are things that the communities want to start thinking about that aren't really covered by the enabling legislation.

613
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:05,524
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a lot of cost cutting themes and that's where our plan themes come from.

614
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:15,048
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really from the interrelationship of the 81 D elements with those other topics so where initially land use was the focus.

615
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:18,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's really the impact of land use on the community.

616
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,650
[SPEAKER_09]: and the other components of that.

617
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:31,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we move through, I'm going to take you through some of our thinking some of our research, and how they those things have an impact with the community input on the development of the plan.

618
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So next slide please.

619
01:01:35,594 --> 01:01:38,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing is the overall goal of this

620
01:01:39,385 --> 01:01:59,484
[SPEAKER_09]: planning process was to develop a 30 year vision, and then support that with a 10 year implementation plan, and we'll talk more about the implementation plan a little bit later but you can see in the bolded language here of this vision for the future, how some of those themes are translated

621
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:05,706
[SPEAKER_09]: into a simple statement that can act as a guiding force for the goals and the strategies that we have.

622
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:12,989
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mentioned earlier that there were nine elements and you saw seven of them in the sort of land use topics there.

623
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:21,452
[SPEAKER_09]: The other two are this vision, this goals and policies vision statement, and finally that implementation plan.

624
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:29,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we look at this, what we want to do is understand with you, talk about how this was developed and then understand

625
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:37,088
[SPEAKER_09]: how the implementation plan gets you from now to 2050 by those series of 10-year actions.

626
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide.

627
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:55,237
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, let's take a step back and just talk a little bit about, in addition to the community work that we did in gathering input, Medford had already done a ton of planning at different levels and in different areas and different topics.

628
01:02:55,297 --> 01:03:03,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of our role as consultants was to bring everything together and understand how all of these planning components can

629
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:07,266
[SPEAKER_09]: relate holistically to each other in a single document.

630
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:14,250
[SPEAKER_09]: So in some cases, what we're pulling is from previous studies and talking about how those have an impact on each other.

631
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:29,121
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of that deep dive into planning, we also wanted to look at the history of land use and development in Medford and understand how stepping back to look at past development plan patterns will affect today's choices.

632
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:30,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, you were beat ahead of me, Brie.

633
01:03:31,222 --> 01:03:36,603
[SPEAKER_09]: But that leads straight into not just the history, but the trends on the next slide.

634
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:40,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's happened in the past, projecting out to the future.

635
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:52,047
[SPEAKER_09]: So understanding about how do we bring in more spending to the city rather than having people leave Medford to buy goods, services, experiences.

636
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:57,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Thinking about who's working in Medford now, who would we like to work in Medford?

637
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,688
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when you talk about

638
01:03:59,088 --> 01:04:13,369
[SPEAKER_09]: transportation mobility circulation, and people get worried about traffic on the roads well if you can live within walking distance if you can buy most of your daily needs within walking distance, you don't have to hop into a car.

639
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:19,312
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can get most of it by public transportation, not hopping in a car reduces circulation.

640
01:04:19,373 --> 01:04:22,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to understand those trends and the impact.

641
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:41,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford is just a jewel in terms of the amount of open space and how accessible that is to people, but understanding how that open space isn't just there, but it supports local needs both now and in the future, and what might we need to do to make changes to add additional support.

642
01:04:42,283 --> 01:04:46,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing for housing who's being housed here now what are the projections for the future.

643
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:56,168
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally climate change Medford again as a leader in thinking about climate change and how climate change impacts people's daily experiences.

644
01:04:56,688 --> 01:05:01,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So taking the past development patterns taking the trends, and then in the next slide.

645
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,392
[SPEAKER_09]: as it pops up, looking at the future land use opportunities.

646
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:19,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a diagrammatic way of thinking about the different areas within Medford and the strategies that this comprehensive plan has for addressing those areas.

647
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll talk a little bit more about it as we move through, but just get the sense that there's this green quarter coming through with the rivers, you've got the green up further.

648
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:35,110
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also quarters of transportation and different types of land uses.

649
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:48,739
[SPEAKER_09]: There's our civic institutional anchors scattered throughout centers and squares being areas of economic activity, and also neighborhood centers being smaller areas.

650
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,021
[SPEAKER_09]: where economic activity and lower scale residential interact.

651
01:05:53,061 --> 01:06:01,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you listen to some of the strategies we're going to show you, just keep this future land use map in mind and we'll return to it later.

652
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:18,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And so finally, just translating again, those areas in Massachusetts general law, those different components, we're now going to show you how those elements interact with each other to create these five building blocks.

653
01:06:18,759 --> 01:06:22,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to turn it over to Brie for that, and I'll be back to talk about implementation.

654
01:06:24,203 --> 01:06:24,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Emily.

655
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:30,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to walk through what those five building blocks are that are going to be the themes that shape the plan.

656
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:37,170
[SPEAKER_00]: and within which all the recommendations and actions for achieving it have been developed.

657
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:42,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these really came directly out of those community conversations and then were refined along the way.

658
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:50,633
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is this idea that we heard from Medford that they really want to have open and engaged communication.

659
01:06:51,577 --> 01:07:03,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to do with the relationship to government, how plans like this get implemented over time, how priorities are set and funding is allocated and spent.

660
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:07,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also how the city relates to many partners.

661
01:07:08,327 --> 01:07:12,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily mentioned the ample open space, which is really true and felt and appreciated.

662
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:19,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is city-owned open space and a lot of that is partners, state and other partners.

663
01:07:19,717 --> 01:07:29,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking about those management roles that could sometimes make implementation run or stewardship and use run more seamlessly.

664
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:39,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three goals that have come out of this are to maintain and build trust, to implement according to clear community priorities, and then to allocate resources effectively.

665
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:48,192
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't be showing you all of the actions within the plan, which I'm sorry that I can't do, but I think you'll also thank me.

666
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:53,254
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be here for a really long time, but we'll be sharing that draft as a document for you to dig into.

667
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:59,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a few of the kind of more detailed ways that we can realize that goal or that set of goals.

668
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:06,818
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan recommends issuing an annual comprehensive plan update so that community members can transparently see progress happen.

669
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:15,575
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing and changing the way that community members are reached and communicated with.

670
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:26,124
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a lot through this plan of the use of social media and digital outreach, that not being the only thing that people can rely on, but certainly a really effective way to do it.

671
01:08:28,185 --> 01:08:36,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Another action is about developing a central database within the city that allows departments to share information about implementation

672
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:39,776
[SPEAKER_00]: and track things together and tie them back to the plan.

673
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:48,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tracking participation and planning processes and boards to make sure that representation of the community is representative.

674
01:08:51,302 --> 01:09:02,508
[SPEAKER_00]: The second big theme or big building block is this idea of continuing to nurture the welcoming and supportive community that so many Medford residents told us they really experience.

675
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:06,167
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we did hear that some feel that more than others.

676
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:16,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So this theme is also about trying to be more inclusive and think about all the different ways that people need to be welcomed to Medford.

677
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:26,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those have to do with enlivening open space, people really embrace the events, the arts and culture, and thinking about ways to spread that to more communities.

678
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Affordable housing, of course, being huge.

679
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:32,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And Emily mentioned all the work that this plan builds on.

680
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:40,238
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very recent housing production plan is just one example of a plan that we're tying into and kind of pulling into to help implement.

681
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:45,721
[SPEAKER_00]: But affordable housing being a really important element to reinforce as well.

682
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:49,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And then honoring Medford's history and all of its facets.

683
01:09:51,885 --> 01:09:55,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the actions that you'll see in the plan that reinforce that

684
01:09:56,181 --> 01:10:25,122
[SPEAKER_00]: are everything from thinking about collaboration with artists to beautify some of those neighborhood centers or centers and squares that Emily showed on that future land use map, to look at ways to expand the amenities that are within the riverfront and other community open spaces to things that we heard about and we also saw in the open space plan, to look at ways to allow more multifamily and small diverse housing options through some zoning changes,

685
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:35,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And then always keeping universal accessibility in mind and having a steady and clear data-driven way to address capital needs at city facilities.

686
01:10:39,313 --> 01:10:47,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibrant places might have been the goal that was talked about the most, I think, across all conversations and no matter what area of the community we were talking about.

687
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:52,618
[SPEAKER_00]: People really are interested in this topic of economic development.

688
01:10:53,422 --> 01:11:03,288
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have, they realize that today, it can be really challenging to live and work in Medford and have that kind of close connection and choice, no matter what age you are.

689
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:07,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard that from teenagers, we heard that from more established professionals.

690
01:11:07,651 --> 01:11:16,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this theme really looks at growing kind of mixed use life sciences and other uses like we just saw.

691
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:29,248
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow more people to live and work in Medford, and then to support businesses so that they can successfully locate, establish, and sustain both their own business and the workforce.

692
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:41,273
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks as well at balancing growth, so thinking carefully about growth as it's happening and the scale of density and where it goes, and tying that to smart transportation investments,

693
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:46,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And then vibrancy very much for Medford is about increasing enjoyment of natural resources.

694
01:11:49,456 --> 01:12:09,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the ideas here, we're encouraging some of those small scale neighborhood retail and services so that it's not just Medford Square, but wherever you are within the city, you can experience and benefit from some of that kind of walkable access to small commercial services, attracting companies, particularly to some kind of

695
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:26,992
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and changing areas that will pay, pay, create high quality jobs that allow residents to access them and strategically using some city on parcels to promote multifamily residential or some or some of that job creation.

696
01:12:27,922 --> 01:12:48,097
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of all of that kind of vibrancy too is keeping an eye on access and inclusion at the same time and looking at anti-displacement strategies for both residential and commercial businesses and partnering with Tufts and lots of other workforce training groups to make sure that this access is equitably provided to everyone.

697
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:58,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings us over to mobility and transportation to which is really linked to creating vibrant places that work and that work for everyone.

698
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:08,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was also something that we talked about a lot and we know Medford has done a lot of work with its complete streets plan and other projects that predated the comp plan.

699
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,317
[SPEAKER_00]: The key goals here were about

700
01:13:12,363 --> 01:13:15,524
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting that multimodal network and really starting to achieve it.

701
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:24,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I sort of alluded to in the previous one, coordinating mobility with future development, making sure those two things work really well together.

702
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:28,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thinking about the kind of on the ground experience.

703
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:31,010
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to have a bike lane, right?

704
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:37,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's another thing to have it feel safe and have it feel like a place where you can take your kids across the street.

705
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:40,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking about that kind of finer grain of the mobility experience.

706
01:13:43,373 --> 01:14:10,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ideas that will support those goals are to implement those great plans you already have in place, like the Bicycle Infrastructure Master Plan, to do an audit of pedestrian crossings and school-adjacent routes for any improvements for safe crossings, to look at one discovery that we found, which we know is really complicated, is that there is an unusually high number of unaccepted streets across

707
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:18,495
[SPEAKER_00]: across Medford, and so look at that closely and figure out how they might become more part of city ownership.

708
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:39,884
[SPEAKER_00]: To tie this also to some of the climate resilience and sustainability goals with piloting installations of electric vehicle charging stations, and then really leveraging and building on the MBTA improvements and major bus hubs, and thinking about density and mix of uses increased, especially in those areas and those corridors.

709
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:44,719
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, climate resilience.

710
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:55,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something that really is sort of an umbrella and aligns with those other four themes very well, but also is one unto itself.

711
01:14:56,328 --> 01:15:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So the climate resilience goals are about achieving that very recently created climate action and adaptation plan and syncing up a lot we benefited from that great work, preserving and enhancing natural resources and supporting community health and resilience.

712
01:15:14,572 --> 01:15:23,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the actions that will help realize that are to think about the public realm, streets and open spaces for stormwater management.

713
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:28,402
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard a lot about tree canopy in our public and our steering committee meetings.

714
01:15:28,502 --> 01:15:39,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of thinking about that within the plan too, and how you might focus and start some of your early investments in priority areas that have higher heat vulnerability.

715
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:51,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Adopting environmental performance standards for large development projects and then updating some of the flood resilience guidelines and cool surface design guidelines in future design standards.

716
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:56,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a lot of ideas, but they need to get done.

717
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:57,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pass it to Emily.

718
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:58,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Brie.

719
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:15,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as Brie said, there's a lot to unpack here but all of these actions go into an implementation strategy and the way I always think about implementation strategy is you know your fifth grade English when you do the who, what, where, how, when, how many, how much.

720
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:27,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So, when we look at an implementation strategy it's critically important to once you've listed out the actions is to understand who is responsible for these.

721
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:45,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a city department, is it the city plus stakeholders from for as partners, is it actually not a city action but it's important enough to the overall goals of the city that it's got some other leads so you'll see the stewardship and the partners flow into the implementation strategy.

722
01:16:46,996 --> 01:17:04,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Figuring out exactly what are the first steps that are needed for those strategies, how we can track progress so we'll talk a little bit about benchmarks, and then are there additional funding sources so we're not just relying on city operating or capital funds to get something done so you'll see these components.

723
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a critical strategy for all of you at the CD board is understanding how zoning is impacted by this plan.

724
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:22,307
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously you've gone through a recodification as a city recently that sort of cleaned everything up.

725
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:32,775
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't necessarily mean that you've done major zoning changes and as you look at this plan, you're going to see for each one of the sections that Brie talked about.

726
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:35,676
[SPEAKER_09]: that there are zoning recommendations for it.

727
01:17:35,796 --> 01:17:44,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're preparing a section, I think you may have a draft memo of it, to talk about how do you take all of these zoning recommendations and address them.

728
01:17:44,537 --> 01:17:46,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's really two main strategies.

729
01:17:47,078 --> 01:17:53,819
[SPEAKER_09]: One is topical in that there's groups of zoning changes that are related to specific topics.

730
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other is geographic.

731
01:17:56,059 --> 01:17:59,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only do they have, and those are more related to the

732
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:05,746
[SPEAKER_09]: the future land use areas that we looked at earlier the gateway centers quarters and neighborhood centers.

733
01:18:07,147 --> 01:18:17,937
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a process strategy that goes along with each so in for the most case, when you're looking at the topical strategies the climate action plan, the new land uses, etc.

734
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:34,083
[SPEAKER_09]: These are things that will probably require some additional research into best practices, what have other communities done that have has worked for them, developing draft language and legal review, they aren't necessarily need it's not necessarily needed to have

735
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:51,380
[SPEAKER_09]: an additional planning process for them they're fairly clearly outlined in some of your original plans, brought forward here because of their importance to the overall city, but you don't necessarily need to do a lot of public outreach and you'll see there's an asterisk for design and development standards I'll get to that.

736
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:09,082
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of the geographic strategies for looking at these, we think that you'll want to have additional community outreach said in fact you're probably going to want to have neighborhood plans that look at specific areas now Medford Square is an exception because you've already done a lot of planning around Medford Square.

737
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:18,914
[SPEAKER_09]: But to look at to some of the gateways to look at some of the neighborhood centers maybe take another look at West Medford and Wellington you're going to, you're going to want some neighborhood planning there.

738
01:19:19,314 --> 01:19:27,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that requires more community engagement that's going to be a process that you can start now, but it's going to take a little bit longer than some of the topical ones.

739
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:52,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I called out design and development standards separately because I think, for example, with the Climate Action Plan, with some of the other work that you've done, if it's a development standard that's related to a use, or if it's a development standard that's related to some of the recommendations in the Climate Action Plan, those probably just need the best practice research, the draft language, and the legal review.

740
01:19:53,530 --> 01:20:16,224
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other hand, if you're talking about design guidelines or design standards for a specific area, say, West Medford Square, Medford Square, or Wellington, you're probably going to want to have, as part of that community engagement, a discussion of what makes sense in terms of consistency, people's expectations for an area,

741
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:33,914
[SPEAKER_09]: how the physical environment affects how people move through it a whole series of design conversations that would then go into the neighborhood plan so that's why that one's pulled out so there's these two different standards and happy to talk about that more as we go through.

742
01:20:34,894 --> 01:20:35,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide please.

743
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:44,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mentioned benchmarks earlier, and these are ways of tracking and measuring progress.

744
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:47,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've indicated some trends here.

745
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:49,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the trend increasing?

746
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the trend decreasing?

747
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:57,183
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've established a metric that you want a trend to be increasing,

748
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:15,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you measure the impact of some of these strategies that trend is decreasing so for example you say you want to increase total housing units, and in the next two to three years total housing units aren't increasing, then you know you need to look back at the strategies and see if they're effective.

749
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:23,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing with the decrease in the percentage of population that is housing costs burden so the benchmarks establish the trend line.

750
01:21:24,323 --> 01:21:44,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the idea is for city staff, city departments to establish the specific numbers so that they have a base data starting with this year, and certainly some of the information that we've pulled establishes some of those bases but not all of them, and then they can measure progress as the years progress for those 10 year actions.

751
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:45,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide please.

752
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:51,841
[SPEAKER_09]: And I touched on this a little bit with the benchmarks.

753
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:55,705
[SPEAKER_09]: It's first, establishing the direction of the trend that's important.

754
01:21:56,086 --> 01:22:00,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, establishing the data points that are important.

755
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:04,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And then looking at how do we test the impacts.

756
01:22:04,195 --> 01:22:04,376
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

757
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:09,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll point down at the bottom, sharing the water quality measurements on the website.

758
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:18,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So the trend is we'd like the water quality measurements to improve, we collect the data, and then we publicly show progress that that's happened.

759
01:22:18,264 --> 01:22:27,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've looked at points throughout there where it's possible to say, for example, has the regional trail been extended through Medford Square?

760
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:31,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we getting more incubator and art spaces?

761
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:34,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And then use that as a check on an annual basis.

762
01:22:34,734 --> 01:22:42,269
[SPEAKER_09]: as part of the review to see if the plan is doing what we've collectively anticipated it to do based on public comments.

763
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:44,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide, please.

764
01:22:45,532 --> 01:22:48,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is just an image of how the document works.

765
01:22:49,574 --> 01:22:59,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you get into the section of looking at the goals, number one there, how it's numbered so you can understand the way it's moved through.

766
01:23:00,419 --> 01:23:07,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And three, you see we've tracked the elements from chapter 81D and how those relate to what you're seeing for the goal.

767
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:12,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're seeing the action titles and explanation of the action.

768
01:23:12,765 --> 01:23:19,328
[SPEAKER_09]: the implementation plan that says who, what, where, how, that's going to be a separate section of the plan.

769
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:25,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got a table that basically over the years, you can just check off and say, we've done this, we've done this.

770
01:23:25,411 --> 01:23:27,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, we need to do some work on this.

771
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:38,277
[SPEAKER_09]: But the guidance in this section of understanding the goals, the strategies, and the actions should give you those first steps of how do we approach the actions that we're seeing.

772
01:23:39,398 --> 01:23:39,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide.

773
01:23:40,997 --> 01:23:47,881
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Brie mentioned we are very close to releasing the draft plan we just have a few more checks to go with the city staff.

774
01:23:48,341 --> 01:24:03,169
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to I think city staff will post it on the website we've set up a little questionnaire so people can review the draft plan and respond to the questionnaire let us know what they think let us know you know they like these actions do they have some additional suggestions.

775
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:13,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at some point, what this will move into the approvals process so we'll have the plan online for enough time for people to have a chance to really engage with it.

776
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:21,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be presented to the mayor and the city council but you all have a huge responsibility because you're the city's planning board.

777
01:24:22,107 --> 01:24:35,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And under chapter 41 section at one D you are responsible for approving this plan and adopting it as part of the city's as the city's official comprehensive plan so we will no doubt be back to you.

778
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:43,396
[SPEAKER_09]: As we get closer to that but I just wanted to give you a preview tonight before it goes out to the public.

779
01:24:43,856 --> 01:24:45,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So you see you see parts of it first.

780
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:57,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, the plan still needs not just you on the board, but anybody who's watching this, any members of the Medford community.

781
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So please review the draft.

782
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:05,091
[SPEAKER_09]: If people are listening to this afterwards, implementation is going to require the support of everybody.

783
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:13,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So we hope this is a useful document for you many years into the future and we look forward to your comments both tonight

784
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:15,220
[SPEAKER_09]: and as the draft comes out.

785
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much, Preet.

786
01:25:19,964 --> 01:25:20,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

787
01:25:20,484 --> 01:25:28,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I will stop sharing so we can all see one another and thank you for listening, but we would welcome questions and I can bring anything back up again too.

788
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:51,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie I see a comment of yours in the chat about zoning strategies so yes, absolutely we're hoping this plan gives you guidance on the zoning strategies.

789
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:56,990
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, we've we've shared a draft of how to think about how all the zoning works together.

790
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:10,275
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly as you review this as you review the draft plan if you feel as a CD board that you need some more information on that we're happy to, you know, provide you additional guidance or information.

791
01:26:10,655 --> 01:26:12,796
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot to unpack in this document.

792
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:15,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So as Brie said we could have been here a couple more hours.

793
01:26:18,749 --> 01:26:19,069
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

794
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is Christy.

795
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:31,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to say that was very nice presentation, and I just love the way that it was packaged and very comprehensive even for that.

796
01:26:31,914 --> 01:26:38,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is a lot to unpack and feel like I just need to spend some time with it before I can ask probably more thoughtful questions.

797
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:40,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But very nicely done.

798
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

799
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:43,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

800
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to have the document in hand for everyone, like we said, next week, and then would welcome input from you all and Alicia and Amanda as suggestions to make sure that we can hear your thoughts and incorporate and reflect them.

801
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:09,473
[SPEAKER_10]: This is David with a question.

802
01:27:12,134 --> 01:27:18,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is something by statute that all cities, towns are supposed to be doing a process they're supposed to be following.

803
01:27:20,236 --> 01:27:26,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there, to my knowledge, we haven't had one of these for a while, in a comprehensive way.

804
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:34,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there other neighboring communities that stand out as great examples where boy they went through this process they really rolled up the sleeves.

805
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:44,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And when the plan came out, they actually implemented a fair number of those, and we see a difference in the community as a result.

806
01:27:44,783 --> 01:27:48,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there some shining stars that you might point to?

807
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,393
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start your list, Emily?

808
01:27:53,397 --> 01:27:59,239
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's, it's interesting that you mentioned that you know Medford doesn't have a comprehensive plan.

809
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:10,782
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we delved into was the history of documents that was great because city staff members kept pulling out documents that, hey, we found something from 1983 we found something from 1966 but

810
01:28:12,862 --> 01:28:19,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were very limited in their scope, there were far more of the straight land use.

811
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:34,850
[SPEAKER_09]: What should we do about this, it was, they were great in terms of history and understanding why some of the decisions that were made were made I think you know obviously some of your neighbors and nearby communities, Somerville Arlington.

812
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:37,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Arlington's got some good plans.

813
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:53,165
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to say which are due to their comprehensive plans, and which are due to the follow on plans, the more strategic plans from the comprehensive plans I think the two of them work hand in hand.

814
01:28:53,605 --> 01:29:03,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's one of the reasons we mentioned the neighborhood plans is that they've got the Boston's actually been doing this with their own as they had their imagine 2030.

815
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:27,493
[SPEAKER_09]: but they're in fact using a neighborhood by neighborhood strategy of doing far more in depth, and I see that as a real model for Medford, because the comprehensive plan is really that 50,000 foot view, you're trying to bring everything together and understand how the different pieces talk to each other, but for some of those planning efforts you really need to be much much closer you need to be at the 5000 foot view.

816
01:29:28,854 --> 01:29:32,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where those neighborhood and gateway and corridor plans come in.

817
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:38,042
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the strategy that Boston is using to do that is really important.

818
01:29:39,704 --> 01:29:50,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add, I think, coming into doing this plan, Medford was in a really good position because there were a lot of citywide plans that were recent.

819
01:29:50,914 --> 01:29:54,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a comprehensive plan, but the climate plan, the housing plan.

820
01:29:54,798 --> 01:29:55,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

821
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:59,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of those things are synced and aligned here.

822
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:02,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're all in alignment.

823
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:05,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sets up, I think, that neighborhood planning well, too.

824
01:30:06,132 --> 01:30:10,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really want to give the city kudos for the amount of planning that they've done.

825
01:30:11,236 --> 01:30:29,268
[SPEAKER_09]: In some case it was very easy for us because we just sit there and answer scroll through and say, these are great we're just going to pull those over but now we can talk about the relationship of these to the other parts of the city so yes you didn't have a comprehensive plan but you had all of the building blocks in place.

826
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:34,145
[SPEAKER_10]: That's super helpful.

827
01:30:34,205 --> 01:30:47,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like, as in the city, I imagine the mayor is the one who's driving the follow on plans on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis and really pushing that process forward mayor's office.

828
01:30:51,057 --> 01:30:52,618
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, it depends.

829
01:30:52,879 --> 01:30:55,241
[SPEAKER_11]: We work very closely with the mayor's office.

830
01:30:55,601 --> 01:30:57,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would say specifically with the mayor.

831
01:30:58,503 --> 01:31:03,848
[SPEAKER_11]: When she's thinking about economic development, business development, she's coming to Victor and to myself.

832
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:08,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's not other staff in her office working on this.

833
01:31:09,273 --> 01:31:25,189
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we have been working with her and we've been hearing what the consultants have been saying and what the pressures are because part of it, part of where you know where we need to focus most urgently has to do with what phone calls and emails are coming in and

834
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:47,259
[SPEAKER_11]: developers are contacting us all the time saying, we're thinking about this, and we're thinking about this location, and I'll tell you that I funnel all of those to Victor, and he sort of figures them out, and which ones are just sort of testing the waters, and which ones are like really, really serious, and where are we going with them?

835
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:54,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And so one of the things I think we've mentioned to this group is that we went out and got a grant, Victor wrote the grant,

836
01:31:54,682 --> 01:32:18,922
[SPEAKER_11]: to do a plan or a study for the Wellington Center area, the Wellington Square, because that is one of the areas that we are hearing from a lot, either the property owners or the developers who want to do things there, and they want to do things that are not in alignment with our zoning, because nobody wants to build a two-story industrial building these days.

837
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:23,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And people look at this area so close to the T, and they even say,

838
01:32:24,066 --> 01:32:28,868
[SPEAKER_11]: a one-story commercial, okay, two-story is allowed, doesn't make sense.

839
01:32:29,248 --> 01:32:37,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't it make so much more sense to do a story of commercial with five stories of residential above it and have all this housing near the T?

840
01:32:37,711 --> 01:32:38,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm willing.

841
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now it would.

842
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad our zoning doesn't allow that, right?

843
01:32:43,348 --> 01:32:45,129
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the things that we've been hearing.

844
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:46,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We're starting that study.

845
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:51,050
[SPEAKER_11]: As the consultants have said, we have not started a study of Medford Square.

846
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:56,312
[SPEAKER_11]: There are 500 recent studies and documents on Medford Square.

847
01:32:57,892 --> 01:33:04,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think I'm speaking out of turn to say that Victor is working on the properties there.

848
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:07,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And what is the best next steps?

849
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:17,328
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been talking about doing a request for information from developers to see who's interested in doing what, what would be a good use of the municipal properties there.

850
01:33:17,348 --> 01:33:21,251
[SPEAKER_11]: I think those are the hot ones.

851
01:33:23,853 --> 01:33:27,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so we're starting to move with these and we're starting to move in the areas.

852
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:35,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna say we're doing studies everywhere, but there's just so many projects that individual people should be managing at one time.

853
01:33:36,938 --> 01:33:39,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are trying to also balance our workload.

854
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:40,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Victor, there's something you wanted to add.

855
01:33:41,684 --> 01:33:51,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Only that, again, Medford doesn't have a history of focusing on economic development and strategic economic development planning.

856
01:33:52,456 --> 01:33:54,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally, in 10 years,

857
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:03,186
[SPEAKER_08]: we have, we're refreshing the Wellington circle plan, you know, and, and building on, on previous studies that were done.

858
01:34:03,787 --> 01:34:08,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having to prioritize now because which there isn't a history to build off of.

859
01:34:08,771 --> 01:34:23,882
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we're focused on areas where there's a lot of activity and a lot of interest and we're having to make decisions, bring projects to you all, you know, that are, that are really out of conformance, but we think are good projects and, and, um,

860
01:34:24,803 --> 01:34:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: So that that's the challenge we're facing I think the feedback we got through the plan, which was very much focused on filling a gap in economic development thought at that 10,000 foot level was really helpful because it.

861
01:34:40,595 --> 01:34:45,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of reframed, I think, the community's mindset around what the potential is in some areas.

862
01:34:46,379 --> 01:35:07,051
[SPEAKER_08]: But then we do need to spend time and engagement on those more neighborhood district level plans in order to make informed decisions about zoning change and what projects are a good fit and what the community really wants to see, as well as understand what the market potential is for these areas.

863
01:35:07,331 --> 01:35:09,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're figuring that out.

864
01:35:10,132 --> 01:35:13,977
[SPEAKER_08]: but really don't have a full grasp on that.

865
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't mind me jumping back in Vic, I think your point about the economic development components being missing is an excellent one.

866
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:44,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was, as we entered into this, that was probably the biggest hole in the previous plans in that there was a lot of focus on certain specific areas, repetitively in some cases, but not on the city as a whole and not really tied to what does economic development, how is economic development tied to land use?

867
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:50,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, again, we're hoping that the comprehensive plan strategy points to the direction.

868
01:35:51,161 --> 01:36:02,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you all have already picked up and started moving as you've talked about on some of those pieces but the comprehensive plan should be able to help you guide further, you know, as you've started to address those pieces.

869
01:36:02,851 --> 01:36:05,293
[SPEAKER_09]: The next ones can come up in the conversation.

870
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:11,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But understanding that the market demand, the trends and what that market demand is likely to change.

871
01:36:12,638 --> 01:36:22,103
[SPEAKER_09]: As you say is really important on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis, or a commercial area by commercial area basis so we hope the plan gives you that to continue continues to give you that direction.

872
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:41,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to quickly say in hearing everyone speak and how everything's been aligned right now and have had the honor of being on a selection committee for picking agency landscape and planning as the comprehensive plan team, I want to hyphenate your own strength and knowledge, which perfectly aligns with my presentation.

873
01:36:42,288 --> 01:36:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts and all the great efforts of the mayor and all the city staff and Alicia and her department, which also included hiring our amazing economic development director, which he's been diligently attempting to fill in the gaps that he illustrated as challenges.

874
01:36:57,676 --> 01:37:01,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm saying that more sitting as a resident of Medford for many, many, many years.

875
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:07,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So as everyone's talking about all the pieces going together, it's just so great to see how they're all aligning now.

876
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:10,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to highlight it

877
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:18,746
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's knowledge and strength and how everything's going together, including the plans that Medford has been putting out.

878
01:37:20,347 --> 01:37:23,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt that very much, I think, that the stars are aligning.

879
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:30,213
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the community felt that in those conversations, too, that the community is feeling that and is pretty coalesced around it.

880
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:31,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of

881
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:33,945
[SPEAKER_00]: dissent or disagreement.

882
01:37:34,005 --> 01:37:44,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, people felt that these ideas, these places where more development could happen, that that was a great opportunity, could be tied to some of the affordability challenges and, you know, understanding that connection.

883
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:53,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I have you in my head too, Jackie, and the good conversations we had about the connections between development and mobility improvements and infrastructure improvements, which need to be dovetailed.

884
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:59,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the comprehensive plan is a chance to bring all those pieces that are sometimes disparate together.

885
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:27,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It all sounds good to me but it's, it seems like such a daunting task to convert so many aspirational goals, which are the senior absolutely wonderful and on target.

886
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:34,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you said there seems to be consensus that's built around them by way of your community engagement, which it just sounds awesome.

887
01:38:36,207 --> 01:38:53,685
[SPEAKER_10]: But how do we, how do we actually implement these things but I guess I'm getting ahead of myself because that's the way my brain works but I know this, the city residents have been critical of the city generally for not implementing for studying, but not following through.

888
01:38:56,170 --> 01:39:07,336
[SPEAKER_10]: the more we can convert these things into things that we can see and feel and experience, I think the better, well, the better our city will be, but the better for everyone involved as well.

889
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:16,261
[SPEAKER_08]: David, I've had the benefit of working in communities with strong comprehensive plans and it sort of goes two ways.

890
01:39:17,262 --> 01:39:18,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows the community to hold

891
01:39:21,006 --> 01:39:23,648
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, city government accountable, it's written down.

892
01:39:23,668 --> 01:39:29,113
[SPEAKER_08]: These are cooperatively developed goals and strategies.

893
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:41,903
[SPEAKER_08]: It also helps city staff say, look, we're working on this, and we need funding for X, or we need your support on Y. It's in the plan, and you can point to that.

894
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:57,112
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've heard it a million times, playing just sit on shelves and they're not worked, but it, and the accountability has to work both ways, but I've seen it happen and it can be really, really powerful.

895
01:39:57,692 --> 01:40:05,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you know, you're just sort of shooting from your hip and there's no continuity over time.

896
01:40:06,635 --> 01:40:19,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And to that point and I completely agree we've recommended a master plan implementation committee, you can take the comprehensive plan and move forward with it you know be responsible for checking to make sure that it's being implemented.

897
01:40:19,398 --> 01:40:28,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We've recommended that it be integrated into the city's budget process, so that as department heads are filling out their budgets they are referring to the comprehensive plan.

898
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,823
[SPEAKER_09]: saying how their budgets are meeting those goals.

899
01:40:32,824 --> 01:40:48,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at appropriate points in that layout that I showed you, we're also providing case studies of how other communities have accomplished some of these things so that there's a way to sort of check and see who else has been doing what.

900
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:50,404
[SPEAKER_09]: to implement it.

901
01:40:50,424 --> 01:40:52,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have thought of that issue of accountability.

902
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:57,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very easy to put names to actions and say, off you go, go and do this.

903
01:40:57,906 --> 01:41:02,147
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've tried to build in the checks and balances on making sure that it gets done.

904
01:41:02,728 --> 01:41:15,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Victor's point, the ability for somebody to stand up at a CD board meeting or a city council and say, it says right here on page 32, that's a very powerful way of communicating with one's government.

905
01:41:19,057 --> 01:41:19,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds great.

906
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:19,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

907
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:37,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that we're looking at with the implementation chart particularly is that different actions have different city stewards.

908
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:47,368
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the things that I think I will say our climate plan is so new that it's hard to say like this works really well because we've barely had it.

909
01:41:48,528 --> 01:41:50,629
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we released it a few months ago.

910
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:58,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the things we really look to is with all the actions, we put a point person or department who's responsible for it.

911
01:41:58,953 --> 01:42:01,834
[SPEAKER_11]: And frankly, when we put a department, we mean the department head.

912
01:42:02,854 --> 01:42:06,696
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't put people's names because it doesn't matter if it's John or Mary.

913
01:42:07,216 --> 01:42:08,837
[SPEAKER_11]: It matters who's in that role.

914
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:10,418
[SPEAKER_11]: is responsible for it.

915
01:42:10,898 --> 01:42:27,126
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the things I really pushing for is that we spread the love that that responsible person is not the department, the planning department for every single item, but that where does it best fit in the municipal structure

916
01:42:27,586 --> 01:42:41,994
[SPEAKER_11]: because if one person or one position is responsible for 40 things, it's not gonna happen the way these go under engineering, and this is part of health, and this is the mayor's office of communication, and this is the planning office.

917
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:47,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot that says planning office next to it, but it's not everything.

918
01:42:47,798 --> 01:42:50,119
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're trying to think strategically about this.

919
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:51,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also,

920
01:42:53,205 --> 01:42:54,525
[SPEAKER_11]: it raises involvement.

921
01:42:54,645 --> 01:43:02,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if I can pull away the layers a little about what we're doing, pull away the curtain, there is a full draft.

922
01:43:02,668 --> 01:43:07,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I've asked to try to have myself read it, have me read it first.

923
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:10,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And a little bit of that is fact-checking, right?

924
01:43:10,611 --> 01:43:14,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm not gonna say, well, I don't like this opinion, we should change it.

925
01:43:14,732 --> 01:43:17,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say there have been some places where I've said,

926
01:43:18,413 --> 01:43:25,343
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what the climate plan said, and this is what you said it said, but it really said this, right?

927
01:43:25,363 --> 01:43:27,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's my particular area of expertise.

928
01:43:27,946 --> 01:43:30,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the things that I'm also doing is saying,

929
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:37,574
[SPEAKER_11]: who in each department or which departments are the knowledgeable people for all of these items.

930
01:43:38,334 --> 01:43:44,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I have, Wren has been sitting with me and taking notes on all of that.

931
01:43:44,782 --> 01:43:51,149
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we go through it, she's going to start sending chunks of it to different departments saying,

932
01:43:53,305 --> 01:44:02,053
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome to read the whole plan, but we would really like you to look at these five actions, read them thoroughly and weigh in on them.

933
01:44:02,453 --> 01:44:05,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And we think that you may be the steward for some of these.

934
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:06,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you agree?

935
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:13,563
[SPEAKER_11]: We found that with that process with the climate plan, it meant that when you send the transportation person

936
01:44:14,093 --> 01:44:18,237
[SPEAKER_11]: the transportation actions and ask them to review it, they find the time.

937
01:44:18,798 --> 01:44:22,202
[SPEAKER_11]: You send them a 200-page document, they do not have the time.

938
01:44:23,003 --> 01:44:30,330
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to be strategic about making sure the right people put their eyes on this document so we have their buy-in.

939
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:35,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm frustrated by how long that is taking right now, and it's all on me.

940
01:44:37,093 --> 01:44:44,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So sometime next week, we're just going to say let's release this, regardless of whether or not I've gotten through the whole thing.

941
01:44:49,313 --> 01:44:51,654
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to send it to you guys.

942
01:44:51,714 --> 01:44:54,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent Emily and Brie some corrections.

943
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:59,718
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know when we, a couple of those were meaningful to me.

944
01:44:59,758 --> 01:45:03,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought then we could get a draft out to people.

945
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:07,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we just looked at those this afternoon, right before this.

946
01:45:07,982 --> 01:45:12,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, I think, those, at least the meaningful ones made, and then a few questions next week.

947
01:45:12,344 --> 01:45:14,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we're thinking next week.

948
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,606
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got that ready to go.

949
01:45:15,646 --> 01:45:15,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

950
01:45:16,566 --> 01:45:16,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

951
01:45:19,094 --> 01:45:20,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have opinions.

952
01:45:20,615 --> 01:45:23,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying to, opinions are in one bucket.

953
01:45:23,577 --> 01:45:25,898
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more like, I don't think this is right.

954
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:27,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we misunderstood something here.

955
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:31,282
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's incredibly valuable.

956
01:45:31,362 --> 01:45:33,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, this is a lot to unpack.

957
01:45:33,563 --> 01:45:44,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So having Alicia's eyes, having Ren's eyes, having Amanda's eyes on it saying, hey, we think you misunderstood this, or can you clarify that, or we need more information here is really, really useful to us.

958
01:45:57,255 --> 01:45:59,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, Alicia.

959
01:45:59,696 --> 01:46:06,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, because I'm someone who's like this, where I sometimes just need some time to myself to unpack things.

960
01:46:06,499 --> 01:46:18,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone from the board has things that, as they kind of sit with this, they want forwarded over to our consultant team, please feel free to send them my way and I can forward them over.

961
01:46:18,945 --> 01:46:22,687
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not to stop discussion now, but I just want to acknowledge.

962
01:46:23,848 --> 01:46:24,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Amanda.

963
01:46:26,243 --> 01:46:27,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I do want to comment.

964
01:46:28,326 --> 01:46:32,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier we were having a public hearing where we're very limited about who can speak.

965
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:39,680
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a couple of members of the public on still if you wanted to open it up if they have any questions or comments.

966
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:41,582
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no reason.

967
01:46:41,602 --> 01:46:45,567
[SPEAKER_11]: This board's generally pretty informal.

968
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:59,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if any of the community members, if you would like to speak, you're welcome to raise your hand or use the comment box or just unmute yourselves.

969
01:47:09,785 --> 01:47:19,267
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't mean to rush the board, but nobody's taking the lead here and saying, OK, let's move to the next agenda item, or let's give everybody some more space to think.

970
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll recommend moving to the next agenda item.

971
01:47:26,543 --> 01:47:28,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second that recommendation slash motion.

972
01:47:28,764 --> 01:47:31,804
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

973
01:47:31,924 --> 01:47:32,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

974
01:47:32,985 --> 01:47:34,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing no objections.

975
01:47:34,905 --> 01:47:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Brie and Emily for your time tonight.

976
01:47:37,586 --> 01:47:39,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

977
01:47:40,286 --> 01:47:41,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to Lauren.

978
01:47:41,646 --> 01:47:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

979
01:47:42,487 --> 01:47:43,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Corte, your thoughts.

980
01:47:50,555 --> 01:47:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the last item for tonight has to do with elections.

981
01:48:00,303 --> 01:48:07,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you all are aware, our beloved previous chair, Andre, is no longer chair.

982
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:13,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd love to, or we need to have someone eventually fill that role.

983
01:48:14,415 --> 01:48:18,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I do wanna acknowledge that Deanna's not present tonight.

984
01:48:19,599 --> 01:48:29,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And given the kind of last minute piece of this notice, she wasn't able to to provide input ahead of time.

985
01:48:29,945 --> 01:48:32,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of just want to pose it to the board.

986
01:48:33,386 --> 01:48:37,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you all want to continue with potential election discussion tonight?

987
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:40,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to start it and finish it later?

988
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:41,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we just finish it tonight?

989
01:48:42,171 --> 01:48:43,472
[SPEAKER_06]: How are people feeling about that?

990
01:48:44,142 --> 01:48:47,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be clear, Deanna is not staying long term.

991
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,369
[SPEAKER_11]: We are actively working to fill her position.

992
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:54,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And then so technically, Emily filled the vacant spots.

993
01:48:56,276 --> 01:48:58,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And we thought we had somebody for Deanna.

994
01:49:00,749 --> 01:49:04,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre spots, there may be some complication with that.

995
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:08,591
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking for some more recommendations that still may happen.

996
01:49:08,631 --> 01:49:09,031
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

997
01:49:11,112 --> 01:49:20,714
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are, Deanna will probably stay on for at least another month, but I wouldn't elect her chair because technically her term is over and she will be rolling off.

998
01:49:23,115 --> 01:49:27,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody else is here tonight though, right?

999
01:49:29,357 --> 01:49:29,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1000
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of questions.

1001
01:49:32,981 --> 01:49:36,782
[SPEAKER_03]: One, shouldn't there be a reelection of also the vice chair, which is my position.

1002
01:49:36,802 --> 01:49:44,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in it for, I'm happy to remain in it, but also is there any interest in chair?

1003
01:49:44,226 --> 01:49:47,807
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things that I wanted to know, have people sent their names?

1004
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:56,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we voted Andre in last time because he had expressed interest and he had actually held it over from previously.

1005
01:49:56,891 --> 01:49:58,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we just elected him into that seat.

1006
01:50:01,774 --> 01:50:15,016
[SPEAKER_10]: As a reminder, we have multiple titles, lots of titles to go around because we do have a chair chair and clerk, clerk position as well.

1007
01:50:19,137 --> 01:50:23,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like places sending an email right now to Amanda, putting his name in the.

1008
01:50:30,343 --> 01:50:34,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a request or an ultimatum he's got for us?

1009
01:50:34,566 --> 01:50:35,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I would vote.

1010
01:50:35,366 --> 01:50:36,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I would vote right now.

1011
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be ready to vote, please.

1012
01:50:44,132 --> 01:50:45,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have much to say about that.

1013
01:50:50,376 --> 01:50:51,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're asking a good question.

1014
01:50:51,877 --> 01:50:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's interested?

1015
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how do you vote if you don't know if anybody's, you know, interested or

1016
01:51:00,377 --> 01:51:03,559
[SPEAKER_04]: you can like recommend nominations, but.

1017
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, can we just ask if anybody is interested?

1018
01:51:11,224 --> 01:51:16,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's really what I'm trying to ask now to see if there is any interest.

1019
01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:20,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can know where we're voting.

1020
01:51:23,453 --> 01:51:29,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Jackie, would you be up for it as our experienced vice chair or would you be not so enthusiastic about that?

1021
01:51:31,077 --> 01:51:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of my biggest things with the chair is the quality of time that you can put into it.

1022
01:51:35,839 --> 01:51:44,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that I would not be able to complete the duties outside of my work duties.

1023
01:51:46,983 --> 01:51:48,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they elected, I thought about it.

1024
01:51:48,743 --> 01:51:54,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And as much as I love my city, I just, I don't know that I have the capacity at this time.

1025
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:05,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention, there's no stipend for me, but I would do it for free anyways.

1026
01:52:09,217 --> 01:52:29,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it sort of helpful for us to review, because as you're mentioning the time commitments, it's not always obvious to people what the chair does, but we do consult pretty regularly with the chair on matters about whether or not something needs to come before the board.

1027
01:52:29,872 --> 01:52:31,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes there are things of discretion.

1028
01:52:31,434 --> 01:52:36,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda frequently reviews the projects with the chair in advance.

1029
01:52:37,779 --> 01:52:44,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, do you want to talk a little bit about, because you are really the person who has been interacting with the chair the most over the past year.

1030
01:52:46,997 --> 01:52:47,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1031
01:52:47,297 --> 01:52:52,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm happy to talk about kind of what that has looked like with me so far.

1032
01:52:53,259 --> 01:53:02,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the past, I typically meet with the chair at least once before any scheduled meeting.

1033
01:53:02,843 --> 01:53:06,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And during that meeting, we go over what's expected.

1034
01:53:08,445 --> 01:53:24,741
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, field questions that either the chair has about the project, um, and also, like, questions I might have or the office might have about, like, is there other information that you anticipate that the board would really find helpful or useful?

1035
01:53:25,602 --> 01:53:30,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so we would have that one at least one meeting usually before, um,

1036
01:53:31,797 --> 01:53:34,560
[SPEAKER_06]: before each of the public meetings.

1037
01:53:36,203 --> 01:53:46,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, occasionally we would maybe bring the chair into conversation if there's a project that, I don't know, for various reasons, maybe there's like some

1038
01:53:47,958 --> 01:54:14,883
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple questions about or like, for example, with rise, we consulted with Andre a little bit after that one of some of the two like initial meetings that were had by the board just to kind of get a sense of there was some like question about like, are we getting enough information before you like, what are the questions that you have slash board members expressed?

1039
01:54:18,712 --> 01:54:28,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I would say that's about the gist, occasional consultation on things, depending on the nature of what's coming before the board.

1040
01:54:29,788 --> 01:54:36,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I could say that in a big picture way, we often get questions about how would the board feel about this?

1041
01:54:36,892 --> 01:54:38,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, should we bring it in front of the board?

1042
01:54:38,453 --> 01:54:41,154
[SPEAKER_11]: What would be the kinds of things they would want to hear from us?

1043
01:54:41,955 --> 01:54:49,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And depending on the nature of the project and the question, we can just answer that because we know, we've seen you guys ask,

1044
01:54:49,975 --> 01:54:55,058
[SPEAKER_11]: This is similar projects, similar questions, and this was a similar project.

1045
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,859
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the kinds of stuff that were asked for.

1046
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:58,039
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what they were looking at.

1047
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:04,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes it'll be a project and we'll be like, we have no idea what they're going to want to know or what's going to be different.

1048
01:55:04,983 --> 01:55:08,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it is useful to bounce some stuff off of somebody.

1049
01:55:10,865 --> 01:55:21,352
[SPEAKER_11]: rather than me speaking for the board, the chair can sort of say like, well, these are the kinds of things, you know, they could never say we're going to decide this or decide that, but they can make it clear.

1050
01:55:21,392 --> 01:55:24,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's just not enough information here.

1051
01:55:24,433 --> 01:55:29,256
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you bring it like this, you're going to get, uh, continued.

1052
01:55:29,276 --> 01:55:32,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you might as well just bring the information to first place.

1053
01:55:33,219 --> 01:55:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1054
01:55:36,995 --> 01:55:57,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess another small piece that I'll throw into the mix to think about is that, you know, whoever has interest and is nominated as chair, you and I can work together to figure out what kind of a strategy or, you know, schedule or whatever works for us going forward.

1055
01:55:57,107 --> 01:56:05,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, like Andre and I, I would prep kind of like a meeting preparation document that, you know, would have,

1056
01:56:06,884 --> 01:56:13,786
[SPEAKER_06]: different things of note and, you know, the governor's notice, for example, to read out and, and things like that.

1057
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And we sometimes go over it ahead of time.

1058
01:56:16,527 --> 01:56:24,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but we, you know, I'm happy to work with whomever to kind of figure out and strike a good balance of what works.

1059
01:56:26,493 --> 01:56:31,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the other thing that's important is that the chair does set the tone of the meeting.

1060
01:56:31,435 --> 01:56:40,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sit in on a lot of different board meetings, and I kind of actually felt it a lot this evening, is that, you know, okay, is it time to move on?

1061
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it time to call the question?

1062
01:56:42,881 --> 01:56:44,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it time to close this?

1063
01:56:44,921 --> 01:56:47,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Are people thinking or are they checked out, right?

1064
01:56:48,403 --> 01:56:54,066
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some I see some chairs who talk a lot and railroad the board a little.

1065
01:56:54,486 --> 01:56:56,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually those are not decision making boards.

1066
01:56:57,327 --> 01:57:07,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see other chairs who sit back so long that that meetings just sort of like as you were kind of saw this evening without somebody stepping up saying, OK, what's next?

1067
01:57:07,592 --> 01:57:08,272
[SPEAKER_11]: What's next?

1068
01:57:08,753 --> 01:57:10,654
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, things just can drag.

1069
01:57:11,754 --> 01:57:16,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is a certain amount of tone setting and setting the direction of

1070
01:57:18,555 --> 01:57:19,596
[SPEAKER_11]: in the meeting, right?

1071
01:57:19,716 --> 01:57:22,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, all right, I'm ready to entertain a motion.

1072
01:57:22,717 --> 01:57:28,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Their opinions sort of come through in the running of the meetings on the various cases.

1073
01:57:30,622 --> 01:57:40,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just think it's helpful to think about how does that, so you tend to have a lot of influence on whether or not it is your intention.

1074
01:57:47,473 --> 01:57:52,258
[SPEAKER_04]: My recommendation would be anybody who can run a very swift and efficient meeting.

1075
01:57:59,825 --> 01:58:05,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the feeling you're all capable of doing it if you know that that's what the rest of the board wants.

1076
01:58:05,271 --> 01:58:07,073
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for saying that, Christy.

1077
01:58:08,553 --> 01:58:11,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the challenge is the time commitment, right?

1078
01:58:12,034 --> 01:58:18,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I could say that anybody on this board could take on the chair based on their experience and background.

1079
01:58:19,395 --> 01:58:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: But to like Jackie's point, it's just really making sure that there's an understanding of the time commitment because each person I believe really wants to do a really good job and not, you know, fail one another or the city if they can't make that time commitment.

1080
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:54,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, one of the things that I've always done when I, like, for instance, I just helped MAPC with their rollout of the 2050, their 2050 Metro Carmen plan.

1081
01:58:55,080 --> 01:59:01,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the executive director approached me, I had to think about the quality and the time that I was dealing with that in my other work.

1082
01:59:01,544 --> 01:59:06,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like one of those things where it's like, you just don't want to raise your hand just because you have that expertise and that knowledge.

1083
01:59:07,427 --> 01:59:11,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure that everything fits the box and that you actually are seeing things.

1084
01:59:11,409 --> 01:59:22,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I'm starting to think about it, their plan, as well as the Medford Comprehensive Plan, as well as our work, and then the exodin recodification, it all does work together.

1085
01:59:22,634 --> 01:59:36,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe since I'm already working on all those other pieces, maybe I can, if no one else puts their hand up, maybe I can help our board move forward with the chair and sit in that seat.

1086
01:59:42,803 --> 02:00:05,379
[SPEAKER_11]: If it would make you feel more comfortable, I feel like we could also say, it is the intention that chairs are elected for a year, but I think that everybody would also be understanding if at any point the time commitment became overwhelming, we come back to the board and say, we need to reconsider, or you could say, I need to reconsider, I need somebody else to do this.

1087
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:10,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it's, everybody's very friendly here.

1088
02:00:14,798 --> 02:00:19,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be willing to do it if for no other reason than to get us out of here tonight and be able to close up our meeting.

1089
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:24,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that motion.

1090
02:00:30,947 --> 02:00:34,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we take a vote.

1091
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:35,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Candidates are one.

1092
02:00:36,451 --> 02:00:38,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question.

1093
02:00:38,652 --> 02:00:40,373
[SPEAKER_11]: You're allowed to have just one, but

1094
02:00:41,026 --> 02:00:43,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I heard both Jackie and David say they're willing to do it.

1095
02:00:44,188 --> 02:00:45,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard that too.

1096
02:00:46,209 --> 02:00:50,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but then I David came in strong after he came in really strong.

1097
02:00:52,213 --> 02:00:53,454
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my only involvement.

1098
02:00:53,474 --> 02:00:56,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, you're on like every board in the city, Jackie.

1099
02:00:56,476 --> 02:01:01,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think David really wants to do it.

1100
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm dying to do it.

1101
02:01:05,762 --> 02:01:07,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I've sent multiple emails already about it.

1102
02:01:08,444 --> 02:01:08,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,

1103
02:01:10,914 --> 02:01:12,235
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important information to know.

1104
02:01:14,256 --> 02:01:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: A motion to elect David Bloomberg as the chair of the Metric Community Development Board.

1105
02:01:20,178 --> 02:01:20,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a second.

1106
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:21,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I second.

1107
02:01:22,899 --> 02:01:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I third.

1108
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:25,940
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1109
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's three votes already.

1110
02:01:27,901 --> 02:01:28,761
[SPEAKER_06]: David, what do you think?

1111
02:01:29,781 --> 02:01:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And Emily?

1112
02:01:33,323 --> 02:01:34,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1113
02:01:34,623 --> 02:01:36,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if this is the official roll call vote.

1114
02:01:36,904 --> 02:01:37,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

1115
02:01:37,905 --> 02:01:38,745
[SPEAKER_05]: You got my vote, David.

1116
02:01:39,848 --> 02:01:40,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1117
02:01:44,033 --> 02:01:44,514
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1118
02:01:47,798 --> 02:01:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to get us out of here, but I'm assuming that we don't have to reelect myself as chair or we're going to do that as well.

1119
02:01:56,368 --> 02:01:57,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as vice chair.

1120
02:01:58,663 --> 02:02:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: unless I would propose, Jackie, if you are comfortable maintaining the vice chair seat, then I propose we continue that.

1121
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:12,493
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you are reconsidering that seat, then we can discuss.

1122
02:02:12,513 --> 02:02:17,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely be a backup as a vice chair.

1123
02:02:18,278 --> 02:02:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

1124
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:22,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1125
02:02:23,682 --> 02:02:25,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to elect Jackie as vice chair.

1126
02:02:27,044 --> 02:02:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

1127
02:02:27,444 --> 02:02:28,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1128
02:02:28,085 --> 02:02:28,785
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Christy.

1129
02:02:29,725 --> 02:02:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, roll call vote.

1130
02:02:31,446 --> 02:02:32,847
[SPEAKER_06]: David Bloomberg?

1131
02:02:33,287 --> 02:02:33,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1132
02:02:34,168 --> 02:02:34,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd?

1133
02:02:35,248 --> 02:02:35,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1134
02:02:36,169 --> 02:02:36,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Klaus Andreessen?

1135
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1136
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:39,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Hedeman?

1137
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:39,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1138
02:02:40,171 --> 02:02:40,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado?

1139
02:02:41,692 --> 02:02:41,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1140
02:02:42,212 --> 02:02:42,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1141
02:02:43,213 --> 02:02:43,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1142
02:02:44,401 --> 02:02:47,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, congratulations to you both.

1143
02:02:47,662 --> 02:02:58,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We do technically still have a third position, the clerk or secretary position, who would be involved in approving the minutes.

1144
02:03:00,345 --> 02:03:10,127
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't historically had this filled, and our office has been acting in that role, and I'm happy to keep doing that, but if,

1145
02:03:11,195 --> 02:03:17,904
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone would like to fill that role or we want to have a discussion about it, now is certainly an appropriate time for that.

1146
02:03:21,514 --> 02:03:42,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Amanda, just for background, by way of our discussion over the regulations and so forth, and the clerk being called out in the statute as an actual officer of planning board, it's really just a third person who's in sequence in case there are recusals or absences.

1147
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:48,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly this person could work with you to figure out

1148
02:03:49,813 --> 02:03:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: what level of involvement they might need the minutes.

1149
02:03:52,015 --> 02:03:55,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking they probably just make sure they read the minutes for each meeting.

1150
02:03:55,678 --> 02:04:01,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that this person, the clerk, is the person who maybe offers the minutes to the board for approval, that sort of thing.

1151
02:04:02,365 --> 02:04:04,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's probably as much as needs to happen.

1152
02:04:08,338 --> 02:04:20,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So it sounds like you're looking for somebody to commit that they will read the minutes before each meeting when Amanda sends them and then say to the board, I've read the minutes and I submit them to you for your approval.

1153
02:04:22,315 --> 02:04:24,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's as much as needs to happen.

1154
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:26,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And then otherwise you're third in succession.

1155
02:04:33,185 --> 02:04:37,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Emily, I thought you were unmuted because as the new member, you were gonna volunteer to do that.

1156
02:04:38,827 --> 02:04:40,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually was gonna volunteer to do that.

1157
02:04:41,567 --> 02:04:47,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Minus the last point, which is third in succession, I'm comfortable with everything else.

1158
02:04:48,089 --> 02:04:51,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys are comfortable with that, I can throw my name up.

1159
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Christie's point, get us out of here.

1160
02:04:54,651 --> 02:05:00,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also fine with supporting somebody else if there's somebody more interested in that role.

1161
02:05:01,852 --> 02:05:06,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily, just using the term succession, I might've given it more weight than it really means.

1162
02:05:06,955 --> 02:05:12,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for instance, Jackie has never, Jackie never, well, one meeting, I think Jackie said.

1163
02:05:12,277 --> 02:05:13,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just one.

1164
02:05:13,818 --> 02:05:20,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if both of you've recused yourself and you need somebody to preside over something, I'm comfortable.

1165
02:05:20,501 --> 02:05:22,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the Somerville Redevelopment Authority.

1166
02:05:22,282 --> 02:05:23,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I staffed that board.

1167
02:05:23,403 --> 02:05:26,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very comfortable around boards.

1168
02:05:26,984 --> 02:05:27,665
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be good to go.

1169
02:05:27,685 --> 02:05:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my vote is in.

1170
02:05:31,463 --> 02:05:37,706
[SPEAKER_04]: make a motion for Emily to second.

1171
02:05:37,786 --> 02:05:39,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So quick roll call vote.

1172
02:05:39,587 --> 02:05:40,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Dowd?

1173
02:05:40,628 --> 02:05:40,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1174
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:42,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Furtado?

1175
02:05:42,549 --> 02:05:42,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1176
02:05:43,409 --> 02:05:44,170
[SPEAKER_06]: David Bloomberg?

1177
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:44,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1178
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Klaus Andreasen?

1179
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:47,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1180
02:05:47,711 --> 02:05:48,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Hedeman?

1181
02:05:48,652 --> 02:05:48,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1182
02:05:50,033 --> 02:05:50,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1183
02:05:51,313 --> 02:05:53,254
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our new officers.

1184
02:05:58,019 --> 02:05:59,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all so much.

1185
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I will only keep you a short second longer just to let you know that things coming up on the horizon.

1186
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:12,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have two applications that were officially submitted for site plan review.

1187
02:06:12,653 --> 02:06:14,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned, I think,

1188
02:06:15,075 --> 02:06:32,769
[SPEAKER_06]: at least one of them in a previous meeting, 162 Mystic Ave Theory Wellness Cannabis Dispensary proposed, as well as a site on 595 Broadway, which would be multifamily, which actually has gone before the board in the past, but

1189
02:06:33,749 --> 02:06:44,052
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the time lapse from when they last submitted to us and the change in membership of both this board and the ZBA, we asked them to resubmit.

1190
02:06:44,612 --> 02:06:53,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can anticipate figuring out some scheduling for a mid-August meeting next.

1191
02:06:54,174 --> 02:07:00,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep your ears peeled, wait, eyes peeled for that email.

1192
02:07:00,176 --> 02:07:01,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We can start figuring out those dates.

1193
02:07:03,315 --> 02:07:08,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And if 595 doesn't sound familiar, it's because, Amanda, it was 2016, right?

1194
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:10,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it?

1195
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:11,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it might've been 2020, actually.

1196
02:07:11,822 --> 02:07:16,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thought it was so long ago that none of us were on the board.

1197
02:07:16,846 --> 02:07:18,327
