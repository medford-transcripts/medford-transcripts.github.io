1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:05,606
Okay, well, I think that we have most everybody here.

2
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,328
And Andre may join us a little bit later.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,653
And actually, before we get the meeting going, I should say that I understand.

4
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:25,480
So Andre, I believe is not no longer the chair has, you know, his term formally ended at the end of last month and

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,201
We may see him on another board.

6
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:35,704
But I haven't spoken to anybody ahead of this meeting about facilitating the meeting.

7
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:45,607
And unless, Jackie, unless you were expecting to facilitate the meeting, in which case, happy to cede the floor to you.

8
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:51,490
I'm happy to manage until we get to kind of some of the election pieces later.

9
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,871
So I kind of want to put that out to the members.

10
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,312
Yeah, thank you.

11
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,233
I mean, I was a little confused on that part without there being a chair.

12
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:10,595
I didn't know if I was supposed to take over, but I know I also have not touched base with you prior to this meeting, so I prefer if you just go ahead and facilitate for this evening.

13
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,296
Absolutely, absolutely.

14
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:17,237
And yes, sorry for not being more communicative before this point.

15
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:24,879
So with that, we're going to open the meeting at 6.05, and I'm just going to read the governor's order here.

16
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:34,184
Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

17
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:39,588
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein.

18
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:48,594
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

19
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,576
And I will just call a quick roll.

20
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,098
So Jackie Furtado,

21
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:55,598
here.

22
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:57,779
Christy Dowd.

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,260
Here.

24
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,182
David Bloomberg here.

25
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:05,423
Plus on Jason.

26
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:06,643
Here.

27
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:10,645
And our newest member, which I'm excited.

28
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,006
Um, we'll get to introduce tonight.

29
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,707
Emily Hedeman here.

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,861
Yeah, so maybe we take a moment just to say hello to Emily.

31
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,704
Hi, welcome to the board.

32
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,105
We're very excited to have you.

33
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:41,652
Just if you had any interest in making a brief introduction about yourself, feel free, but I also don't want to put you on the spot.

34
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:43,053
Sure.

35
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:46,056
You guys will learn soon enough that I'm not very shy.

36
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:49,684
My name is Emily Hedeman.

37
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,387
I live in the Wellington Riverside neighborhood.

38
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,349
I'm a renter, I work in renewable energy.

39
00:02:57,369 --> 00:03:03,654
I have two dogs, and I moved to the city of Medford in August of 2021.

40
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:09,798
So I'm a very, very new resident, and I'm excited to contribute to the city of Medford.

41
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,848
because I feel like it's already given me so much as a resident.

42
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:19,512
So thank you for the opportunity to be on the board, to serve with you, fellow board members, and let's get the meeting started.

43
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,293
Awesome.

44
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:22,933
Thank you, Emily.

45
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:31,838
With that, so first item on the agenda has to do with the approval of minutes from January 5th, 2022.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,400
Does anyone have any comments about the minutes?

47
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,437
Okay.

48
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,799
I would entertain a motion for approval.

49
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,861
Amanda, this is Dave.

50
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,182
Yes, David.

51
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:59,628
I'd like to offer a motion to approve the board's minutes of the meeting held January 5th, 2022.

52
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,069
Thank you.

53
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,650
Do we have a second?

54
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,385
Is Christy my second?

55
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:07,445
Great.

56
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,086
And we'll do a roll call vote.

57
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:12,886
So Jackie Furtado?

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,667
Yes.

59
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:16,387
Christy Dowd?

60
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:18,487
Yes.

61
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:20,388
David Bloomberg?

62
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,208
Yes.

63
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:23,268
Klaas Andreasen?

64
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:24,508
Yes.

65
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:29,849
And actually, Emily, I think because you weren't there, you may not get to vote on this one.

66
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,950
Either that or I'm going to abstain.

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,550
OK, great.

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,410
So abstain.

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,322
And with that, I believe we have our that's passed.

70
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:42,604
Thanks, everybody.

71
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,626
We can move along to the next item.

72
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,189
So let me pull up my notes here.

73
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,151
So this is a public hearing.

74
00:04:53,727 --> 00:05:14,615
for the proposed amendment to chapter 94 zoning to alter the zoning district designation of the area of land bounded by Boston Avenue to the southwest, North Street to the southeast and the MBTA railroad tracks to the northeast and the Summerville border to the northeast from industrial I to office 202.

75
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,197
I believe the proponents are available tonight.

76
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:21,436
to speak to their position.

77
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:27,241
And staff is also available to walk the board through this zoning change in more detail.

78
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:32,425
Would the board like to hear from petitioners first?

79
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,347
Amanda, if I can interrupt.

80
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:35,848
This is Dave.

81
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:36,548
Yes.

82
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,451
I used to be employed by Cummings Properties.

83
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,293
We'll hear from Cummings Properties tonight.

84
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:47,546
Well, I don't continue to hold any financial interest in the organization.

85
00:05:47,566 --> 00:06:01,730
I think it would be best practice to recuse myself from the deliberations tonight because of the small size of the parcel and so much of it being comprised of land owned by Cummings.

86
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:09,532
So I will mute myself and eliminate the video during the discussions.

87
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:11,373
Sounds good.

88
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,033
Thank you, David.

89
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,912
Amanda, this is Jackie vice chair.

90
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:27,189
So, with David refusing himself, do we have enough to vote on it, I know the DNA is not feeling well tonight but if she's still on the board I thought she was in the same position as Andre with her.

91
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:28,523
term expiring?

92
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:36,251
Yes, so we will have enough people to vote tonight as there's still four folks, which is a majority of the seven board members.

93
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:41,356
And regarding Deanna, I'm glad that you brought that up.

94
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:45,941
So I had misunderstood in thinking that the

95
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:52,886
once the term limit was up June 30th, that board members could no longer serve on the board.

96
00:06:53,606 --> 00:07:10,598
And as I've been informed by Alicia, who has actually reached out to legal counsel about this in the past, if a position is not yet filled, the current board member can continue as an on hold status until that position is filled.

97
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:12,839
And so they can continue to vote in that interim.

98
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,260
And we've spoken with Deanna

99
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:18,349
ahead of now and she's comfortable moving forward with that.

100
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,312
Okay, thank you.

101
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:39,666
Okay, so perhaps maybe I believe I see Mike Avini on the call as well as John Walsh who are proponents who had put this petition forward originally.

102
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:45,773
Maybe I invite Mike first to speak about this if you would like.

103
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:47,285
Awesome.

104
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:48,706
Thank you very much.

105
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:49,467
Thank you, Amanda.

106
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:51,228
Good evening.

107
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:58,573
My name is Michael Avani I'm an architect with Cummings properties on behalf of Simmons properties for the benefit of the Cummings Foundation.

108
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,596
Thank you very much for having us here tonight.

109
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:09,982
For clarification, the request that Cummings properties and Simmons properties has before.

110
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,652
the City Council and then subsequently the Planning Board.

111
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:21,519
It is separate and distinct from the, although the same different property from Mr. Walsh's property.

112
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:35,892
So I'm here tonight seeking the Community Development Board support regarding our petition that is before the City Council, seeking to change the zoning designation of the properties at 196 and 200 Boston Avenue from industrial

113
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,222
to the newly created office to zoning district.

114
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:48,888
As such, we, we asked the recording in progress can recordings in progress.

115
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:54,773
We asked the board to consider our request and provide a positive recommendation to the city council on this matter.

116
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:58,817
I understand that.

117
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:05,518
the planning, the community on the board here is familiar with the zoning change.

118
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:20,182
I don't know at this point if you have any questions specific to our petition regarding the zoning change and our request to be put into the 02 zoning district, but I'd be happy to answer any questions.

119
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:24,949
Thanks, Mike.

120
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:33,716
I might ask, before we go into questions, if John Walsh would like to provide any testimony as well.

121
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,079
Yes, thank you, Amanda.

122
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,024
Good evening, members of the Planning and Development Board, Metric residents, ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:50,832
My name is John Walsh, and I am a petitioner for amending the zoning map to include four parcels located on Boston Avenue.

124
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:57,185
all would be within the newly created Office 2 zoning district.

125
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:08,769
As the petition reflects, the parcels are 222, 230, 236 Boston Avenue, and 67 North Street.

126
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,293
I am the president and treasurer of Elizabeth Grady Properties and the managing member of 236 Boston Avenue LLC, 67 North Street LLC,

127
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,556
and I have the authority to make all decisions.

128
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:34,241
The parcels mentioned are currently located in the industrial zone and comprise approximately 1.4 acres.

129
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:48,609
The sites are contiguous and in close proximity to the newly constructed Medford Tufts Greenline Station, which will allow for convenient access to additional public transportation to the site.

130
00:10:50,355 --> 00:11:01,137
With the progressive creation of a new zoning district by the council and the planning board, the site is now poised for life science, among other research and development companies.

131
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:20,081
The conversion of these fossils from industrial to O2 would allow for more modern buildings, a substantial increase in tax revenue, gainful employment within the city, and create a mixed use area of opportunity

132
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,350
which doesn't currently exist in that area.

133
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,573
And last but not least, along with more green space.

134
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:38,281
The property locations clearly seem to comport with what was intended by the city planning board and city council in creating the O2 district.

135
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:49,149
And in conclusion, I would respectfully request approval of this petition as an amendment along with Cummings properties at all, the zoning map.

136
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,002
And I would thank you for your consideration.

137
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,526
Thank you, John.

138
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,288
You're welcome, Miranda.

139
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:03,049
All right.

140
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:12,135
And I think maybe what I'll do is we'll share the map that we have that shows these locations.

141
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,057
So if you'll just give me one moment.

142
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:32,107
All right, can folks see this?

143
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,595
Yes, Vic, are you gonna?

144
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:39,902
Yeah, sure.

145
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,223
This is Victor Schrader.

146
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,024
I'm the director of economic development.

147
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,585
Walk us through these slides.

148
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:53,468
We pulled these together just to show the board and the public what's being considered this evening.

149
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,931
The properties highlighted in red are those owned by proponent John Walsh.

150
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:03,933
So those are the four properties that he mentioned in his opening remarks.

151
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,214
Amanda, if you flip

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,921
to the next one.

153
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:14,604
We just pull pull them at parcel maps that can move on.

154
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:20,307
This is showing the if you go back up actually.

155
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:22,668
This the red.

156
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:27,590
Boxer John Walsh's property, the light lighter red.

157
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,060
Next slide.

158
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:51,287
Just the parcels, the four parcels that Mr. Walsh mentioned in the corner of Boston Avenue and North Street.

159
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:52,368
Next slide.

160
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:04,397
This slide represents the entire industrial district, so it includes properties owned by Mr. Walsh and incoming properties as they are today.

161
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:13,636
That encompasses the entire area that would be changed from industrial to office, too.

162
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,677
Next slide.

163
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,418
Again, parcel map.

164
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,199
And I think that's all.

165
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,220
Amanda, I think it might be helpful for the public and the board to show the table.

166
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:43,735
Before you go off this slide, I was actually, there's a bunch of stuff on the top that sort of looks like it might be parcel lines, but I think that what that was was easements, right?

167
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:54,519
So we want to state definitively that there is one parcel that is fully owned by Cummings, and then there are the five owned by John Walsh, there's four, five.

168
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,685
And they are all of the entirety of the owners of the parcels in this industrial district.

169
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:10,889
So I just wanted to be explicit that there is not somebody else's property that's getting grouped in here or anything like that.

170
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,431
I was just looking at the top there.

171
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,391
There are a bunch of lines.

172
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,852
I believe those are easements, right?

173
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,453
Those are not.

174
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,130
Mr. Avini, I think, can speak to that, or he's giving me the thumbs up.

175
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,572
Yeah, no, I'd be happy to, if you don't mind.

176
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:38,565
So yes, what we're seeing on the screen, the lot N05-7 is what we call 200 Boston Ave, which is formally known as 200 Boston Ave, currently known as, formally known as 200 Boston Ave.

177
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:42,368
The N05-6 is a little piece of the 196 Boston Ave lot.

178
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,109
So that lot kind of straddles,

179
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,795
that building in the lot straddle some of OEM metric.

180
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:54,978
We just like the whole of the properties that are managed by the company to be included in this.

181
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,998
So it would indeed be the two lots.

182
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:04,201
And yes, the dash lines you see are the ones that go kind of from Boston out to the train tracks, if you will.

183
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,922
That's an MWRA easement.

184
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,603
I'm not sure what the curved one is, but

185
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,869
So you're 100% accurate.

186
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,770
I just want to clarify that we do have two pieces of property there.

187
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:26,416
I just wanted to be very explicit to everybody that there is no discussion of properties owned by somebody other than the two entities here this evening.

188
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,074
Thank you.

189
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:46,200
And saying that also, Alicia and Victor, can you actually explain to the board and for the public purposes, and I believe someone asked this in the chat, can you back up a little bit and give us the difference between industrial and office two, especially with someone asking if it is going to have any effect on green line extension?

190
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,803
And I'm assuming that means because usually industrial has less public interaction where offices, commercial would have more.

191
00:16:55,263 --> 00:17:02,110
And so I'm guessing that's maybe a transportation sort of question, but if you can just back up and explain that for the record.

192
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,634
I think, thank you very much.

193
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,977
That's in fact what Victor was going to next.

194
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:14,704
We have the table showing the industrial zoning and the office two zoning.

195
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,367
Victor's prepared to speak to that.

196
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:23,684
Yeah, there are a couple of different distinctions between Office 2 and industrials.

197
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:31,369
Some of the most significant are in the dimensional table, what is allowed to be built in each district.

198
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,513
And you can see I included some of the other commercial districts just to give you context.

199
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:42,616
But Office 2 is the top line, and this is what

200
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,804
the zoning ordinance.

201
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:52,866
So really we just pulled pulled it out and simplified it a little bit for this context.

202
00:17:54,546 --> 00:18:00,088
Currently in the industrial district, there's a high restriction of 30 feet, two stories.

203
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:05,830
You can see some front, side, and rear setbacks.

204
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:13,113
The lot area, and this is a minimum permitted, is 10,000 square feet and above.

205
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,245
And then the frontage of an industrial lot and industrial district must be 35 feet in order to be built.

206
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:25,769
In the office too, we've increased the height in the stories.

207
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:36,479
Really the intention is to allow for more modern office buildings, mixed-use office buildings specifically, and to accommodate lab, which

208
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,622
and life science uses which have different requirements than traditional office buildings.

209
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,043
They need higher floor to ceiling heights.

210
00:18:48,704 --> 00:19:04,410
And so we feel we've accommodated those in the height here and the stories while also trying to maintain some sensitivity to the context of the neighborhood and the buildings that are already in the district.

211
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:20,529
The existing Cummings building on the site 200 Boston Ave is, correct me if I'm wrong, but around 60 feet to the roof, not including rooftop mechanicals.

212
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:25,531
So we're going a little beyond that here, but really just one floor.

213
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:32,154
And I think it's important to mention that

214
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:33,947
So.

215
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:43,452
Throughout Medford any relief from these dimensional requirements is typically by variance the new zoning permits.

216
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,853
Relief by special permit.

217
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:48,255
So it's a slightly different process.

218
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,617
But any large-scale projects that are above 10,000

219
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:00,405
the zoning requirements.

220
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:07,709
As well as ask for relief by special permit 3rd if they're not meeting any of these zoning requirements that are that are here.

221
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,970
These dimensional requirements.

222
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,571
There's some differences in uses as well.

223
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,992
Like I said, we we're trying to.

224
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,894
Transition this or the zoning.

225
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,575
The office to district

226
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:37,179
commercial office with first floor retail or restaurants to fit into the neighborhood a little bit better.

227
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:44,971
So the Office 2 District allows for office, it allows for lab.

228
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:50,097
It also allows for retail and restaurants and consumer services.

229
00:20:50,977 --> 00:21:02,080
The industrial district was, as you would imagine, focused more on auto uses, storage, wholesale, manufacturing, those types of uses.

230
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,622
So most of those have gone away or would go away if the Office 2 district was approved here.

231
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:12,623
So those aren't allowed in the Office 2 district.

232
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:23,624
I think that's all I had in terms of a comparison.

233
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,725
If anyone has any questions on that, I'm happy to answer them.

234
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:35,510
And then Jackie,

235
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:36,674
there.

236
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:42,036
In terms of the question in the chat about would there be any effect on the green line extension.

237
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:49,098
And not to our knowledge, this none of these properties kind of impedes on the rail line there.

238
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,320
There has been contemplation of

239
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:11,361
We don't believe that there would be any impact to the possibility of that given this change.

240
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:23,428
So before that we get to board questions, I think it would actually be helpful to just highlight, I feel like there's an elephant in the room question.

241
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:28,191
And in fact, it's literally, oh, I shouldn't have referred to you guys as elephants, I apologize.

242
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:42,802
that one of the questions is what the city's three comprehensive plan to understand why what zoning change, we would like to see where, and we, it would be premature to make zoning changes in advance of that.

243
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,644
However, there are market forces at work here.

244
00:22:46,725 --> 00:23:04,270
And so this is one of those, so it happened that, I'm gonna tell you, it was chance that our comprehensive plan consultants are in fact here this evening to talk to us about the comprehensive plan and what is in it at the same night as that we're having this public hearing on a zoning change.

245
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:09,712
So I had asked them if asked, they are prepared, they could say a few words about it.

246
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,253
But we basically saw this from the offices.

247
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,274
This is some stuff that we know people really would like to do.

248
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:21,156
We've been talking to Mr. Walsh for quite a while about how he would like to develop his property.

249
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:27,178
Cummings, as you're aware, had brought a project forward and then had trouble with the zoning board.

250
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:43,556
As recently as the last Zoning Board meeting, the Zoning Board had actually, a project came in front of them and their big question is, why aren't you changing the zoning first and then rather than asking us for these variances?

251
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:48,702
And basically the answer is that the market is moving so fast and there are opportunities right now.

252
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:52,404
And we'd like to take advantage of these opportunities.

253
00:23:52,864 --> 00:24:05,492
And in fact, this zoning change is very much in line with what we are seeing from the comprehensive plan, what we are seeing from the public comments, from the research that's being done.

254
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:16,776
and I don't wanna speak too much for our comprehensive plan consultants, but I did say to them, is this in line with what we're seeing coming out of your thing?

255
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:34,083
And it didn't make sense to us to wait for a couple of months when these property owners would really like to actually move on their properties now and to make them wait unnecessarily for a zoning change that would be

256
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,509
very reasonably come from us later.

257
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:46,013
It also feels better to us that if a zoning change is to come from the property owners, then it's not the city doing it to them.

258
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,795
It's them saying, this is how we'd like to see our development go.

259
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:58,599
So Brie and Emily, we haven't introduced you yet, but would you guys be comfortable in saying if the board would like you to?

260
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm seeing some nods.

261
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,913
Is that okay with the board?

262
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:08,577
Would you like to hear from the comprehensive plan consultants about this matter?

263
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:12,840
Or do you have other questions first?

264
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:18,184
No other questions.

265
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,829
I was a little curious about the current uses of the site.

266
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,213
I think maybe another attendee echoes that question, but

267
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:36,805
just seeing what's there, it looks like there's a big building and a couple of small buildings.

268
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,126
I'm more curious about the small buildings.

269
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,847
Can you tell me what's going on there now?

270
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:45,468
This is John Walsh.

271
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:46,509
Hi, John.

272
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:46,829
Thank you.

273
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,530
I'm the owner of Walsh.

274
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,352
Yes, so the building at 222 Boston Avenue houses the Elizabeth Grady Company.

275
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:05,459
In the front building at 230 Boston Avenue, that's warehouse and distribution storage.

276
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,881
The building next to it is used for storage as well.

277
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:15,103
And that's 236 Boston Avenue, I'm sorry.

278
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:20,606
And then 67 North Street that sits on the corner of Boston Avenue and

279
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:36,862
North Street was a upholstery company in which the gentleman actually passed away, and a monument company next to it, and the two families.

280
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:46,746
Thank you, John.

281
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:48,187
I appreciate that background.

282
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:48,487
You're welcome.

283
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,527
Emily, are you familiar with 200 Boston Ave?

284
00:26:57,547 --> 00:27:00,048
Would you like Mike to speak to that?

285
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:01,769
That would be helpful.

286
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,610
Thank you.

287
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:08,412
Sorry about that.

288
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:11,093
Yeah, thank you, Emily and Victor.

289
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:19,137
Yeah, so 200 Boston Ave currently is, it was formerly, from what I understand, a mattress factory.

290
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:23,299
It's this beautiful kind of cast in place concrete

291
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,874
old mill building from around the 1920s.

292
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:30,476
And it's been repurposed now.

293
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:36,960
It is filled with life science companies, predominantly life science companies.

294
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,681
There was a gym downstairs.

295
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:46,205
At one point in time, the Medford Public Library moved there while their main facility was being renovated.

296
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:50,508
There are some accessory office spaces there as well.

297
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:58,221
Our highest and best use for that building would continue the life science program.

298
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:02,471
is.

299
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:03,432
Thank you, Emily.

300
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:04,694
You may not be aware.

301
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:07,256
So Cummings had put together a proposal.

302
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:16,907
The building in front is a parking lot, and they had put together a proposal to make that a second life science lab building.

303
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:22,212
And that proposal had trouble with the zoning.

304
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:31,018
basically it went through this board, it went through site plan review, and then it did not get the zoning variances that it requested.

305
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:36,921
So they actually had tried to put Build Life Science there.

306
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:41,564
And I will sort of add to that, part of the reason for moving is that

307
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:52,342
This city would like to see new development we'd like to see increased taxes, we'd like to, without having to raise the taxes on our current residents.

308
00:28:53,062 --> 00:29:04,107
So, newly developed buildings additional buildings would bring in significant new growth revenue to the city, and the longer we push that down the longer we wait for that to happen.

309
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,669
which is part of why we're bringing that forward now.

310
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:18,258
Those of us who work in the city are very aware that there was a difficult budget discussions over the past few months with this question about where's the revenue coming from?

311
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:19,879
Revenue comes from new growth.

312
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,881
Sure.

313
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:22,741
I add something.

314
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,102
This is John Walsh.

315
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,565
May I add some color to what you just stated?

316
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:31,168
Sure, John.

317
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:43,770
The currently, from a tax liability perspective on the four buildings that I own, the annual taxes are $100,126, with an assessed value of $5,598,700.

318
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,814
For the change on that site for a future, a complete stabilized analysis, the assessed value on that property would bring in

319
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:04,940
property taxes.

320
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:14,362
Based on around a couple 100,000 square feet similar to Cummings, the tax liability of the tax proceeds to the city would change from $100,126 currently.

321
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:14,462
$2,900,000 per

322
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:35,382
to work out in your favor.

323
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:39,063
Everything else was to move forward smoothly.

324
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:53,966
What sort of timeline are you looking at in terms of either completing additional construction on the site with life science or redevelopment of the site with the smaller structures on it?

325
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,347
Are you asking me, John Walsh, the question?

326
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,127
I guess it's both.

327
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:08,857
These are separate projects, but we're proposing the rezoning together, essentially.

328
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,258
Right.

329
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:25,572
If I may speak first, if you don't mind, is I've had a plethora of inquiries from life science companies over the past two years.

330
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,014
that we initially broached this with the city.

331
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:39,740
So I would say, as I mentioned, there's a number of companies that are anxious to move forward imminently, when I say imminently, this summer.

332
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:45,804
Okay, but no LOI or anything in hand at this point?

333
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:48,966
I have four LOIs in hand.

334
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:49,826
Okay, perfect.

335
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:50,527
Awesome.

336
00:31:55,893 --> 00:32:02,656
And then it sounds like the Cummings redevelopment would also accelerate pretty quickly based on the plans you guys have.

337
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:04,617
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

338
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:18,803
Yeah, we had been, as mentioned earlier, we had been in front of the Community Development Board twice last year and brought this project through.

339
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:24,566
And at the time we had a tenant who was looking to expand

340
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,518
We really had a lot of interest in it.

341
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:34,201
Subsequently, when we didn't get to where we needed to be, we kind of back-burnered it a little bit.

342
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:42,186
And just recently, as the last month, we have continued to think about how this could happen again.

343
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:46,908
And we have, again, more clients in the building that would like to expand.

344
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:51,010
So this is definitely something that is on our front burner.

345
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:53,192
Schedule-wise, it certainly isn't

346
00:32:54,373 --> 00:33:03,645
isn't it this summer project uh construction takes a little time but we you know if we could if we have the interest in this um we could

347
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:11,893
we could move as soon as first quarter of next year, really to kind of get shovels on the ground.

348
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:19,438
That is if everything goes well and that'd be kind of the soonest construction date.

349
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:25,582
But as Mr. Walsh had mentioned, people are chomping at the bit for this type of space.

350
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:32,167
So we're pretty optimistic that this is something that could really work.

351
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:34,641
Great, thank you.

352
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:35,901
I don't have any more questions.

353
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:42,983
And I guess, sorry, I keep thinking of things that would be helpful for the board.

354
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:50,765
So when the Cummings project was being considered, they did a public meeting outside of the public hearing process.

355
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:56,226
And there was a lot of interest and support in seeing a life science building there.

356
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,627
There are people who would love to be able to walk to work.

357
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,368
There were some concerns.

358
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:10,435
They tended to be concerns that were involved not having a thorough understanding of what kind of life science would be allowed in Medford.

359
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:19,261
And that we have rules and the ones that you would be scared of are not allowed to be in the city of Medford.

360
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:21,623
There's plenty of interest from the ones that

361
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,943
everybody would be comfortable with.

362
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,284
We could go into more detail if that's helpful.

363
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:30,204
But I also just want to be clear that this would change the zoning.

364
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:49,488
So if either or both property owners proposed a project that was then allowed as of right, the size of those buildings would still require them to come through site plan review for this body to work with the look, the feel, the shapes, the details.

365
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:50,669
on it.

366
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,760
And if either of them still wanted any variances, they would still have to go to the zoning board for variances.

367
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:02,785
But what we've basically heard from the zoning board is

368
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:11,245
a height variance should be coming through as a zoning change first, which is why they're coming here first for the zoning change.

369
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:19,148
And this board will make a recommendation and ultimately it is the city council that will actually vote on it.

370
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:30,292
And to be clear for anybody who is listening, any decision by this board is not an actual change or denial of zoning, it is a recommendation

371
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:34,663
to the city council who is still the decision maker on this request.

372
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:37,786
I'm going to turn it back over to you.

373
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:41,267
Alicia just to clarify under the office to district.

374
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,849
Any relief from dimensional relief.

375
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:50,131
So if they want to go a little higher than what's allowed in the district or a little wider.

376
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,371
Those are all by special permit.

377
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,433
Variance under the office to

378
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:16,500
So are there other other questions from the board?

379
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:23,782
There are also members of the public that we can open it up to.

380
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:33,325
If there are no questions from the board, then we should open, this is a public hearing.

381
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:38,126
We'll wanna open up to the public for any questions.

382
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:50,431
Yes, so if any members of the public would like to provide a comment, you can do so by raising your hand and I'll call on you and you can unmute.

383
00:36:51,913 --> 00:37:02,943
Also, I'll put the office email in the chat in case you'd like to provide anything in writing that way before the end of the hearing.

384
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,334
Okay.

385
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:14,055
Yes, Kayla.

386
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm curious, I've heard a little bit about the Walkland Court redevelopment, which is the property to the north owned by the Medford Housing Authority.

387
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:39,748
Is there any chat, talk about how large those, I mean, I don't know when that project would be happening, but I'm curious whether the heights would sort, for anyone that's concerned about the height differential in the O2 district versus

388
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:45,444
industrial district, like what is the relationship across those properties kind of as a whole.

389
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:58,100
Kayla actually I looked at the latest walk on court plan yesterday, thinking this might come up and they do propose to

390
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:05,109
higher density buildings along the southern edge of that, of their property.

391
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,032
And what was shown in the plans that I found was five stories.

392
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:19,899
Those are residential, so that in terms of total height, they'll be a little shorter, but five stories is what they're showing there.

393
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,360
Okay.

394
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,841
Six stories, five stories.

395
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:26,984
Okay, thank you.

396
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:32,383
And Kayla, I'm sorry, could you provide your full name and address for the record?

397
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,263
I'm sure Kayla Bachman at 604 Fulton Street.

398
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:37,444
Thank you.

399
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:45,525
EB, I saw you might have been interested in providing a comment.

400
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:51,006
Yes, sorry, I was trying to rename myself there.

401
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:52,506
It's Elizabeth Bale.

402
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:56,847
I'm sorry, just your address for the record as well?

403
00:38:58,026 --> 00:38:59,107
34 Emory Street.

404
00:38:59,567 --> 00:38:59,927
Thank you.

405
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:05,131
Um, yeah, so I just had a couple of things as I put in the chat earlier.

406
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:11,735
I wanted to know whether the existing structures were nonconforming or whether there was anything nonconforming about them.

407
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:22,902
And I also just wanted to, um, say again for the record that I am concerned that nothing about changing the zoning or

408
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:40,763
the projects that are considered will interfere with eventually extending the green line as was the preferred alternative to Route 16, Mystic Valley Parkway as the terminus.

409
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:43,826
So those are my concerns.

410
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:44,267
Thank you.

411
00:39:51,576 --> 00:40:01,281
So I will just say that we've looked at, we don't see any way that the zoning change would impact a potential Green Line extension.

412
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:09,146
And all of the property that has been thought of with relation to that is not in this zoning district.

413
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,668
In fact, most if not all of it is actually in Somerville.

414
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:19,026
Um, I can't speak to the building of any buildings because there are no buildings proposed.

415
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:24,489
This does still require correct me if I'm wrong, Victor, a 15 ft setback.

416
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:34,694
Um, that shouldn't be cause any difficulty if the green line extension were to go forward.

417
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:46,963
Well, I guess I just want to say that when we were very heavily meeting about the extension with the preferred alternative to mystic Valley Parkway.

418
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:58,152
There was a lot of concern about 200 Boston have because it actually extends into an area that the fire.

419
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:14,779
department had some problem with the amount of clearance with the tracks and, um, and they had an adjustment they wanted to make with the building might have precluded, um, something to do with the extension.

420
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:20,182
So I just want people to be aware of that and that it's a concern.

421
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,945
Thank you for for bringing that up.

422
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:31,265
Thank you.

423
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,589
Good to hear that people are still pushing for it.

424
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:43,356
We do have.

425
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:53,134
I was gonna say that, Amanda, that we have some, if there are no more public comments here, we have some letters from the public.

426
00:41:53,954 --> 00:42:00,879
Yes, and I'm happy to share, so we have two letters that, I put them both in the meeting materials folder.

427
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,804
Let me pull up, and I can read them into the record if folks want.

428
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,987
Maybe I'll do that, since there's only two.

429
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,932
All right, and so this is from the Medford Chamber of Commerce President, Maury Carroll.

430
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:26,215
And so in summary, it's a letter of support.

431
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,836
And I can just read a segment here.

432
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:34,279
The Medford Chamber of Commerce is expressing its support for additional life science development in the city of Medford.

433
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:44,985
We understand that life science companies and developers have specific requirements relating to building design, such as increased ceiling height, large floor plates, additional storage, and preferred building amenities.

434
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:53,067
that may not be in alignment with existing land use policy, the newly created Office 2 District was specifically created to encourage this type of development.

435
00:42:54,007 --> 00:43:06,549
I may just summarize here that it says the chamber is ready to work with the city, city officials, staff, and stakeholders to create an environment that fosters, supports, and encourages development of this type.

436
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:13,531
We believe that doing so will ultimately support existing Medford businesses and attract additional economic development to the city.

437
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:23,942
We have one additional letter that was submitted by Ken Kraus of 50 Mystic Street.

438
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:34,508
This letter is to register my support for the proposed amendment to the city of Medford zoning map to change the zoning district designation from industrial to office two.

439
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:45,157
The office to zoning category created in the city's recently complete zoning regulations update is appropriate for this area, given its current uses and proposed additions.

440
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:53,722
Long past are the days when the site was home to industrial operations such as the Union Paste Company, American Wool and Company, and Container Corporation of America.

441
00:43:54,323 --> 00:44:02,709
Over the last three decades, the site has been transformed into largely office use and increasingly laboratory and life science space, with more of the latter planned soon.

442
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:11,098
And I want to just summarize some of the points here.

443
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:30,110
Looking forward, in addition to approving their petitions, I would suggest that the Community Development Board encourage both proponents to work closely together as their future projects unfold, especially in the area of transportation demand management and efforts to minimize the volume of automobile traffic to the site.

444
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:41,685
Some possible collaborative measures could include publicly supporting and making a financial contribution to advancing plans for the Green Line station proposed to be constructed next to the site.

445
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:47,352
Opposing reductions in bus service to the site, such as the MBTA's current plans to eliminate

446
00:44:47,714 --> 00:45:12,335
route 80 bus, supporting the ongoing efforts of the Mystic River Watershed Association and Department of Conservation and Recreation to enhance the bicycle and pedestrian network in the area with connections to West Medford commuter rail station, considering ways to minimize parking and share parking areas, electric vehicle charging stations, and shared covered bicycle parking areas, initiating the creation of

447
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:31,209
a nonprofit transportation management association, such as the Charles River TMA, in conjunction with the City of Medford Chamber of Commerce and Tufts to provide and promote sustainable transportation options for commuters and residents to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility and air quality.

448
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,911
Thank you for your consideration.

449
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:43,126
And I'm just checking our email and it looks that we have not received any additional comments.

450
00:45:54,549 --> 00:46:00,090
So do any members of the board, do you want to hear from the comprehensive plan consultants?

451
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,531
Would you like to offer a motion?

452
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,811
Do you have any questions?

453
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,342
this is Jackie vice chair.

454
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:11,526
I actually do have a question overall with the zoning change over there.

455
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:19,732
Obviously the industrial seems to have phased out over there, but the U-Haul that sits there, how would these align with the U-Haul that's right around the corner?

456
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,914
I'm just trying to figure it out.

457
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:32,162
And I guess I do need to see it more comprehensively and would like to know what the members of the comprehensive team thinks.

458
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:42,037
So to be clear, the U-Haul is in Somerville, and we have no impact over Somerville zoning.

459
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:43,998
Okay.

460
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:51,703
So there's actually another Cummings building between this property and the U-Haul.

461
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:52,844
Okay.

462
00:46:55,706 --> 00:47:01,189
Alicia, I can speak to the comprehensive plan if it's appropriate at this point.

463
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:01,949
Sure.

464
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,710
Thank you, Emily.

465
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:09,706
So for the record, my name is Emily Ennis, I'm principal of Ennis associates and one of the team members, the comprehensive plan.

466
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:16,431
Part of my role on the team is the analysis of zoning so we'll talk with you more tonight.

467
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:29,402
Later on, but prior to this meeting, Alicia and Amanda reached out to us let us know what you'd be discussing and asked the team, if we felt that this would be appropriate.

468
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:52,525
Given what we've heard on the comprehensive plan to date and what we were proposing for the city's review, and so we took a look at the plan to change the zoning districts the area was in and considered the goals of the comprehensive plan especially in relationship to new uses to job creation and workforce development.

469
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:59,890
And in our opinion, this is consistent with the themes and the goals that have been developed through this planning process.

470
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,112
Happy to answer any further questions and obviously look forward to going into more depth later on.

471
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,414
Thank you, Emily.

472
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:23,372
is the board.

473
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:24,433
I'm sorry.

474
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:27,714
The first motion that we would actually need would be to close the public hearing.

475
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:32,816
And then there could be deliberation if you Desire.

476
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:42,319
I'll make a

477
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:51,870
Yes.

478
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,310
Jackie Furtado?

479
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:53,990
Yes.

480
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:55,451
Christy Dowd?

481
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:56,771
Yes.

482
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:58,371
Klaus Andreasen?

483
00:48:58,972 --> 00:48:59,212
Yes.

484
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:00,812
Great.

485
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,655
Any further questions from the board?

486
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:24,473
Okay.

487
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:25,034
Um.

488
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:27,776
If interested in.

489
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:37,302
So we would entertain a motion to, um, recommend to City Council that this zoning be.

490
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:44,968
The zoning designation of industrial be changed to vote.

491
00:49:44,988 --> 00:49:45,929
If folks were looking for

492
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:56,699
that the zoning be changed from industrial to office two.

493
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,361
What did I miss?

494
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:03,583
That's good.

495
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:04,003
Great.

496
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:06,745
Do we have a second?

497
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:08,966
This is Jackie.

498
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:10,967
I am seconding the motion.

499
00:50:13,148 --> 00:50:13,428
Great.

500
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:14,969
We'll do a roll call vote.

501
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:16,530
So, Jackie Furtado?

502
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:17,290
Yes.

503
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,531
Christy Dowd?

504
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:19,351
Yes.

505
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:20,812
Emily Hedeman?

506
00:50:24,135 --> 00:50:24,395
Yes.

507
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,236
I wasn't sure whether I was unmuted or not.

508
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,737
And class Andreessen.

509
00:50:29,357 --> 00:50:29,597
Yes.

510
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,358
All right, and that motion is passed.

511
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:35,979
Thank you, everyone for your time on that.

512
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,641
Procedurally Amanda has a, um,

513
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:49,647
city council with the recommendation.

514
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:55,049
We are actually, we should put it from the chair or an acting chair.

515
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:58,430
I know that's later on the meeting, but that's kind of, that's it.

516
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:06,053
This is actually on the city council agenda for Tuesday night, this coming Tuesday for anybody who is interested in seeing that.

517
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:11,695
And we anticipate sending them this document tomorrow morning or tonight.

518
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:15,988
Fantastic.

519
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:17,549
Thank you so much.

520
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:24,735
Thank you to the members of the board and the members of the public and the members of the planning department.

521
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:30,840
We appreciate all the effort you've put into this and we look forward to moving forward.

522
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:32,822
Thank you so much.

523
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:35,504
Thank you for your time this evening.

524
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:36,365
Thank you.

525
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:43,681
All right, so our next item on the agenda is...

526
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:52,025
our informational presentation and discussion of the comprehensive plan draft materials.

527
00:51:53,806 --> 00:52:01,131
So we actually, we have here tonight, you've already heard a little bit from Emily Innes and also Brie Hensholdt.

528
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:04,073
They're part of a consultant team that we've been working with.

529
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:07,855
And I'd love to see the floor to them.

530
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:13,258
Maybe you can introduce yourselves and yeah, get us started.

531
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:15,848
Sounds great.

532
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:17,930
We are happy to jump right in.

533
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:23,594
We do have a presentation to share that kind of informational update about the comprehensive plan.

534
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:28,357
I'm Brie Hensold with Agency, Landscape, and Planning here with Emily.

535
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,861
We'll introduce you to the broader team and everyone who's helped shape this as well.

536
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,803
Alicia, do you want to comment or you want me to just jump right in?

537
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:46,729
I think the board has been getting regular updates from us, and they actually asked for this presentation.

538
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:53,773
And honestly, I just missed, is it you or Emily who is giving the, there, I just made you both co-hosts.

539
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,114
Cool, sounds good.

540
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,615
I will screen share.

541
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:05,620
And, you know, could you just clarify for the board if you'd like them to jump in with questions or wait to the end or?

542
00:53:06,823 --> 00:53:07,403
Absolutely.

543
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:11,566
I think we would be happy to take questions as they arise.

544
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,187
So we'll take them.

545
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:19,971
And Amanda, if you see hands that we miss or comments or anything like that, feel free to interrupt.

546
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:21,091
Will do.

547
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:22,332
Great.

548
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:29,346
So hopefully you're all seeing my screen now.

549
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:36,688
We're going to share with you the status of the Medford Comprehensive Plan, the Citywide Plan.

550
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:38,328
We're really glad to be here tonight.

551
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:44,050
Really glad that the great planning team has been bringing you along and is giving us this chance to

552
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:53,437
share the draft recommendations and get any of your feedback before this goes out to the community for feedback again next week.

553
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:57,619
And then as we head into the fall, we'll be looking ahead to an approval schedule.

554
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:11,105
This is a plan that's really been shaped by the community as well as a really dedicated steering committee that includes community members from all neighborhoods, different roles,

555
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:18,008
youth, community leaders, business owners, residents, parents, environmental advocates.

556
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:26,973
So it's been a very committed steering committee that has been with us for five meetings and a lot of time at public meetings as well.

557
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:33,477
We also have Jackie Furtado as part of the steering committee, who is also a connection to tonight.

558
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,269
You've been introduced to me.

559
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,694
I'm a planner, and I'm joined by Emily Innes, our planner and project manager.

560
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:53,562
We also have some additional experts on the team, Arup for transportation and resilience consulting, economic development experts and CARP strategies.

561
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:59,447
And then we had kind of visualization and technology support who really helped us with engagement.

562
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:05,935
which we needed more than we knew, because a lot of our engagement was online, thanks to COVID.

563
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:11,720
And so we were able to really have an interactive conversation with the community, thanks to having that support.

564
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:16,904
And then at the heart, really, I think this has been done hand in hand with the planning team.

565
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:21,368
And so really grateful to their leadership throughout this.

566
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:32,164
The project has been shaped over the better part of a year and a half now, and we've had really significant engagement all along the way.

567
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:47,428
So like I said, we've had five steering committee meetings, four community engagement milestones, including going to Circle the Square most recently and sharing the recommendations with kind of a steady stream of community who passed by.

568
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,909
And I know I met some of you that day as well.

569
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,689
So really appreciate that.

570
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,150
And then after tonight,

571
00:55:54,030 --> 00:56:04,463
Heading into next week, we're getting ready to share a draft online and a survey to get some additional input on how everyone's ideas have shaped up into the final plan document.

572
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:11,952
We'll then be heading into the fall for approvals and there'll be more conversations at that time too.

573
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:18,685
We wanted to give a little glimpse into what the extent of the engagement has looked like.

574
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:21,748
We were lucky to kick off heading into a summer.

575
00:56:21,788 --> 00:56:31,515
And so even though there were a lot of restrictions on in-person gathering, we were able to get out and about at public events and get a lot of one-on-one conversations.

576
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:37,700
So we spent a lot of time last summer talking to people about their community, what they loved, and hearing firsthand.

577
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:49,690
did a lot of outreach to spread the word through postcards, comment cards at City Hall, and then 15,000 residents were reached via mail, direct mail.

578
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:57,095
We had this dedicated plan website, and we also have had two versions of an online map to capture feedback.

579
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:00,257
And people are really engaged with that, which was fun.

580
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,379
I'll show you some of the outcomes from that in a moment.

581
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:09,664
We've had videos to update people along the way and continue to show the content on community media.

582
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:27,207
We've done a lot of focus groups too, steering committee meetings, like I said, and these public meetings, but the focus groups really let us hear firsthand from experts in everything from history to development to natural systems.

583
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:34,309
And so we got to learn and dig deep from those who are very engaged with all of those systems on a daily basis.

584
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,693
This is a glimpse at that online map, the first one that we put out there.

585
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:52,921
And what was really fun is that it created this conversation where we had over 1000 comments, where people would make a comment about what they loved or a problem that they wanted to see the plan address.

586
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:59,966
And then other folks could comment back on it and either second it or offer an alternative.

587
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:00,306
And so

588
00:58:00,756 --> 00:58:06,259
We really looked and scrutinized kind of all of these comments that came in throughout the course of the last year.

589
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:18,567
And you'll see in the final plan that we think that they've really shaped the recommendations and we've tried to communicate directly how this feedback ties into those final recommendations.

590
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:25,771
We did analyze everything and try to understand it and look for patterns too.

591
00:58:25,992 --> 00:58:28,193
And we learned some really interesting things I think

592
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:33,524
Things that you may know, too, as those who care for Medford.

593
00:58:33,804 --> 00:58:41,108
People talked a lot when they were talking about special places, about the natural systems and the river and the opportunity there.

594
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:44,790
When we heard about issues, we heard a lot about Medford Square.

595
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:47,812
I think Medford Square is the most talked about place within Medford.

596
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:52,255
We heard about transportation and we also heard about some flooding issues.

597
00:58:53,258 --> 00:59:06,885
And ideas kind of mirror those issues too, but we were interested to see that there was a lot of consensus about places and then also some opportunities for change and thinking about improvements to environmental systems.

598
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:16,150
We really kind of, as we develop the plan, tried to work hand in hand with the community so that they were always

599
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,794
helping to brainstorm and improve the ideas with us.

600
00:59:19,854 --> 00:59:42,880
This is just a glimpse into our final public meeting that was online, where we took a test with the community and showed how their ideas and their recommendations might change a series of places around the city so that they could see the reality of a zoning change or a recommendation for flood mitigation and where that might impact their daily lives.

601
00:59:45,901 --> 00:59:47,402
And I'll pass it over to Emily for a little bit.

602
00:59:47,842 --> 00:59:48,082
Great.

603
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:48,842
Thank you, Brie.

604
00:59:49,503 --> 01:00:05,250
So taking a step backwards and understanding that the community input is helpful to us as we start to think about how we put this together under Section 81D of the Massachusetts General Laws.

605
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:11,413
So you see on the left-hand side these images of the seven out of the nine elements that are in 81D.

606
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:25,784
And so our challenge is to look at those elements that were established under the enabling legislation, understand how feedback from the community works into into those and is impacted by them and has an impact on them.

607
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:30,047
And then figuring out how do you how do you pull all this into a plan.

608
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:41,573
One of the things about the way the elements were developed that the history of comprehensive planning is originally in land use, and it has morphed from that.

609
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:46,715
So when you look at the 81D elements, you see all of these components of land use.

610
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:51,797
There are some missing, so things like climate resiliency, public health,

611
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:52,997
energy.

612
01:00:53,438 --> 01:01:00,481
All of these are things that the communities want to start thinking about that aren't really covered by the enabling legislation.

613
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:05,524
There's also a lot of cost cutting themes and that's where our plan themes come from.

614
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:15,048
It's really from the interrelationship of the 81 D elements with those other topics so where initially land use was the focus.

615
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:18,490
Now it's really the impact of land use on the community.

616
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,650
and the other components of that.

617
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:31,093
So as we move through, I'm going to take you through some of our thinking some of our research, and how they those things have an impact with the community input on the development of the plan.

618
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,633
So next slide please.

619
01:01:35,594 --> 01:01:38,935
So the first thing is the overall goal of this

620
01:01:39,385 --> 01:01:59,484
planning process was to develop a 30 year vision, and then support that with a 10 year implementation plan, and we'll talk more about the implementation plan a little bit later but you can see in the bolded language here of this vision for the future, how some of those themes are translated

621
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:05,706
into a simple statement that can act as a guiding force for the goals and the strategies that we have.

622
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:12,989
So I mentioned earlier that there were nine elements and you saw seven of them in the sort of land use topics there.

623
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:21,452
The other two are this vision, this goals and policies vision statement, and finally that implementation plan.

624
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:29,255
So as we look at this, what we want to do is understand with you, talk about how this was developed and then understand

625
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:37,088
how the implementation plan gets you from now to 2050 by those series of 10-year actions.

626
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,050
Next slide.

627
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:55,237
So to do that, let's take a step back and just talk a little bit about, in addition to the community work that we did in gathering input, Medford had already done a ton of planning at different levels and in different areas and different topics.

628
01:02:55,297 --> 01:03:03,023
So part of our role as consultants was to bring everything together and understand how all of these planning components can

629
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:07,266
relate holistically to each other in a single document.

630
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:14,250
So in some cases, what we're pulling is from previous studies and talking about how those have an impact on each other.

631
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:29,121
As part of that deep dive into planning, we also wanted to look at the history of land use and development in Medford and understand how stepping back to look at past development plan patterns will affect today's choices.

632
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:30,742
And actually, you were beat ahead of me, Brie.

633
01:03:31,222 --> 01:03:36,603
But that leads straight into not just the history, but the trends on the next slide.

634
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:40,964
So what's happened in the past, projecting out to the future.

635
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:52,047
So understanding about how do we bring in more spending to the city rather than having people leave Medford to buy goods, services, experiences.

636
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:57,668
Thinking about who's working in Medford now, who would we like to work in Medford?

637
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,688
You know, when you talk about

638
01:03:59,088 --> 01:04:13,369
transportation mobility circulation, and people get worried about traffic on the roads well if you can live within walking distance if you can buy most of your daily needs within walking distance, you don't have to hop into a car.

639
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:19,312
If you can get most of it by public transportation, not hopping in a car reduces circulation.

640
01:04:19,373 --> 01:04:22,394
So we want to understand those trends and the impact.

641
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:41,763
Medford is just a jewel in terms of the amount of open space and how accessible that is to people, but understanding how that open space isn't just there, but it supports local needs both now and in the future, and what might we need to do to make changes to add additional support.

642
01:04:42,283 --> 01:04:46,785
Same thing for housing who's being housed here now what are the projections for the future.

643
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:56,168
And then finally climate change Medford again as a leader in thinking about climate change and how climate change impacts people's daily experiences.

644
01:04:56,688 --> 01:05:01,290
So taking the past development patterns taking the trends, and then in the next slide.

645
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,392
as it pops up, looking at the future land use opportunities.

646
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:19,459
So this is a diagrammatic way of thinking about the different areas within Medford and the strategies that this comprehensive plan has for addressing those areas.

647
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:29,446
So we'll talk a little bit more about it as we move through, but just get the sense that there's this green quarter coming through with the rivers, you've got the green up further.

648
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:35,110
There's also quarters of transportation and different types of land uses.

649
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:48,739
There's our civic institutional anchors scattered throughout centers and squares being areas of economic activity, and also neighborhood centers being smaller areas.

650
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,021
where economic activity and lower scale residential interact.

651
01:05:53,061 --> 01:06:01,685
So as you listen to some of the strategies we're going to show you, just keep this future land use map in mind and we'll return to it later.

652
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:18,719
And so finally, just translating again, those areas in Massachusetts general law, those different components, we're now going to show you how those elements interact with each other to create these five building blocks.

653
01:06:18,759 --> 01:06:22,842
So I'm going to turn it over to Brie for that, and I'll be back to talk about implementation.

654
01:06:24,203 --> 01:06:24,903
Thank you, Emily.

655
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:30,187
So I'm going to walk through what those five building blocks are that are going to be the themes that shape the plan.

656
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:37,170
and within which all the recommendations and actions for achieving it have been developed.

657
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:42,951
So each of these really came directly out of those community conversations and then were refined along the way.

658
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:50,633
The first one is this idea that we heard from Medford that they really want to have open and engaged communication.

659
01:06:51,577 --> 01:07:03,685
And that has to do with the relationship to government, how plans like this get implemented over time, how priorities are set and funding is allocated and spent.

660
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:07,907
And then also how the city relates to many partners.

661
01:07:08,327 --> 01:07:12,270
Emily mentioned the ample open space, which is really true and felt and appreciated.

662
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:19,617
And some of that is city-owned open space and a lot of that is partners, state and other partners.

663
01:07:19,717 --> 01:07:29,782
And so thinking about those management roles that could sometimes make implementation run or stewardship and use run more seamlessly.

664
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:39,547
So the three goals that have come out of this are to maintain and build trust, to implement according to clear community priorities, and then to allocate resources effectively.

665
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:48,192
And I won't be showing you all of the actions within the plan, which I'm sorry that I can't do, but I think you'll also thank me.

666
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:53,254
We'd be here for a really long time, but we'll be sharing that draft as a document for you to dig into.

667
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:59,536
But just a few of the kind of more detailed ways that we can realize that goal or that set of goals.

668
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:06,818
The plan recommends issuing an annual comprehensive plan update so that community members can transparently see progress happen.

669
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:15,575
increasing and changing the way that community members are reached and communicated with.

670
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:26,124
We saw a lot through this plan of the use of social media and digital outreach, that not being the only thing that people can rely on, but certainly a really effective way to do it.

671
01:08:28,185 --> 01:08:36,572
Another action is about developing a central database within the city that allows departments to share information about implementation

672
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:39,776
and track things together and tie them back to the plan.

673
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:48,501
And then tracking participation and planning processes and boards to make sure that representation of the community is representative.

674
01:08:51,302 --> 01:09:02,508
The second big theme or big building block is this idea of continuing to nurture the welcoming and supportive community that so many Medford residents told us they really experience.

675
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:06,167
At the same time, we did hear that some feel that more than others.

676
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:16,513
So this theme is also about trying to be more inclusive and think about all the different ways that people need to be welcomed to Medford.

677
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:26,259
Some of those have to do with enlivening open space, people really embrace the events, the arts and culture, and thinking about ways to spread that to more communities.

678
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,111
Affordable housing, of course, being huge.

679
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:32,112
And Emily mentioned all the work that this plan builds on.

680
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:40,238
And the very recent housing production plan is just one example of a plan that we're tying into and kind of pulling into to help implement.

681
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:45,721
But affordable housing being a really important element to reinforce as well.

682
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:49,984
And then honoring Medford's history and all of its facets.

683
01:09:51,885 --> 01:09:55,688
So some of the actions that you'll see in the plan that reinforce that

684
01:09:56,181 --> 01:10:25,122
are everything from thinking about collaboration with artists to beautify some of those neighborhood centers or centers and squares that Emily showed on that future land use map, to look at ways to expand the amenities that are within the riverfront and other community open spaces to things that we heard about and we also saw in the open space plan, to look at ways to allow more multifamily and small diverse housing options through some zoning changes,

685
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:35,911
And then always keeping universal accessibility in mind and having a steady and clear data-driven way to address capital needs at city facilities.

686
01:10:39,313 --> 01:10:47,916
Vibrant places might have been the goal that was talked about the most, I think, across all conversations and no matter what area of the community we were talking about.

687
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:52,618
People really are interested in this topic of economic development.

688
01:10:53,422 --> 01:11:03,288
They want to have, they realize that today, it can be really challenging to live and work in Medford and have that kind of close connection and choice, no matter what age you are.

689
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:07,531
We heard that from teenagers, we heard that from more established professionals.

690
01:11:07,651 --> 01:11:16,496
And so this theme really looks at growing kind of mixed use life sciences and other uses like we just saw.

691
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:29,248
that allow more people to live and work in Medford, and then to support businesses so that they can successfully locate, establish, and sustain both their own business and the workforce.

692
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:41,273
It looks as well at balancing growth, so thinking carefully about growth as it's happening and the scale of density and where it goes, and tying that to smart transportation investments,

693
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:46,934
And then vibrancy very much for Medford is about increasing enjoyment of natural resources.

694
01:11:49,456 --> 01:12:09,971
So some of the ideas here, we're encouraging some of those small scale neighborhood retail and services so that it's not just Medford Square, but wherever you are within the city, you can experience and benefit from some of that kind of walkable access to small commercial services, attracting companies, particularly to some kind of

695
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:26,992
growing and changing areas that will pay, pay, create high quality jobs that allow residents to access them and strategically using some city on parcels to promote multifamily residential or some or some of that job creation.

696
01:12:27,922 --> 01:12:48,097
The flip side of all of that kind of vibrancy too is keeping an eye on access and inclusion at the same time and looking at anti-displacement strategies for both residential and commercial businesses and partnering with Tufts and lots of other workforce training groups to make sure that this access is equitably provided to everyone.

697
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:58,150
And that brings us over to mobility and transportation to which is really linked to creating vibrant places that work and that work for everyone.

698
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:08,755
So this was also something that we talked about a lot and we know Medford has done a lot of work with its complete streets plan and other projects that predated the comp plan.

699
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,317
The key goals here were about

700
01:13:12,363 --> 01:13:15,524
connecting that multimodal network and really starting to achieve it.

701
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:24,448
Like I sort of alluded to in the previous one, coordinating mobility with future development, making sure those two things work really well together.

702
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:28,409
And then thinking about the kind of on the ground experience.

703
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:31,010
It's one thing to have a bike lane, right?

704
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:37,072
But it's another thing to have it feel safe and have it feel like a place where you can take your kids across the street.

705
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:40,774
And so thinking about that kind of finer grain of the mobility experience.

706
01:13:43,373 --> 01:14:10,985
Some of the ideas that will support those goals are to implement those great plans you already have in place, like the Bicycle Infrastructure Master Plan, to do an audit of pedestrian crossings and school-adjacent routes for any improvements for safe crossings, to look at one discovery that we found, which we know is really complicated, is that there is an unusually high number of unaccepted streets across

707
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:18,495
across Medford, and so look at that closely and figure out how they might become more part of city ownership.

708
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:39,884
To tie this also to some of the climate resilience and sustainability goals with piloting installations of electric vehicle charging stations, and then really leveraging and building on the MBTA improvements and major bus hubs, and thinking about density and mix of uses increased, especially in those areas and those corridors.

709
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:44,719
And then finally, climate resilience.

710
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:55,527
I think this is something that really is sort of an umbrella and aligns with those other four themes very well, but also is one unto itself.

711
01:14:56,328 --> 01:15:11,980
So the climate resilience goals are about achieving that very recently created climate action and adaptation plan and syncing up a lot we benefited from that great work, preserving and enhancing natural resources and supporting community health and resilience.

712
01:15:14,572 --> 01:15:23,459
So some of the actions that will help realize that are to think about the public realm, streets and open spaces for stormwater management.

713
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:28,402
We heard a lot about tree canopy in our public and our steering committee meetings.

714
01:15:28,502 --> 01:15:39,230
And so there's a lot of thinking about that within the plan too, and how you might focus and start some of your early investments in priority areas that have higher heat vulnerability.

715
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:51,635
Adopting environmental performance standards for large development projects and then updating some of the flood resilience guidelines and cool surface design guidelines in future design standards.

716
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:56,619
Okay, so a lot of ideas, but they need to get done.

717
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:57,640
I'll pass it to Emily.

718
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:58,855
Thank you, Brie.

719
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:15,677
So, as Brie said, there's a lot to unpack here but all of these actions go into an implementation strategy and the way I always think about implementation strategy is you know your fifth grade English when you do the who, what, where, how, when, how many, how much.

720
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:27,008
So, when we look at an implementation strategy it's critically important to once you've listed out the actions is to understand who is responsible for these.

721
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:45,435
Is it a city department, is it the city plus stakeholders from for as partners, is it actually not a city action but it's important enough to the overall goals of the city that it's got some other leads so you'll see the stewardship and the partners flow into the implementation strategy.

722
01:16:46,996 --> 01:17:04,612
Figuring out exactly what are the first steps that are needed for those strategies, how we can track progress so we'll talk a little bit about benchmarks, and then are there additional funding sources so we're not just relying on city operating or capital funds to get something done so you'll see these components.

723
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:16,943
And then a critical strategy for all of you at the CD board is understanding how zoning is impacted by this plan.

724
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:22,307
So obviously you've gone through a recodification as a city recently that sort of cleaned everything up.

725
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:32,775
But that doesn't necessarily mean that you've done major zoning changes and as you look at this plan, you're going to see for each one of the sections that Brie talked about.

726
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:35,676
that there are zoning recommendations for it.

727
01:17:35,796 --> 01:17:44,457
So we're preparing a section, I think you may have a draft memo of it, to talk about how do you take all of these zoning recommendations and address them.

728
01:17:44,537 --> 01:17:46,518
And there's really two main strategies.

729
01:17:47,078 --> 01:17:53,819
One is topical in that there's groups of zoning changes that are related to specific topics.

730
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,879
And the other is geographic.

731
01:17:56,059 --> 01:17:59,460
And not only do they have, and those are more related to the

732
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:05,746
the future land use areas that we looked at earlier the gateway centers quarters and neighborhood centers.

733
01:18:07,147 --> 01:18:17,937
There's also a process strategy that goes along with each so in for the most case, when you're looking at the topical strategies the climate action plan, the new land uses, etc.

734
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:34,083
These are things that will probably require some additional research into best practices, what have other communities done that have has worked for them, developing draft language and legal review, they aren't necessarily need it's not necessarily needed to have

735
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:51,380
an additional planning process for them they're fairly clearly outlined in some of your original plans, brought forward here because of their importance to the overall city, but you don't necessarily need to do a lot of public outreach and you'll see there's an asterisk for design and development standards I'll get to that.

736
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:09,082
In terms of the geographic strategies for looking at these, we think that you'll want to have additional community outreach said in fact you're probably going to want to have neighborhood plans that look at specific areas now Medford Square is an exception because you've already done a lot of planning around Medford Square.

737
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:18,914
But to look at to some of the gateways to look at some of the neighborhood centers maybe take another look at West Medford and Wellington you're going to, you're going to want some neighborhood planning there.

738
01:19:19,314 --> 01:19:27,584
And so that requires more community engagement that's going to be a process that you can start now, but it's going to take a little bit longer than some of the topical ones.

739
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:52,850
Now, I called out design and development standards separately because I think, for example, with the Climate Action Plan, with some of the other work that you've done, if it's a development standard that's related to a use, or if it's a development standard that's related to some of the recommendations in the Climate Action Plan, those probably just need the best practice research, the draft language, and the legal review.

740
01:19:53,530 --> 01:20:16,224
On the other hand, if you're talking about design guidelines or design standards for a specific area, say, West Medford Square, Medford Square, or Wellington, you're probably going to want to have, as part of that community engagement, a discussion of what makes sense in terms of consistency, people's expectations for an area,

741
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:33,914
how the physical environment affects how people move through it a whole series of design conversations that would then go into the neighborhood plan so that's why that one's pulled out so there's these two different standards and happy to talk about that more as we go through.

742
01:20:34,894 --> 01:20:35,875
Next slide please.

743
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:44,549
So I mentioned benchmarks earlier, and these are ways of tracking and measuring progress.

744
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:47,993
So we've indicated some trends here.

745
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:49,935
Is the trend increasing?

746
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,657
Is the trend decreasing?

747
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:57,183
If you've established a metric that you want a trend to be increasing,

748
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:15,339
And as you measure the impact of some of these strategies that trend is decreasing so for example you say you want to increase total housing units, and in the next two to three years total housing units aren't increasing, then you know you need to look back at the strategies and see if they're effective.

749
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:23,903
Same thing with the decrease in the percentage of population that is housing costs burden so the benchmarks establish the trend line.

750
01:21:24,323 --> 01:21:44,092
And then the idea is for city staff, city departments to establish the specific numbers so that they have a base data starting with this year, and certainly some of the information that we've pulled establishes some of those bases but not all of them, and then they can measure progress as the years progress for those 10 year actions.

751
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:45,493
Next slide please.

752
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:51,841
And I touched on this a little bit with the benchmarks.

753
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:55,705
It's first, establishing the direction of the trend that's important.

754
01:21:56,086 --> 01:22:00,151
Second, establishing the data points that are important.

755
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:04,095
And then looking at how do we test the impacts.

756
01:22:04,195 --> 01:22:04,376
So,

757
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:09,339
I'll point down at the bottom, sharing the water quality measurements on the website.

758
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:18,224
So the trend is we'd like the water quality measurements to improve, we collect the data, and then we publicly show progress that that's happened.

759
01:22:18,264 --> 01:22:27,310
And so we've looked at points throughout there where it's possible to say, for example, has the regional trail been extended through Medford Square?

760
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:31,692
Are we getting more incubator and art spaces?

761
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:34,314
And then use that as a check on an annual basis.

762
01:22:34,734 --> 01:22:42,269
as part of the review to see if the plan is doing what we've collectively anticipated it to do based on public comments.

763
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:44,471
Next slide, please.

764
01:22:45,532 --> 01:22:48,433
So this is just an image of how the document works.

765
01:22:49,574 --> 01:22:59,959
And when you get into the section of looking at the goals, number one there, how it's numbered so you can understand the way it's moved through.

766
01:23:00,419 --> 01:23:07,523
And three, you see we've tracked the elements from chapter 81D and how those relate to what you're seeing for the goal.

767
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:12,325
And then you're seeing the action titles and explanation of the action.

768
01:23:12,765 --> 01:23:19,328
the implementation plan that says who, what, where, how, that's going to be a separate section of the plan.

769
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:25,251
So you've got a table that basically over the years, you can just check off and say, we've done this, we've done this.

770
01:23:25,411 --> 01:23:27,752
Oh, wait, we need to do some work on this.

771
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:38,277
But the guidance in this section of understanding the goals, the strategies, and the actions should give you those first steps of how do we approach the actions that we're seeing.

772
01:23:39,398 --> 01:23:39,858
Next slide.

773
01:23:40,997 --> 01:23:47,881
So, Brie mentioned we are very close to releasing the draft plan we just have a few more checks to go with the city staff.

774
01:23:48,341 --> 01:24:03,169
We're going to I think city staff will post it on the website we've set up a little questionnaire so people can review the draft plan and respond to the questionnaire let us know what they think let us know you know they like these actions do they have some additional suggestions.

775
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:13,339
And then at some point, what this will move into the approvals process so we'll have the plan online for enough time for people to have a chance to really engage with it.

776
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:21,627
It will be presented to the mayor and the city council but you all have a huge responsibility because you're the city's planning board.

777
01:24:22,107 --> 01:24:35,533
And under chapter 41 section at one D you are responsible for approving this plan and adopting it as part of the city's as the city's official comprehensive plan so we will no doubt be back to you.

778
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:43,396
As we get closer to that but I just wanted to give you a preview tonight before it goes out to the public.

779
01:24:43,856 --> 01:24:45,677
So you see you see parts of it first.

780
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:57,045
And then finally, the plan still needs not just you on the board, but anybody who's watching this, any members of the Medford community.

781
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,807
So please review the draft.

782
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:05,091
If people are listening to this afterwards, implementation is going to require the support of everybody.

783
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:13,298
So we hope this is a useful document for you many years into the future and we look forward to your comments both tonight

784
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:15,220
and as the draft comes out.

785
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,121
So thank you very much, Preet.

786
01:25:19,964 --> 01:25:20,464
Thank you.

787
01:25:20,484 --> 01:25:28,332
I will stop sharing so we can all see one another and thank you for listening, but we would welcome questions and I can bring anything back up again too.

788
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:51,183
Jackie I see a comment of yours in the chat about zoning strategies so yes, absolutely we're hoping this plan gives you guidance on the zoning strategies.

789
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:56,990
As I said, we've we've shared a draft of how to think about how all the zoning works together.

790
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:10,275
But certainly as you review this as you review the draft plan if you feel as a CD board that you need some more information on that we're happy to, you know, provide you additional guidance or information.

791
01:26:10,655 --> 01:26:12,796
There's a lot to unpack in this document.

792
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:15,977
So as Brie said we could have been here a couple more hours.

793
01:26:18,749 --> 01:26:19,069
All right.

794
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:21,750
Yeah, this is Christy.

795
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:31,434
I'd just like to say that was very nice presentation, and I just love the way that it was packaged and very comprehensive even for that.

796
01:26:31,914 --> 01:26:38,757
But it is a lot to unpack and feel like I just need to spend some time with it before I can ask probably more thoughtful questions.

797
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:40,138
But very nicely done.

798
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:40,878
Thank you.

799
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:43,830
Thank you.

800
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:58,883
We're excited to have the document in hand for everyone, like we said, next week, and then would welcome input from you all and Alicia and Amanda as suggestions to make sure that we can hear your thoughts and incorporate and reflect them.

801
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:09,473
This is David with a question.

802
01:27:12,134 --> 01:27:18,756
And this is something by statute that all cities, towns are supposed to be doing a process they're supposed to be following.

803
01:27:20,236 --> 01:27:26,318
Are there, to my knowledge, we haven't had one of these for a while, in a comprehensive way.

804
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:34,941
Are there other neighboring communities that stand out as great examples where boy they went through this process they really rolled up the sleeves.

805
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:44,543
And when the plan came out, they actually implemented a fair number of those, and we see a difference in the community as a result.

806
01:27:44,783 --> 01:27:48,148
Are there some shining stars that you might point to?

807
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,393
You want to start your list, Emily?

808
01:27:53,397 --> 01:27:59,239
You know, it's, it's interesting that you mentioned that you know Medford doesn't have a comprehensive plan.

809
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:10,782
One of the things that we delved into was the history of documents that was great because city staff members kept pulling out documents that, hey, we found something from 1983 we found something from 1966 but

810
01:28:12,862 --> 01:28:19,605
Those were very limited in their scope, there were far more of the straight land use.

811
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:34,850
What should we do about this, it was, they were great in terms of history and understanding why some of the decisions that were made were made I think you know obviously some of your neighbors and nearby communities, Somerville Arlington.

812
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:37,612
Arlington's got some good plans.

813
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:53,165
It's hard to say which are due to their comprehensive plans, and which are due to the follow on plans, the more strategic plans from the comprehensive plans I think the two of them work hand in hand.

814
01:28:53,605 --> 01:29:03,255
And it's one of the reasons we mentioned the neighborhood plans is that they've got the Boston's actually been doing this with their own as they had their imagine 2030.

815
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:27,493
but they're in fact using a neighborhood by neighborhood strategy of doing far more in depth, and I see that as a real model for Medford, because the comprehensive plan is really that 50,000 foot view, you're trying to bring everything together and understand how the different pieces talk to each other, but for some of those planning efforts you really need to be much much closer you need to be at the 5000 foot view.

816
01:29:28,854 --> 01:29:32,397
And that's where those neighborhood and gateway and corridor plans come in.

817
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:38,042
So I think the strategy that Boston is using to do that is really important.

818
01:29:39,704 --> 01:29:50,814
And I would just add, I think, coming into doing this plan, Medford was in a really good position because there were a lot of citywide plans that were recent.

819
01:29:50,914 --> 01:29:54,758
So not a comprehensive plan, but the climate plan, the housing plan.

820
01:29:54,798 --> 01:29:55,038
And so

821
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:59,011
Now all of those things are synced and aligned here.

822
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:02,176
And so they're all in alignment.

823
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:05,119
And so that sets up, I think, that neighborhood planning well, too.

824
01:30:06,132 --> 01:30:10,815
And I really want to give the city kudos for the amount of planning that they've done.

825
01:30:11,236 --> 01:30:29,268
In some case it was very easy for us because we just sit there and answer scroll through and say, these are great we're just going to pull those over but now we can talk about the relationship of these to the other parts of the city so yes you didn't have a comprehensive plan but you had all of the building blocks in place.

826
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:34,145
That's super helpful.

827
01:30:34,205 --> 01:30:47,590
It sounds like, as in the city, I imagine the mayor is the one who's driving the follow on plans on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis and really pushing that process forward mayor's office.

828
01:30:51,057 --> 01:30:52,618
So I mean, it depends.

829
01:30:52,879 --> 01:30:55,241
We work very closely with the mayor's office.

830
01:30:55,601 --> 01:30:57,382
And I would say specifically with the mayor.

831
01:30:58,503 --> 01:31:03,848
When she's thinking about economic development, business development, she's coming to Victor and to myself.

832
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:08,051
Like there's not other staff in her office working on this.

833
01:31:09,273 --> 01:31:25,189
And so we have been working with her and we've been hearing what the consultants have been saying and what the pressures are because part of it, part of where you know where we need to focus most urgently has to do with what phone calls and emails are coming in and

834
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:47,259
developers are contacting us all the time saying, we're thinking about this, and we're thinking about this location, and I'll tell you that I funnel all of those to Victor, and he sort of figures them out, and which ones are just sort of testing the waters, and which ones are like really, really serious, and where are we going with them?

835
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:54,262
And so one of the things I think we've mentioned to this group is that we went out and got a grant, Victor wrote the grant,

836
01:31:54,682 --> 01:32:18,922
to do a plan or a study for the Wellington Center area, the Wellington Square, because that is one of the areas that we are hearing from a lot, either the property owners or the developers who want to do things there, and they want to do things that are not in alignment with our zoning, because nobody wants to build a two-story industrial building these days.

837
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:23,626
And people look at this area so close to the T, and they even say,

838
01:32:24,066 --> 01:32:28,868
a one-story commercial, okay, two-story is allowed, doesn't make sense.

839
01:32:29,248 --> 01:32:37,691
Wouldn't it make so much more sense to do a story of commercial with five stories of residential above it and have all this housing near the T?

840
01:32:37,711 --> 01:32:38,111
I'm willing.

841
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,187
Well, now it would.

842
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,848
Too bad our zoning doesn't allow that, right?

843
01:32:43,348 --> 01:32:45,129
So these are the things that we've been hearing.

844
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:46,729
We're starting that study.

845
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:51,050
As the consultants have said, we have not started a study of Medford Square.

846
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:56,312
There are 500 recent studies and documents on Medford Square.

847
01:32:57,892 --> 01:33:04,638
So I don't think I'm speaking out of turn to say that Victor is working on the properties there.

848
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:07,780
And what is the best next steps?

849
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:17,328
We've been talking about doing a request for information from developers to see who's interested in doing what, what would be a good use of the municipal properties there.

850
01:33:17,348 --> 01:33:21,251
I think those are the hot ones.

851
01:33:23,853 --> 01:33:27,919
Right, so we're starting to move with these and we're starting to move in the areas.

852
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:35,950
I wanna say we're doing studies everywhere, but there's just so many projects that individual people should be managing at one time.

853
01:33:36,938 --> 01:33:39,121
So we are trying to also balance our workload.

854
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:40,943
Victor, there's something you wanted to add.

855
01:33:41,684 --> 01:33:51,756
Only that, again, Medford doesn't have a history of focusing on economic development and strategic economic development planning.

856
01:33:52,456 --> 01:33:54,279
Ideally, in 10 years,

857
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:03,186
we have, we're refreshing the Wellington circle plan, you know, and, and building on, on previous studies that were done.

858
01:34:03,787 --> 01:34:08,410
We're having to prioritize now because which there isn't a history to build off of.

859
01:34:08,771 --> 01:34:23,882
And so that's why we're focused on areas where there's a lot of activity and a lot of interest and we're having to make decisions, bring projects to you all, you know, that are, that are really out of conformance, but we think are good projects and, and, um,

860
01:34:24,803 --> 01:34:38,654
So that that's the challenge we're facing I think the feedback we got through the plan, which was very much focused on filling a gap in economic development thought at that 10,000 foot level was really helpful because it.

861
01:34:40,595 --> 01:34:45,838
It kind of reframed, I think, the community's mindset around what the potential is in some areas.

862
01:34:46,379 --> 01:35:07,051
But then we do need to spend time and engagement on those more neighborhood district level plans in order to make informed decisions about zoning change and what projects are a good fit and what the community really wants to see, as well as understand what the market potential is for these areas.

863
01:35:07,331 --> 01:35:09,193
Because we're figuring that out.

864
01:35:10,132 --> 01:35:13,977
but really don't have a full grasp on that.

865
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:24,325
And if you don't mind me jumping back in Vic, I think your point about the economic development components being missing is an excellent one.

866
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:44,556
I think that was, as we entered into this, that was probably the biggest hole in the previous plans in that there was a lot of focus on certain specific areas, repetitively in some cases, but not on the city as a whole and not really tied to what does economic development, how is economic development tied to land use?

867
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:50,781
And so, again, we're hoping that the comprehensive plan strategy points to the direction.

868
01:35:51,161 --> 01:36:02,170
I think you all have already picked up and started moving as you've talked about on some of those pieces but the comprehensive plan should be able to help you guide further, you know, as you've started to address those pieces.

869
01:36:02,851 --> 01:36:05,293
The next ones can come up in the conversation.

870
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:11,858
But understanding that the market demand, the trends and what that market demand is likely to change.

871
01:36:12,638 --> 01:36:22,103
As you say is really important on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis, or a commercial area by commercial area basis so we hope the plan gives you that to continue continues to give you that direction.

872
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:41,488
I just wanted to quickly say in hearing everyone speak and how everything's been aligned right now and have had the honor of being on a selection committee for picking agency landscape and planning as the comprehensive plan team, I want to hyphenate your own strength and knowledge, which perfectly aligns with my presentation.

873
01:36:42,288 --> 01:36:57,396
efforts and all the great efforts of the mayor and all the city staff and Alicia and her department, which also included hiring our amazing economic development director, which he's been diligently attempting to fill in the gaps that he illustrated as challenges.

874
01:36:57,676 --> 01:37:01,619
And I'm saying that more sitting as a resident of Medford for many, many, many years.

875
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:07,702
So as everyone's talking about all the pieces going together, it's just so great to see how they're all aligning now.

876
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:10,003
I just wanted to highlight it

877
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:18,746
everyone's knowledge and strength and how everything's going together, including the plans that Medford has been putting out.

878
01:37:20,347 --> 01:37:23,489
We felt that very much, I think, that the stars are aligning.

879
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:30,213
And, you know, the community felt that in those conversations, too, that the community is feeling that and is pretty coalesced around it.

880
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:31,013
Not a lot of

881
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:33,945
dissent or disagreement.

882
01:37:34,005 --> 01:37:44,771
Really, people felt that these ideas, these places where more development could happen, that that was a great opportunity, could be tied to some of the affordability challenges and, you know, understanding that connection.

883
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:53,256
I have you in my head too, Jackie, and the good conversations we had about the connections between development and mobility improvements and infrastructure improvements, which need to be dovetailed.

884
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:59,620
So hopefully the comprehensive plan is a chance to bring all those pieces that are sometimes disparate together.

885
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:27,702
It all sounds good to me but it's, it seems like such a daunting task to convert so many aspirational goals, which are the senior absolutely wonderful and on target.

886
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:34,965
And as you said there seems to be consensus that's built around them by way of your community engagement, which it just sounds awesome.

887
01:38:36,207 --> 01:38:53,685
But how do we, how do we actually implement these things but I guess I'm getting ahead of myself because that's the way my brain works but I know this, the city residents have been critical of the city generally for not implementing for studying, but not following through.

888
01:38:56,170 --> 01:39:07,336
the more we can convert these things into things that we can see and feel and experience, I think the better, well, the better our city will be, but the better for everyone involved as well.

889
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:16,261
David, I've had the benefit of working in communities with strong comprehensive plans and it sort of goes two ways.

890
01:39:17,262 --> 01:39:18,863
It allows the community to hold

891
01:39:21,006 --> 01:39:23,648
you know, city government accountable, it's written down.

892
01:39:23,668 --> 01:39:29,113
These are cooperatively developed goals and strategies.

893
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:41,903
It also helps city staff say, look, we're working on this, and we need funding for X, or we need your support on Y. It's in the plan, and you can point to that.

894
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:57,112
You know, I've heard it a million times, playing just sit on shelves and they're not worked, but it, and the accountability has to work both ways, but I've seen it happen and it can be really, really powerful.

895
01:39:57,692 --> 01:40:05,459
Otherwise, you know, you're just sort of shooting from your hip and there's no continuity over time.

896
01:40:06,635 --> 01:40:19,018
And to that point and I completely agree we've recommended a master plan implementation committee, you can take the comprehensive plan and move forward with it you know be responsible for checking to make sure that it's being implemented.

897
01:40:19,398 --> 01:40:28,980
We've recommended that it be integrated into the city's budget process, so that as department heads are filling out their budgets they are referring to the comprehensive plan.

898
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,823
saying how their budgets are meeting those goals.

899
01:40:32,824 --> 01:40:48,503
And then at appropriate points in that layout that I showed you, we're also providing case studies of how other communities have accomplished some of these things so that there's a way to sort of check and see who else has been doing what.

900
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:50,404
to implement it.

901
01:40:50,424 --> 01:40:52,784
So we have thought of that issue of accountability.

902
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:57,786
It's very easy to put names to actions and say, off you go, go and do this.

903
01:40:57,906 --> 01:41:02,147
But we've tried to build in the checks and balances on making sure that it gets done.

904
01:41:02,728 --> 01:41:15,692
And to Victor's point, the ability for somebody to stand up at a CD board meeting or a city council and say, it says right here on page 32, that's a very powerful way of communicating with one's government.

905
01:41:19,057 --> 01:41:19,497
Sounds great.

906
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:19,877
Thank you.

907
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:37,704
And one of the things that we're looking at with the implementation chart particularly is that different actions have different city stewards.

908
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:47,368
So one of the things that I think I will say our climate plan is so new that it's hard to say like this works really well because we've barely had it.

909
01:41:48,528 --> 01:41:50,629
You know, we released it a few months ago.

910
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:58,913
But one of the things we really look to is with all the actions, we put a point person or department who's responsible for it.

911
01:41:58,953 --> 01:42:01,834
And frankly, when we put a department, we mean the department head.

912
01:42:02,854 --> 01:42:06,696
But we don't put people's names because it doesn't matter if it's John or Mary.

913
01:42:07,216 --> 01:42:08,837
It matters who's in that role.

914
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:10,418
is responsible for it.

915
01:42:10,898 --> 01:42:27,126
But one of the things I really pushing for is that we spread the love that that responsible person is not the department, the planning department for every single item, but that where does it best fit in the municipal structure

916
01:42:27,586 --> 01:42:41,994
because if one person or one position is responsible for 40 things, it's not gonna happen the way these go under engineering, and this is part of health, and this is the mayor's office of communication, and this is the planning office.

917
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:47,757
And there's a lot that says planning office next to it, but it's not everything.

918
01:42:47,798 --> 01:42:50,119
And we're trying to think strategically about this.

919
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:51,199
And it also,

920
01:42:53,205 --> 01:42:54,525
it raises involvement.

921
01:42:54,645 --> 01:43:02,008
And so if I can pull away the layers a little about what we're doing, pull away the curtain, there is a full draft.

922
01:43:02,668 --> 01:43:07,250
I've asked to try to have myself read it, have me read it first.

923
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:10,571
And a little bit of that is fact-checking, right?

924
01:43:10,611 --> 01:43:14,292
Like I'm not gonna say, well, I don't like this opinion, we should change it.

925
01:43:14,732 --> 01:43:17,453
But I will say there have been some places where I've said,

926
01:43:18,413 --> 01:43:25,343
This is what the climate plan said, and this is what you said it said, but it really said this, right?

927
01:43:25,363 --> 01:43:27,505
Because that's my particular area of expertise.

928
01:43:27,946 --> 01:43:30,549
But one of the things that I'm also doing is saying,

929
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:37,574
who in each department or which departments are the knowledgeable people for all of these items.

930
01:43:38,334 --> 01:43:44,401
And so I have, Wren has been sitting with me and taking notes on all of that.

931
01:43:44,782 --> 01:43:51,149
So as we go through it, she's going to start sending chunks of it to different departments saying,

932
01:43:53,305 --> 01:44:02,053
You're welcome to read the whole plan, but we would really like you to look at these five actions, read them thoroughly and weigh in on them.

933
01:44:02,453 --> 01:44:05,396
And we think that you may be the steward for some of these.

934
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:06,617
Do you agree?

935
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:13,563
We found that with that process with the climate plan, it meant that when you send the transportation person

936
01:44:14,093 --> 01:44:18,237
the transportation actions and ask them to review it, they find the time.

937
01:44:18,798 --> 01:44:22,202
You send them a 200-page document, they do not have the time.

938
01:44:23,003 --> 01:44:30,330
So we're trying to be strategic about making sure the right people put their eyes on this document so we have their buy-in.

939
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:35,853
I'm frustrated by how long that is taking right now, and it's all on me.

940
01:44:37,093 --> 01:44:44,216
So sometime next week, we're just going to say let's release this, regardless of whether or not I've gotten through the whole thing.

941
01:44:49,313 --> 01:44:51,654
And I'm happy to send it to you guys.

942
01:44:51,714 --> 01:44:54,115
I sent Emily and Brie some corrections.

943
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:59,718
And I don't know when we, a couple of those were meaningful to me.

944
01:44:59,758 --> 01:45:03,360
I thought then we could get a draft out to people.

945
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:07,942
Yeah, I think we just looked at those this afternoon, right before this.

946
01:45:07,982 --> 01:45:12,284
So we've got, I think, those, at least the meaningful ones made, and then a few questions next week.

947
01:45:12,344 --> 01:45:14,185
And so that's why we're thinking next week.

948
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,606
But we've got that ready to go.

949
01:45:15,646 --> 01:45:15,766
Yeah.

950
01:45:16,566 --> 01:45:16,726
Yeah.

951
01:45:19,094 --> 01:45:20,155
Because I have opinions.

952
01:45:20,615 --> 01:45:23,457
I've been trying to, opinions are in one bucket.

953
01:45:23,577 --> 01:45:25,898
This is more like, I don't think this is right.

954
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:27,599
I think we misunderstood something here.

955
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:31,282
And that's incredibly valuable.

956
01:45:31,362 --> 01:45:33,503
And again, this is a lot to unpack.

957
01:45:33,563 --> 01:45:44,190
So having Alicia's eyes, having Ren's eyes, having Amanda's eyes on it saying, hey, we think you misunderstood this, or can you clarify that, or we need more information here is really, really useful to us.

958
01:45:57,255 --> 01:45:59,096
Oh, sorry, Alicia.

959
01:45:59,696 --> 01:46:06,419
I was just going to say, because I'm someone who's like this, where I sometimes just need some time to myself to unpack things.

960
01:46:06,499 --> 01:46:18,925
So if anyone from the board has things that, as they kind of sit with this, they want forwarded over to our consultant team, please feel free to send them my way and I can forward them over.

961
01:46:18,945 --> 01:46:22,687
That's not to stop discussion now, but I just want to acknowledge.

962
01:46:23,848 --> 01:46:24,548
Thank you, Amanda.

963
01:46:26,243 --> 01:46:27,945
Yes, and I do want to comment.

964
01:46:28,326 --> 01:46:32,471
Earlier we were having a public hearing where we're very limited about who can speak.

965
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:39,680
We do have a couple of members of the public on still if you wanted to open it up if they have any questions or comments.

966
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:41,582
There's no reason.

967
01:46:41,602 --> 01:46:45,567
This board's generally pretty informal.

968
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:59,862
Yes, if any of the community members, if you would like to speak, you're welcome to raise your hand or use the comment box or just unmute yourselves.

969
01:47:09,785 --> 01:47:19,267
And I don't mean to rush the board, but nobody's taking the lead here and saying, OK, let's move to the next agenda item, or let's give everybody some more space to think.

970
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,722
I'll recommend moving to the next agenda item.

971
01:47:26,543 --> 01:47:28,684
I'll second that recommendation slash motion.

972
01:47:28,764 --> 01:47:31,804
All right.

973
01:47:31,924 --> 01:47:32,784
Sounds good.

974
01:47:32,985 --> 01:47:34,225
Hearing no objections.

975
01:47:34,905 --> 01:47:37,566
Thank you so much, Brie and Emily for your time tonight.

976
01:47:37,586 --> 01:47:39,306
Thank you.

977
01:47:40,286 --> 01:47:41,206
And thank you to Lauren.

978
01:47:41,646 --> 01:47:41,907
Yes.

979
01:47:42,487 --> 01:47:43,787
Corte, your thoughts.

980
01:47:50,555 --> 01:47:59,743
Okay, so the last item for tonight has to do with elections.

981
01:48:00,303 --> 01:48:07,329
So as you all are aware, our beloved previous chair, Andre, is no longer chair.

982
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:13,314
So we'd love to, or we need to have someone eventually fill that role.

983
01:48:14,415 --> 01:48:18,038
I do wanna acknowledge that Deanna's not present tonight.

984
01:48:19,599 --> 01:48:29,785
And given the kind of last minute piece of this notice, she wasn't able to to provide input ahead of time.

985
01:48:29,945 --> 01:48:32,706
So I kind of just want to pose it to the board.

986
01:48:33,386 --> 01:48:37,829
Do you all want to continue with potential election discussion tonight?

987
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:40,090
Do we want to start it and finish it later?

988
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:41,671
Should we just finish it tonight?

989
01:48:42,171 --> 01:48:43,472
How are people feeling about that?

990
01:48:44,142 --> 01:48:47,606
And to be clear, Deanna is not staying long term.

991
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,369
We are actively working to fill her position.

992
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:54,534
And then so technically, Emily filled the vacant spots.

993
01:48:56,276 --> 01:48:58,759
And we thought we had somebody for Deanna.

994
01:49:00,749 --> 01:49:04,050
Andre spots, there may be some complication with that.

995
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:08,591
So we're looking for some more recommendations that still may happen.

996
01:49:08,631 --> 01:49:09,031
We'll see.

997
01:49:11,112 --> 01:49:20,714
But we are, Deanna will probably stay on for at least another month, but I wouldn't elect her chair because technically her term is over and she will be rolling off.

998
01:49:23,115 --> 01:49:27,196
So everybody else is here tonight though, right?

999
01:49:29,357 --> 01:49:29,557
Yes.

1000
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,721
I have a couple of questions.

1001
01:49:32,981 --> 01:49:36,782
One, shouldn't there be a reelection of also the vice chair, which is my position.

1002
01:49:36,802 --> 01:49:44,046
I've been in it for, I'm happy to remain in it, but also is there any interest in chair?

1003
01:49:44,226 --> 01:49:47,807
That's one of the things that I wanted to know, have people sent their names?

1004
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:56,851
Because we voted Andre in last time because he had expressed interest and he had actually held it over from previously.

1005
01:49:56,891 --> 01:49:58,572
And so we just elected him into that seat.

1006
01:50:01,774 --> 01:50:15,016
As a reminder, we have multiple titles, lots of titles to go around because we do have a chair chair and clerk, clerk position as well.

1007
01:50:19,137 --> 01:50:23,798
It looks like places sending an email right now to Amanda, putting his name in the.

1008
01:50:30,343 --> 01:50:34,466
Is it a request or an ultimatum he's got for us?

1009
01:50:34,566 --> 01:50:35,126
I would vote.

1010
01:50:35,366 --> 01:50:36,527
I would vote right now.

1011
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,228
I'd be ready to vote, please.

1012
01:50:44,132 --> 01:50:45,513
I don't have much to say about that.

1013
01:50:50,376 --> 01:50:51,837
But you're asking a good question.

1014
01:50:51,877 --> 01:50:52,657
Who's interested?

1015
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:58,781
I mean, how do you vote if you don't know if anybody's, you know, interested or

1016
01:51:00,377 --> 01:51:03,559
you can like recommend nominations, but.

1017
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,223
Well, can we just ask if anybody is interested?

1018
01:51:11,224 --> 01:51:16,768
Yeah, I think that's really what I'm trying to ask now to see if there is any interest.

1019
01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:20,611
So we can know where we're voting.

1020
01:51:23,453 --> 01:51:29,917
Jackie, would you be up for it as our experienced vice chair or would you be not so enthusiastic about that?

1021
01:51:31,077 --> 01:51:35,719
So one of my biggest things with the chair is the quality of time that you can put into it.

1022
01:51:35,839 --> 01:51:44,282
And I know that I would not be able to complete the duties outside of my work duties.

1023
01:51:46,983 --> 01:51:48,683
So when they elected, I thought about it.

1024
01:51:48,743 --> 01:51:54,185
And as much as I love my city, I just, I don't know that I have the capacity at this time.

1025
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:05,328
Not to mention, there's no stipend for me, but I would do it for free anyways.

1026
01:52:09,217 --> 01:52:29,792
Is it sort of helpful for us to review, because as you're mentioning the time commitments, it's not always obvious to people what the chair does, but we do consult pretty regularly with the chair on matters about whether or not something needs to come before the board.

1027
01:52:29,872 --> 01:52:31,414
Sometimes there are things of discretion.

1028
01:52:31,434 --> 01:52:36,517
Amanda frequently reviews the projects with the chair in advance.

1029
01:52:37,779 --> 01:52:44,950
Amanda, do you want to talk a little bit about, because you are really the person who has been interacting with the chair the most over the past year.

1030
01:52:46,997 --> 01:52:47,237
Sure.

1031
01:52:47,297 --> 01:52:52,899
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about kind of what that has looked like with me so far.

1032
01:52:53,259 --> 01:53:02,223
So in the past, I typically meet with the chair at least once before any scheduled meeting.

1033
01:53:02,843 --> 01:53:06,544
And during that meeting, we go over what's expected.

1034
01:53:08,445 --> 01:53:24,741
you know, field questions that either the chair has about the project, um, and also, like, questions I might have or the office might have about, like, is there other information that you anticipate that the board would really find helpful or useful?

1035
01:53:25,602 --> 01:53:30,287
Um, and so we would have that one at least one meeting usually before, um,

1036
01:53:31,797 --> 01:53:34,560
before each of the public meetings.

1037
01:53:36,203 --> 01:53:46,936
Otherwise, occasionally we would maybe bring the chair into conversation if there's a project that, I don't know, for various reasons, maybe there's like some

1038
01:53:47,958 --> 01:54:14,883
multiple questions about or like, for example, with rise, we consulted with Andre a little bit after that one of some of the two like initial meetings that were had by the board just to kind of get a sense of there was some like question about like, are we getting enough information before you like, what are the questions that you have slash board members expressed?

1039
01:54:18,712 --> 01:54:28,661
Yeah, so I would say that's about the gist, occasional consultation on things, depending on the nature of what's coming before the board.

1040
01:54:29,788 --> 01:54:36,832
I guess I could say that in a big picture way, we often get questions about how would the board feel about this?

1041
01:54:36,892 --> 01:54:38,373
Like, should we bring it in front of the board?

1042
01:54:38,453 --> 01:54:41,154
What would be the kinds of things they would want to hear from us?

1043
01:54:41,955 --> 01:54:49,099
And depending on the nature of the project and the question, we can just answer that because we know, we've seen you guys ask,

1044
01:54:49,975 --> 01:54:55,058
This is similar projects, similar questions, and this was a similar project.

1045
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,859
This is the kinds of stuff that were asked for.

1046
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:58,039
This is what they were looking at.

1047
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:04,903
And sometimes it'll be a project and we'll be like, we have no idea what they're going to want to know or what's going to be different.

1048
01:55:04,983 --> 01:55:08,545
And so it is useful to bounce some stuff off of somebody.

1049
01:55:10,865 --> 01:55:21,352
rather than me speaking for the board, the chair can sort of say like, well, these are the kinds of things, you know, they could never say we're going to decide this or decide that, but they can make it clear.

1050
01:55:21,392 --> 01:55:24,213
Like there's just not enough information here.

1051
01:55:24,433 --> 01:55:29,256
You know, if you bring it like this, you're going to get, uh, continued.

1052
01:55:29,276 --> 01:55:32,518
And so you might as well just bring the information to first place.

1053
01:55:33,219 --> 01:55:33,319
Hmm.

1054
01:55:36,995 --> 01:55:57,047
And then I guess another small piece that I'll throw into the mix to think about is that, you know, whoever has interest and is nominated as chair, you and I can work together to figure out what kind of a strategy or, you know, schedule or whatever works for us going forward.

1055
01:55:57,107 --> 01:56:05,712
So for example, like Andre and I, I would prep kind of like a meeting preparation document that, you know, would have,

1056
01:56:06,884 --> 01:56:13,786
different things of note and, you know, the governor's notice, for example, to read out and, and things like that.

1057
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:16,467
And we sometimes go over it ahead of time.

1058
01:56:16,527 --> 01:56:24,370
And, but we, you know, I'm happy to work with whomever to kind of figure out and strike a good balance of what works.

1059
01:56:26,493 --> 01:56:31,255
I think the other thing that's important is that the chair does set the tone of the meeting.

1060
01:56:31,435 --> 01:56:40,259
So I sit in on a lot of different board meetings, and I kind of actually felt it a lot this evening, is that, you know, okay, is it time to move on?

1061
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,400
Is it time to call the question?

1062
01:56:42,881 --> 01:56:44,321
Is it time to close this?

1063
01:56:44,921 --> 01:56:47,463
Are people thinking or are they checked out, right?

1064
01:56:48,403 --> 01:56:54,066
You know, some I see some chairs who talk a lot and railroad the board a little.

1065
01:56:54,486 --> 01:56:56,627
Usually those are not decision making boards.

1066
01:56:57,327 --> 01:57:07,532
And I see other chairs who sit back so long that that meetings just sort of like as you were kind of saw this evening without somebody stepping up saying, OK, what's next?

1067
01:57:07,592 --> 01:57:08,272
What's next?

1068
01:57:08,753 --> 01:57:10,654
You know, things just can drag.

1069
01:57:11,754 --> 01:57:16,636
So there is a certain amount of tone setting and setting the direction of

1070
01:57:18,555 --> 01:57:19,596
in the meeting, right?

1071
01:57:19,716 --> 01:57:22,117
Like, all right, I'm ready to entertain a motion.

1072
01:57:22,717 --> 01:57:28,121
Their opinions sort of come through in the running of the meetings on the various cases.

1073
01:57:30,622 --> 01:57:40,728
So I just think it's helpful to think about how does that, so you tend to have a lot of influence on whether or not it is your intention.

1074
01:57:47,473 --> 01:57:52,258
My recommendation would be anybody who can run a very swift and efficient meeting.

1075
01:57:59,825 --> 01:58:05,051
I have the feeling you're all capable of doing it if you know that that's what the rest of the board wants.

1076
01:58:05,271 --> 01:58:07,073
So thank you for saying that, Christy.

1077
01:58:08,553 --> 01:58:11,914
I think the challenge is the time commitment, right?

1078
01:58:12,034 --> 01:58:18,895
I could say that anybody on this board could take on the chair based on their experience and background.

1079
01:58:19,395 --> 01:58:38,119
But to like Jackie's point, it's just really making sure that there's an understanding of the time commitment because each person I believe really wants to do a really good job and not, you know, fail one another or the city if they can't make that time commitment.

1080
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:54,839
I was just going to say, one of the things that I've always done when I, like, for instance, I just helped MAPC with their rollout of the 2050, their 2050 Metro Carmen plan.

1081
01:58:55,080 --> 01:59:01,063
And when the executive director approached me, I had to think about the quality and the time that I was dealing with that in my other work.

1082
01:59:01,544 --> 01:59:06,707
So it's like one of those things where it's like, you just don't want to raise your hand just because you have that expertise and that knowledge.

1083
01:59:07,427 --> 01:59:11,369
You want to make sure that everything fits the box and that you actually are seeing things.

1084
01:59:11,409 --> 01:59:22,574
And now that I'm starting to think about it, their plan, as well as the Medford Comprehensive Plan, as well as our work, and then the exodin recodification, it all does work together.

1085
01:59:22,634 --> 01:59:36,281
And maybe since I'm already working on all those other pieces, maybe I can, if no one else puts their hand up, maybe I can help our board move forward with the chair and sit in that seat.

1086
01:59:42,803 --> 02:00:05,379
If it would make you feel more comfortable, I feel like we could also say, it is the intention that chairs are elected for a year, but I think that everybody would also be understanding if at any point the time commitment became overwhelming, we come back to the board and say, we need to reconsider, or you could say, I need to reconsider, I need somebody else to do this.

1087
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:10,383
I feel like it's, everybody's very friendly here.

1088
02:00:14,798 --> 02:00:19,661
I'd be willing to do it if for no other reason than to get us out of here tonight and be able to close up our meeting.

1089
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:24,924
I second that motion.

1090
02:00:30,947 --> 02:00:34,389
Should we take a vote.

1091
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:35,570
Candidates are one.

1092
02:00:36,451 --> 02:00:38,071
Yeah, yeah, that's a good question.

1093
02:00:38,652 --> 02:00:40,373
You're allowed to have just one, but

1094
02:00:41,026 --> 02:00:43,868
I think I heard both Jackie and David say they're willing to do it.

1095
02:00:44,188 --> 02:00:45,029
I heard that too.

1096
02:00:46,209 --> 02:00:50,752
Yes, but then I David came in strong after he came in really strong.

1097
02:00:52,213 --> 02:00:53,454
This is my only involvement.

1098
02:00:53,474 --> 02:00:56,456
So I mean, you're on like every board in the city, Jackie.

1099
02:00:56,476 --> 02:01:01,699
So I think David really wants to do it.

1100
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,761
I'm dying to do it.

1101
02:01:05,762 --> 02:01:07,863
I've sent multiple emails already about it.

1102
02:01:08,444 --> 02:01:08,544
Oh,

1103
02:01:10,914 --> 02:01:12,235
That's important information to know.

1104
02:01:14,256 --> 02:01:19,237
A motion to elect David Bloomberg as the chair of the Metric Community Development Board.

1105
02:01:20,178 --> 02:01:20,838
We have a second.

1106
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:21,939
I second.

1107
02:01:22,899 --> 02:01:23,299
I third.

1108
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:25,940
All right.

1109
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,821
Well, that's three votes already.

1110
02:01:27,901 --> 02:01:28,761
David, what do you think?

1111
02:01:29,781 --> 02:01:30,262
And Emily?

1112
02:01:33,323 --> 02:01:34,003
Well, yeah.

1113
02:01:34,623 --> 02:01:36,884
I mean, if this is the official roll call vote.

1114
02:01:36,904 --> 02:01:37,704
Roll call vote.

1115
02:01:37,905 --> 02:01:38,745
You got my vote, David.

1116
02:01:39,848 --> 02:01:40,929
Okay, thank you.

1117
02:01:44,033 --> 02:01:44,514
All right.

1118
02:01:47,798 --> 02:01:56,328
I do want to get us out of here, but I'm assuming that we don't have to reelect myself as chair or we're going to do that as well.

1119
02:01:56,368 --> 02:01:57,509
I mean, as vice chair.

1120
02:01:58,663 --> 02:02:08,090
unless I would propose, Jackie, if you are comfortable maintaining the vice chair seat, then I propose we continue that.

1121
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:12,493
But if you are reconsidering that seat, then we can discuss.

1122
02:02:12,513 --> 02:02:17,957
I can definitely be a backup as a vice chair.

1123
02:02:18,278 --> 02:02:18,838
No problem.

1124
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:22,981
Great.

1125
02:02:23,682 --> 02:02:25,283
Motion to elect Jackie as vice chair.

1126
02:02:27,044 --> 02:02:27,424
I'll second.

1127
02:02:27,444 --> 02:02:28,065
Second.

1128
02:02:28,085 --> 02:02:28,785
This is Christy.

1129
02:02:29,725 --> 02:02:30,966
Okay, roll call vote.

1130
02:02:31,446 --> 02:02:32,847
David Bloomberg?

1131
02:02:33,287 --> 02:02:33,528
Yes.

1132
02:02:34,168 --> 02:02:34,768
Christy Dowd?

1133
02:02:35,248 --> 02:02:35,489
Yes.

1134
02:02:36,169 --> 02:02:36,989
Klaus Andreessen?

1135
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,730
Yes.

1136
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:39,010
Emily Hedeman?

1137
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:39,571
Yes.

1138
02:02:40,171 --> 02:02:40,952
Jackie Furtado?

1139
02:02:41,692 --> 02:02:41,932
Yes.

1140
02:02:42,212 --> 02:02:42,652
Thank you.

1141
02:02:43,213 --> 02:02:43,473
Great.

1142
02:02:44,401 --> 02:02:47,102
And yeah, congratulations to you both.

1143
02:02:47,662 --> 02:02:58,644
We do technically still have a third position, the clerk or secretary position, who would be involved in approving the minutes.

1144
02:03:00,345 --> 02:03:10,127
We haven't historically had this filled, and our office has been acting in that role, and I'm happy to keep doing that, but if,

1145
02:03:11,195 --> 02:03:17,904
If someone would like to fill that role or we want to have a discussion about it, now is certainly an appropriate time for that.

1146
02:03:21,514 --> 02:03:42,861
Amanda, just for background, by way of our discussion over the regulations and so forth, and the clerk being called out in the statute as an actual officer of planning board, it's really just a third person who's in sequence in case there are recusals or absences.

1147
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:48,583
And certainly this person could work with you to figure out

1148
02:03:49,813 --> 02:03:51,975
what level of involvement they might need the minutes.

1149
02:03:52,015 --> 02:03:55,638
I'm thinking they probably just make sure they read the minutes for each meeting.

1150
02:03:55,678 --> 02:04:01,684
Maybe that this person, the clerk, is the person who maybe offers the minutes to the board for approval, that sort of thing.

1151
02:04:02,365 --> 02:04:04,567
And that's probably as much as needs to happen.

1152
02:04:08,338 --> 02:04:20,813
So it sounds like you're looking for somebody to commit that they will read the minutes before each meeting when Amanda sends them and then say to the board, I've read the minutes and I submit them to you for your approval.

1153
02:04:22,315 --> 02:04:24,838
I think that's as much as needs to happen.

1154
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:26,761
And then otherwise you're third in succession.

1155
02:04:33,185 --> 02:04:37,966
Oh, Emily, I thought you were unmuted because as the new member, you were gonna volunteer to do that.

1156
02:04:38,827 --> 02:04:40,927
I actually was gonna volunteer to do that.

1157
02:04:41,567 --> 02:04:47,289
Minus the last point, which is third in succession, I'm comfortable with everything else.

1158
02:04:48,089 --> 02:04:51,190
So if you guys are comfortable with that, I can throw my name up.

1159
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:54,251
And to Christie's point, get us out of here.

1160
02:04:54,651 --> 02:05:00,753
But I'm also fine with supporting somebody else if there's somebody more interested in that role.

1161
02:05:01,852 --> 02:05:06,914
Emily, just using the term succession, I might've given it more weight than it really means.

1162
02:05:06,955 --> 02:05:12,257
I mean, for instance, Jackie has never, Jackie never, well, one meeting, I think Jackie said.

1163
02:05:12,277 --> 02:05:13,658
Yeah, just one.

1164
02:05:13,818 --> 02:05:20,361
Yeah, but if both of you've recused yourself and you need somebody to preside over something, I'm comfortable.

1165
02:05:20,501 --> 02:05:22,162
I was on the Somerville Redevelopment Authority.

1166
02:05:22,282 --> 02:05:23,383
I staffed that board.

1167
02:05:23,403 --> 02:05:26,264
So I'm very comfortable around boards.

1168
02:05:26,984 --> 02:05:27,665
You'd be good to go.

1169
02:05:27,685 --> 02:05:29,906
Okay, my vote is in.

1170
02:05:31,463 --> 02:05:37,706
make a motion for Emily to second.

1171
02:05:37,786 --> 02:05:39,247
So quick roll call vote.

1172
02:05:39,587 --> 02:05:40,228
Christy Dowd?

1173
02:05:40,628 --> 02:05:40,828
Yes.

1174
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:42,189
Jackie Furtado?

1175
02:05:42,549 --> 02:05:42,809
Yes.

1176
02:05:43,409 --> 02:05:44,170
David Bloomberg?

1177
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:44,750
Yes.

1178
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:46,171
Klaus Andreasen?

1179
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:47,051
Yes.

1180
02:05:47,711 --> 02:05:48,312
Emily Hedeman?

1181
02:05:48,652 --> 02:05:48,892
Yes.

1182
02:05:50,033 --> 02:05:50,473
Great.

1183
02:05:51,313 --> 02:05:53,254
We have our new officers.

1184
02:05:58,019 --> 02:05:59,140
Thank you all so much.

1185
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:07,087
I will only keep you a short second longer just to let you know that things coming up on the horizon.

1186
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:12,633
We do have two applications that were officially submitted for site plan review.

1187
02:06:12,653 --> 02:06:14,274
I mentioned, I think,

1188
02:06:15,075 --> 02:06:32,769
at least one of them in a previous meeting, 162 Mystic Ave Theory Wellness Cannabis Dispensary proposed, as well as a site on 595 Broadway, which would be multifamily, which actually has gone before the board in the past, but

1189
02:06:33,749 --> 02:06:44,052
because of the time lapse from when they last submitted to us and the change in membership of both this board and the ZBA, we asked them to resubmit.

1190
02:06:44,612 --> 02:06:53,114
So we can anticipate figuring out some scheduling for a mid-August meeting next.

1191
02:06:54,174 --> 02:07:00,156
So keep your ears peeled, wait, eyes peeled for that email.

1192
02:07:00,176 --> 02:07:01,676
We can start figuring out those dates.

1193
02:07:03,315 --> 02:07:08,199
And if 595 doesn't sound familiar, it's because, Amanda, it was 2016, right?

1194
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:10,000
Was it?

1195
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:11,802
I thought it might've been 2020, actually.

1196
02:07:11,822 --> 02:07:16,826
Thought it was so long ago that none of us were on the board.

1197
02:07:16,846 --> 02:07:18,327
Maybe it was 2016.

1198
02:07:19,608 --> 02:07:20,729
Pre-Zoom meetings.

1199
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:21,990
Yeah.

1200
02:07:25,707 --> 02:07:29,470
Okay, well, thank you all so much for the time tonight.

1201
02:07:29,991 --> 02:07:32,233
Emily, welcome to the welcome to the crew.

1202
02:07:34,115 --> 02:07:36,076
And do we have a motion to adjourn?

1203
02:07:37,598 --> 02:07:38,979
A motion to adjourn the meeting.

1204
02:07:39,559 --> 02:07:40,020
Seconded.

1205
02:07:40,841 --> 02:07:42,662
All right, quick roll call vote.

1206
02:07:43,103 --> 02:07:44,083
So Jackie Furtado?

1207
02:07:44,444 --> 02:07:44,724
Yes.

1208
02:07:45,545 --> 02:07:46,225
Emily Hedeman?

1209
02:07:46,666 --> 02:07:46,886
Yes.

1210
02:07:47,366 --> 02:07:48,047
Christy Dowd?

1211
02:07:48,547 --> 02:07:48,808
Yes.

1212
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:50,189
Klaas Andreassen?

1213
02:07:54,048 --> 02:07:55,449
Oh, I think you might be muted.

1214
02:07:55,929 --> 02:07:56,190
Yes.

1215
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:57,671
Oh, there you go.

1216
02:07:58,231 --> 02:07:59,152
And David Bloomberg.

1217
02:07:59,492 --> 02:07:59,752
Yes.

1218
02:08:01,013 --> 02:08:02,654
All right, we are officially adjourned.

1219
02:08:02,915 --> 02:08:03,855
Thank you all so much.

1220
02:08:04,496 --> 02:08:04,996
Thank you.

1221
02:08:05,016 --> 02:08:06,077
Thanks, have a great night.

1222
02:08:06,537 --> 02:08:07,598
Thank you.

1223
02:08:07,858 --> 02:08:11,201
David, we're going to put your name on that decision this evening then.

1224
02:08:13,583 --> 02:08:13,803
Okay.

1225
02:08:13,823 --> 02:08:15,404
It comes from the chair.

1226
02:08:15,984 --> 02:08:16,405
Understood.

1227
02:08:17,105 --> 02:08:17,345
Yes.

1228
02:08:18,827 --> 02:08:19,267
Thank you.

1229
02:08:19,287 --> 02:08:20,528
I'll check it in the notes.

1230
02:08:23,877 --> 02:08:24,203
Goodnight.

1231
02:08:24,713 --> 02:08:25,100
Goodnight.

1232
02:08:25,365 --> 02:08:25,609
Night.
