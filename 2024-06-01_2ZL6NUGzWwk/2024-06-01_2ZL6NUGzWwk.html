    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=674.082s">All</a>  right, <a href="../resolutions/24-046.pdf"><font color="green">24-046</font></a>, request to exempt Fire Chief position from civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=679.746s">February</a>  15th, 2024, to Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, re-removal of Fire Chief position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=689.753s">Dear</a>  President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable body vote to submit a request pursuant to Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Amendments to the Constitution <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=702.341s">of</a>  Massachusetts, as amended by Article 89, that state senator name and state representative name submit special legislation to the general court seeking to remove the position of fire chief in Medford Fire Department from the civil service law, General Law Chapter 31, which would divest the position from all rights and obligations set forth in General Law Chapter 31, your vote, and the legislation would have no effect on civil service status of any other member of the fire department or any other employee of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=732.145s">The</a>  special act would provide as follows, an act exempting the position of fire chief in the city of Medford from the civil service law, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=744.596s">Section</a>  one, the position of fire chief in the city of Medford shall be exempt from chapter 31 of the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=750.561s">Section</a>  two, section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person holding the position of fire chief in the city on the effective act of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=758.453s">Section</a>  three, this act shall take effect upon its passage by way of background of the approximately 102 municipal fire departments that are subject to the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=768.442s">Approximately</a>  51 departments or 50% have a civil service chief in recent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=772.967s">Municipalities</a>  have sought to accept the position of fire chief from chapter 31 for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=777.911s">Among</a>  one of the main reasons that municipalities have sought to exempt the position from Chapter 31 is because once a fire chief is appointed under the current civil service system, they are essentially lifetime appointments and the procedures which the municipality would have to follow to make a change in the position and the standard the municipality would have to satisfy in order to do so are avoidably burdensome with the ever-changing nature and fluidity of the fire profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=800.192s">Currently,</a>  the needs of the city maintain little notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=803.795s">The</a>  chief needs to be able to quickly change, adapt, and work with the changing needs of the city to ensure proper supervision of the department and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=813.541s">By</a>  removing the position from civil service, the city would be able to annually evaluate the chief's performance on a predetermined contractual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=820.304s">The</a>  city would have the ability to negotiate removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=823.226s">and</a>  non reappointment clauses with the individual in the position rather than being bound to the de facto lifetime appointment that comes with the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=830.549s">The</a>  city additionally would not be bound to the constructive measures that exist in civil service relative to appointments to the position of fire chief under civil service and applicant pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=839.352s">is</a>  generally limited and certain scenarios are utilized when either a test or assessment center is administered for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=849.079s">In</a>  order to post a test, the city must work with the understaffed civil service HRD unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=853.502s">This</a>  requires back and forth of multiple forms and processes that are generally unnecessary or redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=858.766s">Subjects</a>  must create online profiles, submit more required forms and documents electronically, and pay fees to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=865.151s">The</a>  city must then wait for civil service to process all forms and payments, which can take months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=870.634s">They</a>  must then conduct a bid for a vendor to deliver the exam and arrange a date that works for the city, the vendor, and for a civil service representative to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=877.297s">This</a>  again pushes up the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=879.338s">Outside</a>  of the constraints of civil service and through its own procurement process, the city would solicit bids from vendors who have experience in conducting fire service assessment centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=887.302s">For</a>  a fire chief, the request for proposals would seek a qualified consultant to design, validate, administer, and score an assessment center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=894.605s">In</a>  order to create a promotional eligible list from which to promote a candidate to the position, the city would be able to offer a better test to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants that could draw interest from applicants throughout the Commonwealth as well as nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=907.355s">This</a>  process would better allow the city and fire department to evolve, maximize its budget, manage the department and fill a vital position in a more expedited manner through its own appointment process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=917.583s">the</a>  city would be in a better position to diversify the department without jumping through hoops that civil service requires when asking for specialized certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=925.088s">It</a>  would also allow the city more flexibility on the quote scenarios presented during the test by removing the fire chief from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=933.593s">The</a>  city would be replacing an outdated and cumbersome procedure with an updated and efficient one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=938.796s">Given</a>  the fire chief's pending retirement and the resulting vacancy in the position, now is the opportune time for the council to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=944.759s">The</a>  removal of the fire chief from civil service will serve to propel the department in the right direction going forward, and it would be in the best interest of the residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=952.163s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=953.783s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Brianne Alamogordo, mayor.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=969.681s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=970.961s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=973.621s">I</a>  would like to request, Mr. President, if the council could please provide the mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=980.663s">She's</a>  on the call.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=986.064s">Okay,</a>  we will go to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=989.605s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=993.417s">On</a>  the call with me, you just heard from Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=997.239s">We</a>  also have Lisa Crowley, our Human Resource Director, as well as Attorney Brian Mazur for any legal questions you may have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1005.843s">I</a>  think the paper speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1008.084s">Thank</a>  you for reading it fully, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1012.686s">The</a>  position of Fire Chief <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1015.956s">became</a>  vacant as of a week ago when the chief freedman put in his retirement papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1023.661s">So</a>  I want to thank him for his service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1026.803s">But</a>  it became an opportunity for the city, like many others that have come before us, to request to remove the position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1037.95s">As</a>  you heard, out of 300 plus 51 cities and towns, there's only 100 <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1045.68s">um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1046.9s">In</a>  civil service and there's only 50 that haven't removed the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1050.881s">So</a>  out of 351 cities and towns Only 50 are restricted by civil service guidelines and what civil service does is creates a very stringent process not allowing the city to have a broad candidate pool, which includes members of our own department if they choose to have interest in the position and I think modernizing the position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1075.749s">making</a>  it more open, competitive, with the goal of hiring the best candidate from a broad pool of applicants, is in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1086.479s">And</a>  I ask that council support this paper this evening so we can move forward and modernize the way that it's done, the process, so we can get the best candidate for the city of Medford to lead our fire department.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1103.302s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1105.023s">We'll</a>  go to members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1107.825s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1109.967s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1110.267s">All</a>  right, just if we could close the doors, please, again, I ask so we can hear in the room and hear everyone's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1115.951s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.592s">So</a>  with all due respect, what the mayor has just said and what you just read is completely crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1125.538s">This</a>  is a joke and this is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1143.015s">What</a>  we're seeing right now is we're seeing action that's being taken by this mayor that has negatively affected multiple departments, multiple people, good people in this community, good people that's worked for the city and found a way to destroy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1160.463s">And</a>  I know I'm reading, I read some posts that all of a sudden the mayor is some kind of right fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1165.425s">We</a>  don't need a right fighter, we need a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1167.486s">We</a>  need a leader that's gonna make decisions that's best for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1184.127s">We</a>  are, this is what, these are the phone calls I've gotten, I've received this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1189.228s">The</a>  school budget, $2.4 million, $2.5 million in the hole this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1197.93s">We</a>  still have questions within our school system of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1202.352s">We</a>  still have questions about our paraprofessionals and whether we have enough teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1209.113s">We're</a>  talking about a situation that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1212.472s">that</a>  you're looking across the city and you're seeing good people getting hurt and the mayor spending good money that belongs to the city to do things on her own agenda, chasing around city employees and paying for private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1228.03s">paying</a>  good money for private investigators, and then the results come back that the city is fraudulent, leaving us into a world of hurt when it comes to finances, and when it comes to what the budget's gonna look like, because what we have to pay people in penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1244.998s">We</a>  have probably the one of best, best employees I've ever worked with than Aleesha Nunley, a former finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1252.501s">was</a>  fighting and suing the city now going after the city because the way this man treated her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1257.164s">And</a>  I believe the comments were that that that at the time that they wanted to have a white male present the budget because she didn't feel that this council would listen to a woman of color, which is which is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1275.578s">And</a>  I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1276.839s">But</a>  what I want to what I find more appalling is this situation right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1282.245s">Everybody</a>  in this community, I've been reading things going back and forth and trying to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1286.571s">It's</a>  a disgrace if anybody's trying to support this for the fact that everybody works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1290.577s">And</a>  when you go to work, you're given a certain criteria of what you can and what you can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1296.044s">And</a>  all this doesn't stem from anything about equity or what 350 other cities are doing in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1303.949s">This</a>  is retribution, this is an attack against an issue that occurred that left our firefighters speechless because it was then called an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1313.594s">So</a>  they couldn't tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1315.736s">What</a>  I do know of the men and women that are our firefighters, they earned the right to have sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1321.977s">And</a>  if I asked these firefighters to raise their hand if they have over 100 days or 200 days saved or 300 days saved, I can guarantee you, Mr. President, the majority of this room hands will go up in red. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1333.169s">Because</a>  that's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1335.132s">What's</a>  been the only constant since the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1338.315s">The</a>  only constant <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1340.735s">are</a>  men and women in fire that have done anything that this city has needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1346.377s">And</a>  we hear rhetoric that our facilities, that the mayor's put money toward the facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1351.159s">That's</a>  a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1353.3s">Well,</a>  the money that was put into those facilities are just barely getting by so they're safe and where they stay every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1360.796s">When</a>  we talked about what happened the other day, and this is all fraudulent, and this was some sort of pre-planned, where does it say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1370.741s">What</a>  investigation said that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1373.363s">Because</a>  all the firefighters I talked to is that they have sick time, and all they did was use the days that they're supposed to take if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1383.154s">And</a>  then I heard, well, what's shocking is they called sick in the morning, but miraculously show up at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1390.064s">Miraculously,</a>  that's who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1392.407s">They're</a>  coming in sick because they don't have coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1396.704s">So</a>  what I find appalling, you're talking about wasted money, setting a dialogue that this financial budget coming this year is going to be disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1405.67s">I</a>  will warn everybody, don't be shocked if this mayor presents cuts for fire, police, DPW, custodians, teachers, because we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1415.075s">The</a>  state has already reported that people that I've talked to, that we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1419.278s">We</a>  have no more ESSA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1420.478s">We</a>  have no more ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1422.019s">We</a>  have 60 positions that we're going to lose that are sponsored by those monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1426.78s">So</a>  maybe this is a dialogue that says City of Medford, they're not listening because until tonight, there haven't been many people listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1435.663s">The</a>  City of Medford, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1438.226s">We</a>  have the firefighters that are using this and wasting $93,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1442.189s">The</a>  president from the fire department is gonna come up and I hope he explains the situation, why we're wasting money on a deputy, I believe a deputy that's over time, I believe almost $50,000 that we've paid because the mayor will not promote that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1460.721s">You</a>  wanna talk about hypocrisy? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1463.018s">This</a>  is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1464.081s">We</a>  have teachers that are getting a check every week because they're not getting their prep time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1471.343s">that's</a>  costing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1474.385s">Because</a>  they're not doing the job correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1476.706s">Now</a>  we have a council that's been talking about overrides and talking about other ways to create money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1483.03s">There's</a>  one reason that we're gonna be in a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1486.112s">Because</a>  the way we've managed our fiscal funds in this community in the last four years, we have no development, we have no movement, we have no new money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1496.378s">And</a>  you wanna turn and look at the fight of the economy to blame them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1499.139s">Shame</a>  on you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1515.799s">I</a>  want to close with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1522.686s">Did</a>  any of you speak to the mayor personally? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1526.77s">Anyone</a>  in the room?</p>

    <p>[Ricky Cormio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1527.791s">Any</a>  councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1530.133s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1531.114s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.015s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.415s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.996s">That's</a>  over to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1533.837s">You</a>  all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1534.838s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1535.218s">It's</a>  shocking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1538.301s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1539.85s">So</a>  it's not illegal, you can talk to each individual, not as a group, but this is what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1545.896s">There's</a>  a dialogue being sent, and I implore to my fellow Councilors that no matter what's happened in this community, no matter what we've looked at and said, whatever has divided this community, because there's been a lot, but there's been one constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1564.025s">one</a>  constant, no matter what, whether they didn't get their raise for years, whether their facilities are deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1571.65s">whether</a>  they're waiting for their retro checks, there's one constant, the fire department's still strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1577.655s">And</a>  the dialogue that's being spun, that Chief Friedman, shame on you firefighters, because the reason why Chief Friedman left is because of your entitled ignorance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1589.024s">That's</a>  a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1591.106s">What</a>  I'm hearing is the total opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1593.488s">He</a>  left because he's never been talked to as an individual, as a professional, the way this administration talks to their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1613.736s">So</a>  I ask, what's the other constant? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1616.679s">No</a>  city solicitor, nobody that we can call to talk and ask what our direction should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1623.765s">We</a>  haven't had stability in most any of our department heads in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1630.811s">We've</a>  had turnover and I think every position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1635.046s">When</a>  we went for a new chief, I didn't see the mayor come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1638.248s">The</a>  dialogue wasn't the mayor coming up and setting this out saying, the chief of police, we need to do this because of X, Y, and Z and everything you read, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1646.472s">She</a>  didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1648.113s">But</a>  all of a sudden, the fire department who stand strong with their convictions and stand strong for what they believe in in our community and do the right thing every single day, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1659.332s">the</a>  firemen that have the right to use their sick time have the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1664.479s">So</a>  it's not their fault that we don't find enough firefighters that we protect our staff just in case this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1672.008s">We</a>  don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1673.831s">We</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1676.067s">But</a>  it's these firefighters after this incident came out, and an irate mayor went public, went to the news authorities, knowing that these people couldn't defend themselves by calling it a criminal act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1690.555s">And</a>  then come to us for a paper to give her control? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1698.646s">Please,</a>  I beg all of you, do not even consider this because this is one constant that has worked no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1707.736s">One</a>  thing I heard from these firefighters and their families and their families, when they watch their families, their loved ones leave the house to go to work, they don't know if they're going to come home. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1718.39s">But</a>  what they do have is they have each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1720.891s">And</a>  by bringing someone in from the outside, you're gonna disrupt that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1728.015s">The</a>  goal to say that the delay in all this is a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1733.718s">We</a>  have capable, qualified firefighters that can step in as an interim chief while this process moves the way it's supposed to in the civil process like we've always done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1755.354s">So</a>  I'll leave you with this, for those people who know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1761.781s">Chief</a>  Sacco, Chief Giliberti, Chief Freeman, Chief Buckley, civil servants, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1768.849s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1770.391s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1771.272s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1772.834s">They've</a>  led our city in some tough times and they've done a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1777.188s">Why</a>  would we even consider, why would we even consider changing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1781.17s">This</a>  shouldn't even be a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1783.951s">So</a>  I appreciate and thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1785.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1797.956s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, we're gonna go to other councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1800.998s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1804.079s">President</a>  Bears, are you able to answer questions if you know the answer?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1807.714s">if</a>  I ask you questions.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1810.737s">Do</a>  the firefighters have a contract right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1812.538s">Are</a>  they working with a contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1813.419s">My</a>  understanding is yes, there's a signed contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1815.921s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1817.283s">The</a>  change in the designation of the fire chief, what impact would it have on the rank and file firefighters, do you know?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1822.888s">According</a>  to this proposal, it would not change their civil service status. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1827.152s">It</a>  would just change who is able... It says the law specifically says <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1834.366s">The</a>  section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1837.768s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1838.308s">The</a>  position of fire chief for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1840.269s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1841.41s">So</a>  it wouldn't have an impact on anybody except for the fire chief.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1844.812s">That's</a>  as it's written.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1850.055s">My</a>  understanding is when everybody called out sick at the same time early this month, that since it's the fire department and there can still be fires and disruption and emergencies that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1864.635s">Somebody</a>  will get called in to cover those shifts and those people that get called in get paid overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1873.717s">Do</a>  you know if that's true?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1875.198s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1875.938s">If</a>  you want to direct questions to the administration, we can all speak and then we can hear from the administration if they want to answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1880.859s">That</a>  would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1883.86s">My</a>  belief is that what happens is when you call in sick, then somebody who is not scheduled <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1889.602s">to</a>  work that shift comes in and fills in that shift but gets paid overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1895.106s">And</a>  that is why it was so much more expensive during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1898.629s">So</a>  what appeared to be a coordinated call out meant that it cost a significantly larger amount of money to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1908.356s">The</a>  reason I'm saying this in explicit terms is because I think most people in Medford wouldn't understand that to be the case because at most jobs, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1917.623s">if</a>  you're a shift worker, if you work in retail or restaurant, and you fill in for somebody, you just get paid normal wages that you would be paid on any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1926.367s">But</a>  my understanding is that in the fire department, when you call at six, somebody else comes and fills in that position, but you get paid time and a half or double time something over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1937.511s">I</a>  just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1938.572s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1941.089s">I</a>  think that there is a possibility that if a fire chief comes in who is from a different department, it would have to be somebody who has worked in a fire department and has that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1953.839s">They</a>  would be maybe somebody that would say, oh, hey, maybe if everybody called out sick one day, that would be something that we would have to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1963.479s">that</a>  wouldn't be something I would be comfortable with happening on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1967.622s">Maybe</a>  I wouldn't want everybody to then get paid overtime to make up a coordinated call out, even though we have a contract, even though it's not a strike, even though there is no, there does not seem to be an ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1984.532s">There</a>  doesn't seem to be any reason for that coordinated call out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1990.286s">And,</a>  excuse me, no, no, you may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1993.627s">Alleged?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1994.548s">Let's</a>  not call a coordinated attack.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1996.008s">I'm</a>  not policing anyone's speech here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1997.689s">So</a>  if we could just step back from the podium, and we're gonna, no one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2001.83s">I'll</a>  pose it for you, it's an alleged.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2004.531s">You're</a>  not part of this conversation here, we're not.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2006.971s">We're</a>  not gonna go back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2010.773s">And</a>  we're not gonna have outbursts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2011.833s">And</a>  again, I wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2013.874s">Interrupting</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, we're not gonna interrupt other councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2017.015s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2019.69s">What</a>  I'm saying is if there was a fire chief who was not part of civil service and who came in from an outside fire department, I believe that the likelihood of a situation like what happened earlier in February would be much less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2034.124s">I</a>  would, if there's possibility for the administration to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2039.509s">If</a>  you're gonna have conversations, please take them outside.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2042.765s">if</a>  the administration could speak to that, I would appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2045.826s">Just</a>  about the overtime issue is that if you can correct me if I was wrong about that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2049.488s">Great,</a>  I have that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2050.368s">We'll</a>  go back to the administration.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2052.689s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2054.91s">Thank</a>  you, and I also ask that I'm just gonna... That's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2060.432s">I'm</a>  just gonna talk, and I'm going to...</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2064.821s">Well,</a>  if folks would not have conversations and not leave the doors open, it's difficult to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2072.212s">It's</a>  difficult to hear in this room when people are shouting, when the doors are open, when there's conversations happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2076.138s">So</a>  I please ask that people respect everyone who's speaking.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2081.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2082.471s">So</a>  I got messages from about 30 people opposed to this, including three or four from firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2090.114s">I</a>  ended up having long conversations, you know, with two of those firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2098.558s">I</a>  had dinner with another one on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2101.679s">Friday,</a>  Thursday, and I even went to the South Medford fire station and rang their doorbell and tried to start a conversation with the fellow there who obviously wasn't expecting to talk to a city councilor but the point that I'm getting at is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2119.712s">City</a>  Council, just like the rest of, like many other people in Medford, has been in a bit of an information vacuum about the nature of what's been happening with union negotiations between the mayor and the leadership and the firefighters union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2135.376s">And</a>  so what I'm trying to say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2139.737s">We</a>  didn't really know too much about what was going on behind closed doors compared to the rest of the public until last Thursday when this came onto the agenda and suddenly became in the interest of both parties to put as much information about what's been happening behind closed doors for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2158.476s">as</a>  possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2159.496s">So</a>  I did talk to the I did talk to the mayor, I tried to talk to different firefighters, I tried to get past a lot of the spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2170.458s">A</a>  lot of you know, obviously, during the union negotiations, union contract negotiations, relationships fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2178.88s">And</a>  there's a lot of there's a lot of bad blood that's going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2182.981s">And</a>  I heard a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2185.161s">And</a>  so what I'm going to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2187.982s">What</a>  I'm going to try to do is make my thinking about this as transparent as I possibly can, and so I'm going to say the points that appeal to me most for voting down, and then I'm going to say the points that I see in favor of this, and then I want to listen to public comment after that, and I'm not going to say anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2211.332s">The</a>  point in opposition to this that meant the most to me was the morale in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2216.797s">There</a>  are promotional issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2218.639s">If</a>  you bring in somebody from the outside, firefighters cannot advance in the normal routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2223.763s">I</a>  hear that loud and clear that so I received an email from a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2231.77s">Dan</a>  Craven, and I think he phrased it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2234.931s">He</a>  said, four promotions normally happen in this scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2237.932s">Firefighter,</a>  Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Chief each get promoted to fill the vacancies created by the Fire Chief's retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2243.594s">There</a>  are already established promotional lists for Deputy Chief, Captain, and Lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2247.135s">The</a>  Mayor has instead called upon your Honorable Body to remove the Chief's position from civil service law so that she can hire him outside the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2254.797s">which</a>  would in turn effectively nullify the normal promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2257.659s">I</a>  take that very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2258.88s">He</a>  then goes on to talk about all of the studying that's required for these tests, why they're so difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2266.485s">And</a>  I've also heard about the behavior that from the mayor personally, which obviously didn't appeal to a lot of people during this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2274.39s">What</a>  I'm going to say that I need, if I am going to vote against this, I absolutely need to be convinced of a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2282.355s">First,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2283.536s">the</a>  sick time situation as my colleagues have both brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2288.638s">Now,</a>  I have tried to ask as many firefighters about this as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2294.699s">I</a>  have been told that they actually were sick and I'll be perfectly honest, 21 out of 23 people call in in a day and then they come in later, I don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2308.163s">I'm</a>  just gonna say that I do not believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2313.052s">I</a>  have, otherwise when I try to ask about that, I think that there's some ongoing, you know, potential litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2321.356s">So</a>  people have been advised to not talk to me about what's happening behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2326.279s">And</a>  one in my position in this is that we absolutely cannot have, we cannot have the fire department making the five o'clock news about these issues, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2340.706s">That</a>  is my bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2342.387s">I</a>  understand morale issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2343.567s">I</a>  understand everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2345.188s">I</a>  do not want to see the Medford Fire Department with a culture that encourages these kinds of issues like sick time and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2355.671s">And</a>  if <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2361.016s">If</a>  an outsider can fix the culture that encouraged that, then I would vote for an outsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2371.346s">The</a>  other thing that, the other thing, and this was a fact that was confirmed by both sides, I specifically asked this of both the fire department and of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2381.576s">Now,</a>  one issue is that the civil service <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2385.6s">test</a>  is fair, it allows for promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2388.521s">I</a>  was told about, you know, a situation in 1999, where two people took the promotional exam to go from deputy to fire chief, one of them was less popular, but scored higher, that person became fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2401.843s">This</a>  past time, three to four people signed up to take the exam, only one of them actually took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2410.933s">Okay,</a>  so if you're telling me that it is a competitive process to be fire chief, then that is not something that given that fact that I believe now I have heard I've heard that fact has been confirmed to me by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2428.626s">What</a>  I have heard from <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2431.488s">why</a>  that was from the mayor was that folks wanted to select their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2436.932s">What</a>  I've heard that that was from the fire department is that it is a big decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2443.917s">People</a>  need to talk to their families about whether or not they want to take the advancement exam and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2450.302s">I</a>  even talked to one of the deputy chiefs that signed up for that but did not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2456.766s">But</a>  the point is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2459.503s">It</a>  did not convince me that it was a competitive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2463.909s">So</a>  that being said, the morale issue is something that I do take very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2473.818s">I</a>  don't expect what I just said to appeal to everybody in this room, but my goal here is to make my thinking on this as transparent as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2480.804s">That's</a>  where I'm at with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2482.145s">I've</a>  tried to talk to as many firefighters as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2484.887s">I</a>  hope once all of this blows over, I can hang out with you all some more, maybe do a Q&A session, just try to make City Council a bit more accessible and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2498.678s">But</a>  that's my thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2502.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2508.145s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2509.785s">Members</a>  of the Council, Council Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2514.128s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2516.149s">Thank</a>  you to everybody who's assembled here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2518.87s">I</a>  think this is probably one of the four council chambers that I've seen, and we pack it two or three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2526.583s">Thank</a>  you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2527.544s">I'm</a>  going to keep it pretty short. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2529.406s">I've</a>  had several conversations with several folks around this issue in the past few days, some of whom I know were in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2538.253s">Thank</a>  you for reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2539.234s">I</a>  always appreciate residents and folks who live and work in this community for getting in touch with us directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2544.238s">This</a>  is how this has to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2546.96s">This</a>  is the dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2549.093s">We're</a>  elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.434s">You</a>  live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.995s">You</a>  work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2551.636s">This</a>  is our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.077s">I'm</a>  here to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.778s">I've</a>  tried to, you know, begin that process of listening with the folks who've reached out to me over the past couple days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2561.566s">We've</a>  heard about this over the past several days from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2564.468s">You</a>  know, I am going into this from the perspective of this decision has landed on our desks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2571.355s">I</a>  know that the priority of folks here, the folks who work in service in the interest of public safety, I know what your priority is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2579.281s">Your</a>  priority is the public safety of Medford residents, the people who live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2584.044s">As</a>  an elected representative, that has to be my priority as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2586.585s">I</a>  know that's the priority shared by the committee, by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2589.828s">And</a>  so as we continue to listen and hear from people around this, that's going to be my guiding light is what decision will be in the best interest of executing public safety for Medford residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2601.715s">as</a>  well as possible every single day because of how the department is structured and any decisions that we have the jurisdiction to make around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2608.039s">That</a>  is going to be my lens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2609.72s">I've</a>  said this about other policies before, you know, because it applies to many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2615.104s">With</a>  any decision, what I try to remember, it can't be about <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2619.964s">this</a>  administration or this person in the role right now or this person who's doing the job right now, it's about the department, it's about the community, it's about today, but it's also about five years from now, 10 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2632.594s">It's</a>  always hard not to make these issues personal because we are a community made up of people who know each other and care for each other and sometimes have history with one another, but these decisions can't be made with anything other than that North Star of public safety in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2646.064s">That's</a>  the perspective that I'm going into this with for the rest of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2648.626s">I</a>  look forward to listening and hearing from people about this continuing to hear from constituents and firefighters and the administration and my fellow Councilors about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2658.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2663.615s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2664.015s">I'll</a>  be brief as well because I know a lot of people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2666.337s">I</a>  want to echo Councilor Collins' sentiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2669.759s">I've</a>  spent a lot of the last few days talking to people, catching up on emails and phone calls and haven't been able to reach everyone, especially since I was sick for a few days last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2680.645s">I</a>  think my job here tonight is to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2683.867s">and</a>  to listen to the perspectives in the room and give you all a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2688.43s">And</a>  I have myself questions about this policy, concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2693.974s">And</a>  I think it's important just to recognize that my job tonight is to listen.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2701.039s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2702.16s">I</a>  have a question from Councilors for the Administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2703.961s">Are</a>  there any other questions for the Administration from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2708.706s">Oh,</a>  Anna, sorry, Councilor Callaghan, I recognize you, then if folks have questions, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2714.073s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2715.779s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2716.999s">I</a>  want to really thank all of the people who reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2720.42s">I</a>  have received more emails on this topic than I've probably on any other topic and spoken to a number of firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2729.682s">And</a>  honestly, my position on this, I am finding it extremely difficult to believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2740.044s">a</a>  healthy fire department filled with people who want to do their jobs, respect their leaders, and are, you know, doing the best that they can here in Medford in this incredibly difficult job is going to be helped by a process that almost to a T, like every single one of them does not want. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2765.489s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2769.001s">If</a>  we are looking, that is just very difficult for me to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2774.044s">I</a>  want to make sure that whatever process that we have for selecting, and it was very interesting to me to hear, and I really dug into the process and how it has worked in the past, and how people are satisfied with it, and why it is that this particular process that the fire department has builds trust, builds respect, builds a really good, as Councilor Lemmie said, morale, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2798.802s">And</a>  I am finding it very difficult to believe that a process that every firefighter does not want is going to get better leadership into the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2813.288s">So</a>  that's where I start from, but I'm open ears and I'm very interested in hearing from everyone who is here to speak about this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2821.692s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2826.792s">Are</a>  there any questions from members of the council for the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2831.255s">All</a>  right, we have Councilor Lazzaro's question, which was regarding, you can repeat it if you wanna phrase it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2836.96s">Yeah,</a>  my question was if firefighters call out sick and somebody has to come in and fill in for the firefighters that are not in attendance, do the firefighters that have come in to fill in, they get paid overtime, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2854.008s">We</a>  have the chief of staff, the mayor and the HR director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2857.33s">Do</a>  any of you want to field that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2859.251s">You</a>  can raise your hand and I can unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2867.737s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2870.979s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, happily answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2873.461s">Yes,</a>  in fact, it does trigger overtime.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2877.624s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2878.204s">Any</a>  further questions from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2880.586s">For</a>  the administration, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2883.476s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2884.397s">I</a>  said I wasn't gonna talk again, but I remembered a clarifying question that I just wanted to double check before we get further into the weeds on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2890.782s">It's</a>  my understanding from the research and the conversations that I've had so far about this, that this change, if it were to go forward, would not render ineligible any applicant within the fire department that's currently eligible for the role that would just extend the pool wider than it currently is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2908.795s">Can</a>  the administration confirm if that's true?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2912.759s">go</a>  to the chief of staff or go to the mayor has raised her hand, I'll go to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2919.902s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2921.082s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Collins and the committee, the application pool would of course allow internal candidates to apply.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2930.899s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2932.2s">So</a>  a question from Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2935.463s">So</a>  for clarity, now we have within the civil service, there's a process in place that if we hire within through the civil service process, we know exactly what <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2948.553s">the</a>  fiscal point will be when we hire that chief, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2955.076s">We</a>  know exactly there's a formula in place that says firefighters make A, the chief is eligible to make B, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2963.533s">So</a>  if that's correct, we allow to open that up and eliminate civil service, we can have people come in to ask for $200,000 a year, 210,000, 180,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2975.096s">So</a>  they can come in and really inflate that cost in that department, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2984.944s">matter.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2986.665s">Yeah,</a>  that is the current salary, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2988.947s">So</a>  if you took it out of civil service, there would not, it would not be an at will, fire chief, it would be a contracted fire chief from somebody either in the department in the state or even broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3002.237s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3003.678s">That</a>  is the way that it has to be versus last time where four deputies signed up to take the test, only one took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3013.528s">So</a>  it seemed like the chief was handpicked by the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3019.034s">And</a>  that too, that did a disservice to our captains who could have signed up for and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3025.39s">Taken</a>  the test to be a potential candidate But once four signed up it blocked everybody else and you did hear from other people within the department upset with that process, too I'm gonna I think you want the best candidate in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3039.915s">You</a>  had a situation at the beginning of the month Where it cost the city almost a hundred thousand dollars to pay for overtime <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3048.379s">I</a>  think it was not the entire fire department's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3053.803s">I</a>  think it was just a misguided situation that got out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3059.008s">And</a>  it's unfortunate because there are good members of the fire department that should be able to rise up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3065.453s">We</a>  just want to make sure that the best person for this job is the proper candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3073.019s">And</a>  we need to gain some control <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3077.603s">Of</a>  the membership we need to make sure that we're helping people rise rise up with integrity And that we have a respected department versus what we're seeing</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3091.167s">So</a>  thank you, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3092.707s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3093.208s">I</a>  have a follow up then because you said something very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3096.368s">Madam</a>  Mayor, you said that the concern of the overtime because of this so-called concern that you had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3105.151s">Let</a>  me ask you something point blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3107.411s">Are</a>  you not promoting positions that are costing us overtime right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3112.253s">Something</a>  you have control of?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3114.81s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, we promote pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3117.491s">Sometimes</a>  it does take HR a week or two or myself to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3123.154s">We</a>  had a retirement several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3128.016s">It</a>  came before myself and HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3131.217s">I</a>  started to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3133.283s">Hoping</a>  that I could just promote and push that and get that checked off the list But when I went to look to see who who was on the list because it's not an assessment center Like I I wish it was it's whoever's at the top is how we promote within our fire department and that that's all well and good That's how it's it's taken place and how the process has has landed the last several, you know <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3156.676s">I</a>  think since I've been around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3159.119s">But</a>  what we have now is not only a review of what happened the first weekend in February, not because I want to review it, it's because we had people <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3170.722s">21</a>  people call out out of 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3173.243s">I,</a>  as mayor, have an obligation to look into why that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3177.825s">And</a>  it wasn't just Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3179.625s">We</a>  had 12, 13 people call out on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3182.946s">12</a>  or 13 people call out on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3185.767s">Monday</a>  got a little better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3188.141s">Again,</a>  12 or 13 people until we're scrambling to get a legal letter to the union president saying please stop this behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3197.088s">It's</a>  putting the city at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3199.63s">It's</a>  causing $100,000 in overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3202.753s">Overtime</a>  has already been skyrocketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3204.994s">I've</a>  been trying to get control of it and get a review on overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3208.718s">because</a>  I did suspect what the data is showing, we're going to continue to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3213.644s">So</a>  if I have people on that list that should be promoted, that were misguided and happened to take time off during that, what I say is an orchestrated event, I have to take a time out and make sure we're promoting <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3228.587s">Through</a>  this review, investigation, whatever this comes about, I need to make sure that the leaders in the department are going to lead the department with integrity and show their younger members how a department should be led. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3243.833s">and</a>  the behavior that should be in our proud Medford Fire Department who are risking their lives to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3253.038s">It</a>  happened to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3253.919s">Pat</a>  Ripley, he's retired, came in when we had an electrical fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3257.841s">I</a>  will be ever, ever grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3260.202s">I'm</a>  not taking away from what they do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3262.804s">I</a>  respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3264.204s">I</a>  respect the job they do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3266.586s">What</a>  I don't respect is the fact that we have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3269.928s">It</a>  is settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3272.116s">And</a>  there was an orchestrated event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3273.938s">And</a>  I don't know what lesson they were trying to teach me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3277.22s">I</a>  don't know what that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3278.581s">They</a>  just had met with our HR director and our diversity equity inclusion director the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3285.467s">I</a>  said, how did those meetings go? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3287.349s">Everybody</a>  said they went fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3289.23s">They</a>  have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3290.892s">We</a>  have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3291.812s">They</a>  have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3292.393s">But</a>  it went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3293.954s">And</a>  then the next day, there was an orchestrated event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3297.716s">And</a>  I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3299.017s">And</a>  the people in the residents don't deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3301.719s">So</a>  yes, we have a school deficit we have over time, it's out of control in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3306.562s">And</a>  we have an orchestrated event that's making it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3308.643s">And</a>  I, I as mayor have to look into that I have to figure out why that was, and I have to make sure it doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3315.648s">And</a>  I have to</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3319.716s">So</a>  so thank you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3322.517s">I</a>  have some questions because I just think that a contractual obligation as the mayor to to promote an internal candidate that I believe has cost the city over $50,000 to date for overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3340.422s">So</a>  I think that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3341.463s">So</a>  I know that you're making it sound like fluff, but this is something that's going to destroy and divide our city, even more than you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3348.392s">So</a>  you have decided as the mayor of this community to now is becoming investigated the jury and the judge to say that this was orchestrated, and it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3358.364s">Councilor</a>  Leming wants <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3360.226s">our</a>  firefighters to explain something and how they can talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3364.207s">But</a>  you, Madam Mayor, have called this an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3367.068s">So</a>  I don't know what these people can say tonight legally to convince you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3372.89s">And</a>  what I fear tonight is you're going to vote yes on an issue that they have no control to support because the mayor is setting a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3381.452s">There's</a>  history here, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3383.653s">If</a>  this is the first thing this mayor has done, if this is the first thing that you've done that has questioned the support for working men and women in this community, I would say, well, maybe we'd have to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3395.282s">But</a>  is it contractual that these men and women in this department, they are given the right to have sick time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3404.029s">Yes,</a>  they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3406.37s">Now,</a>  as a former teacher, and listen, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3410.239s">If</a>  I can ask the president of the teachers union to ask on a daily basis, how many teachers are off because they're sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3415.144s">I</a>  would say there's probably 60, 70 a day sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3419.649s">So</a>  this isn't crazy, but when you spin the dialogue that's doing something like deceiving, this is what divides this community, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3431.738s">So</a>  until we find out what's going on, so isn't that confusing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3436.623s">They</a>  meet with the HR director the day before and everything's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3441.307s">But</a>  could it be that maybe they're sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3444.39s">Maybe</a>  there's a doubt in anybody's mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3446.312s">Some</a>  have already made comments that they've already judged us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3451.196s">They've</a>  already judged these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3453.561s">And</a>  this is what I find appalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3455.162s">You're</a>  putting the cart ahead of the horse, and it's doing major, major destruction to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3462.485s">You're</a>  saying that you need to do this because of the community, and you have this responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3468.368s">Look</a>  at this responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3469.989s">Your</a>  family's calling you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3472.33s">You're</a>  dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3475.311s">We</a>  have so much more that we need to worry about right now, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3478.293s">Way</a>  too much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3480.174s">To</a>  be dealing with this when we have competent people in place to do this is a waste of our taxpayers' time and taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3501.18s">The</a>  question is, do we have these two questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3505.742s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3506.502s">The</a>  one question is, if she can speak to it, that are you familiar with the amount of money that we're paying because contractually you're not promoting a certain position? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3520.649s">That's</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3522.23s">I</a>  was told today, whether you can speak on it or not, that you might have already offered this position to an outside candidate, whether it's intern or not, if that's the truth, that's against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3534.594s">That's</a>  against a chapter that I don't have in front of me, but I can get it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3539.695s">What</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3542.877s">4238,</a>  so I would question that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3547.7s">And</a>  I think that would, the reason why I think that needs to be figured out, that this council have to understand, is this something prearranged? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3555.987s">Does</a>  the mayor already have somebody in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3558.129s">Because</a>  if she's talking about this transparent process and something that we need in this community, if she's already pre-approved somebody to come in that declined the job today, that should be alarming to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3569.338s">Because</a>  everything she just said means nothing, if that's the truth.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3573.399s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3580.78s">The</a>  questions were about if a position hasn't been promoted and has the position been offered to anyone on an interim or permanent basis?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3592.463s">Yeah,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3594.343s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3596.144s">Councilor</a>  scarpelli referenced 42 38 which is trumped by the city charter The city charter says the mayor has appointing authority to all department heads So yes, I did offer the interim position to a candidate that I thought could really work with the membership as well as how to explain why Something like the beginning of what happened in the beginning of february was just not helpful um <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3621.235s">But</a>  he was somewhat scared away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3624.537s">And</a>  then I believe a statement was put out telling everybody in, I don't know if it was in the state, not to apply for the interim role here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3633.063s">So,</a>  yes, I did offer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3634.304s">And</a>  he no longer will accept the position because he knows he's going to get major pushback if he does accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3643.132s">I</a>  can um, I can turn it over to attorney maser if you want to understand better how the charter trumps 42 38 With regards to just the dividing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3653.014s">Um</a>  I'm not dividing the community whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3657.395s">I</a>  Am trying to get to the bottom of what happened at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3660.876s">I'm</a>  trying to hold those accountable that need accountability <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3665.148s">The</a>  only one that divided is the person that put out the call allegedly to not come to work that weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3671.795s">That</a>  started the division. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3673.537s">I'm</a>  trying to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3675.62s">And</a>  I believe I'm going to turn it over to HR director Lisa Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3679.96s">There</a>  is some overtime costs to not promoting, but I don't see how I can promote people until I have finished our review on what happened, who was involved, and continued the data research that I'm doing that is bringing up some other issues with regards to sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3701.936s">People</a>  do have sick time for when they're sick.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3708.796s">Hi,</a>  Mr. President, to the council and all those that are in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3715.481s">There</a>  is a cost of overtime for not hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3717.962s">Unfortunately,</a>  I don't have the paperwork in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3720.264s">If</a>  I knew the question was going to be asked, I would have made sure I was prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3724.306s">But</a>  the mayor is not holding back on the promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3727.648s">What</a>  we're doing is we're making sure that we're going through the civil service process and putting forth the most qualified <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3736.494s">On</a>  the list as civil service process, I'm not sure if, you know, the list comes out, you have your top candidates, depending on where they are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3745.745s">That's</a>  how we hire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3746.666s">And</a>  that's what we will be doing in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3751.152s">But</a>  there is no, there's no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3755.018s">holds</a>  back for any kind of retaliation that, you know, has been stated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3760.461s">It's</a>  that is not been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3762.542s">We</a>  have been working with bringing on five new firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3767.384s">Right</a>  now we're walking through that whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3769.425s">That</a>  too in itself is a massive undertaking through the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3774.788s">So</a>  we are working with the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3776.849s">I</a>  respect the fire department as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3779.17s">I've</a>  had many conversations with President Buckley and Secretary <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3785.532s">of</a>  the union, and we are working through getting the promotions as soon as we can, but we are still working on getting five new firefighters on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3795.518s">And</a>  that again has taken some time there's <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3799.292s">Exams</a>  they have to go through, they have to go through a rigorous process and we're still through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3804.433s">Hopefully</a>  we can get them on board through their required examinations and hopefully get them into an academy sometime within the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3814.035s">We</a>  don't have control over when the academy accepts anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3817.596s">So</a>  once we get all the prerequisites done, then it's up to the academy to tell us when we can get those firefighters in.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3826.757s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3828.898s">I'll</a>  just end with this, two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3830.678s">I'll</a>  end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3831.958s">Madam</a>  Mayor, when there was an issue with the gun clip and the place was filled, when you talk about divide, I wish you were here instead of on Zoom, because there are people outside waiting to get in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3845.261s">This</a>  is a dividing issue, whether you want to believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3847.922s">And</a>  second, more importantly, to my fellow councilors, everything the mayor stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3853.263s">everything</a>  she said about equity and having this process, if she's already gone out and handpicked somebody that declined, how true is that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3880.489s">Thank</a>  you, I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3883.37s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3884.912s">Through</a>  you to Councilor Scarapelli, just to be clear, we're talking about an interim appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3890.697s">This</a>  is a normal process in which ensuring that there's leadership in the department for, you know, obviously operational and other important avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3902.649s">it</a>  needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3903.65s">That</a>  is something that the mayor is doing to try to ensure there's good communication between the department, our office, human resources office, all of those things would be incredibly important to have an interim fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3915.995s">There's</a>  no scenario where we wouldn't want an interim in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3919.856s">So</a>  this is an interim on a temporary basis to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3923.658s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3925.051s">So,</a>  if I can, when Chief Sacco left, we had an interim police chief that was capable, an officer I believe was, I forget who it was, but we had, was it Clemente? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3941.523s">The</a>  acting chief who did an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3943.845s">And</a>  I'm sure we had qualified candidates that could be appointed tonight as interim chiefs tonight that weren't part of it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3963.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3964.32s">We're</a>  gonna, you know, if there's a response to the administration or any other questions for the administration, we'll go there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3970.844s">Any</a>  other questions from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3973.425s">Anything</a>  you'd like to clarify on your end, Madam Chief of Staff or Madam Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3980.25s">All</a>  right, seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3985.433s">How</a>  many people in this room would like to speak tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3987.194s">Please</a>  raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3990.106s">All</a>  right, that is a reasonable number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3992.867s">Last</a>  week, two weeks ago, we had over 70 people speak in public comment, so I made a decision as chair to go to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4000.031s">Seeing</a>  that we have about 10 people tonight, we're gonna go by the city council rules, which are five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4005.333s">and</a>  I'm going to ask you, just if you could, we have a piece of paper over there, Mr. Buckley, you can go after. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4011.016s">Just</a>  for the record, we have assistant clerk Sylvina with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4015.418s">Just</a>  for our records, we're asking people to sign up, so we make sure we get your name and your address correct for speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4020.7s">So</a>  I'm gonna start timer, five minutes, I'll give a 30 second warning, and we will go to you, Mr. Buckley.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4030.151s">just</a>  a point of information to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4038.115s">A</a>  deputy retired on January 7th, and a promotion can take place the next day or two days after. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4044.278s">January</a>  7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, all the way into February, there was no promotion made on that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4050.141s">So</a>  it had nothing to do with any alleged sick time use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4053.943s">That's</a>  just a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4056.067s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors, and thank you all tonight for your comments so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4060.049s">I'm</a>  here tonight to ask you to vote no on the Mayor's request to move the position of Fire Chief from Civil Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4066.431s">The</a>  following is an excerpt from a white letter written by the late Senator Ken Donnery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4071.693s">The</a>  civil service system was instituted to manage how public employees are recruited, screened for legality and security purposes, trained, disciplined, classified, compensated, promoted, and in some case retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4086.161s">Massachusetts</a>  was one of the first states that passed a merit system in 1883. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4089.143s">History</a>  will show that the implementation of this system became a necessity due to the inefficient workforce that came about because of political and patronage abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4101.11s">Before</a>  the inception of the civil service system, public service was in a serious decay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4105.992s">Outright</a>  corruption was not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4108.353s">The</a>  spore system became an established institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4111.655s">Decisions</a>  on appointments, promotions, and removal of jobs were made solely for political purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4117.817s">The</a>  morale of the workforce was at an all-time low, and a system had to be devised to find a solution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4124.6s">The</a>  solution is to set up a merit system for the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4128.101s">The</a>  merit system removes moralizing influence that political interference usually causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4133.963s">It</a>  ensures that the civil service servant's loyalty is given to the public they serve rather than the politician in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4141.705s">It</a>  gives employees some job security without which no technical or professional officer can do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4148.447s">And</a>  it elevates the civil service workforce to a higher plane of professionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4154.653s">This</a>  process has been a vital pathway for veterans and disabled veterans to obtain gainful and meaningful employment, grounded in a fair selection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4163.299s">Although</a>  the mayor is only asking to remove the fire chief from civil service at this time, make no doubt about it, she will attempt to do the same with future new hires. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4172.205s">Give</a>  an inch and they will take a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4174.667s">This</a>  will allow cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism to creep into our city, all of which is currently being mitigated through the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4185.088s">position</a>  with someone of the mayor's choosing is a detriment to the city and a danger to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4191.813s">Appointed</a>  positions leave the door open to favoritism, coercion, and political patronage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4197.437s">The</a>  chief must be able to stand their ground on the basis of safety, even if it is not a politically favorable position or decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4205.142s">If</a>  appointed, making these decisions become almost impossible for fear of biting the hand that feeds you, or worse, for being terminated for doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4217.284s">The</a>  instability and chaos within a department created by a potentially revolving door for the fire chief's position is unmeasurable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4225.347s">Firefighters</a>  need to have confidence in their leader on the fire ground and administratively, even though he is not OVC eye to eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4233.03s">Our</a>  city, specifically under the current mayor, has had multiple personal scandals involving the hiring, firing, disputes turning into legal battles, and a particularly tumultuous reputation with labor contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4247.247s">There</a>  have been major positions within the city government that have gone vacant for months or even years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4252.816s">The</a>  last thing the city should do is hand over the reins of hiring, firing, and directing of the fire chief to this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4261.167s">Civil</a>  service has and will continue to be that governing body that will establish a set of regulations, timelines, procedures, qualifications to be met as a way to standardize the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4273.295s">Within</a>  our ranks, we have decades of experience on the fire ground and a profound understanding of departmental procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4281.401s">These</a>  members have an intimate knowledge of the unique city infrastructure, the layout and size, and most importantly, respect for our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4290.592s">Our</a>  union and the membership of this department are invested in the well-being of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4295.773s">Our</a>  investment is built on the oath we take as firefighters to do all we can for our city and the people who call us in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4303.654s">We</a>  only ask that you, the city, provide us with the necessary tools, equipment, and facilities and confidence to let us work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4310.956s">Today,</a>  it was very troubling to hear that the mayor had offered the chief to someone outside the city of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4317.987s">Her</a>  decision was made unilaterally, without regard for this city charter, and has complete disregard for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4324.972s">its</a>  opinion or results of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4328.975s">The</a>  members of this council here today ran for office on the platform that fights for the people of Medford basic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4336.522s">While</a>  supporting local labor with a quote from the platform reading, we commit to supporting local labor unions, keeping public jobs public by rejecting outsourcing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4347.571s">30</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4348.191s">We</a>  ask that the council acknowledge that we, as a union, feel that outsourcing a job that has always been hired from a pool of long-time and heavily invested members is damaging and goes against the ideal of this department, and we'd assume the ideals of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4365.216s">We</a>  hope that this council declines the motion to hire a chief from outside the department, outside our union, and outside our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4373.399s">Please</a>  keep politics out of public safety.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4396.041s">As</a>  has been our principle, I'm going to go to Guy Manganiello on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4402.703s">You</a>  can speak for five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4404.564s">Please</a>  give your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4407.184s">And</a>  the hand is gone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4408.265s">I'm</a>  gonna ask you to unmute if you're on mute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4417.048s">Apologies,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4420.931s">I</a>  was looking at speaking this evening, but not particularly on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4425.774s">When</a>  you had asked the question, you had asked if anybody planned on speaking this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4428.816s">So</a>  that was the- Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4433.479s">All</a>  right, we'll go to Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4435.961s">Name</a>  and address for the record, and you'll have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4438.602s">Bob</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4439.743s">Mary's</a>  Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4442.105s">Again,</a>  I think it might be what's up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4445.448s">Tap</a>  the microphone base. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4446.669s">I</a>  think it shut off.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4450.288s">Here</a>  we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4451.689s">I</a>  am embarrassed to be here in front of the council for these issues.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4456.252s">I'd</a>  like to address some of the city council's comments, concerns and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4460.395s">First</a>  of all, second of all, we in this union as professionals try to keep our issues in house and internal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4469.081s">Apparently</a>  the mayor doesn't agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4471.723s">So</a>  here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4473.144s">Let's</a>  get them all out there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4475.005s">Mr.</a>  Leming asked about the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4481.71s">I'm</a>  sorry, it was a question again to refresh my memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4483.692s">There's</a>  so many things that I'd like to.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4486.836s">Councilor</a>  Leming, if you'd like to clarify and I'll pause your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4489.338s">So,</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4494.062s">The</a>  two things that I brought up were first off the issue of the sick time abuse that occurred in early February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4500.545s">The</a>  point that I was bringing up was that I <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4522.819s">need</a>  to be convinced that whatever future leader that is hired, is appointed, does not lead the fire department to a position where they're making the five o'clock news in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4539.645s">That</a>  to me is the bottom line behind, like even beyond a lot of the morale issues that have been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4547.528s">My</a>  perspective is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4552.045s">doing</a>  this would lead to people thinking that they could never make it to the top, which obviously affects motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4560.568s">But</a>  at the same time, if you bring an outside officer to lead a new unit, that is more effective at inducing culture change than having somebody that has spent their entire career in that particular body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4580.956s">So</a>  I have not seen anything that can convince me that the current civil service process will effectively address any sick time abuse issues that are currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4599.929s">That's</a>  where I'm at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4608.268s">And</a>  I don't think this was another point that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4610.889s">It</a>  wasn't necessarily a question, but it was kind of supporting that point was the fact that there was one person who actually took the exam this past time to go from deputy to higher chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4625.814s">And</a>  so I don't want to speculate as to the reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4629.195s">Four</a>  people signed up, one person took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4631.255s">That</a>  is a fact that has been established by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4633.716s">But</a>  to me, that is evidence against <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4637.117s">the</a>  idea that the civil service position, when applied every single promotional round, would actually hire competitive leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4650.68s">Those</a>  were the specific points that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4653.72s">Now,</a>  to my colleague's point about, you know, potential litigation here, I do respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4662.622s">I</a>  do respect that this is not something that firefighters of the union can necessarily speak directly to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4672.849s">Again,</a>  I have asked folks that I can find, and they typically have referred me to either representatives from the union or union lawyers, which that's the response that I've gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4688.584s">Those</a>  are my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4690.184s">That</a>  is the result of where... That's the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4694.986s">Basically,</a>  to summarize, if an outside leader can keep the fire department from making the news with corruption allegations in the future, then I will be voting for an outside leader.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4705.709s">To</a>  refresh my memories... I'll put you back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4711.47s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4711.911s">What's</a>  the clarification?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4712.611s">Who</a>  went to the news?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4715.492s">The</a>  early...</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4727.029s">That's</a>  a fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4742.239s">So</a>  I think the nature of the point of who went to the news is like, okay, so it was the mayor that presented the news release there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4753.367s">And</a>  I thought about that too, like clearly the idea here is the mayor, like, there's the sick time issue that happened, the mayor brought that to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4766.976s">And</a>  so, this absolutely is a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4771.459s">The</a>  mayor brings something to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4773.621s">It</a>  is public points against the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4777.544s">There's</a>  totally political maneuvering here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4780.986s">Here's</a>  the thing, if the fire department is gonna do that, you can't put yourselves in a position where somebody can give your actions to a local news source and it's worth reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4794.082s">Okay,</a>  does that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4796.886s">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4797.847s">I</a>  was surprised that you covered it, actually, with everything else that's going on in the city, the country, and the world, that our staffing issues was the second lead news story on the... <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4811.264s">on</a>  the 5 o'clock rules.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4813.826s">If</a>  I may, I'd like to avoid further back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4816.887s">I</a>  appreciate the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4818.168s">I</a>  don't think we wanted to go on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4819.329s">We</a>  don't want to hear from everybody, but I appreciate you asking, Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4823.931s">I'll</a>  go back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4824.652s">I</a>  think we have a clear understanding of what to respond to.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4827.153s">I'd</a>  like to answer all questions as far as the exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4831.475s">As</a>  far as the exam, the deputy chief that took the exam, Chief Friedman, passed the exam, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4837.159s">So</a>  obviously, he studied and has a knowledge base to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4840.02s">As</a>  far as people not going to the exam and not taking the test, I don't know where that information came from, because I wasn't there, and I would dispute any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4849.084s">As</a>  far as Councilor, I think it's Councilor Lazzaro, your comments, with the staffing we've been in my 23 years on this department, if we had sufficient staffing, then we wouldn't have had a hire all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4863.37s">We</a>  have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4871.152s">We</a>  haven't hired a firefighter in 15 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4873.753s">In</a>  that time, we've had approximately 10 retirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4877.274s">So</a>  who's looking at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4879.254s">We</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4880.155s">Apparently,</a>  nobody else cares about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4882.475s">Going</a>  back to the deputy chief that's not promoted, the deputy chief that's not promoted is causing another deputy chief to work overtime in his spot whenever he's supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4892.558s">That's</a>  to the tune of about $45,000 at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4896.659s">Going</a>  back to the other promotional issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4899.972s">A</a>  chief leaving the department happens every day all across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4904.816s">Common</a>  procedure is to make the senior deputy chief interim chief until a search can be done and a permanent chief can be completed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4913.524s">We</a>  have two deputies right here that could be named chief tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4917.408s">We</a>  have five deputies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4925.725s">There's</a>  five deputies that have over 20 years experience that could go into the job, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4932.291s">No</a>  problem at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4935.614s">There</a>  are just so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4936.455s">We</a>  don't have a city solicitor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4938.056s">How</a>  many open jobs out there in the city right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4941.379s">Many,</a>  many jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4943.06s">I</a>  understand the mayor is an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4945.763s">Is</a>  there a city solicitor's job that's open? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4948.405s">It</a>  has been for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4950.58s">So</a>  she's in the field, and she can't hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4954.161s">But</a>  she's going to go outside and hire a chief for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4957.723s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4965.325s">And</a>  the comments that we do have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4967.166s">Yes,</a>  we do have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4968.726s">We</a>  had some negotiations with the team that's on Zoom for approximately three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4974.748s">And</a>  only when we decided to go to arbitration, we got a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4979.864s">All</a>  the units in this room have to go to arbitration for a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4984.208s">We</a>  can't sit in a room and talk to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4987.37s">It's</a>  not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4988.111s">It's</a>  not done with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4990.693s">I'm</a>  glad to see the mayor was at least here on Zoom, but she didn't come to any of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4995.236s">We</a>  have to have a back and forth with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5002.731s">So</a>  as far as the city solicitor goes, one of the duties of the city solicitor is to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5011.662s">Is</a>  that one of the things that they do?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5013.834s">Yeah,</a>  who does that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5015.115s">We</a>  put one in- Public records officers, Janice.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5018.316s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5018.616s">Well,</a>  we put them in and it went unfilled, as all these other units have in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5023.899s">They</a>  go unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5024.9s">They</a>  have to be, we have to file a complaint with the attorney general's office to get the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5030.483s">The</a>  information that we had to get is for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5034.265s">$825,000</a>  had been expended at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5044.326s">was</a>  ever on a Zoom call, would anybody like to comment or update that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5049.267s">Because</a>  I'm sure it's well over a million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5051.288s">If</a>  you want to talk about money and wasting of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5055.629s">And</a>  we've had many cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5057.65s">How</a>  much open litigation is it with the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5059.93s">What</a>  is the value, the exposure of the lawsuits that the city is going to lose in the near future because of their actions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5070.073s">KP</a>  Law, I don't know the case that they've won. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5073.763s">Can</a>  you update that to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5075.805s">Anybody</a>  on Zoom?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5079.488s">I</a>  don't have the answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5081.09s">I'd</a>  love to get it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5082.371s">I</a>  will give the administration- I'd love to get it.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5084.653s">Another</a>  thing is open meeting violation requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5088.437s">If</a>  you're the city council and that's a legal opinion, what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5091.199s">Do</a>  you call KP law? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5093.562s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5095.283s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5097.759s">and</a>  clear that they do not work for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5100.061s">Special</a>  council, special council status.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5102.743s">The</a>  current process is that we reach out to the mayor, the chief of staff, and KP Law when we need legal support.</p>
