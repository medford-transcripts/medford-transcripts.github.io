    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=558.325s">Thank</a>  you, and Mr. Costigan, just to clarify, this is just enabling certain types of ownership to be eligible for the veteran's exemption of the property tax levy?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=674.082s">All</a>  right, <a href="../resolutions/24-046.pdf"><font color="green">24-046</font></a>, request to exempt Fire Chief position from civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=679.746s">February</a>  15th, 2024, to Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, re-removal of Fire Chief position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=689.753s">Dear</a>  President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable body vote to submit a request pursuant to Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Amendments to the Constitution <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=702.341s">of</a>  Massachusetts, as amended by Article 89, that state senator name and state representative name submit special legislation to the general court seeking to remove the position of fire chief in Medford Fire Department from the civil service law, General Law Chapter 31, which would divest the position from all rights and obligations set forth in General Law Chapter 31, your vote, and the legislation would have no effect on civil service status of any other member of the fire department or any other employee of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=732.145s">The</a>  special act would provide as follows, an act exempting the position of fire chief in the city of Medford from the civil service law, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=744.596s">Section</a>  one, the position of fire chief in the city of Medford shall be exempt from chapter 31 of the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=750.561s">Section</a>  two, section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person holding the position of fire chief in the city on the effective act of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=758.453s">Section</a>  three, this act shall take effect upon its passage by way of background of the approximately 102 municipal fire departments that are subject to the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=768.442s">Approximately</a>  51 departments or 50% have a civil service chief in recent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=772.967s">Municipalities</a>  have sought to accept the position of fire chief from chapter 31 for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=777.911s">Among</a>  one of the main reasons that municipalities have sought to exempt the position from Chapter 31 is because once a fire chief is appointed under the current civil service system, they are essentially lifetime appointments and the procedures which the municipality would have to follow to make a change in the position and the standard the municipality would have to satisfy in order to do so are avoidably burdensome with the ever-changing nature and fluidity of the fire profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=800.192s">Currently,</a>  the needs of the city maintain little notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=803.795s">The</a>  chief needs to be able to quickly change, adapt, and work with the changing needs of the city to ensure proper supervision of the department and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=813.541s">By</a>  removing the position from civil service, the city would be able to annually evaluate the chief's performance on a predetermined contractual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=820.304s">The</a>  city would have the ability to negotiate removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=823.226s">and</a>  non reappointment clauses with the individual in the position rather than being bound to the de facto lifetime appointment that comes with the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=830.549s">The</a>  city additionally would not be bound to the constructive measures that exist in civil service relative to appointments to the position of fire chief under civil service and applicant pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=839.352s">is</a>  generally limited and certain scenarios are utilized when either a test or assessment center is administered for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=849.079s">In</a>  order to post a test, the city must work with the understaffed civil service HRD unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=853.502s">This</a>  requires back and forth of multiple forms and processes that are generally unnecessary or redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=858.766s">Subjects</a>  must create online profiles, submit more required forms and documents electronically, and pay fees to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=865.151s">The</a>  city must then wait for civil service to process all forms and payments, which can take months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=870.634s">They</a>  must then conduct a bid for a vendor to deliver the exam and arrange a date that works for the city, the vendor, and for a civil service representative to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=877.297s">This</a>  again pushes up the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=879.338s">Outside</a>  of the constraints of civil service and through its own procurement process, the city would solicit bids from vendors who have experience in conducting fire service assessment centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=887.302s">For</a>  a fire chief, the request for proposals would seek a qualified consultant to design, validate, administer, and score an assessment center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=894.605s">In</a>  order to create a promotional eligible list from which to promote a candidate to the position, the city would be able to offer a better test to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants that could draw interest from applicants throughout the Commonwealth as well as nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=907.355s">This</a>  process would better allow the city and fire department to evolve, maximize its budget, manage the department and fill a vital position in a more expedited manner through its own appointment process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=917.583s">the</a>  city would be in a better position to diversify the department without jumping through hoops that civil service requires when asking for specialized certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=925.088s">It</a>  would also allow the city more flexibility on the quote scenarios presented during the test by removing the fire chief from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=933.593s">The</a>  city would be replacing an outdated and cumbersome procedure with an updated and efficient one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=938.796s">Given</a>  the fire chief's pending retirement and the resulting vacancy in the position, now is the opportune time for the council to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=944.759s">The</a>  removal of the fire chief from civil service will serve to propel the department in the right direction going forward, and it would be in the best interest of the residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=952.163s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=953.783s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Brianne Alamogordo, mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=956.385s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=957.665s">I</a>  would like to recognize the administration so they can present the paper before we move to council comment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=962.288s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=963.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=965.74s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=969.681s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=970.961s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=973.621s">I</a>  would like to request, Mr. President, if the council could please provide the mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=980.663s">She's</a>  on the call.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=986.064s">Okay,</a>  we will go to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=989.605s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=993.417s">On</a>  the call with me, you just heard from Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=997.239s">We</a>  also have Lisa Crowley, our Human Resource Director, as well as Attorney Brian Mazur for any legal questions you may have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1005.843s">I</a>  think the paper speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1008.084s">Thank</a>  you for reading it fully, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1012.686s">The</a>  position of Fire Chief <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1015.956s">became</a>  vacant as of a week ago when the chief freedman put in his retirement papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1023.661s">So</a>  I want to thank him for his service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1026.803s">But</a>  it became an opportunity for the city, like many others that have come before us, to request to remove the position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1037.95s">As</a>  you heard, out of 300 plus 51 cities and towns, there's only 100 <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1045.68s">um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1046.9s">In</a>  civil service and there's only 50 that haven't removed the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1050.881s">So</a>  out of 351 cities and towns Only 50 are restricted by civil service guidelines and what civil service does is creates a very stringent process not allowing the city to have a broad candidate pool, which includes members of our own department if they choose to have interest in the position and I think modernizing the position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1075.749s">making</a>  it more open, competitive, with the goal of hiring the best candidate from a broad pool of applicants, is in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1086.479s">And</a>  I ask that council support this paper this evening so we can move forward and modernize the way that it's done, the process, so we can get the best candidate for the city of Medford to lead our fire department.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1103.302s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1105.023s">We'll</a>  go to members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1107.825s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1109.967s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1110.267s">All</a>  right, just if we could close the doors, please, again, I ask so we can hear in the room and hear everyone's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1115.951s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.592s">So</a>  with all due respect, what the mayor has just said and what you just read is completely crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1125.538s">This</a>  is a joke and this is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1143.015s">What</a>  we're seeing right now is we're seeing action that's being taken by this mayor that has negatively affected multiple departments, multiple people, good people in this community, good people that's worked for the city and found a way to destroy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1160.463s">And</a>  I know I'm reading, I read some posts that all of a sudden the mayor is some kind of right fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1165.425s">We</a>  don't need a right fighter, we need a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1167.486s">We</a>  need a leader that's gonna make decisions that's best for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1184.127s">We</a>  are, this is what, these are the phone calls I've gotten, I've received this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1189.228s">The</a>  school budget, $2.4 million, $2.5 million in the hole this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1197.93s">We</a>  still have questions within our school system of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1202.352s">We</a>  still have questions about our paraprofessionals and whether we have enough teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1209.113s">We're</a>  talking about a situation that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1212.472s">that</a>  you're looking across the city and you're seeing good people getting hurt and the mayor spending good money that belongs to the city to do things on her own agenda, chasing around city employees and paying for private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1228.03s">paying</a>  good money for private investigators, and then the results come back that the city is fraudulent, leaving us into a world of hurt when it comes to finances, and when it comes to what the budget's gonna look like, because what we have to pay people in penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1244.998s">We</a>  have probably the one of best, best employees I've ever worked with than Aleesha Nunley, a former finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1252.501s">was</a>  fighting and suing the city now going after the city because the way this man treated her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1257.164s">And</a>  I believe the comments were that that that at the time that they wanted to have a white male present the budget because she didn't feel that this council would listen to a woman of color, which is which is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1275.578s">And</a>  I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1276.839s">But</a>  what I want to what I find more appalling is this situation right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1282.245s">Everybody</a>  in this community, I've been reading things going back and forth and trying to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1286.571s">It's</a>  a disgrace if anybody's trying to support this for the fact that everybody works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1290.577s">And</a>  when you go to work, you're given a certain criteria of what you can and what you can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1296.044s">And</a>  all this doesn't stem from anything about equity or what 350 other cities are doing in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1303.949s">This</a>  is retribution, this is an attack against an issue that occurred that left our firefighters speechless because it was then called an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1313.594s">So</a>  they couldn't tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1315.736s">What</a>  I do know of the men and women that are our firefighters, they earned the right to have sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1321.977s">And</a>  if I asked these firefighters to raise their hand if they have over 100 days or 200 days saved or 300 days saved, I can guarantee you, Mr. President, the majority of this room hands will go up in red. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1333.169s">Because</a>  that's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1335.132s">What's</a>  been the only constant since the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1338.315s">The</a>  only constant <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1340.735s">are</a>  men and women in fire that have done anything that this city has needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1346.377s">And</a>  we hear rhetoric that our facilities, that the mayor's put money toward the facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1351.159s">That's</a>  a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1353.3s">Well,</a>  the money that was put into those facilities are just barely getting by so they're safe and where they stay every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1360.796s">When</a>  we talked about what happened the other day, and this is all fraudulent, and this was some sort of pre-planned, where does it say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1370.741s">What</a>  investigation said that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1373.363s">Because</a>  all the firefighters I talked to is that they have sick time, and all they did was use the days that they're supposed to take if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1383.154s">And</a>  then I heard, well, what's shocking is they called sick in the morning, but miraculously show up at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1390.064s">Miraculously,</a>  that's who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1392.407s">They're</a>  coming in sick because they don't have coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1396.704s">So</a>  what I find appalling, you're talking about wasted money, setting a dialogue that this financial budget coming this year is going to be disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1405.67s">I</a>  will warn everybody, don't be shocked if this mayor presents cuts for fire, police, DPW, custodians, teachers, because we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1415.075s">The</a>  state has already reported that people that I've talked to, that we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1419.278s">We</a>  have no more ESSA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1420.478s">We</a>  have no more ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1422.019s">We</a>  have 60 positions that we're going to lose that are sponsored by those monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1426.78s">So</a>  maybe this is a dialogue that says City of Medford, they're not listening because until tonight, there haven't been many people listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1435.663s">The</a>  City of Medford, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1438.226s">We</a>  have the firefighters that are using this and wasting $93,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1442.189s">The</a>  president from the fire department is gonna come up and I hope he explains the situation, why we're wasting money on a deputy, I believe a deputy that's over time, I believe almost $50,000 that we've paid because the mayor will not promote that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1460.721s">You</a>  wanna talk about hypocrisy? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1463.018s">This</a>  is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1464.081s">We</a>  have teachers that are getting a check every week because they're not getting their prep time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1471.343s">that's</a>  costing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1474.385s">Because</a>  they're not doing the job correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1476.706s">Now</a>  we have a council that's been talking about overrides and talking about other ways to create money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1483.03s">There's</a>  one reason that we're gonna be in a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1486.112s">Because</a>  the way we've managed our fiscal funds in this community in the last four years, we have no development, we have no movement, we have no new money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1496.378s">And</a>  you wanna turn and look at the fight of the economy to blame them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1499.139s">Shame</a>  on you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1515.799s">I</a>  want to close with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1522.686s">Did</a>  any of you speak to the mayor personally? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1526.77s">Anyone</a>  in the room?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1527.791s">Any</a>  councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1530.133s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1531.114s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.015s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.415s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.996s">That's</a>  over to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1533.837s">You</a>  all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1534.838s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1535.218s">It's</a>  shocking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1538.301s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1539.85s">So</a>  it's not illegal, you can talk to each individual, not as a group, but this is what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1545.896s">There's</a>  a dialogue being sent, and I implore to my fellow Councilors that no matter what's happened in this community, no matter what we've looked at and said, whatever has divided this community, because there's been a lot, but there's been one constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1564.025s">one</a>  constant, no matter what, whether they didn't get their raise for years, whether their facilities are deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1571.65s">whether</a>  they're waiting for their retro checks, there's one constant, the fire department's still strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1577.655s">And</a>  the dialogue that's being spun, that Chief Friedman, shame on you firefighters, because the reason why Chief Friedman left is because of your entitled ignorance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1589.024s">That's</a>  a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1591.106s">What</a>  I'm hearing is the total opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1593.488s">He</a>  left because he's never been talked to as an individual, as a professional, the way this administration talks to their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1613.736s">So</a>  I ask, what's the other constant? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1616.679s">No</a>  city solicitor, nobody that we can call to talk and ask what our direction should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1623.765s">We</a>  haven't had stability in most any of our department heads in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1630.811s">We've</a>  had turnover and I think every position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1635.046s">When</a>  we went for a new chief, I didn't see the mayor come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1638.248s">The</a>  dialogue wasn't the mayor coming up and setting this out saying, the chief of police, we need to do this because of X, Y, and Z and everything you read, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1646.472s">She</a>  didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1648.113s">But</a>  all of a sudden, the fire department who stand strong with their convictions and stand strong for what they believe in in our community and do the right thing every single day, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1659.332s">the</a>  firemen that have the right to use their sick time have the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1664.479s">So</a>  it's not their fault that we don't find enough firefighters that we protect our staff just in case this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1672.008s">We</a>  don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1673.831s">We</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1676.067s">But</a>  it's these firefighters after this incident came out, and an irate mayor went public, went to the news authorities, knowing that these people couldn't defend themselves by calling it a criminal act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1690.555s">And</a>  then come to us for a paper to give her control? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1698.646s">Please,</a>  I beg all of you, do not even consider this because this is one constant that has worked no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1707.736s">One</a>  thing I heard from these firefighters and their families and their families, when they watch their families, their loved ones leave the house to go to work, they don't know if they're going to come home. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1718.39s">But</a>  what they do have is they have each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1720.891s">And</a>  by bringing someone in from the outside, you're gonna disrupt that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1728.015s">The</a>  goal to say that the delay in all this is a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1733.718s">We</a>  have capable, qualified firefighters that can step in as an interim chief while this process moves the way it's supposed to in the civil process like we've always done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1755.354s">So</a>  I'll leave you with this, for those people who know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1761.781s">Chief</a>  Sacco, Chief Giliberti, Chief Freeman, Chief Buckley, civil servants, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1768.849s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1770.391s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1771.272s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1772.834s">They've</a>  led our city in some tough times and they've done a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1777.188s">Why</a>  would we even consider, why would we even consider changing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1781.17s">This</a>  shouldn't even be a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1783.951s">So</a>  I appreciate and thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1785.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1797.956s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, we're gonna go to other councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1800.998s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1804.079s">President</a>  Bears, are you able to answer questions if you know the answer?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1807.714s">if</a>  I ask you questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1810.737s">Do</a>  the firefighters have a contract right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1812.538s">Are</a>  they working with a contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1813.419s">My</a>  understanding is yes, there's a signed contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1815.921s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1817.283s">The</a>  change in the designation of the fire chief, what impact would it have on the rank and file firefighters, do you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1822.888s">According</a>  to this proposal, it would not change their civil service status. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1827.152s">It</a>  would just change who is able... It says the law specifically says <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1834.366s">The</a>  section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1837.768s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1838.308s">The</a>  position of fire chief for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1840.269s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1841.41s">So</a>  it wouldn't have an impact on anybody except for the fire chief.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1844.812s">That's</a>  as it's written.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1850.055s">My</a>  understanding is when everybody called out sick at the same time early this month, that since it's the fire department and there can still be fires and disruption and emergencies that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1864.635s">Somebody</a>  will get called in to cover those shifts and those people that get called in get paid overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1873.717s">Do</a>  you know if that's true?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1875.198s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1875.938s">If</a>  you want to direct questions to the administration, we can all speak and then we can hear from the administration if they want to answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1880.859s">That</a>  would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1883.86s">My</a>  belief is that what happens is when you call in sick, then somebody who is not scheduled <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1889.602s">to</a>  work that shift comes in and fills in that shift but gets paid overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1895.106s">And</a>  that is why it was so much more expensive during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1898.629s">So</a>  what appeared to be a coordinated call out meant that it cost a significantly larger amount of money to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1908.356s">The</a>  reason I'm saying this in explicit terms is because I think most people in Medford wouldn't understand that to be the case because at most jobs, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1917.623s">if</a>  you're a shift worker, if you work in retail or restaurant, and you fill in for somebody, you just get paid normal wages that you would be paid on any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1926.367s">But</a>  my understanding is that in the fire department, when you call at six, somebody else comes and fills in that position, but you get paid time and a half or double time something over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1937.511s">I</a>  just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1938.572s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1941.089s">I</a>  think that there is a possibility that if a fire chief comes in who is from a different department, it would have to be somebody who has worked in a fire department and has that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1953.839s">They</a>  would be maybe somebody that would say, oh, hey, maybe if everybody called out sick one day, that would be something that we would have to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1963.479s">that</a>  wouldn't be something I would be comfortable with happening on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1967.622s">Maybe</a>  I wouldn't want everybody to then get paid overtime to make up a coordinated call out, even though we have a contract, even though it's not a strike, even though there is no, there does not seem to be an ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1984.532s">There</a>  doesn't seem to be any reason for that coordinated call out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1990.286s">And,</a>  excuse me, no, no, you may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1993.627s">Alleged?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1994.548s">Let's</a>  not call a coordinated attack.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1996.008s">I'm</a>  not policing anyone's speech here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1997.689s">So</a>  if we could just step back from the podium, and we're gonna, no one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2001.83s">I'll</a>  pose it for you, it's an alleged.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2004.531s">You're</a>  not part of this conversation here, we're not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2006.971s">We're</a>  not gonna go back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2010.773s">And</a>  we're not gonna have outbursts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2011.833s">And</a>  again, I wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2013.874s">Interrupting</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, we're not gonna interrupt other councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2017.015s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2019.69s">What</a>  I'm saying is if there was a fire chief who was not part of civil service and who came in from an outside fire department, I believe that the likelihood of a situation like what happened earlier in February would be much less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2034.124s">I</a>  would, if there's possibility for the administration to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2039.509s">If</a>  you're gonna have conversations, please take them outside.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2042.765s">if</a>  the administration could speak to that, I would appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2045.826s">Just</a>  about the overtime issue is that if you can correct me if I was wrong about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2049.488s">Great,</a>  I have that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2050.368s">We'll</a>  go back to the administration.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2052.689s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2054.91s">Thank</a>  you, and I also ask that I'm just gonna... That's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2060.432s">I'm</a>  just gonna talk, and I'm going to...</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2064.821s">Well,</a>  if folks would not have conversations and not leave the doors open, it's difficult to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2072.212s">It's</a>  difficult to hear in this room when people are shouting, when the doors are open, when there's conversations happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2076.138s">So</a>  I please ask that people respect everyone who's speaking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2081.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2082.471s">So</a>  I got messages from about 30 people opposed to this, including three or four from firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2090.114s">I</a>  ended up having long conversations, you know, with two of those firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2098.558s">I</a>  had dinner with another one on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2101.679s">Friday,</a>  Thursday, and I even went to the South Medford fire station and rang their doorbell and tried to start a conversation with the fellow there who obviously wasn't expecting to talk to a city councilor but the point that I'm getting at is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2119.712s">City</a>  Council, just like the rest of, like many other people in Medford, has been in a bit of an information vacuum about the nature of what's been happening with union negotiations between the mayor and the leadership and the firefighters union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2135.376s">And</a>  so what I'm trying to say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2139.737s">We</a>  didn't really know too much about what was going on behind closed doors compared to the rest of the public until last Thursday when this came onto the agenda and suddenly became in the interest of both parties to put as much information about what's been happening behind closed doors for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2158.476s">as</a>  possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2159.496s">So</a>  I did talk to the I did talk to the mayor, I tried to talk to different firefighters, I tried to get past a lot of the spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2170.458s">A</a>  lot of you know, obviously, during the union negotiations, union contract negotiations, relationships fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2178.88s">And</a>  there's a lot of there's a lot of bad blood that's going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2182.981s">And</a>  I heard a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2185.161s">And</a>  so what I'm going to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2187.982s">What</a>  I'm going to try to do is make my thinking about this as transparent as I possibly can, and so I'm going to say the points that appeal to me most for voting down, and then I'm going to say the points that I see in favor of this, and then I want to listen to public comment after that, and I'm not going to say anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2211.332s">The</a>  point in opposition to this that meant the most to me was the morale in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2216.797s">There</a>  are promotional issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2218.639s">If</a>  you bring in somebody from the outside, firefighters cannot advance in the normal routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2223.763s">I</a>  hear that loud and clear that so I received an email from a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2231.77s">Dan</a>  Craven, and I think he phrased it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2234.931s">He</a>  said, four promotions normally happen in this scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2237.932s">Firefighter,</a>  Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Chief each get promoted to fill the vacancies created by the Fire Chief's retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2243.594s">There</a>  are already established promotional lists for Deputy Chief, Captain, and Lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2247.135s">The</a>  Mayor has instead called upon your Honorable Body to remove the Chief's position from civil service law so that she can hire him outside the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2254.797s">which</a>  would in turn effectively nullify the normal promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2257.659s">I</a>  take that very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2258.88s">He</a>  then goes on to talk about all of the studying that's required for these tests, why they're so difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2266.485s">And</a>  I've also heard about the behavior that from the mayor personally, which obviously didn't appeal to a lot of people during this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2274.39s">What</a>  I'm going to say that I need, if I am going to vote against this, I absolutely need to be convinced of a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2282.355s">First,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2283.536s">the</a>  sick time situation as my colleagues have both brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2288.638s">Now,</a>  I have tried to ask as many firefighters about this as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2294.699s">I</a>  have been told that they actually were sick and I'll be perfectly honest, 21 out of 23 people call in in a day and then they come in later, I don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2308.163s">I'm</a>  just gonna say that I do not believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2313.052s">I</a>  have, otherwise when I try to ask about that, I think that there's some ongoing, you know, potential litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2321.356s">So</a>  people have been advised to not talk to me about what's happening behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2326.279s">And</a>  one in my position in this is that we absolutely cannot have, we cannot have the fire department making the five o'clock news about these issues, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2340.706s">That</a>  is my bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2342.387s">I</a>  understand morale issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2343.567s">I</a>  understand everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2345.188s">I</a>  do not want to see the Medford Fire Department with a culture that encourages these kinds of issues like sick time and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2355.671s">And</a>  if <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2361.016s">If</a>  an outsider can fix the culture that encouraged that, then I would vote for an outsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2371.346s">The</a>  other thing that, the other thing, and this was a fact that was confirmed by both sides, I specifically asked this of both the fire department and of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2381.576s">Now,</a>  one issue is that the civil service <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2385.6s">test</a>  is fair, it allows for promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2388.521s">I</a>  was told about, you know, a situation in 1999, where two people took the promotional exam to go from deputy to fire chief, one of them was less popular, but scored higher, that person became fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2401.843s">This</a>  past time, three to four people signed up to take the exam, only one of them actually took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2410.933s">Okay,</a>  so if you're telling me that it is a competitive process to be fire chief, then that is not something that given that fact that I believe now I have heard I've heard that fact has been confirmed to me by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2428.626s">What</a>  I have heard from <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2431.488s">why</a>  that was from the mayor was that folks wanted to select their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2436.932s">What</a>  I've heard that that was from the fire department is that it is a big decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2443.917s">People</a>  need to talk to their families about whether or not they want to take the advancement exam and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2450.302s">I</a>  even talked to one of the deputy chiefs that signed up for that but did not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2456.766s">But</a>  the point is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2459.503s">It</a>  did not convince me that it was a competitive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2463.909s">So</a>  that being said, the morale issue is something that I do take very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2473.818s">I</a>  don't expect what I just said to appeal to everybody in this room, but my goal here is to make my thinking on this as transparent as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2480.804s">That's</a>  where I'm at with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2482.145s">I've</a>  tried to talk to as many firefighters as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2484.887s">I</a>  hope once all of this blows over, I can hang out with you all some more, maybe do a Q&A session, just try to make City Council a bit more accessible and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2498.678s">But</a>  that's my thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2502.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2508.145s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2509.785s">Members</a>  of the Council, Council Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2514.128s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2516.149s">Thank</a>  you to everybody who's assembled here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2518.87s">I</a>  think this is probably one of the four council chambers that I've seen, and we pack it two or three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2526.583s">Thank</a>  you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2527.544s">I'm</a>  going to keep it pretty short. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2529.406s">I've</a>  had several conversations with several folks around this issue in the past few days, some of whom I know were in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2538.253s">Thank</a>  you for reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2539.234s">I</a>  always appreciate residents and folks who live and work in this community for getting in touch with us directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2544.238s">This</a>  is how this has to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2546.96s">This</a>  is the dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2549.093s">We're</a>  elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.434s">You</a>  live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.995s">You</a>  work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2551.636s">This</a>  is our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.077s">I'm</a>  here to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.778s">I've</a>  tried to, you know, begin that process of listening with the folks who've reached out to me over the past couple days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2561.566s">We've</a>  heard about this over the past several days from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2564.468s">You</a>  know, I am going into this from the perspective of this decision has landed on our desks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2571.355s">I</a>  know that the priority of folks here, the folks who work in service in the interest of public safety, I know what your priority is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2579.281s">Your</a>  priority is the public safety of Medford residents, the people who live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2584.044s">As</a>  an elected representative, that has to be my priority as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2586.585s">I</a>  know that's the priority shared by the committee, by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2589.828s">And</a>  so as we continue to listen and hear from people around this, that's going to be my guiding light is what decision will be in the best interest of executing public safety for Medford residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2601.715s">as</a>  well as possible every single day because of how the department is structured and any decisions that we have the jurisdiction to make around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2608.039s">That</a>  is going to be my lens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2609.72s">I've</a>  said this about other policies before, you know, because it applies to many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2615.104s">With</a>  any decision, what I try to remember, it can't be about <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2619.964s">this</a>  administration or this person in the role right now or this person who's doing the job right now, it's about the department, it's about the community, it's about today, but it's also about five years from now, 10 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2632.594s">It's</a>  always hard not to make these issues personal because we are a community made up of people who know each other and care for each other and sometimes have history with one another, but these decisions can't be made with anything other than that North Star of public safety in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2646.064s">That's</a>  the perspective that I'm going into this with for the rest of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2648.626s">I</a>  look forward to listening and hearing from people about this continuing to hear from constituents and firefighters and the administration and my fellow Councilors about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2658.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2663.615s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2664.015s">I'll</a>  be brief as well because I know a lot of people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2666.337s">I</a>  want to echo Councilor Collins' sentiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2669.759s">I've</a>  spent a lot of the last few days talking to people, catching up on emails and phone calls and haven't been able to reach everyone, especially since I was sick for a few days last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2680.645s">I</a>  think my job here tonight is to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2683.867s">and</a>  to listen to the perspectives in the room and give you all a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2688.43s">And</a>  I have myself questions about this policy, concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2693.974s">And</a>  I think it's important just to recognize that my job tonight is to listen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2701.039s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2702.16s">I</a>  have a question from Councilors for the Administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2703.961s">Are</a>  there any other questions for the Administration from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2708.706s">Oh,</a>  Anna, sorry, Councilor Callaghan, I recognize you, then if folks have questions, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2714.073s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2715.779s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2716.999s">I</a>  want to really thank all of the people who reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2720.42s">I</a>  have received more emails on this topic than I've probably on any other topic and spoken to a number of firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2729.682s">And</a>  honestly, my position on this, I am finding it extremely difficult to believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2740.044s">a</a>  healthy fire department filled with people who want to do their jobs, respect their leaders, and are, you know, doing the best that they can here in Medford in this incredibly difficult job is going to be helped by a process that almost to a T, like every single one of them does not want. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2765.489s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2769.001s">If</a>  we are looking, that is just very difficult for me to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2774.044s">I</a>  want to make sure that whatever process that we have for selecting, and it was very interesting to me to hear, and I really dug into the process and how it has worked in the past, and how people are satisfied with it, and why it is that this particular process that the fire department has builds trust, builds respect, builds a really good, as Councilor Lemmie said, morale, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2798.802s">And</a>  I am finding it very difficult to believe that a process that every firefighter does not want is going to get better leadership into the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2813.288s">So</a>  that's where I start from, but I'm open ears and I'm very interested in hearing from everyone who is here to speak about this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2821.692s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2826.792s">Are</a>  there any questions from members of the council for the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2831.255s">All</a>  right, we have Councilor Lazzaro's question, which was regarding, you can repeat it if you wanna phrase it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2836.96s">Yeah,</a>  my question was if firefighters call out sick and somebody has to come in and fill in for the firefighters that are not in attendance, do the firefighters that have come in to fill in, they get paid overtime, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2854.008s">We</a>  have the chief of staff, the mayor and the HR director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2857.33s">Do</a>  any of you want to field that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2859.251s">You</a>  can raise your hand and I can unmute you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2867.737s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2870.979s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, happily answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2873.461s">Yes,</a>  in fact, it does trigger overtime.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2877.624s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2878.204s">Any</a>  further questions from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2880.586s">For</a>  the administration, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2883.476s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2884.397s">I</a>  said I wasn't gonna talk again, but I remembered a clarifying question that I just wanted to double check before we get further into the weeds on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2890.782s">It's</a>  my understanding from the research and the conversations that I've had so far about this, that this change, if it were to go forward, would not render ineligible any applicant within the fire department that's currently eligible for the role that would just extend the pool wider than it currently is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2908.795s">Can</a>  the administration confirm if that's true?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2912.759s">go</a>  to the chief of staff or go to the mayor has raised her hand, I'll go to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2919.902s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2921.082s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Collins and the committee, the application pool would of course allow internal candidates to apply.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2930.899s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2932.2s">So</a>  a question from Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2935.463s">So</a>  for clarity, now we have within the civil service, there's a process in place that if we hire within through the civil service process, we know exactly what <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2948.553s">the</a>  fiscal point will be when we hire that chief, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2955.076s">We</a>  know exactly there's a formula in place that says firefighters make A, the chief is eligible to make B, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2963.533s">So</a>  if that's correct, we allow to open that up and eliminate civil service, we can have people come in to ask for $200,000 a year, 210,000, 180,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2975.096s">So</a>  they can come in and really inflate that cost in that department, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2984.944s">matter.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2986.665s">Yeah,</a>  that is the current salary, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2988.947s">So</a>  if you took it out of civil service, there would not, it would not be an at will, fire chief, it would be a contracted fire chief from somebody either in the department in the state or even broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3002.237s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3003.678s">That</a>  is the way that it has to be versus last time where four deputies signed up to take the test, only one took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3013.528s">So</a>  it seemed like the chief was handpicked by the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3019.034s">And</a>  that too, that did a disservice to our captains who could have signed up for and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3025.39s">Taken</a>  the test to be a potential candidate But once four signed up it blocked everybody else and you did hear from other people within the department upset with that process, too I'm gonna I think you want the best candidate in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3039.915s">You</a>  had a situation at the beginning of the month Where it cost the city almost a hundred thousand dollars to pay for overtime <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3048.379s">I</a>  think it was not the entire fire department's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3053.803s">I</a>  think it was just a misguided situation that got out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3059.008s">And</a>  it's unfortunate because there are good members of the fire department that should be able to rise up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3065.453s">We</a>  just want to make sure that the best person for this job is the proper candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3073.019s">And</a>  we need to gain some control <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3077.603s">Of</a>  the membership we need to make sure that we're helping people rise rise up with integrity And that we have a respected department versus what we're seeing</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3091.167s">So</a>  thank you, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3092.707s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3093.208s">I</a>  have a follow up then because you said something very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3096.368s">Madam</a>  Mayor, you said that the concern of the overtime because of this so-called concern that you had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3105.151s">Let</a>  me ask you something point blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3107.411s">Are</a>  you not promoting positions that are costing us overtime right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3112.253s">Something</a>  you have control of?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3114.81s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, we promote pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3117.491s">Sometimes</a>  it does take HR a week or two or myself to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3123.154s">We</a>  had a retirement several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3128.016s">It</a>  came before myself and HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3131.217s">I</a>  started to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3133.283s">Hoping</a>  that I could just promote and push that and get that checked off the list But when I went to look to see who who was on the list because it's not an assessment center Like I I wish it was it's whoever's at the top is how we promote within our fire department and that that's all well and good That's how it's it's taken place and how the process has has landed the last several, you know <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3156.676s">I</a>  think since I've been around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3159.119s">But</a>  what we have now is not only a review of what happened the first weekend in February, not because I want to review it, it's because we had people <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3170.722s">21</a>  people call out out of 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3173.243s">I,</a>  as mayor, have an obligation to look into why that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3177.825s">And</a>  it wasn't just Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3179.625s">We</a>  had 12, 13 people call out on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3182.946s">12</a>  or 13 people call out on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3185.767s">Monday</a>  got a little better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3188.141s">Again,</a>  12 or 13 people until we're scrambling to get a legal letter to the union president saying please stop this behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3197.088s">It's</a>  putting the city at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3199.63s">It's</a>  causing $100,000 in overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3202.753s">Overtime</a>  has already been skyrocketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3204.994s">I've</a>  been trying to get control of it and get a review on overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3208.718s">because</a>  I did suspect what the data is showing, we're going to continue to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3213.644s">So</a>  if I have people on that list that should be promoted, that were misguided and happened to take time off during that, what I say is an orchestrated event, I have to take a time out and make sure we're promoting <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3228.587s">Through</a>  this review, investigation, whatever this comes about, I need to make sure that the leaders in the department are going to lead the department with integrity and show their younger members how a department should be led. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3243.833s">and</a>  the behavior that should be in our proud Medford Fire Department who are risking their lives to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3253.038s">It</a>  happened to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3253.919s">Pat</a>  Ripley, he's retired, came in when we had an electrical fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3257.841s">I</a>  will be ever, ever grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3260.202s">I'm</a>  not taking away from what they do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3262.804s">I</a>  respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3264.204s">I</a>  respect the job they do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3266.586s">What</a>  I don't respect is the fact that we have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3269.928s">It</a>  is settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3272.116s">And</a>  there was an orchestrated event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3273.938s">And</a>  I don't know what lesson they were trying to teach me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3277.22s">I</a>  don't know what that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3278.581s">They</a>  just had met with our HR director and our diversity equity inclusion director the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3285.467s">I</a>  said, how did those meetings go? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3287.349s">Everybody</a>  said they went fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3289.23s">They</a>  have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3290.892s">We</a>  have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3291.812s">They</a>  have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3292.393s">But</a>  it went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3293.954s">And</a>  then the next day, there was an orchestrated event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3297.716s">And</a>  I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3299.017s">And</a>  the people in the residents don't deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3301.719s">So</a>  yes, we have a school deficit we have over time, it's out of control in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3306.562s">And</a>  we have an orchestrated event that's making it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3308.643s">And</a>  I, I as mayor have to look into that I have to figure out why that was, and I have to make sure it doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3315.648s">And</a>  I have to</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3319.716s">So</a>  so thank you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3322.517s">I</a>  have some questions because I just think that a contractual obligation as the mayor to to promote an internal candidate that I believe has cost the city over $50,000 to date for overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3340.422s">So</a>  I think that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3341.463s">So</a>  I know that you're making it sound like fluff, but this is something that's going to destroy and divide our city, even more than you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3348.392s">So</a>  you have decided as the mayor of this community to now is becoming investigated the jury and the judge to say that this was orchestrated, and it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3358.364s">Councilor</a>  Leming wants <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3360.226s">our</a>  firefighters to explain something and how they can talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3364.207s">But</a>  you, Madam Mayor, have called this an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3367.068s">So</a>  I don't know what these people can say tonight legally to convince you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3372.89s">And</a>  what I fear tonight is you're going to vote yes on an issue that they have no control to support because the mayor is setting a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3381.452s">There's</a>  history here, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3383.653s">If</a>  this is the first thing this mayor has done, if this is the first thing that you've done that has questioned the support for working men and women in this community, I would say, well, maybe we'd have to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3395.282s">But</a>  is it contractual that these men and women in this department, they are given the right to have sick time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3404.029s">Yes,</a>  they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3406.37s">Now,</a>  as a former teacher, and listen, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3410.239s">If</a>  I can ask the president of the teachers union to ask on a daily basis, how many teachers are off because they're sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3415.144s">I</a>  would say there's probably 60, 70 a day sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3419.649s">So</a>  this isn't crazy, but when you spin the dialogue that's doing something like deceiving, this is what divides this community, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3431.738s">So</a>  until we find out what's going on, so isn't that confusing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3436.623s">They</a>  meet with the HR director the day before and everything's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3441.307s">But</a>  could it be that maybe they're sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3444.39s">Maybe</a>  there's a doubt in anybody's mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3446.312s">Some</a>  have already made comments that they've already judged us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3451.196s">They've</a>  already judged these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3453.561s">And</a>  this is what I find appalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3455.162s">You're</a>  putting the cart ahead of the horse, and it's doing major, major destruction to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3462.485s">You're</a>  saying that you need to do this because of the community, and you have this responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3468.368s">Look</a>  at this responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3469.989s">Your</a>  family's calling you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3472.33s">You're</a>  dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3475.311s">We</a>  have so much more that we need to worry about right now, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3478.293s">Way</a>  too much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3480.174s">To</a>  be dealing with this when we have competent people in place to do this is a waste of our taxpayers' time and taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3501.18s">The</a>  question is, do we have these two questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3505.742s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3506.502s">The</a>  one question is, if she can speak to it, that are you familiar with the amount of money that we're paying because contractually you're not promoting a certain position? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3520.649s">That's</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3522.23s">I</a>  was told today, whether you can speak on it or not, that you might have already offered this position to an outside candidate, whether it's intern or not, if that's the truth, that's against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3534.594s">That's</a>  against a chapter that I don't have in front of me, but I can get it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3539.695s">What</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3542.877s">4238,</a>  so I would question that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3547.7s">And</a>  I think that would, the reason why I think that needs to be figured out, that this council have to understand, is this something prearranged? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3555.987s">Does</a>  the mayor already have somebody in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3558.129s">Because</a>  if she's talking about this transparent process and something that we need in this community, if she's already pre-approved somebody to come in that declined the job today, that should be alarming to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3569.338s">Because</a>  everything she just said means nothing, if that's the truth.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3573.399s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3580.78s">The</a>  questions were about if a position hasn't been promoted and has the position been offered to anyone on an interim or permanent basis?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3592.463s">Yeah,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3594.343s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3596.144s">Councilor</a>  scarpelli referenced 42 38 which is trumped by the city charter The city charter says the mayor has appointing authority to all department heads So yes, I did offer the interim position to a candidate that I thought could really work with the membership as well as how to explain why Something like the beginning of what happened in the beginning of february was just not helpful um <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3621.235s">But</a>  he was somewhat scared away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3624.537s">And</a>  then I believe a statement was put out telling everybody in, I don't know if it was in the state, not to apply for the interim role here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3633.063s">So,</a>  yes, I did offer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3634.304s">And</a>  he no longer will accept the position because he knows he's going to get major pushback if he does accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3643.132s">I</a>  can um, I can turn it over to attorney maser if you want to understand better how the charter trumps 42 38 With regards to just the dividing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3653.014s">Um</a>  I'm not dividing the community whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3657.395s">I</a>  Am trying to get to the bottom of what happened at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3660.876s">I'm</a>  trying to hold those accountable that need accountability <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3665.148s">The</a>  only one that divided is the person that put out the call allegedly to not come to work that weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3671.795s">That</a>  started the division. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3673.537s">I'm</a>  trying to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3675.62s">And</a>  I believe I'm going to turn it over to HR director Lisa Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3679.96s">There</a>  is some overtime costs to not promoting, but I don't see how I can promote people until I have finished our review on what happened, who was involved, and continued the data research that I'm doing that is bringing up some other issues with regards to sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3701.936s">People</a>  do have sick time for when they're sick.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3705.619s">Director</a>  Crowley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3708.796s">Hi,</a>  Mr. President, to the council and all those that are in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3715.481s">There</a>  is a cost of overtime for not hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3717.962s">Unfortunately,</a>  I don't have the paperwork in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3720.264s">If</a>  I knew the question was going to be asked, I would have made sure I was prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3724.306s">But</a>  the mayor is not holding back on the promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3727.648s">What</a>  we're doing is we're making sure that we're going through the civil service process and putting forth the most qualified <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3736.494s">On</a>  the list as civil service process, I'm not sure if, you know, the list comes out, you have your top candidates, depending on where they are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3745.745s">That's</a>  how we hire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3746.666s">And</a>  that's what we will be doing in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3751.152s">But</a>  there is no, there's no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3755.018s">holds</a>  back for any kind of retaliation that, you know, has been stated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3760.461s">It's</a>  that is not been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3762.542s">We</a>  have been working with bringing on five new firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3767.384s">Right</a>  now we're walking through that whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3769.425s">That</a>  too in itself is a massive undertaking through the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3774.788s">So</a>  we are working with the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3776.849s">I</a>  respect the fire department as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3779.17s">I've</a>  had many conversations with President Buckley and Secretary <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3785.532s">of</a>  the union, and we are working through getting the promotions as soon as we can, but we are still working on getting five new firefighters on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3795.518s">And</a>  that again has taken some time there's <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3799.292s">Exams</a>  they have to go through, they have to go through a rigorous process and we're still through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3804.433s">Hopefully</a>  we can get them on board through their required examinations and hopefully get them into an academy sometime within the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3814.035s">We</a>  don't have control over when the academy accepts anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3817.596s">So</a>  once we get all the prerequisites done, then it's up to the academy to tell us when we can get those firefighters in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3826.757s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3828.898s">I'll</a>  just end with this, two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3830.678s">I'll</a>  end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3831.958s">Madam</a>  Mayor, when there was an issue with the gun clip and the place was filled, when you talk about divide, I wish you were here instead of on Zoom, because there are people outside waiting to get in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3845.261s">This</a>  is a dividing issue, whether you want to believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3847.922s">And</a>  second, more importantly, to my fellow councilors, everything the mayor stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3853.263s">everything</a>  she said about equity and having this process, if she's already gone out and handpicked somebody that declined, how true is that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3880.489s">Thank</a>  you, I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3883.37s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3884.912s">Through</a>  you to Councilor Scarapelli, just to be clear, we're talking about an interim appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3890.697s">This</a>  is a normal process in which ensuring that there's leadership in the department for, you know, obviously operational and other important avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3902.649s">it</a>  needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3903.65s">That</a>  is something that the mayor is doing to try to ensure there's good communication between the department, our office, human resources office, all of those things would be incredibly important to have an interim fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3915.995s">There's</a>  no scenario where we wouldn't want an interim in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3919.856s">So</a>  this is an interim on a temporary basis to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3923.658s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3925.051s">So,</a>  if I can, when Chief Sacco left, we had an interim police chief that was capable, an officer I believe was, I forget who it was, but we had, was it Clemente? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3941.523s">The</a>  acting chief who did an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3943.845s">And</a>  I'm sure we had qualified candidates that could be appointed tonight as interim chiefs tonight that weren't part of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3963.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3964.32s">We're</a>  gonna, you know, if there's a response to the administration or any other questions for the administration, we'll go there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3970.844s">Any</a>  other questions from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3973.425s">Anything</a>  you'd like to clarify on your end, Madam Chief of Staff or Madam Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3980.25s">All</a>  right, seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3985.433s">How</a>  many people in this room would like to speak tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3987.194s">Please</a>  raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3990.106s">All</a>  right, that is a reasonable number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=3992.867s">Last</a>  week, two weeks ago, we had over 70 people speak in public comment, so I made a decision as chair to go to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4000.031s">Seeing</a>  that we have about 10 people tonight, we're gonna go by the city council rules, which are five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4005.333s">and</a>  I'm going to ask you, just if you could, we have a piece of paper over there, Mr. Buckley, you can go after. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4011.016s">Just</a>  for the record, we have assistant clerk Sylvina with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4015.418s">Just</a>  for our records, we're asking people to sign up, so we make sure we get your name and your address correct for speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4020.7s">So</a>  I'm gonna start timer, five minutes, I'll give a 30 second warning, and we will go to you, Mr. Buckley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4030.151s">just</a>  a point of information to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4038.115s">A</a>  deputy retired on January 7th, and a promotion can take place the next day or two days after. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4044.278s">January</a>  7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, all the way into February, there was no promotion made on that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4050.141s">So</a>  it had nothing to do with any alleged sick time use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4053.943s">That's</a>  just a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4056.067s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors, and thank you all tonight for your comments so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4060.049s">I'm</a>  here tonight to ask you to vote no on the Mayor's request to move the position of Fire Chief from Civil Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4066.431s">The</a>  following is an excerpt from a white letter written by the late Senator Ken Donnery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4071.693s">The</a>  civil service system was instituted to manage how public employees are recruited, screened for legality and security purposes, trained, disciplined, classified, compensated, promoted, and in some case retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4086.161s">Massachusetts</a>  was one of the first states that passed a merit system in 1883. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4089.143s">History</a>  will show that the implementation of this system became a necessity due to the inefficient workforce that came about because of political and patronage abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4101.11s">Before</a>  the inception of the civil service system, public service was in a serious decay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4105.992s">Outright</a>  corruption was not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4108.353s">The</a>  spore system became an established institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4111.655s">Decisions</a>  on appointments, promotions, and removal of jobs were made solely for political purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4117.817s">The</a>  morale of the workforce was at an all-time low, and a system had to be devised to find a solution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4124.6s">The</a>  solution is to set up a merit system for the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4128.101s">The</a>  merit system removes moralizing influence that political interference usually causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4133.963s">It</a>  ensures that the civil service servant's loyalty is given to the public they serve rather than the politician in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4141.705s">It</a>  gives employees some job security without which no technical or professional officer can do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4148.447s">And</a>  it elevates the civil service workforce to a higher plane of professionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4154.653s">This</a>  process has been a vital pathway for veterans and disabled veterans to obtain gainful and meaningful employment, grounded in a fair selection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4163.299s">Although</a>  the mayor is only asking to remove the fire chief from civil service at this time, make no doubt about it, she will attempt to do the same with future new hires. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4172.205s">Give</a>  an inch and they will take a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4174.667s">This</a>  will allow cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism to creep into our city, all of which is currently being mitigated through the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4185.088s">position</a>  with someone of the mayor's choosing is a detriment to the city and a danger to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4191.813s">Appointed</a>  positions leave the door open to favoritism, coercion, and political patronage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4197.437s">The</a>  chief must be able to stand their ground on the basis of safety, even if it is not a politically favorable position or decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4205.142s">If</a>  appointed, making these decisions become almost impossible for fear of biting the hand that feeds you, or worse, for being terminated for doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4217.284s">The</a>  instability and chaos within a department created by a potentially revolving door for the fire chief's position is unmeasurable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4225.347s">Firefighters</a>  need to have confidence in their leader on the fire ground and administratively, even though he is not OVC eye to eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4233.03s">Our</a>  city, specifically under the current mayor, has had multiple personal scandals involving the hiring, firing, disputes turning into legal battles, and a particularly tumultuous reputation with labor contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4247.247s">There</a>  have been major positions within the city government that have gone vacant for months or even years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4252.816s">The</a>  last thing the city should do is hand over the reins of hiring, firing, and directing of the fire chief to this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4261.167s">Civil</a>  service has and will continue to be that governing body that will establish a set of regulations, timelines, procedures, qualifications to be met as a way to standardize the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4273.295s">Within</a>  our ranks, we have decades of experience on the fire ground and a profound understanding of departmental procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4281.401s">These</a>  members have an intimate knowledge of the unique city infrastructure, the layout and size, and most importantly, respect for our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4290.592s">Our</a>  union and the membership of this department are invested in the well-being of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4295.773s">Our</a>  investment is built on the oath we take as firefighters to do all we can for our city and the people who call us in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4303.654s">We</a>  only ask that you, the city, provide us with the necessary tools, equipment, and facilities and confidence to let us work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4310.956s">Today,</a>  it was very troubling to hear that the mayor had offered the chief to someone outside the city of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4317.987s">Her</a>  decision was made unilaterally, without regard for this city charter, and has complete disregard for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4324.972s">its</a>  opinion or results of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4328.975s">The</a>  members of this council here today ran for office on the platform that fights for the people of Medford basic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4336.522s">While</a>  supporting local labor with a quote from the platform reading, we commit to supporting local labor unions, keeping public jobs public by rejecting outsourcing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4347.571s">30</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4348.191s">We</a>  ask that the council acknowledge that we, as a union, feel that outsourcing a job that has always been hired from a pool of long-time and heavily invested members is damaging and goes against the ideal of this department, and we'd assume the ideals of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4365.216s">We</a>  hope that this council declines the motion to hire a chief from outside the department, outside our union, and outside our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4373.399s">Please</a>  keep politics out of public safety.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4396.041s">As</a>  has been our principle, I'm going to go to Guy Manganiello on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4402.703s">You</a>  can speak for five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4404.564s">Please</a>  give your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4407.184s">And</a>  the hand is gone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4408.265s">I'm</a>  gonna ask you to unmute if you're on mute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4417.048s">Apologies,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4420.931s">I</a>  was looking at speaking this evening, but not particularly on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4425.774s">When</a>  you had asked the question, you had asked if anybody planned on speaking this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4428.816s">So</a>  that was the- Thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4433.479s">All</a>  right, we'll go to Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4435.961s">Name</a>  and address for the record, and you'll have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4438.602s">Bob</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4439.743s">Mary's</a>  Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4442.105s">Again,</a>  I think it might be what's up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4445.448s">Tap</a>  the microphone base. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4446.669s">I</a>  think it shut off.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4450.288s">Here</a>  we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4451.689s">I</a>  am embarrassed to be here in front of the council for these issues.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4456.252s">I'd</a>  like to address some of the city council's comments, concerns and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4460.395s">First</a>  of all, second of all, we in this union as professionals try to keep our issues in house and internal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4469.081s">Apparently</a>  the mayor doesn't agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4471.723s">So</a>  here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4473.144s">Let's</a>  get them all out there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4475.005s">Mr.</a>  Leming asked about the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4481.71s">I'm</a>  sorry, it was a question again to refresh my memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4483.692s">There's</a>  so many things that I'd like to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4486.836s">Councilor</a>  Leming, if you'd like to clarify and I'll pause your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4489.338s">So,</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4494.062s">The</a>  two things that I brought up were first off the issue of the sick time abuse that occurred in early February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4500.545s">The</a>  point that I was bringing up was that I <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4522.819s">need</a>  to be convinced that whatever future leader that is hired, is appointed, does not lead the fire department to a position where they're making the five o'clock news in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4539.645s">That</a>  to me is the bottom line behind, like even beyond a lot of the morale issues that have been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4547.528s">My</a>  perspective is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4552.045s">doing</a>  this would lead to people thinking that they could never make it to the top, which obviously affects motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4560.568s">But</a>  at the same time, if you bring an outside officer to lead a new unit, that is more effective at inducing culture change than having somebody that has spent their entire career in that particular body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4580.956s">So</a>  I have not seen anything that can convince me that the current civil service process will effectively address any sick time abuse issues that are currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4599.929s">That's</a>  where I'm at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4608.268s">And</a>  I don't think this was another point that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4610.889s">It</a>  wasn't necessarily a question, but it was kind of supporting that point was the fact that there was one person who actually took the exam this past time to go from deputy to higher chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4625.814s">And</a>  so I don't want to speculate as to the reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4629.195s">Four</a>  people signed up, one person took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4631.255s">That</a>  is a fact that has been established by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4633.716s">But</a>  to me, that is evidence against <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4637.117s">the</a>  idea that the civil service position, when applied every single promotional round, would actually hire competitive leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4650.68s">Those</a>  were the specific points that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4653.72s">Now,</a>  to my colleague's point about, you know, potential litigation here, I do respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4662.622s">I</a>  do respect that this is not something that firefighters of the union can necessarily speak directly to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4672.849s">Again,</a>  I have asked folks that I can find, and they typically have referred me to either representatives from the union or union lawyers, which that's the response that I've gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4688.584s">Those</a>  are my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4690.184s">That</a>  is the result of where... That's the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4694.986s">Basically,</a>  to summarize, if an outside leader can keep the fire department from making the news with corruption allegations in the future, then I will be voting for an outside leader.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4705.709s">To</a>  refresh my memories... I'll put you back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4711.47s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4711.911s">What's</a>  the clarification?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4712.611s">Who</a>  went to the news?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4715.492s">The</a>  early...</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4727.029s">That's</a>  a fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4742.239s">So</a>  I think the nature of the point of who went to the news is like, okay, so it was the mayor that presented the news release there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4753.367s">And</a>  I thought about that too, like clearly the idea here is the mayor, like, there's the sick time issue that happened, the mayor brought that to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4766.976s">And</a>  so, this absolutely is a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4771.459s">The</a>  mayor brings something to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4773.621s">It</a>  is public points against the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4777.544s">There's</a>  totally political maneuvering here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4780.986s">Here's</a>  the thing, if the fire department is gonna do that, you can't put yourselves in a position where somebody can give your actions to a local news source and it's worth reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4794.082s">Okay,</a>  does that make sense?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4796.886s">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4797.847s">I</a>  was surprised that you covered it, actually, with everything else that's going on in the city, the country, and the world, that our staffing issues was the second lead news story on the... <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4811.264s">on</a>  the 5 o'clock rules.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4813.826s">If</a>  I may, I'd like to avoid further back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4816.887s">I</a>  appreciate the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4818.168s">I</a>  don't think we wanted to go on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4819.329s">We</a>  don't want to hear from everybody, but I appreciate you asking, Mr. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4823.931s">I'll</a>  go back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4824.652s">I</a>  think we have a clear understanding of what to respond to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4827.153s">I'd</a>  like to answer all questions as far as the exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4831.475s">As</a>  far as the exam, the deputy chief that took the exam, Chief Friedman, passed the exam, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4837.159s">So</a>  obviously, he studied and has a knowledge base to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4840.02s">As</a>  far as people not going to the exam and not taking the test, I don't know where that information came from, because I wasn't there, and I would dispute any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4849.084s">As</a>  far as Councilor, I think it's Councilor Lazzaro, your comments, with the staffing we've been in my 23 years on this department, if we had sufficient staffing, then we wouldn't have had a hire all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4863.37s">We</a>  have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4871.152s">We</a>  haven't hired a firefighter in 15 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4873.753s">In</a>  that time, we've had approximately 10 retirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4877.274s">So</a>  who's looking at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4879.254s">We</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4880.155s">Apparently,</a>  nobody else cares about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4882.475s">Going</a>  back to the deputy chief that's not promoted, the deputy chief that's not promoted is causing another deputy chief to work overtime in his spot whenever he's supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4892.558s">That's</a>  to the tune of about $45,000 at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4896.659s">Going</a>  back to the other promotional issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4899.972s">A</a>  chief leaving the department happens every day all across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4904.816s">Common</a>  procedure is to make the senior deputy chief interim chief until a search can be done and a permanent chief can be completed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4913.524s">We</a>  have two deputies right here that could be named chief tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4917.408s">We</a>  have five deputies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4925.725s">There's</a>  five deputies that have over 20 years experience that could go into the job, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4932.291s">No</a>  problem at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4935.614s">There</a>  are just so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4936.455s">We</a>  don't have a city solicitor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4938.056s">How</a>  many open jobs out there in the city right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4941.379s">Many,</a>  many jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4943.06s">I</a>  understand the mayor is an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4945.763s">Is</a>  there a city solicitor's job that's open? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4948.405s">It</a>  has been for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4950.58s">So</a>  she's in the field, and she can't hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4954.161s">But</a>  she's going to go outside and hire a chief for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4957.723s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4965.325s">And</a>  the comments that we do have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4967.166s">Yes,</a>  we do have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4968.726s">We</a>  had some negotiations with the team that's on Zoom for approximately three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4974.748s">And</a>  only when we decided to go to arbitration, we got a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4979.864s">All</a>  the units in this room have to go to arbitration for a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4984.208s">We</a>  can't sit in a room and talk to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4987.37s">It's</a>  not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4988.111s">It's</a>  not done with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4990.693s">I'm</a>  glad to see the mayor was at least here on Zoom, but she didn't come to any of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4995.236s">We</a>  have to have a back and forth with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5002.731s">So</a>  as far as the city solicitor goes, one of the duties of the city solicitor is to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5011.662s">Is</a>  that one of the things that they do?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5013.834s">Yeah,</a>  who does that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5015.115s">We</a>  put one in- Public records officers, Janice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5018.316s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5018.616s">Well,</a>  we put them in and it went unfilled, as all these other units have in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5023.899s">They</a>  go unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5024.9s">They</a>  have to be, we have to file a complaint with the attorney general's office to get the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5030.483s">The</a>  information that we had to get is for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5034.265s">$825,000</a>  had been expended at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5044.326s">was</a>  ever on a Zoom call, would anybody like to comment or update that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5049.267s">Because</a>  I'm sure it's well over a million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5051.288s">If</a>  you want to talk about money and wasting of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5055.629s">And</a>  we've had many cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5057.65s">How</a>  much open litigation is it with the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5059.93s">What</a>  is the value, the exposure of the lawsuits that the city is going to lose in the near future because of their actions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5070.073s">KP</a>  Law, I don't know the case that they've won. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5073.763s">Can</a>  you update that to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5075.805s">Anybody</a>  on Zoom?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5079.488s">I</a>  don't have the answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5081.09s">I'd</a>  love to get it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5082.371s">I</a>  will give the administration- I'd love to get it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5084.653s">Another</a>  thing is open meeting violation requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5088.437s">If</a>  you're the city council and that's a legal opinion, what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5091.199s">Do</a>  you call KP law? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5093.562s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5095.283s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5097.759s">and</a>  clear that they do not work for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5100.061s">Special</a>  council, special council status.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5102.743s">The</a>  current process is that we reach out to the mayor, the chief of staff, and KP Law when we need legal support.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5109.889s">Through</a>  the chair, so council president's right, if there's an issue right now and we need a legal representation, we don't know, we would have to ask if KP Law was on, and most of the time they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5120.977s">So</a>  we don't have anybody onsite ready to help us if we have issues, which would put us in some, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5127.202s">really</a>  bad situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5128.463s">So</a>  it's denying you the opportunity to get a legal opinion, which is denying you the ability to do your job.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5134.808s">It's</a>  delaying, I would say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5136.849s">Have</a>  you got one that was fulfilled?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5138.971s">We</a>  have had legal representation at several times when we requested it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5142.133s">All</a>  right, well, I'm glad they're being fulfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5144.575s">The</a>  other thing is taking the chief out of civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5147.438s">It's</a>  clearly a reaction to the mayor being upset about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5152.902s">I</a>  mean, you have people <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5156.286s">In</a>  this city, in this department, our contract states we will promote by civil service laws and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5164.71s">That's</a>  what it is, like it or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5167.172s">Mr.</a>  Jones, you have about 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5169.373s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5170.153s">I</a>  could be here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5171.494s">But</a>  the other thing is that when you hire an outside person, which I know the person that she's offered the job to, she's already been somewhere and been let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5182.895s">people</a>  have a buy-in, people that are in this department, in this city, they have loyalty, they have a buy-in, they have institutional knowledge, they have ties to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5192.659s">You</a>  go outside the city, where apparently that's okay in this administration, there are people that aren't from Medford, and apparently don't care about Medford, have no ties, no loyalty, just a job, when it's over, they'll go, and whatever happens, happens.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_59]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5209.225s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Bowen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5219.221s">I</a>  do have, Mr. Kennedy, if you just give me a moment, we have the Chief of Staff has a hand raised, Madam Chief of Staff on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5227.859s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5231.778s">Several</a>  things that were stated I feel the need to address first and foremost We've said many times before here and in other forums one-on-one with city Councilors We're not going to get into a scenario where we get into back and forth discussion on collective bargaining but one thing is very clear and I want to make sure that the council knows this because <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5252.779s">You</a>  know, perhaps the narrative tonight from the union is convenient that we don't meet with the union, but in fact, we do have many meetings with the union on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5262.342s">The</a>  union meets with our human resources department, the human resources director with legal involved as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5268.844s">The</a>  union meets with the mayor when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5272.425s">The</a>  union has reached out to the mayor and the mayor has responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5275.505s">The</a>  mayor has reached out to the union in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5277.946s">There</a>  have been many meetings over the course of my time as chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5281.207s">So</a>  I don't want anyone to be under the impression that there haven't been one-on-one meetings with the mayor during negotiations on the side to try to attempt to resolve negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5291.078s">I</a>  realize that was an arduous road, but I just want to be clear about that one fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5295.313s">As</a>  far as how much the city has spent on legal counsel, legal counsel has, the numbers that were presented tonight must be for multiple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5304.059s">And</a>  as we've shared with the prior counsel, I realize new Councilors may not have this information, so sharing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5309.563s">I</a>  know that existing Councilors have this information, but we have spent approximately $450,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5316.948s">We</a>  also did a survey of 16 communities in our nearby area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5321.872s">And</a>  of those 16 communities, we only, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5325.274s">We</a>  only had our numbers and their numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5330.138s">And</a>  when we did that, we found that we were the third lowest in total cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5336.222s">We</a>  have that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5337.203s">We</a>  shared it with the prior council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5338.704s">We're</a>  happy to share it with this current council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5341.443s">also</a>  um many times I know the council knows this but for the purposes of addressing an issue that came up earlier many times council chairs reach out to kp law directly as well not saying that the procedure isn't as was presented again tonight and but we are working with the council I believe I hope the council is you know generally feeling like kp law is responsive I believe they are um <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5365.345s">And</a>  they sometimes go to KP Law directly and schedule dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5369.528s">And</a>  I'm just copied on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5370.609s">I</a>  don't interfere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5371.37s">I</a>  don't have anything to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5372.491s">It</a>  gets completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5373.992s">And</a>  then finally, a comment about someone coming into this community who's already been let go from another place, that's beyond reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5384.16s">The</a>  reality is we're looking at retired individuals, not somebody who's been asked to leave another community or terminated from another community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5392.026s">We're</a>  asking for seasoned professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5394.688s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5396.803s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5398.284s">We</a>  will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5399.304s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5400.965s">Five</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5401.986s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5402.506s">My</a>  name is Thomas Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5403.727s">I'm</a>  a resident of 53 Irving Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5406.789s">Long</a>  time ties to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5407.949s">I've</a>  been here over 27 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5409.35s">I'm</a>  also the vice president of the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5413.112s">And</a>  before I delve into my remarks, I just want to address a couple of the issues I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5417.715s">The</a>  mayor made a statement that overtime is out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5421.397s">Overtime</a>  is out of control, just to reiterate what <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5425.839s">Bobby</a>  Jones said, the city of Medford Fire Department is budgeted right now for 124 firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5432.981s">There</a>  are currently 102 firefighters on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5436.782s">Those</a>  extra 22 firefighters would go a long way to reducing the amount of overtime cost in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5442.164s">Number</a>  two, I think we're getting mixed up with the sick leave issue and taking the chief out of civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5448.266s">Those</a>  are two dramatically different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5450.726s">Taking</a>  the chief out of civil service <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5456.244s">is</a>  a reaction to what has happened here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5459.106s">But</a>  things are getting out of control because maybe morale is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5461.968s">I</a>  don't know what the exact issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5463.909s">But</a>  these two, these are two different automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5467.131s">I've</a>  been on the fire department myself for almost 37 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5470.072s">I've</a>  been elected union official for over 33 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5472.734s">I</a>  know a little bit about civil service and the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5475.996s">And</a>  right now we're going through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5477.677s">What</a>  we have to do in order to take the chief out of civil service, the board has to petition the courts, the general courts, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5484.921s">Senate</a>  and the House of Representatives for a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5488.944s">It</a>  has to be voted here, then it has to be approved and brought forward and voted in the House and Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5495.689s">This</a>  hasn't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5497.19s">It</a>  hasn't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5497.931s">It</a>  hasn't gone through the council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5500.393s">So</a>  until then, that is still a civil service position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5503.976s">And</a>  the mayor, I wish we had a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5507.338s">The</a>  mayor has no right to offer that job outside of civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5510.861s">And</a>  she's already done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5519.944s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me my time to address the body regarding civil service and how important it is to keep the fire chief in civil service in order to be an effective fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5530.892s">You</a>  have to have intimate knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5533.614s">Of</a>  the city that you were going to be working in in your community and Medford, not like unlike other communities, has unique challenges facing the fire service that require the chief to beware of many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5544.762s">The</a>  layout and the design of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5547.903s">all</a>  the Title III facilities that house dangerous and hazardous materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5552.106s">They</a>  need to know about large warehouses with heavy fire loads, mercantile as well as manufacturing companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5558.289s">They</a>  also need to know about special buildings, not limited to elderly housing, high rises, schools, bio labs, and of course, let's not forget the large campus that we have, Tufts University, which has a number of hazardous materials and bio labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5573.315s">Medford</a>  also has a very complicated water delivery system that we need to have to provide our citizens with protection with proper water pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5583.865s">The</a>  way this is set up, the chief has to know how this water pressure affects different fires and how they use their resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5592.633s">This</a>  is something that only a Medford chief that has many, many years of experience is going to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5600.151s">They</a>  also need to utilize the resources that best meets the demands of the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5605.096s">And</a>  one of those resources is our personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5608.719s">The</a>  chief needs to have an understanding of the fire company officers and the firefighters, their special <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5615.706s">certificates</a>  that they have their years of experience, their knowledge, the areas that they grew up in, that they have a very intimate knowledge of the areas that they're providing serious service, where they may be working in the area they grew up, and they know every single street, every single building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5632.784s">And</a>  the same thing that deputy chiefs, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5634.426s">They're</a>  working right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5635.826s">They've</a>  had many, many thousands of calls to different parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5639.888s">They're</a>  in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5641.088s">They</a>  have knowledge of the layout of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5643.089s">They</a>  have knowledge of the layout of these larger buildings that have dangers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5648.29s">They</a>  know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5650.291s">And</a>  we need to have a professional, experienced fire chief coming within the ranks so they have that institutional knowledge that you'll never get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5660.014s">You'll</a>  never get that from somebody coming from outside the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5665.185s">in</a>  about 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5666.266s">Okay,</a>  I'm going to finish up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5668.869s">Any</a>  chief that works to appease just the mayor, instead of working to keep its firefighters and the citizen safe is going to be ineffective and dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5677.498s">metric</a>  fire department is fortunate enough right now to have multiple fire deputies in its ranks that are willing and able to take over leadership roles department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5685.007s">There's</a>  no reason <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5686.448s">other</a>  than politics right now to remove this position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5690.33s">Now's</a>  the time for level heads to prevail, put politics aside and open up a dialogue that's going to help resolve the issues that we have between the administration and labor in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5699.993s">Not</a>  just the fire labor, labor in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5702.895s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5715.407s">Mr.</a>  Jones, we're gonna let everybody who's had a chance, we wanna hear from everybody if you wanna speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5719.712s">Just</a>  to rebuttal on those comments of the chief of staff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5722.475s">I'm</a>  giving everyone five minutes, but once we've gone through everyone who likes to speak, once we can hear folks again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5728.701s">Is</a>  there someone who'd like to speak next? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5731.244s">Write</a>  your name down, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5733.266s">And</a>  if you have spoken or would like to speak, please give your name to the city messenger.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5741.476s">Bill</a>  Young, 110 Lincoln Road, also a member of the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5744.578s">Thank</a>  you for the council for hearing us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5747.02s">Thank</a>  you for everybody for coming, standing up for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5750.802s">I</a>  just wanted to talk on keeping the chief's position in civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5754.845s">I</a>  thought of three reasons to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5756.446s">I</a>  thought I was gonna have two minutes, so I put together two minutes of... I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5761.729s">Could</a>  have went on and on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5763.21s">First</a>  of all, safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5765.779s">person</a>  at the top makes those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5767.44s">They</a>  make policy and it's disseminated through the ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5771.403s">And</a>  if you have an appointed person to a politician, I just don't have the faith that they're gonna find the right person for that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5782.231s">As</a>  some of these gentlemen said, that it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5789.235s">It's</a>  everything in this job is about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5790.915s">It's</a>  the safety of the fire community, as well as the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5794.236s">That's</a>  our priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5795.056s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5796.817s">Number</a>  two is integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5799.978s">Civil</a>  service provides a checks and balances system so that you can make the best decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5806.639s">It</a>  levels the playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5808.96s">And</a>  I've seen what an appointee can do in this city, and it's not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5818.152s">We've</a>  had issues with different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5820.894s">I've</a>  had issues with different departments and an appointee is not gonna do the trick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5826.317s">You</a>  need somebody who knows the city and can do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5829.718s">The</a>  third point I wanted to make was upward mobility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5832.88s">It's</a>  important to have a person at the top level that gives you something to attain. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5840.945s">When</a>  you open these books and you start studying, it's a lot of work and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5847.248s">And</a>  you have to have that one position that you can strive for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5850.551s">And</a>  you might not make it, you might not do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5852.693s">But</a>  every day you open those books, it makes you a better firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5856.016s">And</a>  I think that would be taken away if this is taken out of civil service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5859.82s">I</a>  just want to say, you got one minute, 54 seconds, so you aced it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5870.63s">All</a>  right, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5871.131s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5878.001s">the</a>  fire chief position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5879.321s">Um</a>  as a Medford resident and a wife of Deputy Chief William Young, you just met.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5882.942s">He</a>  I see <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5907.489s">Like</a>  this shows the commitment and the dedication that this family has. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5911.971s">However,</a>  the current efforts of the mayor wreak the worst kind of backhanded political power play you can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5921.394s">Her</a>  actions are born out of revenge, and it's not what we elected her to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5928.775s">As</a>  a mother of children who attend Medford schools, I recognize there is a movement to eradicate bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5935.367s">This</a>  is difficult when the nucleus of this behavior happens on a regular basis right here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5953.044s">As</a>  my mother instilled in me and my sisters when we were growing up, treat others the way you want to be treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5959.226s">Thank</a>  you for your time and consideration, and I please ask you to vote no and help keep the integrity of the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5966.628s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5976.63s">Who</a>  would like to speak at the podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5980.471s">Do</a>  we have anyone else to speak at the podium?</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6123.299s">I'm</a>  not sure anyone really does, because I'm not sure anyone's walked in their shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6126.74s">Just</a>  like I and she probably do not understand the complexity of others and their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6132.421s">So</a>  we try every day to make sure we do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6135.744s">We</a>  also want to make sure that everyone understands that this is a simple modification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6142.71s">We're</a>  looking to remove the fire chief's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6145.572s">That's</a>  all from the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6148.474s">Allow</a>  this community to build a process that's robust and has the control of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6153.578s">There</a>  are many communities that have gone this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6156.141s">Most</a>  recently, there have been communities that have gone in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6159.283s">In</a>  fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6160.504s">There</a>  are the city of lemonster recently went in this direction november 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6165.128s">They</a>  removed the captain and the fire chief from the civil service process President Bears if you call me out of order, I will stop speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6176.377s">But</a>  until then I will continue to speak sir show some basic respect Greenfield recently removed their um <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6186.438s">police</a>  and fire chiefs from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6189.386s">Chelmsford</a>  is in the process of removing their deputy fire chief and the chief was already out prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6195.026s">Needham</a>  removed their fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6197.428s">Hopedale</a>  is in the process of, Needham and Hopedale are in the process of removing their fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6201.551s">Rentham</a>  is removing their deputy fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6203.632s">The</a>  chief was removed in 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6204.753s">This</a>  is not new work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6208.536s">This</a>  is an important step to ensure that this community can select the best candidate and a candidate that has opportunities to be selected from a wide range. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6218.343s">This</a>  would bring <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6219.464s">any</a>  opportunities for review on the process and ensure that this community can select candidates that are also outside of just one pigeon-held, very stringent process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6233.433s">Again,</a>  I don't know where this word revenge comes from, but it's so far from the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6238.756s">I</a>  wouldn't work for a community where my supervisor was seeking revenge on anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6243.158s">There</a>  is no such thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6244.698s">To</a>  be clear, I would not put my name in a community like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6249.08s">And</a>  to anyone who thinks otherwise, I'm happy to have a meeting with you because I can't even understand those words. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6256.084s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6282.75s">Okay,</a>  and let's stay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6285.651s">Just</a>  to the individual that was off at the chief shop was chief in another community, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6313.189s">Mr.</a>  Jones, I mean, we're not gonna get in direct questions back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6315.63s">I'm</a>  just asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6316.31s">I</a>  mean, I'm just wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6317.07s">The</a>  chief of staff was not the first chief of staff, no.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6320.19s">Oh,</a>  okay, all right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6321.091s">That</a>  seems to be business as usual here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6325.051s">So,</a>  and again, I apologize for having to hear these comments, but the mayor wanted to go public with these things, so here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6333.793s">The</a>  mayor has not been to one bargaining session that I have been at. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6336.874s">I'm</a>  on the bargaining team. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6337.974s">She</a>  has not been to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6340.199s">There</a>  has been a revolving door of bargaining people at the sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6344.061s">You're</a>  going to see, if you talk to every other union in the city, it's the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6350.145s">Business</a>  as usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6352.006s">Nothing</a>  gets done until you file paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6357.013s">just</a>  a few words about Chief Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6358.774s">Probably</a>  one of the smartest guys I ever met. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6360.574s">Lived,</a>  breathed, and ate the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6364.476s">All</a>  he ever wanted to do, 100% commitment to this fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6369.157s">Once</a>  he came back from meeting with the mayor, he doesn't even want to work there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6373.398s">He's</a>  trying to paint it as us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6375.199s">It</a>  absolutely is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6376.94s">Look</a>  at the wounded soldiers from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6380.641s">A</a>  lot of turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6382.821s">Not</a>  in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6384.755s">Could</a>  you please leave the fire department, public safety up to the firefighters?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6390.237s">And</a>  one question, people are gonna hire a chief for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6394.338s">Does</a>  anybody know what our schedule is? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6396.379s">Somebody</a>  who's gonna pick the chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6398.66s">What's</a>  our schedule?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6401.121s">Personnel</a>  director, KP Law, the mayor, what's our schedule?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6405.422s">We're</a>  not gonna go into the direct back and forth, but I appreciate the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6408.324s">I</a>  don't think anybody knows.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6414.883s">I'd</a>  like to alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6416.786s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_56]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6425.586s">I'm</a>  Eleanor O'Leary, 30 Norwood Circle, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6429.969s">I</a>  am Secretary of the Teachers Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6432.45s">I</a>  would just like to state to the Chief of Staff, I sat in numerous negotiations for a few years, and we only saw the mayor once when we went to operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6446.118s">So</a>  I'm sure I'm just wondering where <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6451.84s">this</a>  mayor was during our negotiations and where the school committee was during negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6459.062s">They</a>  never showed up once until we were told we were going to arbitration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6464.483s">So</a>  I would like to know where you say you met with the unions numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6470.485s">I</a>  sat in on every negotiation and no one sat in with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6477.547s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6486.192s">Ricky,</a>  call me at 150 Middle Six Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6488.734s">I</a>  don't know much about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6489.714s">I'm</a>  not a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6490.635s">I</a>  didn't even know much about it till tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6494.177s">But</a>  from what I've heard, it just sounds like this is a punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6497.559s">It</a>  sounds like something happened that the mayor thinks happened anyways, an organized call-out, and now they're being punished by removing the top position in the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6506.184s">It</a>  seems like a pretty significant punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6509.099s">and</a>  just being trying to pass it off as we're trying to broaden our search and make it more available for more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6514.445s">But</a>  it's ultimately, it's just a punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6516.848s">And</a>  even most of your questions that revolve around, was this because of a sick call? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6521.693s">Was</a>  this an organized call? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6524.569s">Is</a>  this the appropriate punishment to remove the chief to have to go to the state house and have a home rule petition and completely remove a position? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6531.312s">That's</a>  a pretty significant punishment for a couple of guys calling out one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6535.673s">Like,</a>  I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6537.274s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6538.694s">Seems</a>  really a really tough punishment to lay down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6543.296s">Treating</a>  them like children, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6545.517s">Grown</a>  men and women that protect your city every day and you're treating them like children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6548.898s">You</a>  did this bad thing and now you lose your chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6552.079s">That's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6553.1s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6564.087s">anyone</a>  who hasn't spoken yet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6565.588s">I</a>  don't think you have, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6566.729s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6567.81s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6569.551s">John</a>  Souza, 359 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6573.794s">I</a>  wasn't originally gonna speak on this particular topic, but I think, you know, luckily, Ricky and Eleanor gave a resident's perspective on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6585.723s">But</a>  it clearly seems, and I've heard a word that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6591.101s">doesn't</a>  really sit well with me that was used earlier, control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6597.003s">This</a>  is a department that does not need to be controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6604.466s">That</a>  is an unnecessary response to a situation that simply takes place in all facets of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6616.511s">People</a>  get sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6618.331s">Again,</a>  we are muddling two separate issues into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6623.393s">So</a>  because control cannot be had, we will now take control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6629.514s">I</a>  disagree with this fundamentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6631.495s">And</a>  I think that this council specifically needs to understand, they need to deeply understand that a vote yes here <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6642.978s">is</a>  a direct slap in the face of the entire room and the people that support this city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6664.183s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6665.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6670.929s">Is</a>  there anyone who has not spoken yet who'd like to speak before I come back to someone to speak a second time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6676.693s">Mr.</a>  Merritt, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6677.494s">Mr.</a>  Merritt, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6679.495s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6680.156s">Sure</a>  thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6680.596s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6683.118s">I</a>  have to agree with the last speaker, and that was my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6685.359s">Sorry,</a>  this is so full that we got another separate room watching on the video.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6690.963s">Glad</a>  we could do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6692.478s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6694.741s">When</a>  I'm starting to hear questions about, well, how would you guarantee, how would this, how would that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6699.186s">The</a>  position of fire chief is it's a leadership position, but it's not a dictator and it's not a king. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6705.293s">Okay,</a>  all the men and women here are going to work for that person, and they give orders on a fire ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6711.018s">But</a>  you know, there's the emergency time, there's incident, you know, commanders and management that happens, versus them, there's the administrative and personnel side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6719.767s">So</a>  let's say hypothetically, that whatever happened with sick time, this and that happened again, do you expect the fire chief to be able to sit there and unilaterally go, you're fired? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6729.875s">Does</a>  that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6730.575s">Does</a>  that happen in any leadership position that you know of? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6733.876s">And</a>  through the chair to Councilor Leming, I mean, do you think that happens in the military? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6738.738s">I</a>  expect you know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6742.239s">It</a>  doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6743.539s">So</a>  it's kind of a conflated issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6745.6s">Whatever</a>  happened with sick time and this and that is completely separate from what to do with civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6751.101s">This</a>  seems very reactionary on its face. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6754.342s">And</a>  you all know me, I've been here for over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6757.506s">I</a>  try to weigh in with logical, you know, logic on some of these things and be very balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6762.89s">This</a>  appears and smells reactionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6766.333s">When</a>  do you install a sprinkler system in a building, before or after the fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6771.757s">They</a>  know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6774.259s">You</a>  do it before the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6775.56s">So</a>  if you're putting out a fire now, right, it's kind of too little too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6779.664s">This</a>  is the wrong time for this particular topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6782.346s">It</a>  doesn't mean you shouldn't necessarily address it in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6785.981s">But</a>  why are you doing it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6789.065s">Because</a>  the opportunity presented itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6790.647s">Well,</a>  okay, but now's not the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6794.373s">When</a>  would you rather buy a car? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6797.317s">Do</a>  you buy a car when your old one's crapped out or do you proactively think, you know, maybe I should upgrade while I still have wheels? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6804.997s">So</a>  before you make your decision, reactionary, maybe consider this in a proactive manner, maybe revisit it and table it, but now is not the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6814.386s">This</a>  stinks to high heaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6816.028s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6824.246s">Nate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6825.106s">Hey,</a>  Nate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6826.326s">Could</a>  you just put your name down? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6827.247s">We</a>  have a sign in list for this one so we get the records right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6832.448s">The</a>  clerk's not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6833.908s">We</a>  have assistant clerk Sylvia DePlaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6837.128s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6838.309s">You</a>  haven't spoken yet, Ms.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6839.389s">Ellis,</a>  so I'd like to take you first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6841.189s">I'm</a>  trying to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6842.389s">We'll</a>  go to you, and then we'll go to Jess Healy on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6845.61s">I'm</a>  keeping a stack in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6846.51s">We</a>  also have the chief of staff who wants to speak a third time, but we'll let him speak a second time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6946.788s">How</a>  dear and how insulting is this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6956.861s">I</a>  have lived in the city since I was in the second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6963.063s">And</a>  I really am ashamed to say that this is my city and my hometown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6970.866s">I</a>  am beyond ashamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6972.927s">We</a>  finally, the pet group, are meeting with the mayor on March 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6981.257s">Your</a>  whole pet group, which is the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6985.46s">We've</a>  been negotiating with our insurance contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6989.343s">Of</a>  course, we're under Chapter 19, so it just rolls over, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=6993.485s">But</a>  we are finally meeting with her on March 6th, because we demanded it, finally, for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7001.111s">So</a>  please, stop insulting us, stop lying, and stop pretending. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7008.598s">We</a>  took a vote of no confidence on this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7012.859s">Is</a>  the next vote of no confidence from every union going to be on the mayor, the school committee, and the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7020.481s">Do</a>  what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7021.861s">You</a>  were elected to represent these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7025.262s">Do</a>  what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7026.903s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7252.301s">to</a>  anyone who'd like to speak for the first time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7274.873s">I</a>  know that when you're a police officer or a firefighter and you're out on the road or you're at a fire scene, you depend on leadership to keep you safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7285.276s">And</a>  leadership needs to come up through the ranks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7290.152s">People</a>  coming in from the outside don't don't know Personnel they don't know the layout of the city and this has all been said but The rank-and-file need to have confidence in their leaders.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7303.317s">I've</a>  been on fire grounds with these guys and they're competent You want to do a worldwide search?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7309.659s">Well,</a>  here's your worldwide search it ends right here so</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7321.473s">We</a>  live in turbulent times, and any day, anything can happen now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7326.096s">We</a>  live in turbulent times, and when chaos, when we're dealing with chaos, we need steady leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7332.52s">And</a>  steady leadership is right here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7335.322s">I</a>  know we have it on the police department, and I know the firefighters have the same steady leadership.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7341.806s">Promote</a>  from within.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7342.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7352.812s">Luis</a>  Pacheco on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7355.114s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7356.275s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7358.137s">Good</a>  evening, City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7359.858s">My</a>  name is Mark Pacheco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7360.779s">Luis</a>  logged in as my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7363.241s">Just</a>  wanted to say a few things from my perspective on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7365.944s">I</a>  had 31 Calvary Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7367.225s">I've</a>  been a resident homeowner for 14 years in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7372.069s">Someone</a>  that works for a state agency that routinely works with the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7377.253s">at</a>  my work, working with significant incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7381.855s">Probably</a>  no one on the city council will ever have to deal with bomb threats, significant safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7388.359s">Having</a>  that continuity of firefighters is important, not just the rank and file, but also as the other agencies that work within <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7400.205s">these</a>  departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7401.567s">For</a>  me, my perspective is to work with the current chief, we had a significant incident in the municipality where I work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7409.217s">And</a>  I have worked with him since he was a lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7412.501s">So</a>  his his institutional knowledge of that building, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7415.945s">how</a>  to work with me, that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7418.587s">And</a>  that's something that city council should really keep in mind when they make their decision about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7424.092s">The</a>  fire department, secondly, the fire department is a brotherhood that no one on the city council will ever understand unless you work directly with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7433.06s">To</a>  take that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7435.788s">chance</a>  for them to move up to a level to reach the pinnacle of their career and take that from them just to have a candidate from outside of the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7448.594s">I</a>  think you're going to lose and miss the really the big point of this if you really should consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7454.818s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7463.823s">anyone</a>  who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7466.386s">Is</a>  there anyone who has spoken once who'd like to speak again?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7470.371s">There's</a>  another gentleman behind Councilor Bearsley, President Beasley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7473.976s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7474.677s">Come</a>  on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7475.077s">Come</a>  on up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7487.216s">Welcome,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7488.016s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_66]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7489.697s">Joe</a>  Spinelli, 340 Salem Street, Medford Fire Department, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7494.519s">I</a>  wasn't gonna come up tonight and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7497.02s">One</a>  is I'm not a good speaker, I don't enjoy it, but I couldn't listen to this without bringing up a couple of things.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7503.443s">And</a>  I actually wanna thank the administration for almost making this vote pretty simple for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7510.606s">They</a>  start off with transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7512.767s">That's</a>  what this city ran, that's what this administration ran on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7517.591s">And</a>  the first thing she does after this incident that she says happens, decides to take the chief out of civil service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7527.234s">Within</a>  two weeks, she finds somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7530.295s">I'd</a>  love to know what the background on that person was, when she had 20, 30 year deputy chiefs sitting there, waiting to step up and be in charge of the city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7543.561s">but</a>  find somebody in a week and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7545.962s">They</a>  talk about a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7547.703s">She</a>  said it would be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7548.724s">We</a>  all heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7549.624s">It</a>  would be fair.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7551.085s">How</a>  fair was it when they went behind the backs of the fire department and this council and the city to appoint somebody and not ask one other person to be involved in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7563.211s">Not</a>  one deputy chief was part of that interview process, were they?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7567.782s">I</a>  think she made it very simple on how she's going to act with this new power and this new leadership she says she has. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7573.667s">We</a>  know what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7574.388s">This</a>  is control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7575.548s">This</a>  is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7576.91s">And</a>  I think you guys know how to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7578.911s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7584.556s">Would</a>  you like to speak first or second time?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7592.863s">You</a>  can come up if you'd like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7603.123s">Name</a>  and address for the record you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7605.224s">My</a>  name is Marie Masio, I live at six coverage treatment wasn't here tonight because of the firefighters but I'm listening to everything being said, and I feel you guys elected officials of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7621.395s">And</a>  I've lived in Medford for 61 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7625.599s">And</a>  listening to all of this, I feel that I want to know that the fire chief of the city of Medford has a good knowledge of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7636.567s">And</a>  for me, we are in really challenging times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7639.89s">And</a>  if something's going to happen, I want to know that the chief is somebody that I can feel confident is really going to take care of all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7648.839s">I</a>  think that it should be somebody that comes within the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7653.423s">And</a>  that's my personal opinion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7663.807s">I</a>  appreciate it, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7665.488s">The</a>  boss had some line blocking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7668.929s">All</a>  right, anyone else who'd like to speak for the first or second time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7673.27s">I'm</a>  gonna go to the Chief of Staff for the third one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7674.891s">I'd</a>  really like to keep it to three for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7677.431s">I'd</a>  like us all to respect everyone who's spoken, even if we disagree with them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7681.073s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff, you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7687.455s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7688.795s">I</a>  will be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7689.535s">I</a>  do have a number of items, but I will go through them quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7692.785s">Um,</a>  as stated by the mayor at the start of this call, or the start of this meeting, uh, on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7699.894s">Our</a>  legal counsel attorney Brian Mazer is on the line and I welcome and I encourage the council to speak with him this evening regarding the authority that this council has to move this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7712.031s">The</a>  second item is to be clear again, it's been stated, but it should be restated because I think we're getting a little lost in some of the nuances here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7720.838s">This</a>  request to the city council is because there is a vacancy pending, like imminent vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7729.804s">That</a>  is why this is before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7731.986s">This</a>  wouldn't be before the council if there wasn't a vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7735.048s">So</a>  that I just want to be explicit on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7738.047s">If</a>  for some reason, my comments were perceived to refer to other unions, when I was saying that the mayor has met with the union, I was referring to the fire union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7747.452s">I</a>  was never attempting to describe or capture other union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7753.835s">I</a>  do take exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7754.936s">I'll</a>  circle back on that in a moment about other unions, but I want to be clear with the caller on zoom and the members of the public who spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7762.9s">I</a>  wasn't attempting to speak to other union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7765.441s">I</a>  was referring to the fire union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7766.961s">And</a>  I will circle back on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7768.221s">But</a>  I do take significant exception with being called a liar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7772.722s">I</a>  even think I may have stated earlier on this call that it was the Lemonster fire chief and fire captain. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7779.984s">If</a>  I stated that, I was incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7782.144s">I</a>  meant to state police chief and police captain. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7785.325s">That</a>  is the type of person I am is I restate statements, if I believe that I may have made a mistake, or may have attempted to mislead unintentionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7796.412s">So</a>  to be clear, that that's, that's who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7799.274s">That's</a>  who the mayor is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7801.416s">But</a>  also getting back to union negotiations, there are so many nuances to this process as it relates to school union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7809.181s">The</a>  mayor is not the chief negotiating officer on the school side, as I'm sure the city council knows, but for members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7815.445s">The</a>  mayor is one member of the school committee, certainly the leader as the chair of the school committee, but the mayor doesn't unilaterally, it would be inappropriate for the mayor to be at negotiating sessions because of the structure of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7830.023s">The</a>  school committee is a seven member <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7832.606s">uh,</a>  body seven member body, unless they were to vote to allow the mayor to sit in on all negotiations and then that were to somehow be, um, appropriate in accordance with the school superintendent, those things, that is not how this works to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7847.776s">So,</a>  uh, furthermore, there's other note, um, nuances to this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7853.16s">The</a>  chief, the mayor is also not the chief negotiating officer on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7856.862s">That</a>  role falls between the chief of staff and the HR director who have always been at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7861.365s">At</a>  least one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7862.686s">And</a>  furthermore, the mayor does have union negotiations on her calendar on all city-side negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7872.192s">She</a>  may have them on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7873.833s">To</a>  be honest with you, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7875.274s">She</a>  maintains her own calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7876.895s">But</a>  I can tell you as a fact, because the HR director and I put them on her calendar, she is almost always on call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7883.48s">She</a>  is almost always in the room with me and the HR director when we caucus. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7888.903s">We</a>  are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7889.683s">We</a>  just may not physically be in that same room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7892.104s">But</a>  this is a typical negotiation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7894.645s">And</a>  our HR director can back that up based on her experience in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7900.368s">And</a>  finally, I will reiterate, no one's taking anything from the department if this were to move out of the fire chief position, were to move out of the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7911.552s">Union</a>  employees, members of the department would very much have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7918.306s">A</a>  fire department employee who rises through the ranks and ensures a clean slate and does a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7928.939s">I</a>  mean, that doesn't even mean that the person doesn't make mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7931.442s">We're</a>  all human. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7932.183s">We</a>  make mistakes and our office understands that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7935.831s">but</a>  has to be with integrity, has to do the job, you know, with the kind of integrity that this community deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7947.156s">That</a>  person can very well make fire chief with or without civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7952.818s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7955.259s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7958.32s">Is</a>  there anyone, members of the public who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7964.378s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7966.839s">Mr.</a>  McGilvrey, just give your name and address.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7968.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7968.779s">Harry</a>  McGilvrey, 4P Mark Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7971.219s">So</a>  if the city is going in that direction to take the fire chief position out of civil service, I think it's a fair question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7979.401s">Are</a>  we taking the police chief out of civil service also?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7991.944s">Because</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7994.814s">Chief,</a>  and I'm probably gonna get, you know, ragged on when I get back at the station, but our chief's doing a heck of a job, and he's really, you know, brought this department along, and he's a civil service chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8007.581s">So</a>  I think it's a fair question, and I think that the council is obligated, if that's the direction the city's going, I think there's an obligation to the city to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8019.087s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8028.092s">Douglas.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8028.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8119.642s">Anyone</a>  else who hasn't spoken yet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8127.187s">If</a>  anyone else who hasn't spoken would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8131.229s">Seeing</a>  none, Mr. Buckley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8133.411s">Walter</a>  Buckley, Liberal 1032 president. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8136.174s">I</a>  just want to end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8138.236s">The</a>  mayor and the chief of staff was on transparency in this pool of people that are going to be interviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8145.783s">And</a>  she said, if you have a clean slate and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8149.409s">Billy</a>  Young's here, I know he has a clean slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8152.693s">Danny</a>  Shea's here, he's got a clean slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8154.976s">Tommy</a>  Brennan's working right now, he's got a clean slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8158.08s">Todd</a>  Evans worked yesterday, he's got a clean slate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8161.685s">Frank</a>  Gilberti, he definitely got a clean slate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8167.315s">Was</a>  she discriminating against our members by not interviewing them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8170.978s">She</a>  likes to throw discrimination around and equality and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8174.581s">I</a>  believe she discriminated against our members by not even telling them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8178.164s">And</a>  I believe she just, excuse my language, crapped all over you guys by going behind your backs and trying to hire somebody without your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8186.471s">Think</a>  about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8198.167s">The</a>  hand is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8201.548s">If</a>  you would like to speak, please raise your hand again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8203.489s">In</a>  the meantime, I'll go to just Healy on zoom name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8207.73s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_61]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8210.571s">Jessica</a>  Healy for lock road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8213.052s">I'm</a>  sorry, I just had to say, following what this gentleman also just said, the way she put it stating that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8220.694s">you</a>  know, firefighters that are already been in Medford for probably 30 plus years protecting us day in and day out, that if they have a clean slate, they're also eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8232.823s">But</a>  are we saying that we don't have those type of firefighters here in Medford, and that we have to outsource and that's the only way we're going to get a great chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8243.831s">I</a>  find that very disrespectful to our firefighters who've been in Medford for 30 something years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8250.711s">You're</a>  going to tell them that no, sorry, we're going to go out and find a new chief, someone who's going to come in know nothing about the city and not know how to protect us properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8262.575s">Because</a>  like they stated, you have to know a magnitude of different circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8270.018s">But</a>  I feel like they're pushing down the firefighters that we already have that are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8277.66s">And</a>  that would be able to be promoted to chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8281.104s">But</a>  they're just pushing it out as already finding someone within a week and a half and not looking within our own department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8290.788s">It's</a>  disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8293.049s">I</a>  just had to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8294.429s">And</a>  I appreciate all the firefighters that are there tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8298.711s">And</a>  we all thank you for everything you do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8309.919s">name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8311.16s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_63]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8318.243s">Hi,</a>  Kathleen St. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8319.263s">Germain,</a>  34 Harrison Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8322.487s">I</a>  just want to say coming from a family of fire and police, I can't tell you what a great job these firefighters do in our county, in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8333.856s">And</a>  I want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8335.238s">And</a>  I really hope that the council thinks very hard about this and does not vote in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8342.363s">We</a>  need to have the civil service process in order to keep it fair and consistent going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8347.408s">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8348.669s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8357.176s">Any</a>  further public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8358.597s">Mrs.</a>  Lonergan, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8361.398s">Uh-oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8362.378s">I</a>  just have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8364.779s">I</a>  know that you're in the service for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8370.741s">You</a>  have a rank, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8372.842s">You</a>  have a rank in the Navy? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8375.683s">You</a>  have to go through the process to reach this point that you have a rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8380.384s">How</a>  come you don't feel that they don't deserve the same as you have?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8392.499s">If</a>  you could keep it brief, I would like to learn quite a bit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8395.681s">I'm</a>  only an ensign.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8397.182s">I</a>  don't care what you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8399.483s">Your</a>  goal is to be an admiral, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8401.664s">At</a>  some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8402.905s">And</a>  you know you have to work yourself up through that rank to become an admiral or whatever you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8409.129s">And</a>  I just think it's unfair for you to state that these guys don't deserve the same <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8415.922s">same</a>  with the stability that you're getting, or what you're open to, or opportunity to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8421.286s">So</a>  that's my other, my second comment is, if a police chief is brought in, he's obviously served many years in whatever community he's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8430.812s">Now</a>  we hire somebody from outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8433.094s">Are</a>  they gonna stay three years or five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8435.435s">Do</a>  we give them a pension? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8437.417s">That's</a>  a big deal to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8440.338s">I</a>  can speak to that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8447.421s">My</a>  understanding is if they had already had enough credit, then it would add to their credit, but if they... I don't see how it would be possible that someone would start at zero years as a chief of fire in the state, so... Fair, fair point, fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8463.841s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8465.652s">All</a>  right, any further comment from members of the public?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8468.595s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8469.716s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8471.058s">Patrick</a>  Kearse, 178 Woburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8474.542s">President</a>  Bearsky, I want to ask the committee a question, if they can answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8478.806s">Is</a>  anybody on the committee born and raised Medford?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8481.99s">We're</a>  not going to, we can't just ask those questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8488.305s">to</a>  say why that's not a valid question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8490.846s">Some</a>  of the people on here said that we voted for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8493.968s">Not</a>  all of us voted for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8495.728s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out who here <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8499.736s">lives</a>  in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8500.876s">Do</a>  they pay property tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8503.257s">Do</a>  they pay property tax?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8504.637s">Have</a>  they been in Medford for two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8506.938s">The</a>  qualification to be a voter is the same as an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8510.839s">Everyone</a>  here is a registered voter in the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8512.599s">Have</a>  they been here two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8513.819s">Five</a>  years?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8514.44s">Answer</a>  personal questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8516.86s">Well,</a>  my question is, I've lived here for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8520.421s">I</a>  work in the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8521.421s">I</a>  pay property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8523.182s">I</a>  have firefighter friends in this town that have worked for this town for over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8528.86s">Now,</a>  all of a sudden, people are going to be coming in here and they don't get elected by everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8533.723s">And</a>  that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8535.364s">Many</a>  more people should vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8537.165s">So</a>  we know who gets into office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8538.786s">But</a>  when people up here tell me that they were voted in, they weren't voted in by all of us, maybe some of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8544.989s">But</a>  I'm just trying to say we are <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8547.831s">I'd</a>  like to know how long you've been in Medford, what you have invested in Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8552.572s">I</a>  think many, many, many people know how long I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8555.073s">I'm</a>  not going to ask any of my colleagues to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8557.874s">Well,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8558.194s">Douglas</a>  is one of my great teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8561.675s">And</a>  I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8562.515s">And</a>  every person who is a resident of the city has a voice and a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8565.956s">And</a>  we have a majority vote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8567.016s">But</a>  then you're going to go outside of Medford, when you have so many employees of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8572.478s">I'm</a>  not even here for this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8574.079s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8575.479s">I</a>  respect your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8576.259s">You</a>  can continue to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8577.18s">But</a>  we're not going to be obligated to answer your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8579.901s">You</a>  should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8580.661s">You</a>  work for us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8581.541s">We're</a>  not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8582.181s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8583.122s">I</a>  have a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8586.223s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8592.133s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8595.114s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8598.375s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8599.236s">I</a>  see there are a couple hands still raised on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8601.056s">I'm</a>  happy to defer to those.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8602.057s">Sorry,</a>  I think these have been raised for a while.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8605.238s">I</a>  think Director Crowley is waiting to speak, and I see a hand that looks new.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8609.119s">Director</a>  Crowley, would you like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8612.361s">I'll</a>  ask you to unmute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8618.916s">Thank</a>  you, President Beas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8622.077s">Through</a>  you, to the council, to everybody out there, I just want to clear up a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8627.82s">I</a>  think the chief of staff and others have stated this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8631.322s">We're</a>  not, truly we're not trying to block a firefighter, a captain, a deputy chief from becoming chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8640.077s">We're</a>  trying to open the pool up, which would actually open the pool up to our firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8645.459s">I</a>  believe the mayor stated a little while ago that four deputy captains had to apply for the job, and then only one took the test that blocked the captains. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8659.183s">In</a>  this process, those captains would have also had the opportunity to take a shot at the captain's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8669.321s">It's</a>  not my intention nor do I think it's the administration's intention to block any of our current personnel from the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8678.528s">We</a>  just want to open it up so that it's fair and that the, I'm sorry, deputy chiefs, not deputy captains. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8687.155s">And</a>  I want to make sure that even our captains or whoever else might be qualified on the force could actually go for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8695.391s">We're</a>  not trying to hold anybody back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8698.814s">That</a>  would never be my intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8701.296s">I've</a>  worked in HR for many, many years, and it's never been my intention to hold anybody back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8708.041s">We're</a>  just trying to open up the field so that more qualified people could go for the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8714.026s">There's</a>  no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8714.967s">We're</a>  not trying to control anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8717.068s">We're</a>  just trying to control a process like we control any other <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8722.953s">Hiring</a>  process is checks and balances along the way and I'm sure if we got to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8729.359s">And</a>  the council voted on that to go to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8733.043s">We</a>  would have members of the department help us with the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8738.949s">I</a>  believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8741.178s">Somebody</a>  had said, we don't know your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8743.4s">Absolutely</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8744.201s">We</a>  don't know your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8745.202s">I've</a>  never stood in your shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8747.144s">I</a>  have nephews who are firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8748.805s">I</a>  have nieces and nephews who are police officers, never stood in their shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8752.829s">And</a>  I understand the job you have in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8755.492s">But</a>  I just want to make sure that you understand that it would open up the field to more of you to be able to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8765.526s">whether</a>  it's inside or out, you would not be precluded from this process, nor would we want to preclude you from the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8772.747s">So</a>  I just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8775.048s">I</a>  understand the job they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8776.588s">I</a>  think they do a fantastic job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8778.389s">I</a>  have not been with the city for a long time, but I'm looking forward to help move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8783.71s">Working</a>  with the fire department, I've had great conversations and I'm hoping to continue those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8789.331s">My</a>  door is opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8791.368s">All</a>  day long, anybody wants to come in and have a conversation, I'm always open for that, but we're really truly not trying to preclude anybody from taking a position as chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8804.032s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8805.512s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Director.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8806.112s">I'm</a>  going to go to the podium, then I'm going to go to Melissa Tobin on Zoom, then Mr. Pacheco on Zoom, then Councilor Collins, then Councilor Scarpellilli, then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8814.755s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8816.275s">Ellen</a>  Lovecchia, 27 Ramstad Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8820.373s">I</a>  wasn't here to talk about this, but I couldn't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8825.637s">Let's</a>  get real. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8827.338s">Does</a>  this come across to you as authentic? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8831.882s">What</a>  the chief of staff is saying and what this person is saying, does that come across to you as authentic? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8837.806s">Does</a>  anybody in this room believe what they're saying?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8843.03s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8844.471s">Number</a>  two, their only argument <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8852.763s">The</a>  only argument they have is that no one in this world who does the job every day understands what they're trying to do for us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8863.254s">None</a>  of us understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8870.586s">None</a>  of us get it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8872.588s">They</a>  think those two get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8874.57s">Those</a>  two get it, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8875.992s">But</a>  none of us do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8877.493s">So</a>  those are their two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8878.895s">They're</a>  in a dick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8879.936s">They're</a>  disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8881.778s">And</a>  they're telling these people who do the job every day that they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8886.483s">And</a>  it doesn't affect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8887.664s">They</a>  just don't get it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8902.065s">Melissa</a>  Tobin, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8903.986s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8905.887s">Hi,</a>  my name is Melissa Tobin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8907.508s">I</a>  live at 97 Taft Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8910.27s">And</a>  I was just listening in tonight to see, and after listening for the past three and a half hours, a lot of light has come. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8919.195s">A</a>  lifetime Medford resident, I own a home here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8924.078s">In</a>  taking a step back from all this, we've had a process for years <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8930.233s">with</a>  the civil service exam and it's worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8934.735s">And</a>  right now we're trying to change something that's not broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8939.398s">So</a>  why are we using our resources and energy to attempt to fix something that is working? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8947.262s">So</a>  my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8948.182s">Second</a>  is the chief of staff mentioned various communities in the Commonwealth that have gone away from the civil service exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8958.649s">She</a>  stated that they were surveyed about what they have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8963.855s">It's</a>  very hard to look at some of those communities because they're not like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8971.805s">So</a>  I think we need to take that off the table because they are not apples to apples. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8979.451s">And</a>  until you can compare a Medford to a Malden or a Somerville or a Cambridge in what they're doing, that should be a baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8989.335s">I</a>  also ask the council to take a step back and really look, what is the root problem, the root cause of this problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8998.619s">There's</a>  lots of issues going on, whether it's this, they're saying the fire department had like a sick out, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9007.726s">The</a>  civil service exam, you're bringing the two together and they need to be two totally separate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9016.649s">And</a>  I stand with the firefighters, keep the process as is and let the civil service exam do its job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9025.061s">And</a>  my last question is, why is there only four? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9030.106s">They</a>  mentioned that four people signed up for the test, but then only one took it and there were other qualified candidates in the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9039.314s">Why</a>  isn't it open up to all within the fire department or any other unions moving forward with promotions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9052.333s">Um,</a>  to the last question, I think the reason that it is the way it is because of the civil service process.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9056.816s">So</a>  I'm sitting just answering factual questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9064.881s">Okay,</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9067.483s">Is</a>  that something that you could get back to the community on about why? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9071.326s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9072.827s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9080.174s">Sorry,</a>  Miss Tobin, we can look into that and we can try to get the answer to that question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9087.297s">I</a>  hope you can get the answer, not just try, because I think it will be very helpful for the community to see why it's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9096.442s">Because</a>  right now with the civil service exam, as long as you meet the qualifications, you can take the exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9104.145s">And</a>  right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9105.891s">you're</a>  limiting this pool of candidates that may feel that are probably qualified for some of these jobs and you're not allowing them the advantage to take it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9115.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9118.157s">We're</a>  going to go to who I think may be Luis Pacheco now on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9124.505s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9125.266s">Luis</a>  Pacheco, 31 Carberry Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9127.748s">You</a>  know, as I sit here, I was there earlier and then I came home and I continue listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9132.871s">And</a>  I just think how undermining this whole entire process has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9137.455s">You</a>  know, you you want to open it up to everybody else, like Crowley just said, but you never spoke within. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9146.658s">A</a>  leader speaks within. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9148.541s">They</a>  speak within their police department, their firefighters, their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9153.308s">They</a>  ask what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9154.47s">They</a>  ask what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9155.572s">And</a>  it's been opened up to somebody else to take a position that was a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9162.11s">but</a>  yet the firefighters are sitting here and they're blindsided. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9166.412s">Communication</a>  is so huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9170.093s">And</a>  this is so disheartening as I grew up in Medford and now I own a house in Medford and I'm raising kids in Medford and I want the city of Medford to continue to bleed Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9182.257s">And</a>  I want people that are born and raised here to continue to work within this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9186.899s">And</a>  this is so sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9190.182s">This</a>  is so disheartening to see that nobody knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9194.626s">The</a>  mayor, the city councilors have conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9199.971s">There's</a>  a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9201.532s">People</a>  have put their lives into working for Medford and nobody thought about like pausing the button and having larger conversations, bringing it to the leaders to bring down to the workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9216.756s">This</a>  is absolutely disgusting to hear what's going on in our community today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9222.983s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9223.844s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9229.251s">Jamie.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9231.153s">Mr.</a>  Thompson, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9235.834s">And</a>  if you could just sign in with Larry when you're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9237.655s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9238.595s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9238.895s">Jamie</a>  Thompson, 80s Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9241.656s">Wasn't</a>  here originally to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9243.276s">I</a>  am amazed by the debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9245.957s">I</a>  appreciate all the conversation, but you're here to discuss a major change to the fire chief role in the promotion chain for community organization where those people have built institutional knowledge and relationships in the organization and in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9263.502s">The</a>  conversation about the sick call out has nothing to do with that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9268.724s">And</a>  if it does, it makes me question based on all this conversation, the lack of transparency, whether this is a retaliatory decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9279.249s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9293.396s">Lisa,</a>  I've unmuted you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9294.817s">You</a>  have five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9296.277s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_46]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9298.438s">Lisa</a>  Falanga, 88 Dudley Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9300.96s">I</a>  just have a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9302.581s">I</a>  had no intention of responding at all, but after listening, especially to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9306.703s">Nazarian,</a>  a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9310.705s">You</a>  know, does she live in the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9313.306s">That's</a>  a really important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9314.927s">I</a>  know you're not going to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9316.187s">You</a>  don't have to, but as a council, you need to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9320.518s">Secondly,</a>  you know, everybody makes mistakes was one of her comments her mistakes can't kill somebody a firefighter's mistake can Change the course of their life forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9334.97s">They</a>  need to have solid leadership And they have to have faith in their leader And a lot of that comes by built with the come, you know, the brotherhood that they have and the other thing is <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9348.564s">To</a>  be a lawyer, I could go to law school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9351.706s">I</a>  could go to law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9352.967s">I</a>  think I'm smart enough to go to law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9355.249s">But</a>  I still have to pass a bar exam to be a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9360.152s">So</a>  why wouldn't a civil service exam not apply? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9365.276s">I</a>  think when you make decisions, you have to make it based on the people who do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9371.641s">They</a>  know what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9373.782s">And</a>  the other thing that I was a little perplexed about, and I don't know what the answer is, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9378.331s">Um,</a>  it said that the firefighters who called out some of them went in and got paid overtime Why would they get paid overtime if it was their shift? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9387.056s">That</a>  is the most ridiculous thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9388.197s">I</a>  would have heard that is totally mismanagement of funds So, I don't know if that really happened but that's what somebody said Um, but that's something you should really be thinking about who's writing the policies of overtime <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9404.997s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9405.757s">I</a>  just think, like I said, Miss Nazarian, I don't think, I don't think she's, of course, she's going to support Mayor LaRonde O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9412.86s">She</a>  works for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9413.921s">She</a>  gets her paycheck. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9415.681s">But</a>  I think as a council, you need to listen to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9419.843s">And</a>  I think the people support the firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9421.964s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9432.372s">You</a>  may come to the podium, you have five minutes, name and address for the record, and sign in with Larry if you have to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9436.773s">Sure,</a>  so my name is Melissa Miguel, I live on Bowen Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9440.774s">Back</a>  in 2019, none of you were here, not a single one of you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9446.035s">I</a>  served on Breonna Lungo-Koehn's transition team, where she promised that she ran on the platform of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9454.153s">I'm</a>  here tonight to deal with the other nonsense that you're gonna put forward tonight as a 20 year homeowner here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9460.197s">But</a>  as I stand here listening to the firefighters talk, the bottom line here is there has been zero transparency in this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9468.662s">So</a>  I don't know where Brianna is tonight, but I'd like to remind her when I sat with her in 2019, her platform was transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9477.327s">So</a>  I'd like to see her walk the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9482.423s">So</a>  Brianna, wherever you are, I know you know who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9486.124s">You</a>  ran on transparency.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9488.324s">Let's</a>  do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9500.107s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9501.167s">Anyone</a>  else in the room who hasn't spoken would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9504.848s">All</a>  right, I'm going to go to Melissa Tobin on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9508.068s">This</a>  is your second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9509.609s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9510.569s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9512.435s">Hi</a>  again, Melissa Tobin 97 tap street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9515.196s">I</a>  wasn't finished previously and I was muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9518.098s">So</a>  that's why I'm back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9522.16s">One</a>  of my last points is that as like the city council, you've been elected by all the residents in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9533.938s">And</a>  there's been a lot of tension, but I ask that we all check our egos at the door and do what's right for our community and our firefighters tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9545.689s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9554.497s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9558.058s">This</a>  is not my way, steps ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9560.419s">All</a>  right, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli with a legal question, then Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9563.841s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9564.581s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9566.102s">If</a>  we can ask the attorney from KP Law, I believe the process that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9576.064s">We</a>  are mandated by law now to have a chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9581.145s">Now</a>  the chief Freeman is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9582.526s">This</a>  chief that you offer the job to is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9585.747s">I</a>  want to know legally who was that chief right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9589.288s">Attorney</a>  Mazer, I recognize you to respond to the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9594.789s">Chief</a>  retires tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9595.849s">So</a>  after tomorrow, who will be our chief?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_67]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9599.954s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, through you, upon Chief Reuben's retirement, if the position is vacant, the department does not have a chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9611.306s">And</a>  my understanding right now is that there's no current <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9617.052s">civil</a>  service list in existence for the position of chief in light of the fact that Chief Freeman was the only name on the prior list and he was subsequently appointed from that list and from the test that was administered that led to that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9631.549s">So</a>  basically, you don't have a chief until a provisional <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9636.534s">appointment</a>  is made to that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9639.656s">And</a>  if the position remains in civil service, it would be a provisional or temporary appointment until such time as the city can schedule either an exam or some type of an assessment center through the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9651.701s">And</a>  as a result of that process, a list of eligible candidates would be generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9656.263s">And</a>  then the city would make an appointment from that list of eligible candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9661.596s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9662.017s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9663.82s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli or any other Councilors, do you have questions for Attorney Major at this time?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9667.466s">No,</a>  that was it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9668.568s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9669.55s">Any</a>  further comment from members of the public?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9672.199s">just</a>  real quick.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9672.979s">And</a>  last name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9675.1s">Thomas</a>  Ross 53 Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9677.421s">Just</a>  to make a comment on the attorney's last remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9680.542s">I'm</a>  not an attorney, but I'm pretty sure he's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9683.683s">Okay,</a>  so what happens when we have a vacancy, according to the collective bargaining agreement when there's a permanent vacancy, and there is no established civil service list, the next senior deputy will shout <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9694.887s">Whether</a>  it's a senior deputy chief, it's a deputy's position that's vacant, a captain's position is vacant, a lieutenant's position is vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9701.215s">In</a>  such a case, when you don't have a qualified civil service list in place, and we don't right now, the senior deputy shall take over that position immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9710.165s">That's</a>  in the collective bargain agreement, and it's part of civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9713.509s">I</a>  don't know what this guy's talking about.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9725.102s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the public?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9728.224s">Just</a>  to follow up, if we can, out of necessity of safety for our community, we need some action before 4 o'clock tomorrow when Chief Friedman steps down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9739.594s">We</a>  need some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9741.275s">So</a>  we have qualified deputies, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9743.897s">We</a>  need answers for this community because without a head at the table, I fear what can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9751.482s">So</a>  we're talking about public safety, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9753.904s">So</a>  we need the mayor to respond to this with some sort of letter or communication with the community and what we're gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9763.31s">We</a>  have conflicting reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9765.592s">We</a>  have an expert on civil service and rules, and we have an attorney that didn't seem to be too sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9772.056s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9775.378s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpellilli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9777.638s">Mr.</a>  Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9778.359s">On</a>  a clarification, there was a City Ordinance that says in absence of the Chief, week or more, the Senior Deputy Chief will be sworn in as Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9787.862s">That's</a>  a City Ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9789.463s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9789.863s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9800.077s">Thank</a>  you, President Barras. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9801.338s">I</a>  noticed that Attorney Mazer had raised his hand.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9803.819s">I</a>  just want to say something before I... And if we could respond to Councilor Scarpellilli's question about notifying the public by 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9816.568s">tomorrow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9816.988s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9819.634s">Um,</a>  president bears through you, uh, certainly, uh, obviously the mayor would need to make an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9826.641s">Um,</a>  that would be the only logical thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9829.683s">Um,</a>  this process is going to be one that we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9833.307s">We</a>  had been working on it over the course of the time, between the time that chief Friedman had, um, announced his resignation to the mayor and today, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9842.575s">So</a>  obviously, there will be further action. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9845.396s">But</a>  I do ask that Attorney Mazur, through you, President Bears, if possible, could respond to the issue presented by the last speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9854.198s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9858.98s">Attorney</a>  Mazur, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_67]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9862.459s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman, through you to the other members of the council as well as those in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9869.747s">The</a>  position of fire chief is not a position that's covered by the collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9874.391s">The</a>  collective bargaining agreement has no authority over that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9878.395s">nor</a>  do any of the members of local 1032. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9880.996s">It's</a>  a managerial position and pursuant to the charter, which trumps any city ordinances, as it is the force of law, the mayor is the appointing authority for the position of fire chief and all of the department heads under chapter, I think it's 52, you know, of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9896.701s">So</a>  while the ordinance may say one thing, the charter, again, if it conflicts, prevails, as it is the force of law, it's a special act that was elected or essentially enacted by the voters of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9906.645s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9908.564s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9911.129s">So</a>  just to follow up, just to end this, I think that, again, with the question I already asked the mayor, this banter going back and forth doesn't help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9922.756s">We</a>  have people right now that are qualified to step in that role, whether it's the mayor's responsibility or not, or that's her role now, legally or by ordinance, I'm requesting that we please put one of these people in place so our fire department and our city is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9939.146s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9949.712s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9951.953s">Thank</a>  you to everybody who's spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9953.274s">And</a>  there's been a lot of members of public service who have spoken tonight and are otherwise here in support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9959.597s">And</a>  it's never a bad opportunity to say thank you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9963.239s">So</a>  I didn't say it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9964.28s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9965.02s">Thank</a>  you for speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9966.361s">Thank</a>  you for sharing your thoughts with us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9967.902s">And</a>  thank you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9970.527s">Um,</a>  we've heard a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9973.348s">I'm</a>  not ready to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9974.668s">Um,</a>  we have some, we have some, I think we've all, many of us have put forward a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9984.692s">Some</a>  of them to me have not been answered satisfactorily. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9987.232s">Some</a>  of them have conflicting answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9994.198s">I</a>  think everybody can agree that this is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9996.66s">I</a>  want to give it the time that it deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9998.801s">I</a>  need more time to consider this and evaluate the proposal on the merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10002.304s">A</a>  lot of people have pointed out that this has been conflated with other allegations against the Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10006.988s">This</a>  is a serious paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10008.449s">I'd</a>  like the opportunity to continue the conversation in Committee of the Whole with my colleagues and evaluate this proposal on the merits without conflating it with other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10018.476s">What</a>  we're voting on is a change to the civil service position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10020.937s">I'd</a>  like to have that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10023.017s">My</a>  motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole, and also to have legal counsel present for that discussion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10028.599s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to Committee of the Whole and have legal counsel present at the meeting, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10033.961s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Fleming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10036.921s">Further</a>  discussion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10038.122s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10040.022s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10041.043s">I</a>  understand what my fellow colleague is asking, but they're here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10048.957s">We're</a>  here now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10051.078s">To</a>  postpone this just pushes this down the line and puts our community more and more in danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10058.382s">They're</a>  here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10059.963s">You</a>  said that the questions that have to be answered, well, ask the answers, they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10065.266s">This</a>  isn't something that, this isn't a political game that we can play back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10070.149s">This</a>  is something serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10071.329s">This</a>  is something that might have one of our lives to deal with in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10076.132s">This</a>  is too serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10077.293s">This</a>  is safety for our firefighters and understanding the process we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10081.417s">I</a>  think people are very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10082.798s">I</a>  think, listen, we're all educated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10085.561s">And</a>  I think common sense has to come forward here and understand what we just heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10091.666s">The</a>  points that were made are so moving in the sense that it is two separate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10098.092s">And</a>  the issues are still questionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10101.24s">We</a>  have a mayor that is historically, everyone, now listen, we all understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10105.442s">Historically,</a>  the mayor has used her position for what she thought was the right thing to do because she was losing control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10114.667s">Ask</a>  Aleesha Nunley, ask Michael Durham, ask other department heads in this community that are gone, good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10121.391s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10121.591s">Kibby,</a>  ask our elections coordinator, ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10126.173s">This</a>  is, if you could see it, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10129.295s">It's,</a>  it's a path that this is now it's playing in a bigger picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10134.358s">And</a>  I don't like the fact that I feel like I'm glanced in because I'm not I'm speaking to from my heart and understanding something very simple here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10143.163s">We</a>  have people here that can answer all of our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10146.465s">The</a>  questions that Councilor Leming brought up, that there is some fraudulent absenteeism, we're not a trial, we're not a jury. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10157.613s">That</a>  still has to be figured out down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10160.215s">What</a>  we did here is that we have qualified people in the civil service process that have worked their way to the position and have earned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10170.751s">Now</a>  to look back, they're talking about how the process and how they would do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10177.498s">They</a>  lied to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10179.06s">If</a>  we didn't find out by a firefighter calling me saying that this person contacted them to ask about the climate of Medford, this is why he denied the job that they offered them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10189.952s">They</a>  didn't, in true faith, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10192.114s">They</a>  didn't bring in the deputy chiefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10195.556s">They</a>  didn't bring in anybody else to say, listen, we're looking at this person and this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10200.958s">They</a>  did it on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10203.179s">So</a>  what makes you sure? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10204.38s">What</a>  makes you strong? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10205.34s">What</a>  makes you give you the common sense to understand that this isn't a political issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10210.422s">This</a>  isn't a control issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10212.223s">This</a>  isn't an issue of anger driven by that, because it reeks of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10217.826s">You</a>  don't have to be a genius to understand this, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10221.107s">We're</a>  smart people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10221.988s">We're</a>  elected by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10223.369s">Now,</a>  you can say one side or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10225.49s">I'm</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10225.99s">I'm</a>  really speaking to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10227.231s">Because</a>  firefighters don't knock on the door and say, what political party do you belong to? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10232.234s">They</a>  kick the door in and they go into the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10234.415s">And</a>  to question that right now is a problem to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10238.338s">So</a>  please, they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10239.639s">It's</a>  10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10240.419s">I</a>  know we have more important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10242.781s">We</a>  have issues to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10244.622s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10245.242s">they're</a>  here let's ask the questions and get to a resolution so tomorrow the mayor understands that she has to figure out a way with her team to work with the civil servants that are here that have worked their tails off to earn the right to be the next chief of Medford and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10272.642s">I'm</a>  gonna end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10274.223s">Because</a>  the mayor doesn't she said publicly that she doesn't understand that this is a divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10279.627s">Of</a>  course it's a divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10281.008s">Because</a>  honestly, between my relationships with my colleagues, if you can't see the common sense behind this, it has nothing to do with our political ties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10289.794s">If</a>  we can't see the common sense with this, guys, this is what divides us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10294.304s">This</a>  is what's dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10296.867s">And</a>  if she can't see that, come on outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10302.332s">They're</a>  still out in the parking lot waiting to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10305.055s">And</a>  that says a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10307.637s">And</a>  to the rest of the people here, I'm going to pander a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10311.461s">But</a>  where were you on November 4? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10319.386s">want</a>  to talk about it now, we'll stand up and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10322.287s">This</a>  has been a pattern for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10325.169s">Okay,</a>  so we need to figure out as a community and a council for this one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10330.731s">This</a>  is all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10332.051s">It's</a>  one issue that we know the answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10334.733s">Let's</a>  not pander to politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10336.573s">Let's</a>  not take this to a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10338.134s">We</a>  don't need a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10338.954s">We're</a>  going to do the same thing again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10340.646s">We're</a>  gonna hear it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10341.947s">Let's</a>  help our city move forward and heal from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10345.491s">Hire</a>  the people that are qualified and make everybody feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10348.935s">Because</a>  what we don't know, we don't know what they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10352.318s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10353.199s">No</a>  one can sit here and say that I understand what a firefighter do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10356.903s">No</a>  matter if you're a boss, no matter if you're a director, you don't know what they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10361.588s">And</a>  that's what I'm getting out of this, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10363.349s">And</a>  it's pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10365.61s">Please,</a>  let's put our politics aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10367.752s">Let's</a>  put egos aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10369.152s">Let's</a>  ask the question so we can get to a resolution tonight, which has to be no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10381.94s">So</a>  I make the motion that we deny the mayor's request to take the chief's position out of civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10386.882s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10394.97s">That's</a>  a powerhead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10399.309s">Thank</a>  you, and thanks so much to everyone who has come tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10404.172s">I</a>  consider myself to be a pro-worker and pro-union person, and I know that there are other Councilors on this council who agree with that statement about themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10417.4s">I</a>  think the absolute minimum that we can do if we are pro-worker, pro-union people, is to not make this permanent change <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10427.208s">to</a>  essentially at will employment based solely on flimsy corporate arguments and a totally unproven allegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10437.491s">So</a>  from the arguments standpoint, I have heard a number of things tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10444.899s">and</a>  things like this process should not be hamstrung by all sorts of bureaucratic blah blah blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10455.909s">It</a>  sure is real simple when you can fire anybody for no reason and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10464.113s">Process</a>  is something that helps us have good democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10467.475s">It</a>  helps us have good workplaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10470.597s">I</a>  do not think that this argument of needing to have a quick process is one that I would agree with or that vibes with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10480.443s">This</a>  idea that we need leadership that is most qualified, that we're going to find the best candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10485.066s">I</a>  talked at length with firefighters who described the process, the civil service process, and believe me, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10493.47s">Having</a>  a mayor select someone is not merit-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10497.996s">If</a>  you want the best candidate or most qualified candidate, then you're going to go with a civil service process because that in fact is totally merit-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10510.625s">And</a>  this question that this decision does not affect other people in the department is, frankly, totally not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10519.691s">It</a>  is true to say that it does not remove those other people from civil service, but it totally affects them, aside from the fact that all these promotions, you know, would, you know, waterfall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10533.78s">and</a>  affect a lot of people every time there would be a new fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10540.243s">That,</a>  of course, is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10541.284s">But</a>  if you want to know if it affects the department, look around the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10544.465s">It</a>  affects the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10545.826s">Why</a>  else are all of these people here? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10547.747s">And</a>  as far as the allegation, you know, I am very concerned that we are being pushed into this decision based on <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10558.152s">a</a>  totally unproven allegation that the mayor herself says she doesn't even have any idea why these people would do a coordinated sick out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10569.496s">Now,</a>  people don't do a coordinated, like, they don't through their union coordinate to all be sick at the same time without a demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10577.278s">You</a>  don't, like, that just isn't the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10580.96s">And</a>  the other thing about being sick is that, you know, diseases are contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.283s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.783s">So</a>  people all get sick at the same time when they work in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10591.385s">That</a>  is normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10593.526s">And</a>  you can think what you want about that particular instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10597.488s">But</a>  whatever you think, there is no proven anything going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10603.37s">And</a>  this is not the time for us to make this kind of decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10608.973s">It</a>  also I really have to urge Councilors to understand that there is not one firefighter that is in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10617.76s">And</a>  I am, again, as I said at the beginning, really boggles my mind how we could possibly improve our fire department with leadership that they themselves will refuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10629.569s">It</a>  simply does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10633.112s">So</a>  I am not in favor of this, and I don't think that it helps us to move this to a committee where we'll discuss it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10642.338s">I</a>  have made my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10644.1s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10649.5s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10651.281s">There's</a>  two motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10652.542s">Is</a>  there anyone Councilor would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10656.504s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? President Bears?.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10658.325s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10660.086s">Talking</a>  to people coming in here today, I said that I had, as I said to the union reps, I have questions about this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10668.651s">I</a>  have points where I'm not very happy with how it's presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10674.794s">I</a>  think coming out of here tonight, hearing from the perspectives, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10678.496s">those</a>  questions still exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10680.197s">I</a>  think Councilor Callaghan is making important points about how reform has to be complete, comprehensive, that we need to take our time with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10696.722s">any</a>  policy issue that comes before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10701.364s">There</a>  are really great questions that the union reps have brought up tonight, legal questions, technical questions that I think need to be answered with time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10712.588s">And</a>  as residents have stated, this particular timing is <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10726.007s">questionable,</a>  it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10728.29s">But</a>  taking our time with it, as a resident supporting the firefighters said, tabling it, postponing it, moving it to committee is something I would be comfortable with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10739.205s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Schell.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10743.927s">We</a>  have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10745.068s">We</a>  have motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10746.009s">We're</a>  going to take the motions at this point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10747.43s">We've</a>  had public comment, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10749.091s">I'm</a>  just here to answer whatever questions you have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10751.353s">Unless</a>  there's a motion to reopen public comment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10756.437s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that we have two councils that are very capable, and we have the people tonight to answer these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10764.704s">So</a>  if we can, I would recommend that we do reopen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10767.286s">Just</a>  have them answer the questions that maybe can move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10772.23s">If</a>  in a month or two months, the mayor wants to revisit this process, she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10777.454s">But</a>  right now, we're in a tough situation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10782.257s">So</a>  this is why I think it needs to be something that needs to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10786.6s">So</a>  if we can, reopen it, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10787.981s">And</a>  give them the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10790.262s">Ask</a>  them the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10791.363s">Ask</a>  them the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10792.504s">Let's</a>  get the answers that we need to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10794.845s">We're</a>  educated people, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10796.086s">Come</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10796.446s">We</a>  don't need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10796.987s">It's</a>  a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10798.968s">It's</a>  dangerous.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10803.865s">do</a>  councilors have questions at this time to ask of the city administration or other parties?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10811.147s">Whatever</a>  you want to ask, we're here to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10812.707s">That's</a>  why we're here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10815.988s">I</a>  have questions for the administration, but I don't think this is the venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10822.23s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10822.67s">All</a>  right, we have two motions on the floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10826.477s">One</a>  is a motion by Councilor Collins to refer to committee, seconded by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10831.579s">Second</a>  is a motion to reject by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10835.461s">It's</a>  Councilor Collins, you can unmute and then speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10856.246s">Oh,</a>  you cannot be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10856.926s">Please</a>  respect the meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10860.647s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10864.688s">I</a>  second Councilor Scarpelli's motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10886.169s">pursuant</a>  to Robert's rules, a motion to refer to committee takes precedence over a motion on the main motion, so we will take a vote on the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to committee, seconded by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10897.376s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_62]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11770.785s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11771.465s">Good</a>  evening, councillors, members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11773.467s">Thank</a>  you so much for sticking out with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11776.208s">My</a>  name is Therese Dupont. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11777.549s">I</a>  am the community preservation grant manager here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11781.231s">Tonight,</a>  we have 10 applications for community preservation funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11786.695s">These</a>  were part of our annual funding round. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11790.257s">So</a>  we are now at the final step, which is to hopefully gain approval from this honorable body on each of these applications appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11801.243s">happy</a>  to answer any questions that folks may have on individual applications or the process itself.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11807.47s">Thank</a>  you, Teresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11808.631s">I</a>  just have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11810.373s">Everything</a>  everything seems in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11812.114s">And</a>  I think that we should all support just one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11814.997s">I</a>  know that the question that was that the housing, the housing family, the proposal for what was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11826.633s">pro</a>  bono legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11828.915s">The</a>  house is 69,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11830.317s">I</a>  was under the impression that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11832.82s">Cameron</a>  said that this is funding for paying rents in the rears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11842.049s">But</a>  somebody sent a message saying that on the application, the Housing Families Homeless Prevention and Legal Services Program provides legal assistance and rental assistance to the residents of Malden, Medford, Everett, Pueblo West as legal assistance services include representing families, rental assistance, administering. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11863.746s">So</a>  the question is defined, is this for rental assistance? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11869.07s">What</a>  she's saying is this for legal services, because I think that was one of the questions some will be brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11874.194s">They</a>  just want a clarification.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11877.016s">Thank</a>  you, Teresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11877.817s">If</a>  you could answer that question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_62]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11880.677s">Yes,</a>  and I won't mute myself again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11882.198s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11883.198s">This</a>  is for rental assistance for residents facing arrears and potentially eviction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11891.842s">So</a>  this is for rental assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11894.483s">I</a>  believe in the application, some description of the entire body of housing families work may have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11904.238s">It</a>  ended up in the application as a description of the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11907.661s">So</a>  I can see where folks might be confused, but it is for rental arrears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11912.264s">Okay,</a>  thank you for the clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11913.525s">I</a>  would move approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11915.006s">We've</a>  already had the meetings and talked about all these projects in length. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11918.728s">I</a>  think that they're all super, super successful for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11924.112s">I</a>  think we'll benefit from these projects, and I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12377.469s">Good</a>  evening, President, Chair, and members of the City Council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12382.853s">My</a>  name is Hannah Kilson of the law firm of Nolan Sheehan Patent in Boston, Mass., and I am counsel to Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12390.96s">Continuing</a>  with the presentation, I'd like to make two points to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12395.143s">One,</a>  we've asked our development team, they are also on Zoom watching us, and we're doing a much more <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12402.809s">truncated</a>  presentation, but they are available to engage in any questions that are presented by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12409.813s">As</a>  you can see, we are here with the PD for the issuance of our special permit to show that we are in compliance with the PD3 special permit requirements that are set forth in the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12422.821s">The</a>  ordinance establishes four criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12425.663s">that</a>  need to be considered by this board in issuing the special permit under the PDD-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12432.071s">One</a>  is that the site development and use plan that was submitted as part of our application is substantially conforms to the preliminary plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12444.006s">It</a>  does, and it only has insubstantial differences, and I'd like to highlight those insubstantial differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12452.532s">As</a>  was noted, this site will have five buildings on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12456.394s">Building</a>  A, can you move to slide 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12460.077s">We'll</a>  have five buildings on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12462.518s">Building</a>  A, six-story, 198-unit senior disabled housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12468.86s">Building</a>  B, which is a four-story mid-rise family units, and four townhomes, C, D, and E, which will contain the balance of the 16 family units. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12488.166s">The</a>  only difference between the preliminary plan and the site development plan that was filed with our application and use plan that was filed with our application is changes to building A. The width of building A has been reduced by three feet six inches from what was originally proposed in the PDD submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12511.433s">The</a>  building square footage has increased by one percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12518.035s">from</a>  the PDD submission to the special permit plan application, and the total gross floor area at the site has decreased by about 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12528.802s">These</a>  changes are insubstantial, and the other related changes are to usable open space, which has also decreased by about 4%, and landscape open space, which has increased by about 4% as a result of changes between the two plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12549.075s">So</a>  the site development and use plan is substantially conforms to the preliminary plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12555.257s">The</a>  third criteria that this council needs to consider is that the project meets the special permit criteria that is set forth in the zoning code at section 94-11.6.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12566.92s">Those</a>  six criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12574.082s">are</a>  social economic and community needs size scale and design traffic flow and safety, public utility and services impacts on the environmental condition and compatibility with the city's comprehensive plan, and the city's housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12594.167s">This</a>  project meets the social, economic, and community needs of Medford as we are preserving 144 units of existing deeply affordable housing for low-income, senior, and disabled households, while at the same time adding 94 new additional deeply affordable units in a transit-rich neighborhood and creating a range of housing types, from elevator-accessible, small family units, and family units. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12623.596s">As</a>  noted before, the size, scale, and design of Rockling Court has been intentionally and carefully developed to be responsive to the larger neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12641.095s">No,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12643.056s">So</a>  let me say on the size, scale, and design. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12647.78s">So</a>  as you all know, the boundaries, the neighborhoods that abut this parcel, the Southwest Corridor by building A, that is an industrial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12658.867s">And</a>  so our largest plan building has been located in that proximity, close to the traffic area and an industrial zoned area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12668.954s">to</a>  the rest of the project where we have Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12672.977s">That</a>  is where we situate our building B, our four-story family unit plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12679.542s">The</a>  north and the east boundaries of the parcel, they abut residential settings, and that's where the three townhome buildings are situated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12691.832s">So</a>  the size and scale and design of Auckland Court has really been responsive to the larger neighborhood, trying to create a welcoming and pedestrian-friendly neighborhood through the using of planting, trees, and by installing certain kinds of pedestrian safety measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12709.741s">So</a>  traffic flow and safety, what is up before you on the screen, shows the traffic calming measures being utilized at Auckland Court to ensure <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12721.767s">that</a>  we have safe flow of traffic through the site by the use of gateway entries, midway entries where we have raised sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12733.315s">We're</a>  utilizing the speed tables that you can see in the lower left corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12738.959s">And</a>  you will see a narrowing of the roadway through the development and with a curvature in order to reduce speed of traffic as it flows through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12749.747s">The</a>  next criteria in the review of a special permit is public utility and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12756.552s">Our</a>  consultants, Fuss and O'Neill, have engaged directly with the city engineer, DPW, to ensure that we have readily available and sufficient public utilities in the area to support the project without undue burden on the existing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12775.604s">Impacts</a>  to natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12778.326s">This</a>  development has really been designed to be sustainable and resilient. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12782.748s">We're</a>  meeting both the state and the city's sustainability requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12787.49s">We</a>  will have enterprise green community standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12790.891s">The</a>  electricity is being utilized for heating and cooling and we are developing this project in a way to be solar ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12799.415s">We</a>  are working to reduce the carbon footprint of the buildings by this use of solar and electricity for heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12805.877s">In</a>  addition at the project, we would note that there will be tree removal as a part of this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12813.68s">Currently</a>  on site, there are 52 trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12816.701s">As</a>  part of the development, 12 of those trees will be removed and they are pear trees and they will be located in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12826.625s">eight</a>  of the mature trees will remain. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12829.327s">The</a>  remainder of the trees will be removed, but they will be replaced such that our net trees added to the project will be 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12837.232s">We</a>  will have 78 trees on site when the project is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12843.436s">Additionally,</a>  the Medford Housing Authority has agreed to make a payment to the City of Medford of $50,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12852.363s">to</a>  be paid at the time of the issuance of the building permit to be utilized by the city for further tree enhancement and development throughout the city, and we're asking today that that in fact be a condition of our special permit issuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12868.106s">The</a>  last special permit factor that we'd like to note is that the project must be compatible with Medford's comprehensive plan and housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12877.994s">These</a>  plans really focus on the critical and urgent need in Medford for additional affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12885.0s">And</a>  the housing development plan includes specific references to the need to redevelop Walkling Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12891.666s">The</a>  development of the buildings and structures at Walkling will help satisfy <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12896.71s">the</a>  city's objective of more than 600 new units of affordable housing over the next three fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12908.977s">So</a>  those are the criteria for the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12912.539s">The</a>  last piece that needs to be considered, sorry, it's not the last, my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12919.773s">So</a>  the special permit criteria, as you know, is that the adverse effects of the project do not outweigh the beneficial impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12927.677s">And</a>  we really do believe that that is clear here, that we've demonstrated in this discussion the beneficial impacts of the development to bring more affordable housing, to improve the movement and the use of the site, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12944.387s">The</a>  other standard that we need to satisfy as part of our permit request is that the project meets the standards of approval set forth in the site plan provisions of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12954.674s">And</a>  we believe that has been demonstrated by the CDB's issuance of their approval with recommended conditions at the meeting on the 7th of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12965.287s">The</a>  last element of the special permit criteria under the PDD3 that needs to be addressed is that the site development and the use plan incorporates the recommendations of the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12978.111s">We</a>  have worked with the engineering, has worked with the city's engineer to incorporate many of the recommendations already into our plans relative to stormwater and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=12991.896s">We</a>  have agreed to to in consultation with the traffic department and the DCR to reach agreement as to the conditions recommended relative to the crosswalks and the intersections adjacent to the parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13010.241s">And</a>  we would ask that all of those conditions that have been set forth and given to you by the CDB would be incorporated as conditions of this special permit to be satisfied prior to the issuance of the building permit for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13025.234s">And</a>  with that, I will conclude my remarks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13027.416s">And</a>  so if we could go to slide 33.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13030.238s">Slide</a>  33. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13033.281s">Thank</a>  you for bearing with me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13040.157s">As</a>  Executive Director, I'm cognizant of the impact the Housing Authority can have upon the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13046.982s">The</a>  Housing Authority has provided a lifeline for low-income individuals and families who in many instances face housing insecurity and homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13058.271s">These</a>  are issues that we deal with on a daily basis and through our efforts and the skilled designers who have assisted us to get to this point, we're happy to be here, which will hopefully allow us to carry on with our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13070.02s">Our</a>  efforts go beyond what a housing authority would ordinarily be undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13074.564s">We're</a>  one of the more progressive agencies in Massachusetts and beyond what we're doing at 121 Riverside Avenue by adding <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13083.29s">22</a>  units to a 200 unit development. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13086.712s">This</a>  is a $146 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13090.393s">The</a>  redevelopment of Walkland Court, which has traditionally been thought of as the poor sister of the housing authorities, is what sets the Medford Housing Authority apart, as we are not looking to only maintain our units, but to extend those beyond what most housing authorities today can do, and that is to increase the amount of affordable housing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13113.046s">The</a>  Medford Housing Authority will preserve 144 existing deeply affordable units, as was stated, for low-income seniors and disabled individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13121.628s">We're</a>  not capable of currently providing adequate assistance and housing services to individuals who are there at that site at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13130.011s">The</a>  authority has attempted through years of limited funding to maintain Walkling Court, and Walkling Court, though, is in a much better condition today <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13139.008s">but</a>  does not compare with the Housing Authority's federal developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13143.75s">We're</a>  building units in a transit-rich community, as was stated, within walking distance of the Tufts Green Line stop nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13151.154s">We</a>  are looking to provide accessible family <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13154.455s">apartments</a>  through the inclusion of an elevator, accessible family apartments in housing industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13160.822s">It's</a>  extraordinarily rare to find accessible units on the private market, never mind in public subsidized housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13169.292s">It</a>  is in dire need of being provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13171.553s">We're</a>  addressing climate change, meaning state and city sustainability requirements, enterprise communities, improving energy efficiency, ventilation, stormwater management, removing hazardous waste on the site, as well as HVAC improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13186.798s">The</a>  goal of the Housing Authority is to affirmatively impact the lives of our residents, both those who reside at this property today and those who will reside at Walkland Court sometime in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13197.388s">Remember</a>  that elderly or disabled resident or family who one day may reside in these new apartments may be someone you know or may be a neighbor or even a member of your own family. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13210.14s">integrating</a>  walk and court into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13212.861s">Medford</a>  Housing Authority wants to be a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13215.223s">We've</a>  taken great strides in attempting to take into consideration the comments and input from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13222.026s">Our</a>  design team has received and incorporated recommendations on street design and site density from the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13229.31s">We've</a>  had numerous discussions as far as the landscaping, and we'll attempt to save as many of the trees as possible, as was earlier stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13236.974s">We</a>  will continue to work with the city departments through design and during construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13242.655s">The</a>  economic benefit is that $166 million in local economic activity through the construction will be generated, which will support up to 968 jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13254.318s">With</a>  the contribution of the city, this has enabled the Housing Authority to receive millions of dollars in projected and committed funding from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13262.279s">That</a>  commitment is over $25 million at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13266.42s">Walkley</a>  Court is presently a polling place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13269.502s">Walkley</a>  Court will continue to be a polling place and will be for the upcoming March 5th election. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13275.145s">The</a>  facilities will have a community room which can hold an estimated 150 to 200 people and can be used by the local neighborhood and by the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13285.231s">So</a>  the aspect of being a good neighbor is important to us, and is one of the reasons we've had numerous meetings with residents, neighbors, and city departments, as well as interest groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13295.094s">On</a>  behalf of the Medford Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, our employees, our residents, our current residents, and those who will one day live in one of these apartments at Walkland Court, I thank you for the opportunity to come before you tonight and ask for your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13310.86s">Again,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13313.148s">Thank</a>  you, Director Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13314.449s">Thank</a>  you all for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13316.79s">Thank</a>  you for bearing with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13318.11s">We</a>  have considered this at this point several times as a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13321.912s">We</a>  passed the PDD3 zoning and a number of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13325.473s">So</a>  when we talk about an abbreviated presentation, we have seen this presentation several times at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13331.036s">We're</a>  well aware of what it contains. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13332.637s">I</a>  have one technical question for you, and then we'll open up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13338.599s">is</a>  the $50,000 for the tree fund, or for trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13343.181s">We'll</a>  leave tree fund for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13346.083s">Is</a>  that a condition of the Community Development Board recommendations? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13349.224s">Okay,</a>  so we'll need to do that along with the Community Development Board recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13353.246s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13353.646s">At</a>  this point, do councilors have any questions for the petitioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13359.709s">Any</a>  comments they'd like to make to Vice President Collins?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13364.531s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13365.652s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13367.073s">As</a>  President Bears said, we've had this conversation many times before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13371.536s">I</a>  think this is one of the first things that, I think this was the subject of one of my first committees of the whole in my first term. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13377.62s">It's</a>  been great to get to know this project very well through our various meetings about it as it's gone through its various approval stages with the CPA, the CBB. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13387.126s">It's</a>  exciting that we're getting to this stage and this very long, very considered process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13394.767s">Obviously,</a>  there's a lot to talk about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13396.889s">There's</a>  been a lot of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13397.97s">It's</a>  baked into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13400.853s">But</a>  for me, still the most compelling thing is preserving those 144 existing deeply affordable units, adding 94 deeply affordable units to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13412.543s">I</a>  think I said this the last time we talked about this, but it is so incredibly rare that we get the chance to make a double digit percentage increase towards our <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13420.831s">known</a>  affordable housing goals in the city, especially when we're leveraging funding that comes from outside of our community, our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13426.953s">It's,</a>  it's such a rare opportunity I know it's a value that shared behind this rail throughout so much of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13433.876s">And</a>  it's so important not only to be increasing affordable housing in the community but really <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13438.537s">excellent,</a>  dignified, affordable housing for people at all stages of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13443.72s">This</a>  is an area where I think Medford is really leading, and thank you so much to your leadership on this and making sure that this project is shepherded through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13449.623s">I</a>  don't have a lot of questions because I've had the opportunity to ask you tons of nitty gritty questions before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13457.768s">We</a>  haven't opened the public hearing yet, so I'll save my motion for later, but thank you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13462.791s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13465.466s">Yeah,</a>  I can.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13467.308s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13467.728s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13468.068s">And</a>  again, thank you for all you know that you've been in front of us many times and tonight wasn't an easy night, and appreciate you sticking through it I know that I think the biggest, the biggest feedback we get, there's always two sides and in talking to residents that are actually living in the court right now, and understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13489.83s">the</a>  quality of life increase that they're gonna go through, I think really weighed on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13494.894s">And</a>  I think that as we move forward and we talk about affordable housing and having family affordable housing, I think that's something you don't see too often, especially in such a dense community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13505.981s">And</a>  I think that the phone calls I received from a lot of people that were against it, I don't think they're really against the process and understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13515.728s">From</a>  what I heard really was a lack of really <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13519.429s">understanding</a>  through communication on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13523.572s">Something</a>  that I think that even if things don't go right, we have an opportunity that I've heard over and over again with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13530.736s">These</a>  are the biggest concerns that I hear is that in the neighborhood, in a densely populated area, that's the biggest fear they have and what's happening in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13539.321s">Now</a>  that existed way before this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13543.123s">But</a>  I also give us, there's an opportunity there as well that as we move forward with this project, and we have families and we have a place that everybody can use like you've talked about, and I think that revisiting the different traffic flows and making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13559.488s">We're</a>  there for the members of the community that are concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13562.991s">And</a>  again, like I said, I think my concern more isn't really with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13568.456s">It's</a>  really with the lack of communication or the lack of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13573.962s">See,</a>  I come from a service industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13577.485s">So</a>  an understanding when somebody doesn't like something, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13581.869s">All</a>  they need to do sometimes is just pick up the phone and talk to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13585.191s">So</a>  even if it's the same person 55 times I'm sure you guys have heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13588.992s">So</a>  and I think that that's the issue that I have with our administration that I find it a little lackluster and I and I hope they would work on that but other than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13600.339s">you</a>  know, it's, everything isn't most popular for everybody, but I think this is a project that really will, it's really thought through in the process that really would enhance the people, like I said, that live there now and really build their quality of life, what they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13617.023s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13618.523s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13619.823s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13620.944s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13621.924s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13623.59s">I,</a>  in a very similar manner as Council Columns and Councilor Scarpelli, want to thank you for the time that you've put into this project, I know it's been years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13634.563s">I</a>  think very importantly, you've put a lot of time to get to know the community to talk to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13640.249s">to,</a>  you know, sometimes you don't see eye to eye with them on things, but you talk and compromise and have made adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13647.434s">And</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13649.275s">You've</a>  coordinated a lot with city staff in a way that we wish every project were done in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13656.9s">And</a>  I think it's really important to underscore how rare it is for our city to have this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13661.944s">I</a>  think any municipality in Massachusetts would be kicking its heels to get at this opportunity and the opportunity like this to increase its affordable housing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13670.749s">to</a>  better the living conditions of the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13674.872s">I</a>  think it's really important to talk about how there'll be better ventilation in these buildings, there's better noise guards against outside noise in these buildings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13685.798s">There's</a>  more space, there are elevators. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13688.719s">seniors</a>  can get the care that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13691.28s">When,</a>  you know, Walken Court, when it was first designed, was state of its art. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13696.061s">But,</a>  you know, time changes, and needs change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13699.782s">And</a>  as those needs have changed, I'm very happy to see that the MHA has taken that into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13706.404s">I</a>  know it's not been the easiest process, and I know that, as Councilor Scarpell mentioned, there are still residents with some concerns, but I think you have negotiated in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13716.167s">to</a>  address those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13717.588s">And</a>  I'm also very happy to see that, to see the 50,000 in tree mitigation agreement that you've reached with trees, which I think speaks to that good faith negotiations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13731.279s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13733.58s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13736.752s">All</a>  right, whereas this is a public hearing, I'm going to open the public hearing to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13742.277s">People</a>  can give comment, put their comments on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13746.74s">They</a>  can comment that they're in favor, they're against, or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13750.263s">So</a>  I'm opening the public hearing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13752.585s">If</a>  you'd like to speak regarding this project, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom, and we will recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13760.472s">If</a>  you are in the room, I do ask that you just give your name and address to Messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13765.996s">Lepore,</a>  Lepore, who hates when I call him that, to Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13773.126s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13780.086s">On</a>  February 7th, the Community Development Board had a hearing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13786.17s">I</a>  don't have email, I don't have a computer, so my comments have to be made either in person or via letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13795.655s">I</a>  type a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13797.219s">On</a>  February 7th, I actually brought my comments in the letter to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13803.106s">I</a>  happened to bump into Chairman, President Bears, and I handed him his, and I also told him that I was going to bring copies for the rest of the council to the clerk's office, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13819.003s">in</a>  speaking to one Councilor, they did not receive my comments yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13824.045s">Either</a>  they didn't pick them up or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13826.626s">So</a>  I don't know if the rest of you got my comments or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13831.007s">But</a>  I wanna explain what happened on the Community Development Board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13836.028s">They,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13841.77s">First</a>  of all, they changed the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13843.131s">It</a>  was supposed to be held two weeks prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13845.532s">They</a>  had to send out a new notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13847.673s">And</a>  in that notice, the first notice said that you could respond by email or by voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13860.779s">Then</a>  they had to redo that because they didn't accept voicemails anymore because once before on a <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13868.163s">October</a>  4th meeting, they accepted voicemails, but then at the very end, they said there were five people who claimed that they were not gonna count their comments, even though they had advertised to send in voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13880.694s">Okay,</a>  so that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13881.835s">So</a>  now on the October 4th meeting, we had a meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13891.076s">They</a>  opened it up for public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13896.342s">Three</a>  people spoke in person, and then they closed the public comment portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13903.849s">Then</a>  Alicia Hunt mentioned that they had received my paper letter that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13910.436s">And</a>  she asked the chair if she had read them, and she said she did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13914.978s">And</a>  the rest of the board said they did not, well, they didn't respond at all, so I would assume that they didn't read them either. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13921.741s">So</a>  Director Hunt asked them if they wanted to have her read my comments, and they said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13928.205s">But</a>  Director Hunt briefly mentioned a couple of my topics with a questioning inflection voice, which, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13937.978s">appeared</a>  that she was confused about the points I was raising in my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13942.806s">I</a>  immediately tried to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13946.286s">I</a>  pressed six because I was on the phone, because I don't have email, and I can't do it electronically, but I wasn't recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13953.829s">So</a>  my comments that day didn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13956.49s">It</a>  was a public hearing, but my comments, they didn't read my letter, and they didn't let me respond when I tried to call in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13964.593s">Okay,</a>  that's the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13969.309s">So,</a>  if this Council did not receive or read my comments, I know Council did because I handed it to them, then this is the public comment period, public hearing didn't happen because my comments were not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13989.921s">I</a>  would propose that you not take a vote tonight, because you have not allowed the public to speak, me, and people like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14001.665s">So,</a>  there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14002.885s">I</a>  mean, I don't wanna go over the points in my letter to you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14008.907s">In</a>  that letter, I also mentioned that I had submitted a petition back in September, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14015.948s">and</a>  a letter along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14017.449s">So</a>  rather than reiterate all the comments in my letter, I just made reference to it, it was on file in the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14024.691s">So</a>  just for the new Councilors, here's the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14029.713s">1,131</a>  people signed the petition, not because we're opposed to affordable housing, not because we're opposed to them redeveloping Lockwood Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14043.311s">We</a>  in the neighborhood, we know it best, because these are immediate neighbors, are opposed to the design that's being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14052.695s">One</a>  of the issues is the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14054.516s">They</a>  did a traffic study, but it was only three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14060.899s">I</a>  spoke to Todd Blake this morning about this traffic study, and he said that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14069.183s">The</a>  traffic volume in our area between 2021 and 2023 has increased 78%. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14076.445s">And</a>  he said the traffic on Knott Street alone has increased by 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14083.248s">Now,</a>  the street, one of the streets, the two streets there connecting, going through Welcome Court, exits or enters, I don't know which way they're gonna put the direction, on Knott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14097.592s">And</a>  one of my concerns was the fact that it would become a very dangerous intersection, given the fact that it's at the foot of the North Street Bridge, which is very steep, and it's a truck road, and the trucks that deliver to Whole Foods, 18 Wheels, and the liquor store come down that bridge with momentum and speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14119.267s">If</a>  anyone from the New Rockland Court presents themselves in that intersection, it would be an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14127.722s">So</a>  I am proposing, if you all didn't read my letter, that this vote not be taken tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14136.39s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14137.05s">I</a>  don't know who said they didn't receive it, but your letter was included in the packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14140.874s">I</a>  watched Larry put them in the folders, so somebody didn't look at them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14144.737s">But</a>  did you read them prior to tonight?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14146.779s">I</a>  read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14147.18s">You</a>  did? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14147.96s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14148.14s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14148.881s">I</a>  can't speak for exactly what people have read, but I do know that the material was provided to them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14154.5s">But</a>  when is that folder provided, tonight?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14157.463s">We</a>  received it last Thursday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14158.884s">All</a>  right, well, I don't know, as I said, how many of them read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14165.41s">But</a>  the points, I don't want to go over all my points in my letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14169.594s">If</a>  they've all read it, they understand what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14172.785s">but</a>  there are concerns in the neighborhood for the design that's being presented, for the size of the complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14179.869s">We</a>  don't mind it being for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14182.471s">We</a>  don't mind it being redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14184.732s">We</a>  are concerned about the increase in, it's a very, you have to, I don't know if anyone's made a site visit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14192.676s">It's</a>  one thing seeing it on paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14195.728s">But</a>  it's another thing actually making a site visit and trying to visualize what it is that they're proposing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14205.431s">It's</a>  really a lot for a small lot with flaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14212.593s">So</a>  that's about all I want to say at the moment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14216.004s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14217.345s">I'm</a>  going to go to Tom Lincoln on Zoom next. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14220.927s">I</a>  also just want to say we did receive two written comments, at least I did by email. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14226.751s">I</a>  don't know what the clerk received. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14228.652s">One</a>  from Trees Medford regarding the $50,000 mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14234.716s">They</a>  said this is an excellent first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14236.957s">They</a>  made two points concerning the condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14240.217s">First,</a>  that the funds be exclusively to the cost of purchasing and planting additional trees, and they'd like that to be clear in the special permit language. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14247.679s">And</a>  the second, that the 50,000 represents about half of their estimated cost for mitigation, and that the Medford Housing Authority agreed to collaborate in the search for grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14258.322s">Of</a>  course, it is incumbent on the city of Medford to secure full mitigation funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14262.463s">to</a>  address the effects of climate change and the enhanced critical role of trees and climate resiliency and quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14269.444s">I</a>  will go to Tom Lincoln on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14272.045s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, Tom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14275.946s">Tom</a>  Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street, the Owl Rizzly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14280.987s">I'm</a>  kind of wearing the Trees Medford hat tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14285.708s">Council</a>  President Zach Baer stole most of our thunder here by reading the letter, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14291.656s">moving</a>  things along here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14293.938s">First,</a>  we want to say, I think I can speak for Trees Medford when working with them on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14299.922s">We</a>  are really happy that this project is adding so much affordable housing, which is certainly a huge societal and community need in Medford and probably just about everywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14316.072s">We</a>  look forward to working further with MHA on additional <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14322.06s">uh,</a>  tree plantings, uh, through, uh, 82 and et cetera, uh, on the outside, uh, of, of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14329.562s">Um,</a>  but it did want to reiterate a couple of things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14333.083s">One</a>  is, um, this project, uh, this tree cutting and the tree planting is really a first instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14341.485s">Uh,</a>  really a test case on the city's, uh, commitment to no net loss of tree canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14348.67s">I</a>  talked with Aggie Tudin recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14350.972s">I</a>  won't take her thunder either, but I think she's bringing out a report soon on her activities in terms of tree plantings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14359.657s">But</a>  the bottom line is that we are still behind the proverbial eight ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14364.54s">I</a>  don't know if you can use that expression anymore, but that is what comes to mind in terms of both the tree plantings, stump removal and tree plantings on that aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14379.968s">We</a>  at Trees Medford will, I'm hoping, have further proposals along these lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14390.275s">We</a>  really think, as our letter indicates, that making up the rest of the mitigation, which was very carefully calculated based on information from MHA, thank you, Gabe, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14405.488s">making</a>  up the rest of the deficit, so to speak, in terms of the trees cut, size of the trees cut versus trees planted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14415.31s">This</a>  really needs to come with help from the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14420.611s">And</a>  I don't know what the tree budget is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14423.412s">I'm</a>  understanding it's certainly bigger than it was when I moved here 500 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14429.059s">It</a>  wasn't 500 years ago, close to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14431.961s">It's</a>  certainly larger than that, but it certainly has not met the actual needs in terms of catching up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14440.968s">There've</a>  been many, many street trees cut down because they were all planted at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14446.993s">And</a>  there were many years, certainly I think in the late 80s and 90s, maybe beyond, which virtually no tree planting occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14457.61s">in</a>  Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14459.951s">But</a>  we're optimistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14461.712s">We're</a>  hoping for bigger and better things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14464.533s">This</a>  is an ongoing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14467.734s">And</a>  again, we appreciate the efforts of the MHA in this regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14475.237s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14476.918s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14477.898s">We'll</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14479.919s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14483.08s">Angela</a>  Murphy, 16 Codding Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14485.983s">I</a>  live in the neighborhood down the street a couple blocks from Walking Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14489.585s">I've</a>  been there 68 years when Walking Court was originally built. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14494.429s">And</a>  once again, I want to reiterate what Mary Ann said, that we are not against the proposed redevelopment site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14501.254s">We</a>  are concerned with the placement of the buildings on the site and the overcrowding that it's going to cause with all these <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14510.641s">new</a>  residents that are going to be accommodated there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14514.084s">It's</a>  a small site if any of you have ever been there, you can see that this site can handle just so much before it gets too crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14524.074s">And</a>  the placement if the housing authority really cared about seniors and disabled residents that the two six story buildings will house. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14533.863s">They</a>  would not place them parallel to the tracks with the back units only have an access to a view of train tracks and fumes and vibrations and noise, because knowing from experience that the condos that they built that Wellington up against the green line tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14551.294s">They</a>  people paid a million dollars there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14553.897s">And</a>  upon a person I know who worked in the condos, one woman complained because all she heard was noise, but yet they were guaranteed the windows would be soundproof and cut down on vibrations and things and they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14566.661s">So,</a>  concern for these vulnerable housebound residents looking out those windows and then they got the building, the six-story building across the other side of the tracks, that six stories are higher elevation, they're gonna be deprived most of the day of sunlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14583.734s">It's</a>  not gonna improve these seniors, all these disabled people's quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14589.378s">They're</a>  going to cut down green space, they're going to relegate the community gardens there to a corner of the lot, which is not conducive to growing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14597.982s">And</a>  the residents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14602.341s">they're</a>  not gonna have sufficient parking, which is gonna overspill these vehicles into the surrounding neighborhood, because they don't account for seniors who do still drive in their 70s and 80s, such as myself and everything, having an extra car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14618.392s">They</a>  don't count for all the visitors, the family members who might drive there and visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14623.756s">They</a>  don't count for caregivers who have to drive and park somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14627.739s">They</a>  haven't made an account, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14631.201s">any</a>  accommodations for these people and the people who are going to come to aid the residents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14639.564s">And</a>  my thing is that we're not opposed to redeveloping it, just rethink the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14647.747s">And</a>  as far as community meetings and public meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14652.309s">I</a>  was at a couple of those meetings, and each time I was verbally berated because I asked too many questions they didn't want to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14664.284s">And</a>  that was to one point where I was afraid to walk out because my vehicle was parked at Whole Foods next to the vehicle of the housing authority employee who berated me during the meeting was parked next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14678.619s">So</a>  I kind of held back and did not go to my cop and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14684.165s">It's</a>  not... <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14686.235s">a</a>  good plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14687.255s">It</a>  has lots of flaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14688.576s">If</a>  a thousand people in the surrounding community, including some residents who are afraid to voice their voice from walking court, are opposed to the placement in this proposal, they're pushing down our throats in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14702.381s">They</a>  need to rethink it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14703.541s">We</a>  need to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14704.682s">I</a>  was on the phone two and a half hours at that meeting that Marianne was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14709.884s">Not</a>  once was I unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14711.885s">Not</a>  once was I recognized as being <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14715.726s">a</a>  public person who had, I had to write a letter and take it the next day and hand it to the development board to tell them what I wanted to say on the phone that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14725.051s">And</a>  all they talked about was a conference or some kind of committee meeting they had to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14730.454s">They</a>  did not want to address anybody who may have had a comment opposing the current proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14736.997s">So</a>  please, I ask again, you do not vote on anything tonight considering what they're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14744.881s">and</a>  tell them to reconsider and go back and look at what they proposed and see if it's the right proposal for that particular complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14754.128s">It</a>  needs to be the beautiful, suburban, serene senior community that it was meant to be when it was built originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14762.215s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14763.036s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14765.558s">I'm</a>  going to go to Navar on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14773.342s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14781.907s">My</a>  public comment is that I support the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14786.629s">It</a>  shouldn't be downsized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14789.03s">If</a>  you were to respond to concerns by overcrowding, by downsizing the project, that would mean you're building less housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14796.895s">And</a>  the people who live there, they would, you know, they'd either be homeless, have to leave town, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14803.502s">Or</a>  perhaps, ironically, they would have to actually overcrowd with more roommates in some other unit somewhere in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14810.988s">There's</a>  not really many other possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14814.011s">So</a>  I don't think that's the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14817.414s">That</a>  means you're helping less people, you're achieving less housing, if you were to go that route. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14822.458s">But</a>  it's an important project as is, and I hope the city council approves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14828.584s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14832.025s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14832.387s">We'll</a>  go to anyone in the room who would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14834.838s">Mr.</a>  Cross, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14839.187s">Oh,</a>  is that on? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14839.827s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14840.788s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14841.668s">Ken</a>  Kraus, my home is at 50 Mystic Street in Medford, about four and a half blocks from the Walkling Court, albeit on the other side of the Mystic River, Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14856.674s">I</a>  just wanna register my support for the project as it was presented, as I did at the Community Development Board <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14864.637s">meeting</a>  on February 7th where the first speaker's letter was acknowledged at that meeting and summarized and shared with the board just for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14876.18s">Reworking</a>  of Wapping Court is decades overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14879.381s">Some</a>  of the building is still in its original condition for the 1960s. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14885.304s">It</a>  desperately needs to be brought up to the standards that people who live there deserve, particularly with regard to accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14893.007s">As</a>  I mentioned, there's no elevators in the buildings at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14898.889s">I</a>  think I'm especially excited about being able to add more units more affordable housing units as was mentioned, very rare community has an opportunity to do that with an existing site, especially excited about the addition of family housing as well the family component. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14918.357s">which</a>  is in bad need in the affordable family units. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14923.261s">And</a>  it'll add vitality and vibrancy to the neighborhood too, in a way that traditionally with complexes more geared towards seniors and people with disabilities might not have as much of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14936.331s">So</a>  I'm excited about that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14938.552s">I</a>  do think the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14940.974s">issues</a>  that have been brought up are sound ones that have been taken into consideration by the developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14950.284s">I</a>  think that the concern about parking is a little overstated in traffic just because the nature of the people that live in these type of facilities are not particularly car dependent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14959.894s">So</a>  I think that is, there's plenty of plenty of parking to accommodate the needs, though I think it would be wise to continue to find ways to accommodate people to get to and from the facility, and other means they didn't mention it but there's a large bike parking facility there for <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14978.118s">residents</a>  who can bike and guests as well, but look to make shuttles available to the nearby transit stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14987.825s">We</a>  continue to advocate for the not elimination of the 94 bus that goes by there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14993.97s">So</a>  the more we can do to improve conditions for bicycling and walking and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=14999.854s">shuttles</a>  and other ways to get to and from the facility will be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15004.316s">So</a>  I just want to register my support again and urge approval for the paper that's in front of you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15010.278s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15010.558s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15010.798s">I'm</a>  going to go to Carol on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15017.221s">Carol,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15020.622s">Yes,</a>  my name is Carol Koskulowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15022.583s">I</a>  live at 624 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15026.338s">I'm</a>  mindful of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15028.559s">I</a>  just wanted to voice my strong support for the proposal and for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15038.324s">I</a>  am in support of both preserving and adding deeply affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15045.567s">I</a>  appreciate the accessibility <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15053.931s">accommodations</a>  that are built into the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15058.539s">And</a>  I think it is a good move for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15063.066s">It's</a>  a unique opportunity that we should support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15067.553s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15070.316s">Thank</a>  you, Carol. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15071.456s">Mary</a>  Ann, I'm going to let people who haven't spoken yet speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15075.738s">So</a>  if there's anyone who'd like to speak in the chamber, and then there's one more person on Zoom, then I can come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15081.339s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15082.56s">And</a>  if you could leave it with the messenger, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15084.88s">Steve</a>  Dougherty, 55 Horn Avenue, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15087.981s">Tonight's,</a>  as you can tell by the color I'm wearing, I wasn't here for this issue, but it looks like an interesting project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15094.183s">But</a>  given the state of the economy these days, how is this being funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15100.626s">Can</a>  someone address that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15103.467s">That's</a>  a complicated question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15107.069s">There's</a>  a, I don't wanna speak for Jeff, but there's a lot of variety of funding, a small amount from the CPA, 800,000 of $145 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15120.635s">There's</a>  low income housing tax credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15122.956s">There's</a>  some state aid, maybe some ARPA.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15127.239s">I</a>  don't even know pretty much covered the rest the bulk of the money is coming from outside of Medford we've been relying on the CPA funds to get the project started in all there'll be 1.95 million of CPA funds, but for every $1 CPA funds, the housing authorities levering $58 of <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15147.17s">other</a>  resources primarily a combination of state and federal housing resources that will support the renovation be about $85 million in construction, but $116 million in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15164.629s">But</a>  it's a combination of federal low-income housing tax credits, Section 8 vouchers, some debt supported by the Section 8 vouchers, and as Executive Director Driscoll mentioned, we've received over $25 million of awarded funds from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to redevelop a property because of it being state public housing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15188.627s">So</a>  mostly state and federal, and it sounds like only 1 to 2% city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15193.053s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15193.574s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15193.955s">And</a>  so the CPA was only able to fund less than 2% of this project, which I think is an ideal outcome for the use of CPA funds in terms of return to the community.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15204.089s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15208.117s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Alex on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15211.318s">Alex,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15272.018s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_65]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15272.738s">Gianna</a>  Spontanetti, 126 Lincoln Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15276.421s">How</a>  do you expect to fund the 2%? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15278.743s">Can</a>  we elaborate on that from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15282.665s">I</a>  mean, from the city?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15283.866s">The</a>  city funds have already been approved from the CPA.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_65]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15286.673s">Okay,</a>  so is that coming from the homeowner when they sell their home?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15290.394s">It's</a>  the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15294.555s">It's</a>  already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15297.115s">It's</a>  the 1.5% CPA surcharge that's matched by state funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15300.976s">It</a>  goes to fund affordable housing, open space and recreation, and historical preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15308.097s">It's</a>  been in effect for about seven years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15309.478s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15526.687s">You're</a>  introducing two non-straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15528.749s">I</a>  just want to correct the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15531.071s">Mr.</a>  Crouse did not see my letter, so it was presumptuous to him to say it was summarized correctly in his comments that he just made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15543.242s">So</a>  I just wanted to set the record straight on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15548.96s">and</a>  the fact that the community board acknowledged that they hadn't read the comments that were delivered to them that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15559.246s">Even</a>  though Director Hunt basically just bullet-itemed the things that she thought should be mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15569.471s">But</a>  she didn't explain them, or she didn't read them, and they didn't want the memo read to her, read to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15575.614s">So,</a>  there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15579.375s">And</a>  I don't think the traffic study that was done was actually complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15588.722s">It</a>  was only done for three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15590.223s">And</a>  I don't think they captured enough correct information in three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15598.389s">So</a>  I just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15602.471s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15603.632s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15605.914s">Any</a>  further comment by members in person or on Zoom?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15611.701s">Thank</a>  you, Angela Murphy 16 Carding Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15615.924s">Once</a>  again, I want to say that from the beginning, there's only been one design proposal acceptable and presented to the residents in the abutting neighbors and the other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15628.772s">They</a>  haven't even considered any different proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15633.558s">All</a>  we're saying is that we know walking court needs to be redeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15637.964s">The</a>  buildings have left to deteriorate over 60 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15643.712s">common</a>  sense to rebuild them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15645.773s">But</a>  why cannot they consider a different proposal that won't overcrowd the site won't have such a negative impact on the surrounding neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15654.939s">I</a>  mean 1000 neighbors, both the mothers and surrounding neighbors in the street from winter street all the way down to almost high street in West Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15665.405s">Why</a>  are a thousand neighbors who are concerned and want to reconsider another proposal to reposition the new buildings on the site? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15676.229s">Can</a>  they not leave the nine buildings in the positions they are and go up two floors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15682.788s">and</a>  have some similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15684.549s">No,</a>  they want to overhaul the area, put too many people in a small place, limit green space, limit the quality of life for the seniors and the residents in that back building along the tracks, and they don't have any regard for them at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15699.601s">They're</a>  only proposing one set of plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15703.607s">And</a>  it doesn't fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15705.528s">And</a>  if you go down to the site and actually walk it and see it, you can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15711.291s">I</a>  don't think some of you even know what Rockland Court is, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15715.453s">Because</a>  to tell you the truth, it's a beautiful community and always has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15721.236s">And</a>  they proposed to build a projects there, a housing projects, not a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15728.359s">And</a>  I'll tell you, within a year, the residents there are going to be sorry they did.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15735.282s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15736.822s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15739.163s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15739.883s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15741.263s">You</a>  have some divine wisdom to share?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15744.144s">Just</a>  three simple questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15746.565s">Just</a>  name and address, just so we have it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15748.245s">Castagnetti</a>  Andrew from East Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15751.286s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15753.766s">Three</a>  questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15754.946s">What</a>  is the total cost of this project?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15758.676s">Um,</a>  but to the to the city, I believe the total city contribution is 1.95 million in CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15764.381s">Uh,</a>  the total cost is 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15765.441s">I</a>  get around 140 116,000,016 million and a total of how many units will end up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15773.447s">to</a>  238.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15773.607s">And</a>  this is strictly for Method residents, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15778.832s">That</a>  I'm, I can't answer I'm not sure how the public housing law works on that, but I do know that all the residents in that development have a right to return to it once it's complete.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15787.659s">Is</a>  this state, federal, or local?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15792.412s">It</a>  is managed by the Medford Housing Authority, but I believe this project is turning it from state public housing to federal public housing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15799.319s">I</a>  think I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15800.22s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15800.701s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15807.428s">Any</a>  further public comment?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15812.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15813.193s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15815.981s">Hi,</a>  I'm Javier Bellini, 42 Circuit Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15818.682s">So</a>  I was here for a different conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15821.443s">But</a>  in my observation, it looks like this is pretty much a done deal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15825.685s">I</a>  don't think anyone's opposed to the project in itself, the concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15831.248s">I</a>  really want to support the housing and city method. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15833.349s">I</a>  really want to support seniors and those with disabilities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15837.851s">I</a>  think a limited traffic study, anybody that really knows the area, it's not,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15845.862s">have</a>  trains at which, if you were walking to the Green Line from here, it's over a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15852.666s">From</a>  Dix to Wellington Station, we don't see people walking down the parkway in abundance to use the Orange Line and the Commuter Rail in the same station, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15864.093s">So</a>  I don't think we're gonna see that in the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15866.475s">If</a>  there are people who are not really driving, they're not gonna be getting on bicycles either, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15872.639s">So</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15875.549s">If</a>  you have 1,100 people signing a petition in an immediate area, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15883.152s">Is</a>  it too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15883.732s">I</a>  mean, everybody wants Rockland Court to be redeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15886.113s">It's</a>  falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15887.894s">I</a>  grew up in the area, and I know it, and that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15890.935s">But</a>  is this a case where it's too much on a restricted site? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15895.959s">Okay,</a>  so we should do the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15900.1s">However,</a>  we should consider is 238 units too much for the site to support? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15907.283s">And</a>  not disregard that it will put an additional strain on traffic in the area, additional parking in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15915.946s">And</a>  if you have 1100 people who live in the area, we should probably pause and see what their concerns are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15923.154s">So</a>  that's just my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15924.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15924.874s">Did</a>  you register your name with the messenger? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15927.295s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15928.936s">Any</a>  further public comment in this public hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15935.877s">Seeing</a>  none, the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15938.698s">We</a>  have the recommendations of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15942.099s">We</a>  have the request for a specific language to incorporate into the conditions from Therese Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15948.121s">And</a>  I will go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15951.22s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15952.36s">I</a>  would motion to, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15955.762s">Adopt</a>  the condition to approve and adopt the conditions recommended by the Community Development Board and adopt the. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15963.305s">Um.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15964.785s">I</a>  have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15967.746s">It's</a>  a that $50,000 mitigation payment to the city of Medford by the Medford Housing Authority will be exclusively for the cost of purchasing and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15983.863s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, Madam Clerk, please call the roll on the motion to approve and adopt the conditions of the Community Development Board for site plan review, as well as the language around the tree mitigation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16000.569s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16001.41s">I</a>  think we've lost Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16010.513s">Oh,</a>  she may be here actually, give me one second.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16024.585s">You</a>  can go through and come back.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16027.687s">Vice</a>  President Collins? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16029.068s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16029.288s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16143.412s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative, zero the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16144.953s">We</a>  revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16146.355s">Reports</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16147.296s">We</a>  have five reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16148.577s">Is</a>  there a motion to? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16153.001s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16153.622s">Motion</a>  to join and approve motions on the reports of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16158.307s">We</a>  have the subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs report. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16160.749s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16165.094s">We</a>  had a special permit meeting with Council Member Nygaard there and we discussed the signage for the restaurant that is being built in the Felswick Plaza.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16534.223s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16536.843s">The</a>  idea for this ordinance came out of conversations that I had with several members of city staff and several residents over the course of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16547.56s">residents</a>  were complaining about specific sidewalks and residential neighborhoods that were rendered impassable by vegetation starting on private properties that have grown so long that folks couldn't walk on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16559.17s">I've</a>  talked about this with code enforcement, and it seems like there may be a gap in our municipal code that prevents them from having the statute that they need to do enforcement when <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16569.258s">the</a>  public way is impacted by plant growth, essentially, from private properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16574.28s">So</a>  this would just be a really targeted project to make sure that there's enabling language in our code of ordinances so that code enforcement does have the ability to issue warnings and potentially tickets if need be when folks cannot travel on the public way because of stuff coming out of private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16591.669s">So</a>  I would move the question to proceed this along to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16740.998s">So</a>  this was an ordinance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16752.421s">This</a>  is an ordinance that we passed one year ago, actually just almost exactly a year ago, the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16894.237s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16895.618s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to the Committee on Planning and Permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16900.461s">Seconded</a>  by...

 <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17362.359s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that the council president request City <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17373.41s">for</a>  consideration in a Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, March 6, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17377.971s">Be</a>  it further resolved that, based on the schedule included in the soon-to-be finalized budget ordinance, the City Council and City Administration will follow the budget schedule for the FY 2025 City Budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17389.015s">By</a>  March 1, 2024, City Councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration by Administration and Finance Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17397.995s">By</a>  Friday, March 22nd, 2024, City Council submits collective budget recommended to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17405.464s">From</a>  April 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2024, City Council holds preliminary budget meetings with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17413.553s">By</a>  Friday, May 31st, 2024, mayor submits comprehensive budget proposal to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17419.684s">president</a>  bears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17420.404s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17422.065s">Uh,</a>  resolution is pretty self explanatory, but one of the things we've been working on in the former ordinances and rules and now the administration and Finance Committee, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17433.604s">is</a>  the budget ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17435.927s">And</a>  the framework of the budget ordinance has us working on the budget significantly earlier than we normally would. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17440.671s">We'll</a>  have it submitted to us in final form as it says here by May 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17444.935s">But</a>  also having preliminary budget meetings between April 15th and May 15th before the budget is released, which is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17452.103s">So</a>  we will have input before the budget comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17456.667s">and</a>  then we can hold further meetings in June as we decide at our discretion of different departments after the budget comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17464.551s">But</a>  I wanted to make sure, just realizing that we're coming up against it, we're not gonna have the ordinance passed, but we agreed in principle to follow the timeline within the ordinance for this budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17473.815s">So</a>  that requires us to get going pretty soon, March 1, if councilors have budget recommendations, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17481.099s">that</a>  they would like to send in for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17484.741s">Please</a>  send those to the city clerk who will submit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17488.344s">There's</a>  a typo in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17489.304s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17490.525s">It</a>  should say under by March 1st 2024 city councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration by committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17498.45s">So</a>  if we could amend the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17502.472s">We</a>  will then have a meeting on March 6th regarding those recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17507.815s">We</a>  can have further meetings as needed with our deadline of submitting them to the mayor by March 22nd, and then having preliminary meetings from April 15th to May 15th with the deputants of the various departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17521.65s">before</a>  the mayor submits the comprehensive budget proposal on May 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17524.972s">So</a>  I think this is a significant upgrade to the past where we've gotten budgets at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17531.915s">We</a>  haven't had consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17533.016s">We</a>  haven't had meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17533.696s">We</a>  haven't had the time to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17535.677s">We</a>  certainly haven't had our <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17537.778s">recommendations</a>  duly considered before the budget was released. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17541.96s">So</a>  I invite all councillors to submit and we can discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17546.841s">And</a>  I am continually hopeful that the administration will meet us where we are on this and help us have a much more robust budget process over four months of where in the past it has happened in four weeks or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17561.647s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17563.69s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17565.791s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17568.371s">Appreciate</a>  the effort Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17571.112s">I</a>  know that as the mayor talked to you about what the fiscal outlook so far, I mean, is it something that are we looking to? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17582.685s">I</a>  don't want to make these, you know, when you look at going through this exercise, I think it's super important because it's a step closer to where we want to be and what we haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17593.197s">But</a>  I also realize that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17596.365s">I</a>  don't want to make it a dog and pony show, or go through the process and look and see what I want to request when we're hearing that we're already 2.4 in the hole, 2.5 in the hole in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17607.848s">So</a>  I think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17612.649s">I'm</a>  going to follow through with the requests that I'll have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17615.73s">But</a>  from what I'm hearing on the state side, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17622.515s">Our</a>  governor isn't giving a rosy picture of what we'll be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17625.959s">And</a>  without ARP ARESA, it just, it's frightening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17630.024s">I</a>  think people need to realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17632.107s">But</a>  again, what I, what I do appreciate is something that we've talked about for years here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17637.675s">especially</a>  when we talk about neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17639.777s">I've</a>  been in my process personally with my department for the last two months and making sure that our council gets that information so they can make reasonable decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17651.87s">So</a>  I applaud your effort with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17654.112s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17663.956s">Just</a>  to that question, had some conversations there has not been numbers included those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17670.918s">My</a>  understanding is that we are still in a similar place to where we were a year ago with what we were discussing the fiscal 24 budget that fiscal 25 was going to be a cliff year with the ARPA and ESSER funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17686.525s">I</a>  completely understand your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17687.766s">I</a>  think my first hope is we can come up with our initial recommendations and then have discussions while we start to get the information from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17694.551s">I</a>  have heard from several department heads that they did get requests to start putting together their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17700.656s">Library</a>  trustees had a meeting with the mayor last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17703.218s">So</a>  I think we're seeing some movement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17707.001s">I</a>  think personally, it's just my philosophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17710.78s">know</a>  we all know that we we've had a million times agreed we need five people for a sidewalk crew or whatever you know we know they're probably not going to happen this year but i think it's important to let people know we need it that's just my philosophy but i think more importantly uh if there are positions that are federal funded ARPA funded ESSER funded that we say are like we can't be losing this one those are the kinds of recommendations we may be in that kind of year like <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17732.799s">we</a>  really need one to stay on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17735.401s">And</a>  that's a tough, you know, obviously we don't wanna be picking and choosing it, but if that's where we are, that may be the kind of recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17743.846s">I'd</a>  much rather be making a recommendation to do something new than save something we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17747.889s">But</a>  that's, I think that should be considered as part of this process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17750.73s">If</a>  there's a position or a program that any councilor identifies that is, you know, we really would like to keep it going.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17757.915s">I</a>  think we amend that this just if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17760.096s">Yeah,</a>  because I think that if we can ask the city administration for the positions that are funded by opera that we possibly lose because the rumor is that the buzz around the city hall was Penelope's position, even though she left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17774.841s">was</a>  part of ARPA, and I think the fear of not being rehired might have played an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17779.782s">I</a>  don't know if that's true, but, you know, these things that we want to get, you know, if we can get that to understand that's to your point, it'll be good to move this forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17787.103s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17787.903s">I</a>  accept the amendment happily to request the list of ARPA positions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17797.365s">Are</a>  there any other comments from my fellow councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17800.426s">Any</a>  members of the public that would like to speak on this paper?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17806.555s">Steve</a>  Darby, 55 Horn Avenue Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17808.657s">I</a>  don't know if it's directly related, but when you mentioned the budget, since as of four o'clock tomorrow, or four o'clock today, the fire department doesn't have a chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17820.964s">Who's</a>  going to submit the budget for the fire department?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17829.79s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17831.991s">Seeing</a>  no further comment on the motion of <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17835.486s">President</a>  Bears as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17925.842s">Hi,</a>  this is Alyssa Scott, 132 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17929.765s">And</a>  I don't normally attend these meetings, but I attended because someone had posted on a social media page that there would be discussions around rent stabilization, discussions around rent control and transfer fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17948.776s">Is</a>  this something that is on the docket for discussion at some point? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17952.399s">Is</a>  this something that's already in <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17954.46s">and</a>  play, it's sort of hard to follow as a layman.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17958.281s">Transfer</a>  fee was on the agenda, but it was postponed to our next regular meeting on March 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17964.044s">Discussions</a>  on rent stabilization and other tenant rights and tenant protections is currently in the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17971.787s">Do</a>  you have a date for the next discussion on that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17975.828s">Not</a>  confirmed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17976.848s">Okay,</a>  so it is in planning and permitting, but we do not have a confirmed date for the next discussion on those items.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17982.33s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17983.471s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17993.676s">Hello,</a>  Mike Kroll, 32 Right Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17997.038s">I</a>  actually was attending for the same reason, so a little disappointed that now that it is, what, after midnight to find that we won't be speaking about those topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18009.251s">how</a>  will it be best to keep track of when those discussions will be had in front of the City Council?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_55]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18017.29s">So</a>  the city council meets every Tuesday and Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18021.112s">Generally,</a>  there are some exceptions to that, holidays, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18026.196s">And</a>  our agendas are available at medfordma.org for the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18030.979s">That</a>  meeting is every second and fourth Wednesday at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18035.321s">So</a>  that is where the rent stabilization petition is currently under consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18041.045s">however,</a>  no confirmed date for the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=18043.848s">And</a>  for the transfer fee, that will be on the agenda for our March 12th regular meeting.</p>
