    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=674.082s">All</a>  right, <a href="../resolutions/24-046.pdf"><font color="green">24-046</font></a>, request to exempt Fire Chief position from civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=679.746s">February</a>  15th, 2024, to Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, re-removal of Fire Chief position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=689.753s">Dear</a>  President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable body vote to submit a request pursuant to Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Amendments to the Constitution <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=702.341s">of</a>  Massachusetts, as amended by Article 89, that state senator name and state representative name submit special legislation to the general court seeking to remove the position of fire chief in Medford Fire Department from the civil service law, General Law Chapter 31, which would divest the position from all rights and obligations set forth in General Law Chapter 31, your vote, and the legislation would have no effect on civil service status of any other member of the fire department or any other employee of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=732.145s">The</a>  special act would provide as follows, an act exempting the position of fire chief in the city of Medford from the civil service law, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=744.596s">Section</a>  one, the position of fire chief in the city of Medford shall be exempt from chapter 31 of the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=750.561s">Section</a>  two, section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person holding the position of fire chief in the city on the effective act of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=758.453s">Section</a>  three, this act shall take effect upon its passage by way of background of the approximately 102 municipal fire departments that are subject to the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=768.442s">Approximately</a>  51 departments or 50% have a civil service chief in recent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=772.967s">Municipalities</a>  have sought to accept the position of fire chief from chapter 31 for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=777.911s">Among</a>  one of the main reasons that municipalities have sought to exempt the position from Chapter 31 is because once a fire chief is appointed under the current civil service system, they are essentially lifetime appointments and the procedures which the municipality would have to follow to make a change in the position and the standard the municipality would have to satisfy in order to do so are avoidably burdensome with the ever-changing nature and fluidity of the fire profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=800.192s">Currently,</a>  the needs of the city maintain little notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=803.795s">The</a>  chief needs to be able to quickly change, adapt, and work with the changing needs of the city to ensure proper supervision of the department and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=813.541s">By</a>  removing the position from civil service, the city would be able to annually evaluate the chief's performance on a predetermined contractual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=820.304s">The</a>  city would have the ability to negotiate removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=823.226s">and</a>  non reappointment clauses with the individual in the position rather than being bound to the de facto lifetime appointment that comes with the civil service law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=830.549s">The</a>  city additionally would not be bound to the constructive measures that exist in civil service relative to appointments to the position of fire chief under civil service and applicant pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=839.352s">is</a>  generally limited and certain scenarios are utilized when either a test or assessment center is administered for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=849.079s">In</a>  order to post a test, the city must work with the understaffed civil service HRD unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=853.502s">This</a>  requires back and forth of multiple forms and processes that are generally unnecessary or redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=858.766s">Subjects</a>  must create online profiles, submit more required forms and documents electronically, and pay fees to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=865.151s">The</a>  city must then wait for civil service to process all forms and payments, which can take months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=870.634s">They</a>  must then conduct a bid for a vendor to deliver the exam and arrange a date that works for the city, the vendor, and for a civil service representative to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=877.297s">This</a>  again pushes up the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=879.338s">Outside</a>  of the constraints of civil service and through its own procurement process, the city would solicit bids from vendors who have experience in conducting fire service assessment centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=887.302s">For</a>  a fire chief, the request for proposals would seek a qualified consultant to design, validate, administer, and score an assessment center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=894.605s">In</a>  order to create a promotional eligible list from which to promote a candidate to the position, the city would be able to offer a better test to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants that could draw interest from applicants throughout the Commonwealth as well as nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=907.355s">This</a>  process would better allow the city and fire department to evolve, maximize its budget, manage the department and fill a vital position in a more expedited manner through its own appointment process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=917.583s">the</a>  city would be in a better position to diversify the department without jumping through hoops that civil service requires when asking for specialized certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=925.088s">It</a>  would also allow the city more flexibility on the quote scenarios presented during the test by removing the fire chief from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=933.593s">The</a>  city would be replacing an outdated and cumbersome procedure with an updated and efficient one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=938.796s">Given</a>  the fire chief's pending retirement and the resulting vacancy in the position, now is the opportune time for the council to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=944.759s">The</a>  removal of the fire chief from civil service will serve to propel the department in the right direction going forward, and it would be in the best interest of the residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=952.163s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=953.783s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Brianne Alamogordo, mayor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=986.064s">Okay,</a>  we will go to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=989.605s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=993.417s">On</a>  the call with me, you just heard from Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=997.239s">We</a>  also have Lisa Crowley, our Human Resource Director, as well as Attorney Brian Mazur for any legal questions you may have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1005.843s">I</a>  think the paper speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1008.084s">Thank</a>  you for reading it fully, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1012.686s">The</a>  position of Fire Chief <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1015.956s">became</a>  vacant as of a week ago when the chief freedman put in his retirement papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1023.661s">So</a>  I want to thank him for his service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1026.803s">But</a>  it became an opportunity for the city, like many others that have come before us, to request to remove the position from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1037.95s">As</a>  you heard, out of 300 plus 51 cities and towns, there's only 100 <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1045.68s">um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1046.9s">In</a>  civil service and there's only 50 that haven't removed the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1050.881s">So</a>  out of 351 cities and towns Only 50 are restricted by civil service guidelines and what civil service does is creates a very stringent process not allowing the city to have a broad candidate pool, which includes members of our own department if they choose to have interest in the position and I think modernizing the position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1075.749s">making</a>  it more open, competitive, with the goal of hiring the best candidate from a broad pool of applicants, is in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1086.479s">And</a>  I ask that council support this paper this evening so we can move forward and modernize the way that it's done, the process, so we can get the best candidate for the city of Medford to lead our fire department.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1103.302s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1105.023s">We'll</a>  go to members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1107.825s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1109.967s">Zack?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1110.267s">All</a>  right, just if we could close the doors, please, again, I ask so we can hear in the room and hear everyone's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1115.951s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1117.592s">So</a>  with all due respect, what the mayor has just said and what you just read is completely crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1125.538s">This</a>  is a joke and this is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1143.015s">What</a>  we're seeing right now is we're seeing action that's being taken by this mayor that has negatively affected multiple departments, multiple people, good people in this community, good people that's worked for the city and found a way to destroy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1160.463s">And</a>  I know I'm reading, I read some posts that all of a sudden the mayor is some kind of right fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1165.425s">We</a>  don't need a right fighter, we need a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1167.486s">We</a>  need a leader that's gonna make decisions that's best for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1184.127s">We</a>  are, this is what, these are the phone calls I've gotten, I've received this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1189.228s">The</a>  school budget, $2.4 million, $2.5 million in the hole this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1197.93s">We</a>  still have questions within our school system of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1202.352s">We</a>  still have questions about our paraprofessionals and whether we have enough teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1209.113s">We're</a>  talking about a situation that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1212.472s">that</a>  you're looking across the city and you're seeing good people getting hurt and the mayor spending good money that belongs to the city to do things on her own agenda, chasing around city employees and paying for private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1228.03s">paying</a>  good money for private investigators, and then the results come back that the city is fraudulent, leaving us into a world of hurt when it comes to finances, and when it comes to what the budget's gonna look like, because what we have to pay people in penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1244.998s">We</a>  have probably the one of best, best employees I've ever worked with than Aleesha Nunley, a former finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1252.501s">was</a>  fighting and suing the city now going after the city because the way this man treated her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1257.164s">And</a>  I believe the comments were that that that at the time that they wanted to have a white male present the budget because she didn't feel that this council would listen to a woman of color, which is which is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1275.578s">And</a>  I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1276.839s">But</a>  what I want to what I find more appalling is this situation right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1282.245s">Everybody</a>  in this community, I've been reading things going back and forth and trying to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1286.571s">It's</a>  a disgrace if anybody's trying to support this for the fact that everybody works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1290.577s">And</a>  when you go to work, you're given a certain criteria of what you can and what you can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1296.044s">And</a>  all this doesn't stem from anything about equity or what 350 other cities are doing in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1303.949s">This</a>  is retribution, this is an attack against an issue that occurred that left our firefighters speechless because it was then called an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1313.594s">So</a>  they couldn't tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1315.736s">What</a>  I do know of the men and women that are our firefighters, they earned the right to have sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1321.977s">And</a>  if I asked these firefighters to raise their hand if they have over 100 days or 200 days saved or 300 days saved, I can guarantee you, Mr. President, the majority of this room hands will go up in red. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1333.169s">Because</a>  that's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1335.132s">What's</a>  been the only constant since the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1338.315s">The</a>  only constant <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1340.735s">are</a>  men and women in fire that have done anything that this city has needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1346.377s">And</a>  we hear rhetoric that our facilities, that the mayor's put money toward the facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1351.159s">That's</a>  a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1353.3s">Well,</a>  the money that was put into those facilities are just barely getting by so they're safe and where they stay every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1360.796s">When</a>  we talked about what happened the other day, and this is all fraudulent, and this was some sort of pre-planned, where does it say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1370.741s">What</a>  investigation said that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1373.363s">Because</a>  all the firefighters I talked to is that they have sick time, and all they did was use the days that they're supposed to take if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1383.154s">And</a>  then I heard, well, what's shocking is they called sick in the morning, but miraculously show up at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1390.064s">Miraculously,</a>  that's who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1392.407s">They're</a>  coming in sick because they don't have coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1396.704s">So</a>  what I find appalling, you're talking about wasted money, setting a dialogue that this financial budget coming this year is going to be disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1405.67s">I</a>  will warn everybody, don't be shocked if this mayor presents cuts for fire, police, DPW, custodians, teachers, because we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1415.075s">The</a>  state has already reported that people that I've talked to, that we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1419.278s">We</a>  have no more ESSA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1420.478s">We</a>  have no more ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1422.019s">We</a>  have 60 positions that we're going to lose that are sponsored by those monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1426.78s">So</a>  maybe this is a dialogue that says City of Medford, they're not listening because until tonight, there haven't been many people listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1435.663s">The</a>  City of Medford, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1438.226s">We</a>  have the firefighters that are using this and wasting $93,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1442.189s">The</a>  president from the fire department is gonna come up and I hope he explains the situation, why we're wasting money on a deputy, I believe a deputy that's over time, I believe almost $50,000 that we've paid because the mayor will not promote that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1460.721s">You</a>  wanna talk about hypocrisy? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1463.018s">This</a>  is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1464.081s">We</a>  have teachers that are getting a check every week because they're not getting their prep time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1471.343s">that's</a>  costing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1474.385s">Because</a>  they're not doing the job correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1476.706s">Now</a>  we have a council that's been talking about overrides and talking about other ways to create money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1483.03s">There's</a>  one reason that we're gonna be in a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1486.112s">Because</a>  the way we've managed our fiscal funds in this community in the last four years, we have no development, we have no movement, we have no new money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1496.378s">And</a>  you wanna turn and look at the fight of the economy to blame them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1499.139s">Shame</a>  on you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1515.799s">I</a>  want to close with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1522.686s">Did</a>  any of you speak to the mayor personally? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1526.77s">Anyone</a>  in the room?</p>

    <p>[Ricky Cormio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1527.791s">Any</a>  councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1530.133s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1531.114s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.015s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.415s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1532.996s">That's</a>  over to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1533.837s">You</a>  all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1534.838s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1535.218s">It's</a>  shocking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1538.301s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1539.85s">So</a>  it's not illegal, you can talk to each individual, not as a group, but this is what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1545.896s">There's</a>  a dialogue being sent, and I implore to my fellow Councilors that no matter what's happened in this community, no matter what we've looked at and said, whatever has divided this community, because there's been a lot, but there's been one constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1564.025s">one</a>  constant, no matter what, whether they didn't get their raise for years, whether their facilities are deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1571.65s">whether</a>  they're waiting for their retro checks, there's one constant, the fire department's still strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1577.655s">And</a>  the dialogue that's being spun, that Chief Friedman, shame on you firefighters, because the reason why Chief Friedman left is because of your entitled ignorance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1589.024s">That's</a>  a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1591.106s">What</a>  I'm hearing is the total opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1593.488s">He</a>  left because he's never been talked to as an individual, as a professional, the way this administration talks to their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1613.736s">So</a>  I ask, what's the other constant? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1616.679s">No</a>  city solicitor, nobody that we can call to talk and ask what our direction should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1623.765s">We</a>  haven't had stability in most any of our department heads in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1630.811s">We've</a>  had turnover and I think every position <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1635.046s">When</a>  we went for a new chief, I didn't see the mayor come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1638.248s">The</a>  dialogue wasn't the mayor coming up and setting this out saying, the chief of police, we need to do this because of X, Y, and Z and everything you read, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1646.472s">She</a>  didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1648.113s">But</a>  all of a sudden, the fire department who stand strong with their convictions and stand strong for what they believe in in our community and do the right thing every single day, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1659.332s">the</a>  firemen that have the right to use their sick time have the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1664.479s">So</a>  it's not their fault that we don't find enough firefighters that we protect our staff just in case this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1672.008s">We</a>  don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1673.831s">We</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1676.067s">But</a>  it's these firefighters after this incident came out, and an irate mayor went public, went to the news authorities, knowing that these people couldn't defend themselves by calling it a criminal act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1690.555s">And</a>  then come to us for a paper to give her control? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1698.646s">Please,</a>  I beg all of you, do not even consider this because this is one constant that has worked no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1707.736s">One</a>  thing I heard from these firefighters and their families and their families, when they watch their families, their loved ones leave the house to go to work, they don't know if they're going to come home. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1718.39s">But</a>  what they do have is they have each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1720.891s">And</a>  by bringing someone in from the outside, you're gonna disrupt that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1728.015s">The</a>  goal to say that the delay in all this is a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1733.718s">We</a>  have capable, qualified firefighters that can step in as an interim chief while this process moves the way it's supposed to in the civil process like we've always done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1755.354s">So</a>  I'll leave you with this, for those people who know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1761.781s">Chief</a>  Sacco, Chief Giliberti, Chief Freeman, Chief Buckley, civil servants, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1768.849s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1770.391s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1771.272s">They</a>  were pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1772.834s">They've</a>  led our city in some tough times and they've done a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1777.188s">Why</a>  would we even consider, why would we even consider changing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1781.17s">This</a>  shouldn't even be a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1783.951s">So</a>  I appreciate and thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1785.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1797.956s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, we're gonna go to other councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1800.998s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1804.079s">President</a>  Bears, are you able to answer questions if you know the answer?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1807.714s">if</a>  I ask you questions.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1810.737s">Do</a>  the firefighters have a contract right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1812.538s">Are</a>  they working with a contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1813.419s">My</a>  understanding is yes, there's a signed contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1815.921s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1817.283s">The</a>  change in the designation of the fire chief, what impact would it have on the rank and file firefighters, do you know?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1822.888s">According</a>  to this proposal, it would not change their civil service status. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1827.152s">It</a>  would just change who is able... It says the law specifically says <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1834.366s">The</a>  section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1837.768s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1838.308s">The</a>  position of fire chief for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1840.269s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1844.812s">That's</a>  as it's written.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1850.055s">My</a>  understanding is when everybody called out sick at the same time early this month, that since it's the fire department and there can still be fires and disruption and emergencies that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1864.635s">Somebody</a>  will get called in to cover those shifts and those people that get called in get paid overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1873.717s">Do</a>  you know if that's true?</p>
