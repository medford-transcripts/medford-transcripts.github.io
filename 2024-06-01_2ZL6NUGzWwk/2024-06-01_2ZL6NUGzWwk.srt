[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, I have.

155
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,354
[SPEAKER_55]: Great.

156
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,016
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

157
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:53,756
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

158
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,037
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

159
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:56,357
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

160
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:58,258
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lazzaro?

161
00:07:59,219 --> 00:07:59,479
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

162
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:00,860
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Leming?

163
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,680
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

164
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,141
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

165
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:03,561
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

166
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:04,782
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Tseng?

167
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:04,862
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

168
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,187
[SPEAKER_39]: President Diaz.

169
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,287
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, none in the negative.

170
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,468
[SPEAKER_55]: The motion passes and the warrant is accepted.

171
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,168
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

172
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,148
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, everyone.

173
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:19,609
[SPEAKER_55]: Please vote Tuesday, March 5th, or at early voting or by mail.

174
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:28,371
[SPEAKER_55]: 24-039, request to accept the provisions of MGL, Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22G, related to the real estate tax exemptions for qualifying veterans.

175
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:34,312
[SPEAKER_55]: I will welcome our assessor, Ted Costigan, for explanation and comment.

176
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:35,192
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Costigan.

177
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:36,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, Council.

178
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:51,642
[SPEAKER_22]: The city allows last year 226 wounded disabled veterans and their surviving spouses a tax exemption, ranging from $800 to a full exemption depending on their, their status.

179
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:54,185
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm asking tonight the council adopt.

180
00:08:55,486 --> 00:09:14,652
[SPEAKER_22]: The President indicated Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22G, which would allow this benefit to expand to wounded veterans that have a disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs that own their house in certain trusts and conservatorships.

181
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:16,733
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm asking for the option of that.

182
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:25,189
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, and Mr. Costigan, just to clarify, this is just enabling certain types of ownership to be eligible for the veteran's exemption of the property tax levy?

183
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:25,829
[SPEAKER_22]: That's correct.

184
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:26,489
[SPEAKER_55]: Great, thank you.

185
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,090
[SPEAKER_55]: Any questions, members of the council?

186
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,291
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng?

187
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,211
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Costigan.

188
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:35,554
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to check and make sure, are we maxing out the exemption for seniors and vets?

189
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:36,835
[SPEAKER_22]: That's correct.

190
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,857
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, that's helpful, and I think good for the residents of our city.

191
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:40,577
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.

192
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,238
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Mr. Costigan.

193
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,338
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further questions?

194
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:45,720
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Collins?

195
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:47,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

196
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:49,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being here tonight.

197
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Assessor Costigan, just the basic bullet points for what this new exemption would does.

198
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:11,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad that in the past couple of years, the council has been able to take votes to make sure that we are maxing out the exemptions for these populations in Medford that I think uncontroversially, we want to extend these benefits to populations very deserving of the tax break that the city can provide.

199
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be happy to motion for approval to adopt this tonight.

200
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,262
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a motion to approve.

201
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:18,902
[SPEAKER_55]: Second.

202
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:19,242
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

203
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,845
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

204
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,368
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

205
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,170
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callaghan.

206
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:30,131
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

207
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:32,613
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

208
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:33,754
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

209
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:35,535
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lazzaro.

210
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:36,116
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

211
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,497
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Leming.

212
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:37,937
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

213
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,278
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scapelli.

214
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:39,679
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

215
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,920
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Tseng.

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,040
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

217
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:42,655
[SPEAKER_39]: President Bears.

218
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,697
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, I mean affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

219
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:50,082
[SPEAKER_55]: And I saw in your request there is no waiver or extended advertising because we're adopting state law.

220
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:50,583
[SPEAKER_55]: So you're good.

221
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:51,103
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

222
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:51,724
[SPEAKER_55]: Appreciate it.

223
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:52,084
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

224
00:10:52,104 --> 00:11:02,475
[SPEAKER_55]: Thanks.

225
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,257
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Simpons, could you read me back the order again?

226
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, after that one we just voted on, which was 24039, next up is 24046.

227
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

228
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:19,226
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, 24046, request to exempt Fire Chief position from civil service law.

229
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:29,713
[SPEAKER_55]: February 15th, 2024, to Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, re-removal of Fire Chief position from civil service.

230
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:41,500
[SPEAKER_55]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable body vote to submit a request pursuant to Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Amendments to the Constitution

231
00:11:42,341 --> 00:12:08,858
[SPEAKER_55]: of Massachusetts, as amended by Article 89, that state senator name and state representative name submit special legislation to the general court seeking to remove the position of fire chief in Medford Fire Department from the civil service law, General Law Chapter 31, which would divest the position from all rights and obligations set forth in General Law Chapter 31, your vote, and the legislation would have no effect on civil service status of any other member of the fire department or any other employee of the city of Medford.

232
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:24,056
[SPEAKER_55]: The special act would provide as follows, an act exempting the position of fire chief in the city of Medford from the civil service law, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows.

233
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:30,041
[SPEAKER_55]: Section one, the position of fire chief in the city of Medford shall be exempt from chapter 31 of the general laws.

234
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:37,427
[SPEAKER_55]: Section two, section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person holding the position of fire chief in the city on the effective act of the state.

235
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:48,002
[SPEAKER_55]: Section three, this act shall take effect upon its passage by way of background of the approximately 102 municipal fire departments that are subject to the civil service law.

236
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:52,927
[SPEAKER_55]: Approximately 51 departments or 50% have a civil service chief in recent years.

237
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:57,331
[SPEAKER_55]: Municipalities have sought to accept the position of fire chief from chapter 31 for various reasons.

238
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:20,132
[SPEAKER_55]: Among one of the main reasons that municipalities have sought to exempt the position from Chapter 31 is because once a fire chief is appointed under the current civil service system, they are essentially lifetime appointments and the procedures which the municipality would have to follow to make a change in the position and the standard the municipality would have to satisfy in order to do so are avoidably burdensome with the ever-changing nature and fluidity of the fire profession.

239
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:23,195
[SPEAKER_55]: Currently, the needs of the city maintain little notice.

240
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:33,080
[SPEAKER_55]: The chief needs to be able to quickly change, adapt, and work with the changing needs of the city to ensure proper supervision of the department and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

241
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:40,224
[SPEAKER_55]: By removing the position from civil service, the city would be able to annually evaluate the chief's performance on a predetermined contractual basis.

242
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:42,386
[SPEAKER_55]: The city would have the ability to negotiate removal.

243
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:49,989
[SPEAKER_55]: and non reappointment clauses with the individual in the position rather than being bound to the de facto lifetime appointment that comes with the civil service law.

244
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:58,512
[SPEAKER_55]: The city additionally would not be bound to the constructive measures that exist in civil service relative to appointments to the position of fire chief under civil service and applicant pool.

245
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:08,419
[SPEAKER_55]: is generally limited and certain scenarios are utilized when either a test or assessment center is administered for the position.

246
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,042
[SPEAKER_55]: In order to post a test, the city must work with the understaffed civil service HRD unit.

247
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:18,146
[SPEAKER_55]: This requires back and forth of multiple forms and processes that are generally unnecessary or redundant.

248
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:24,631
[SPEAKER_55]: Subjects must create online profiles, submit more required forms and documents electronically, and pay fees to the Commonwealth.

249
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:29,333
[SPEAKER_55]: The city must then wait for civil service to process all forms and payments, which can take months.

250
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:37,257
[SPEAKER_55]: They must then conduct a bid for a vendor to deliver the exam and arrange a date that works for the city, the vendor, and for a civil service representative to be present.

251
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:38,717
[SPEAKER_55]: This again pushes up the timeline.

252
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:47,262
[SPEAKER_55]: Outside of the constraints of civil service and through its own procurement process, the city would solicit bids from vendors who have experience in conducting fire service assessment centers.

253
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:53,865
[SPEAKER_55]: For a fire chief, the request for proposals would seek a qualified consultant to design, validate, administer, and score an assessment center.

254
00:14:54,605 --> 00:15:06,815
[SPEAKER_55]: In order to create a promotional eligible list from which to promote a candidate to the position, the city would be able to offer a better test to a larger and more diverse pool of applicants that could draw interest from applicants throughout the Commonwealth as well as nationally.

255
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:16,863
[SPEAKER_55]: This process would better allow the city and fire department to evolve, maximize its budget, manage the department and fill a vital position in a more expedited manner through its own appointment process.

256
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:24,387
[SPEAKER_55]: the city would be in a better position to diversify the department without jumping through hoops that civil service requires when asking for specialized certification.

257
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:32,993
[SPEAKER_55]: It would also allow the city more flexibility on the quote scenarios presented during the test by removing the fire chief from civil service.

258
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:38,175
[SPEAKER_55]: The city would be replacing an outdated and cumbersome procedure with an updated and efficient one.

259
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:44,259
[SPEAKER_55]: Given the fire chief's pending retirement and the resulting vacancy in the position, now is the opportune time for the council to act.

260
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,542
[SPEAKER_55]: The removal of the fire chief from civil service will serve to propel the department in the right direction going forward, and it would be in the best interest of the residents of the city.

261
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:53,743
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you for your attention to this matter.

262
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,065
[SPEAKER_55]: Respectfully submitted, Brianne Alamogordo, mayor.

263
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:56,865
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

264
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,868
[SPEAKER_55]: I would like to recognize the administration so they can present the paper before we move to council comment.

265
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:02,388
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

266
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:03,739
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

267
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,600
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Chief of Staff.

268
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

269
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the opportunity.

270
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:20,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to request, Mr. President, if the council could please provide the mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, the opportunity to speak.

271
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:21,303
[SPEAKER_11]: She's on the call.

272
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:27,645
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, we will go to the mayor.

273
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears and City Council

274
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:37,179
[SPEAKER_06]: On the call with me, you just heard from Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian.

275
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:44,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have Lisa Crowley, our Human Resource Director, as well as Attorney Brian Mazur for any legal questions you may have tonight.

276
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the paper speaks for itself.

277
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:51,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for reading it fully, President Bears.

278
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The position of Fire Chief

279
00:16:55,956 --> 00:17:03,381
[SPEAKER_06]: became vacant as of a week ago when the chief freedman put in his retirement papers.

280
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank him for his service to the city.

281
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:17,450
[SPEAKER_06]: But it became an opportunity for the city, like many others that have come before us, to request to remove the position from civil service.

282
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: As you heard, out of 300 plus 51 cities and towns, there's only 100

283
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:25,802
[SPEAKER_06]: um

284
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,801
[SPEAKER_06]: In civil service and there's only 50 that haven't removed the position.

285
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:54,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of 351 cities and towns Only 50 are restricted by civil service guidelines and what civil service does is creates a very stringent process not allowing the city to have a broad candidate pool, which includes members of our own department if they choose to have interest in the position and I think modernizing the position

286
00:17:55,749 --> 00:18:06,359
[SPEAKER_06]: making it more open, competitive, with the goal of hiring the best candidate from a broad pool of applicants, is in the best interest of the city of Medford.

287
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ask that council support this paper this evening so we can move forward and modernize the way that it's done, the process, so we can get the best candidate for the city of Medford to lead our fire department.

288
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,123
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

289
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,825
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll go to members of the council.

290
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:28,226
[SPEAKER_55]: Zack?

291
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:30,167
[SPEAKER_55]: Zack?

292
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:35,511
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, just if we could close the doors, please, again, I ask so we can hear in the room and hear everyone's comments.

293
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:36,852
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Scarpelli.

294
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:37,492
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

295
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:44,918
[SPEAKER_36]: So with all due respect, what the mayor has just said and what you just read is completely crap.

296
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,740
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a joke and this is disgusting.

297
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:19,522
[SPEAKER_36]: What we're seeing right now is we're seeing action that's being taken by this mayor that has negatively affected multiple departments, multiple people, good people in this community, good people that's worked for the city and found a way to destroy.

298
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:24,584
[SPEAKER_36]: And I know I'm reading, I read some posts that all of a sudden the mayor is some kind of right fighter.

299
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,185
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't need a right fighter, we need a mayor.

300
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:30,647
[SPEAKER_36]: We need a leader that's gonna make decisions that's best for this community.

301
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:48,328
[SPEAKER_36]: We are, this is what, these are the phone calls I've gotten, I've received this week.

302
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:56,230
[SPEAKER_36]: The school budget, $2.4 million, $2.5 million in the hole this year.

303
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,631
[SPEAKER_36]: We still have questions within our school system of safety.

304
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:08,653
[SPEAKER_36]: We still have questions about our paraprofessionals and whether we have enough teachers.

305
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:11,314
[SPEAKER_36]: We're talking about a situation that

306
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:26,909
[SPEAKER_36]: that you're looking across the city and you're seeing good people getting hurt and the mayor spending good money that belongs to the city to do things on her own agenda, chasing around city employees and paying for private investigators.

307
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:43,457
[SPEAKER_36]: paying good money for private investigators, and then the results come back that the city is fraudulent, leaving us into a world of hurt when it comes to finances, and when it comes to what the budget's gonna look like, because what we have to pay people in penalties.

308
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:51,741
[SPEAKER_36]: We have probably the one of best, best employees I've ever worked with than Aleesha Nunley, a former finance director.

309
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:57,144
[SPEAKER_36]: was fighting and suing the city now going after the city because the way this man treated her.

310
00:20:57,164 --> 00:21:14,677
[SPEAKER_36]: And I believe the comments were that that that at the time that they wanted to have a white male present the budget because she didn't feel that this council would listen to a woman of color, which is which is a disgrace.

311
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:16,719
[SPEAKER_36]: And I could go on and on.

312
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,922
[SPEAKER_36]: But what I want to what I find more appalling is this situation right here.

313
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:26,211
[SPEAKER_36]: Everybody in this community, I've been reading things going back and forth and trying to support this.

314
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:30,517
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a disgrace if anybody's trying to support this for the fact that everybody works.

315
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:34,623
[SPEAKER_36]: And when you go to work, you're given a certain criteria of what you can and what you can't do.

316
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:43,568
[SPEAKER_36]: And all this doesn't stem from anything about equity or what 350 other cities are doing in the Commonwealth.

317
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:53,114
[SPEAKER_36]: This is retribution, this is an attack against an issue that occurred that left our firefighters speechless because it was then called an investigation.

318
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:54,915
[SPEAKER_36]: So they couldn't tell the truth.

319
00:21:55,736 --> 00:22:00,959
[SPEAKER_36]: What I do know of the men and women that are our firefighters, they earned the right to have sick time.

320
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:12,649
[SPEAKER_36]: And if I asked these firefighters to raise their hand if they have over 100 days or 200 days saved or 300 days saved, I can guarantee you, Mr. President, the majority of this room hands will go up in red.

321
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:14,351
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that's the truth.

322
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:17,454
[SPEAKER_36]: What's been the only constant since the pandemic?

323
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:19,476
[SPEAKER_36]: The only constant

324
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:26,117
[SPEAKER_36]: are men and women in fire that have done anything that this city has needed.

325
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:31,139
[SPEAKER_36]: And we hear rhetoric that our facilities, that the mayor's put money toward the facilities.

326
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,299
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a joke.

327
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,082
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, the money that was put into those facilities are just barely getting by so they're safe and where they stay every night.

328
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:50,521
[SPEAKER_36]: When we talked about what happened the other day, and this is all fraudulent, and this was some sort of pre-planned, where does it say that?

329
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,182
[SPEAKER_36]: What investigation said that?

330
00:22:53,363 --> 00:23:02,268
[SPEAKER_36]: Because all the firefighters I talked to is that they have sick time, and all they did was use the days that they're supposed to take if they need it.

331
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:09,643
[SPEAKER_36]: And then I heard, well, what's shocking is they called sick in the morning, but miraculously show up at night.

332
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:11,506
[SPEAKER_36]: Miraculously, that's who they are.

333
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,691
[SPEAKER_36]: They're coming in sick because they don't have coverage.

334
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:25,409
[SPEAKER_36]: So what I find appalling, you're talking about wasted money, setting a dialogue that this financial budget coming this year is going to be disgusting.

335
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:34,515
[SPEAKER_36]: I will warn everybody, don't be shocked if this mayor presents cuts for fire, police, DPW, custodians, teachers, because we're in trouble.

336
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:38,297
[SPEAKER_36]: The state has already reported that people that I've talked to, that we're in trouble.

337
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:40,438
[SPEAKER_36]: We have no more ESSA money.

338
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:41,659
[SPEAKER_36]: We have no more ARPA money.

339
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:46,140
[SPEAKER_36]: We have 60 positions that we're going to lose that are sponsored by those monies.

340
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:54,883
[SPEAKER_36]: So maybe this is a dialogue that says City of Medford, they're not listening because until tonight, there haven't been many people listening.

341
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:57,084
[SPEAKER_36]: The City of Medford, please.

342
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:02,089
[SPEAKER_36]: We have the firefighters that are using this and wasting $93,000.

343
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:19,760
[SPEAKER_36]: The president from the fire department is gonna come up and I hope he explains the situation, why we're wasting money on a deputy, I believe a deputy that's over time, I believe almost $50,000 that we've paid because the mayor will not promote that position.

344
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:21,921
[SPEAKER_36]: You wanna talk about hypocrisy?

345
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:23,860
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a disgrace.

346
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:30,237
[SPEAKER_36]: We have teachers that are getting a check every week because they're not getting their prep time.

347
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:33,404
[SPEAKER_36]: that's costing our city.

348
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,086
[SPEAKER_36]: Because they're not doing the job correctly.

349
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:42,269
[SPEAKER_36]: Now we have a council that's been talking about overrides and talking about other ways to create money.

350
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,491
[SPEAKER_36]: There's one reason that we're gonna be in a mess.

351
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:55,537
[SPEAKER_36]: Because the way we've managed our fiscal funds in this community in the last four years, we have no development, we have no movement, we have no new money coming in.

352
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:58,739
[SPEAKER_36]: And you wanna turn and look at the fight of the economy to blame them?

353
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,200
[SPEAKER_36]: Shame on you, Madam Mayor.

354
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,365
[SPEAKER_36]: I want to close with this.

355
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,648
[SPEAKER_36]: Did any of you speak to the mayor personally?

356
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,691
[SPEAKER_36]: Anyone in the room?

357
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Any councillors?

358
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,533
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

359
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:31,474
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

360
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:32,355
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

361
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:32,816
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

362
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:33,636
[SPEAKER_26]: That's over to the mayor.

363
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:34,657
[SPEAKER_36]: You all did.

364
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:35,198
[SPEAKER_36]: I didn't.

365
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,680
[SPEAKER_36]: It's shocking, right?

366
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:38,741
[SPEAKER_36]: I didn't.

367
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,035
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's not illegal, you can talk to each individual, not as a group, but this is what we're saying.

368
00:25:45,896 --> 00:26:02,713
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a dialogue being sent, and I implore to my fellow Councilors that no matter what's happened in this community, no matter what we've looked at and said, whatever has divided this community, because there's been a lot, but there's been one constant.

369
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:10,098
[SPEAKER_36]: one constant, no matter what, whether they didn't get their raise for years, whether their facilities are deplorable.

370
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:17,235
[SPEAKER_36]: whether they're waiting for their retro checks, there's one constant, the fire department's still strong.

371
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:28,364
[SPEAKER_36]: And the dialogue that's being spun, that Chief Friedman, shame on you firefighters, because the reason why Chief Friedman left is because of your entitled ignorance.

372
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:29,605
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a word.

373
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,787
[SPEAKER_36]: What I'm hearing is the total opposite.

374
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:40,954
[SPEAKER_36]: He left because he's never been talked to as an individual, as a professional, the way this administration talks to their department.

375
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,678
[SPEAKER_36]: So I ask, what's the other constant?

376
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,504
[SPEAKER_36]: No city solicitor, nobody that we can call to talk and ask what our direction should be.

377
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:10,310
[SPEAKER_36]: We haven't had stability in most any of our department heads in this city.

378
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:13,073
[SPEAKER_36]: We've had turnover and I think every position

379
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:17,507
[SPEAKER_36]: When we went for a new chief, I didn't see the mayor come up here.

380
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:25,932
[SPEAKER_36]: The dialogue wasn't the mayor coming up and setting this out saying, the chief of police, we need to do this because of X, Y, and Z and everything you read, Mr. President.

381
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,213
[SPEAKER_36]: She didn't say that.

382
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:38,099
[SPEAKER_36]: But all of a sudden, the fire department who stand strong with their convictions and stand strong for what they believe in in our community and do the right thing every single day,

383
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:44,459
[SPEAKER_36]: the firemen that have the right to use their sick time have the right.

384
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:51,448
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's not their fault that we don't find enough firefighters that we protect our staff just in case this happens.

385
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:52,689
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't have that.

386
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:54,431
[SPEAKER_36]: We didn't do that.

387
00:27:56,067 --> 00:28:10,535
[SPEAKER_36]: But it's these firefighters after this incident came out, and an irate mayor went public, went to the news authorities, knowing that these people couldn't defend themselves by calling it a criminal act.

388
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:16,618
[SPEAKER_36]: And then come to us for a paper to give her control?

389
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:26,815
[SPEAKER_36]: Please, I beg all of you, do not even consider this because this is one constant that has worked no matter what.

390
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:37,286
[SPEAKER_36]: One thing I heard from these firefighters and their families and their families, when they watch their families, their loved ones leave the house to go to work, they don't know if they're going to come home.

391
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,211
[SPEAKER_36]: But what they do have is they have each other.

392
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:45,014
[SPEAKER_36]: And by bringing someone in from the outside, you're gonna disrupt that.

393
00:28:48,015 --> 00:28:52,778
[SPEAKER_36]: The goal to say that the delay in all this is a joke.

394
00:28:53,718 --> 00:29:03,704
[SPEAKER_36]: We have capable, qualified firefighters that can step in as an interim chief while this process moves the way it's supposed to in the civil process like we've always done.

395
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:19,759
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'll leave you with this, for those people who know.

396
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:27,988
[SPEAKER_36]: Chief Sacco, Chief Giliberti, Chief Freeman, Chief Buckley, civil servants, correct?

397
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:29,630
[SPEAKER_36]: They were pretty good.

398
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:30,771
[SPEAKER_36]: Correct?

399
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,133
[SPEAKER_36]: They were pretty good.

400
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,097
[SPEAKER_36]: They've led our city in some tough times and they've done a good job.

401
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:40,749
[SPEAKER_36]: Why would we even consider, why would we even consider changing that?

402
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,411
[SPEAKER_36]: This shouldn't even be a conversation.

403
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,972
[SPEAKER_36]: So I appreciate and thank you.

404
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:57,936
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

405
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:00,878
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, Councilor Scarpelli, we're gonna go to other councilors.

406
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,078
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Lazzaro.

407
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,740
[SPEAKER_60]: President Bears, are you able to answer questions if you know the answer?

408
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:10,416
[SPEAKER_55]: if I ask you questions.

409
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,398
[SPEAKER_60]: Do the firefighters have a contract right now?

410
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:13,399
[SPEAKER_60]: Are they working with a contract?

411
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,201
[SPEAKER_60]: My understanding is yes, there's a signed contract.

412
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:16,102
[SPEAKER_60]: Okay.

413
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:22,527
[SPEAKER_60]: The change in the designation of the fire chief, what impact would it have on the rank and file firefighters, do you know?

414
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,991
[SPEAKER_55]: According to this proposal, it would not change their civil service status.

415
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:31,636
[SPEAKER_55]: It would just change who is able... It says the law specifically says

416
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,728
[SPEAKER_55]: The section one shall not impair the civil service status of any person.

417
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:38,228
[SPEAKER_55]: Oh, sorry.

418
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:40,229
[SPEAKER_55]: The position of fire chief for the city of Medford.

419
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:40,550
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

420
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,852
[SPEAKER_60]: So it wouldn't have an impact on anybody except for the fire chief.

421
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:48,334
[SPEAKER_52]: That's as it's written.

422
00:30:50,055 --> 00:31:01,782
[SPEAKER_60]: My understanding is when everybody called out sick at the same time early this month, that since it's the fire department and there can still be fires and disruption and emergencies that

423
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:12,877
[SPEAKER_60]: Somebody will get called in to cover those shifts and those people that get called in get paid overtime.

424
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:14,958
[SPEAKER_60]: Do you know if that's true?

425
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:15,818
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't.

426
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:20,819
[SPEAKER_55]: If you want to direct questions to the administration, we can all speak and then we can hear from the administration if they want to answer the question.

427
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,620
[SPEAKER_55]: That would be helpful.

428
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,742
[SPEAKER_60]: My belief is that what happens is when you call in sick, then somebody who is not scheduled

429
00:31:29,602 --> 00:31:34,526
[SPEAKER_60]: to work that shift comes in and fills in that shift but gets paid overtime.

430
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,988
[SPEAKER_60]: And that is why it was so much more expensive during that time.

431
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:47,636
[SPEAKER_60]: So what appeared to be a coordinated call out meant that it cost a significantly larger amount of money to the city.

432
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:56,802
[SPEAKER_60]: The reason I'm saying this in explicit terms is because I think most people in Medford wouldn't understand that to be the case because at most jobs,

433
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:06,247
[SPEAKER_60]: if you're a shift worker, if you work in retail or restaurant, and you fill in for somebody, you just get paid normal wages that you would be paid on any other day.

434
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:17,291
[SPEAKER_60]: But my understanding is that in the fire department, when you call at six, somebody else comes and fills in that position, but you get paid time and a half or double time something over time.

435
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:18,512
[SPEAKER_60]: I just want to clarify that.

436
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:18,732
[SPEAKER_60]: So

437
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:33,479
[SPEAKER_60]: I think that there is a possibility that if a fire chief comes in who is from a different department, it would have to be somebody who has worked in a fire department and has that experience.

438
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:42,445
[SPEAKER_60]: They would be maybe somebody that would say, oh, hey, maybe if everybody called out sick one day, that would be something that we would have to discuss.

439
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:47,061
[SPEAKER_60]: that wouldn't be something I would be comfortable with happening on an ongoing basis.

440
00:32:47,622 --> 00:33:03,412
[SPEAKER_60]: Maybe I wouldn't want everybody to then get paid overtime to make up a coordinated call out, even though we have a contract, even though it's not a strike, even though there is no, there does not seem to be an ask.

441
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:08,215
[SPEAKER_60]: There doesn't seem to be any reason for that coordinated call out.

442
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:13,507
[SPEAKER_60]: And, excuse me, no, no, you may not.

443
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:14,067
[SPEAKER_60]: Alleged?

444
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:15,988
[SPEAKER_58]: Let's not call a coordinated attack.

445
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:17,409
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm not policing anyone's speech here.

446
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:21,550
[SPEAKER_55]: So if we could just step back from the podium, and we're gonna, no one.

447
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,471
[SPEAKER_58]: I'll pose it for you, it's an alleged.

448
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:26,831
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not part of this conversation here, we're not.

449
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,433
[SPEAKER_55]: We're not gonna go back here.

450
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:31,793
[SPEAKER_55]: And we're not gonna have outbursts.

451
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,713
[SPEAKER_55]: And again, I wouldn't.

452
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,334
[SPEAKER_55]: Interrupting Councilor Scarpelli, we're not gonna interrupt other councilors.

453
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,215
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Lazzaro, you have the floor.

454
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:53,503
[SPEAKER_60]: What I'm saying is if there was a fire chief who was not part of civil service and who came in from an outside fire department, I believe that the likelihood of a situation like what happened earlier in February would be much less.

455
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:59,268
[SPEAKER_60]: I would, if there's possibility for the administration to speak to that.

456
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:01,771
[SPEAKER_55]: If you're gonna have conversations, please take them outside.

457
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:05,806
[SPEAKER_60]: if the administration could speak to that, I would appreciate it.

458
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:09,468
[SPEAKER_60]: Just about the overtime issue is that if you can correct me if I was wrong about that.

459
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:10,348
[SPEAKER_55]: Great, I have that down.

460
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:12,049
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll go back to the administration.

461
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:13,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming.

462
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and I also ask that I'm just gonna... That's fine.

463
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:21,293
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just gonna talk, and I'm going to...

464
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:31,691
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, if folks would not have conversations and not leave the doors open, it's difficult to hear.

465
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:36,118
[SPEAKER_55]: It's difficult to hear in this room when people are shouting, when the doors are open, when there's conversations happening.

466
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:38,782
[SPEAKER_55]: So I please ask that people respect everyone who's speaking.

467
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:42,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

468
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:50,034
[SPEAKER_21]: So I got messages from about 30 people opposed to this, including three or four from firefighters.

469
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:58,478
[SPEAKER_21]: I ended up having long conversations, you know, with two of those firefighters.

470
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:00,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I had dinner with another one on.

471
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:18,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Friday, Thursday, and I even went to the South Medford fire station and rang their doorbell and tried to start a conversation with the fellow there who obviously wasn't expecting to talk to a city councilor but the point that I'm getting at is that

472
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:35,236
[SPEAKER_21]: City Council, just like the rest of, like many other people in Medford, has been in a bit of an information vacuum about the nature of what's been happening with union negotiations between the mayor and the leadership and the firefighters union.

473
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:38,457
[SPEAKER_21]: And so what I'm trying to say is that

474
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:57,775
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't really know too much about what was going on behind closed doors compared to the rest of the public until last Thursday when this came onto the agenda and suddenly became in the interest of both parties to put as much information about what's been happening behind closed doors for months.

475
00:35:58,476 --> 00:35:59,116
[SPEAKER_21]: as possible.

476
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:09,058
[SPEAKER_21]: So I did talk to the I did talk to the mayor, I tried to talk to different firefighters, I tried to get past a lot of the spin.

477
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:18,500
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of you know, obviously, during the union negotiations, union contract negotiations, relationships fell apart.

478
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,701
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's a lot of there's a lot of bad blood that's going around.

479
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,861
[SPEAKER_21]: And I heard a lot of that.

480
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:26,462
[SPEAKER_21]: And so what I'm going to say is,

481
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:49,111
[SPEAKER_21]: What I'm going to try to do is make my thinking about this as transparent as I possibly can, and so I'm going to say the points that appeal to me most for voting down, and then I'm going to say the points that I see in favor of this, and then I want to listen to public comment after that, and I'm not going to say anything else.

482
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:56,497
[SPEAKER_21]: The point in opposition to this that meant the most to me was the morale in the fire department.

483
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,198
[SPEAKER_21]: There are promotional issues.

484
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,143
[SPEAKER_21]: If you bring in somebody from the outside, firefighters cannot advance in the normal routes.

485
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:11,070
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear that loud and clear that so I received an email from a firefighter.

486
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Dan Craven, and I think he phrased it best.

487
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,872
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, four promotions normally happen in this scenario.

488
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:23,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Firefighter, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Chief each get promoted to fill the vacancies created by the Fire Chief's retirement.

489
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:27,095
[SPEAKER_21]: There are already established promotional lists for Deputy Chief, Captain, and Lieutenant.

490
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:34,277
[SPEAKER_21]: The Mayor has instead called upon your Honorable Body to remove the Chief's position from civil service law so that she can hire him outside the Medford Fire Department.

491
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:37,599
[SPEAKER_21]: which would in turn effectively nullify the normal promotions.

492
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:38,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I take that very seriously.

493
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,985
[SPEAKER_21]: He then goes on to talk about all of the studying that's required for these tests, why they're so difficult to do.

494
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:54,150
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've also heard about the behavior that from the mayor personally, which obviously didn't appeal to a lot of people during this.

495
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:01,795
[SPEAKER_21]: What I'm going to say that I need, if I am going to vote against this, I absolutely need to be convinced of a few things.

496
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:02,675
[SPEAKER_21]: First,

497
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:08,017
[SPEAKER_21]: the sick time situation as my colleagues have both brought up.

498
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:13,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I have tried to ask as many firefighters about this as possible.

499
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:27,583
[SPEAKER_21]: I have been told that they actually were sick and I'll be perfectly honest, 21 out of 23 people call in in a day and then they come in later, I don't believe it.

500
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:29,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just gonna say that I do not believe it.

501
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:41,316
[SPEAKER_21]: I have, otherwise when I try to ask about that, I think that there's some ongoing, you know, potential litigation.

502
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:45,518
[SPEAKER_21]: So people have been advised to not talk to me about what's happening behind closed doors.

503
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:59,526
[SPEAKER_21]: And one in my position in this is that we absolutely cannot have, we cannot have the fire department making the five o'clock news about these issues, okay?

504
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,227
[SPEAKER_21]: That is my bottom line.

505
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:03,507
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand morale issues.

506
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:04,687
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand everything else.

507
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:15,651
[SPEAKER_21]: I do not want to see the Medford Fire Department with a culture that encourages these kinds of issues like sick time and whatnot.

508
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:16,512
[SPEAKER_21]: And if

509
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:31,306
[SPEAKER_21]: If an outsider can fix the culture that encouraged that, then I would vote for an outsider.

510
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:41,076
[SPEAKER_21]: The other thing that, the other thing, and this was a fact that was confirmed by both sides, I specifically asked this of both the fire department and of the mayor.

511
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:44,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, one issue is that the civil service

512
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,341
[SPEAKER_21]: test is fair, it allows for promotions.

513
00:39:48,521 --> 00:40:01,283
[SPEAKER_21]: I was told about, you know, a situation in 1999, where two people took the promotional exam to go from deputy to fire chief, one of them was less popular, but scored higher, that person became fire chief.

514
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:09,785
[SPEAKER_21]: This past time, three to four people signed up to take the exam, only one of them actually took it.

515
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:28,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so if you're telling me that it is a competitive process to be fire chief, then that is not something that given that fact that I believe now I have heard I've heard that fact has been confirmed to me by both sides.

516
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,687
[SPEAKER_21]: What I have heard from

517
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:36,892
[SPEAKER_21]: why that was from the mayor was that folks wanted to select their friends.

518
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:42,956
[SPEAKER_21]: What I've heard that that was from the fire department is that it is a big decision.

519
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:50,242
[SPEAKER_21]: People need to talk to their families about whether or not they want to take the advancement exam and so on.

520
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:55,706
[SPEAKER_21]: I even talked to one of the deputy chiefs that signed up for that but did not take it.

521
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:57,947
[SPEAKER_21]: But the point is that

522
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:03,309
[SPEAKER_21]: It did not convince me that it was a competitive process.

523
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:11,801
[SPEAKER_21]: So that being said, the morale issue is something that I do take very seriously.

524
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:20,283
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't expect what I just said to appeal to everybody in this room, but my goal here is to make my thinking on this as transparent as possible.

525
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:21,865
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where I'm at with that.

526
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,867
[SPEAKER_21]: I've tried to talk to as many firefighters as I can.

527
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:38,118
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope once all of this blows over, I can hang out with you all some more, maybe do a Q&A session, just try to make City Council a bit more accessible and transparent.

528
00:41:38,678 --> 00:41:41,440
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's my thinking.

529
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:42,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

530
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:47,504
[SPEAKER_21]: And I look forward to listening to members of the public.

531
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,245
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

532
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:53,507
[SPEAKER_51]: Members of the Council, Council Vice President Collins.

533
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

534
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:58,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to everybody who's assembled here today.

535
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:05,634
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is probably one of the four council chambers that I've seen, and we pack it two or three times a year.

536
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:07,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all for being here.

537
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:09,205
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to keep it pretty short.

538
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:17,692
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had several conversations with several folks around this issue in the past few days, some of whom I know were in the room.

539
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:19,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for reaching out.

540
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:24,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I always appreciate residents and folks who live and work in this community for getting in touch with us directly.

541
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:26,920
[SPEAKER_18]: This is how this has to work.

542
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,641
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the dynamic.

543
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:29,774
[SPEAKER_18]: We're elected.

544
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:30,935
[SPEAKER_18]: You live here.

545
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:31,576
[SPEAKER_18]: You work here.

546
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:32,436
[SPEAKER_18]: This is our city.

547
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:33,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here to listen.

548
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:41,125
[SPEAKER_18]: I've tried to, you know, begin that process of listening with the folks who've reached out to me over the past couple days.

549
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:44,448
[SPEAKER_18]: We've heard about this over the past several days from the administration.

550
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:50,314
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I am going into this from the perspective of this decision has landed on our desks.

551
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:59,260
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that the priority of folks here, the folks who work in service in the interest of public safety, I know what your priority is.

552
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:03,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Your priority is the public safety of Medford residents, the people who live here.

553
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:06,545
[SPEAKER_18]: As an elected representative, that has to be my priority as well.

554
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,147
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that's the priority shared by the committee, by the community.

555
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:20,475
[SPEAKER_18]: And so as we continue to listen and hear from people around this, that's going to be my guiding light is what decision will be in the best interest of executing public safety for Medford residents,

556
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:27,419
[SPEAKER_18]: as well as possible every single day because of how the department is structured and any decisions that we have the jurisdiction to make around that.

557
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,060
[SPEAKER_18]: That is going to be my lens.

558
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,343
[SPEAKER_18]: I've said this about other policies before, you know, because it applies to many things.

559
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:38,346
[SPEAKER_18]: With any decision, what I try to remember, it can't be about

560
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:50,912
[SPEAKER_18]: this administration or this person in the role right now or this person who's doing the job right now, it's about the department, it's about the community, it's about today, but it's also about five years from now, 10 years from now.

561
00:43:52,594 --> 00:44:05,604
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always hard not to make these issues personal because we are a community made up of people who know each other and care for each other and sometimes have history with one another, but these decisions can't be made with anything other than that North Star of public safety in mind.

562
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:08,606
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the perspective that I'm going into this with for the rest of the meeting.

563
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:18,732
[SPEAKER_18]: I look forward to listening and hearing from people about this continuing to hear from constituents and firefighters and the administration and my fellow Councilors about this.

564
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:19,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

565
00:44:23,615 --> 00:44:23,975
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

566
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,317
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be brief as well because I know a lot of people want to speak.

567
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:28,838
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to echo Councilor Collins' sentiment.

568
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:40,205
[SPEAKER_25]: I've spent a lot of the last few days talking to people, catching up on emails and phone calls and haven't been able to reach everyone, especially since I was sick for a few days last week.

569
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,967
[SPEAKER_25]: I think my job here tonight is to listen.

570
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:48,210
[SPEAKER_25]: and to listen to the perspectives in the room and give you all a chance to speak.

571
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,593
[SPEAKER_25]: And I have myself questions about this policy, concerns as well.

572
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:59,038
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's important just to recognize that my job tonight is to listen.

573
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,140
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

574
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,941
[SPEAKER_55]: I have a question from Councilors for the Administration.

575
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:06,383
[SPEAKER_55]: Are there any other questions for the Administration from members of the Council?

576
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:13,973
[SPEAKER_55]: Oh, Anna, sorry, Councilor Callaghan, I recognize you, then if folks have questions, let me know.

577
00:45:14,073 --> 00:45:14,654
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Callaghan.

578
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:16,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

579
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to really thank all of the people who reach out to me.

580
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:28,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I have received more emails on this topic than I've probably on any other topic and spoken to a number of firefighters.

581
00:45:29,682 --> 00:45:38,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, my position on this, I am finding it extremely difficult to believe that

582
00:45:40,044 --> 00:46:04,849
[SPEAKER_04]: a healthy fire department filled with people who want to do their jobs, respect their leaders, and are, you know, doing the best that they can here in Medford in this incredibly difficult job is going to be helped by a process that almost to a T, like every single one of them does not want.

583
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:05,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

584
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: If we are looking, that is just very difficult for me to believe.

585
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that whatever process that we have for selecting, and it was very interesting to me to hear, and I really dug into the process and how it has worked in the past, and how people are satisfied with it, and why it is that this particular process that the fire department has builds trust, builds respect, builds a really good, as Councilor Lemmie said, morale,

586
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am finding it very difficult to believe that a process that every firefighter does not want is going to get better leadership into the position.

587
00:46:53,288 --> 00:47:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I start from, but I'm open ears and I'm very interested in hearing from everyone who is here to speak about this topic.

588
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:01,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

589
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,254
[SPEAKER_55]: Are there any questions from members of the council for the administration?

590
00:47:11,255 --> 00:47:15,378
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, we have Councilor Lazzaro's question, which was regarding, you can repeat it if you wanna phrase it.

591
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:33,292
[SPEAKER_60]: Yeah, my question was if firefighters call out sick and somebody has to come in and fill in for the firefighters that are not in attendance, do the firefighters that have come in to fill in, they get paid overtime, is that correct?

592
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:37,290
[SPEAKER_55]: We have the chief of staff, the mayor and the HR director.

593
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,171
[SPEAKER_55]: Do any of you want to field that question?

594
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,574
[SPEAKER_55]: You can raise your hand and I can unmute you.

595
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:48,097
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

596
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears, happily answer that question.

597
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:56,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, in fact, it does trigger overtime.

598
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,064
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

599
00:47:58,204 --> 00:47:59,885
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further questions from members of the council?

600
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,347
[SPEAKER_55]: For the administration, Vice President Collins.

601
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:04,357
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

602
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:10,321
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I wasn't gonna talk again, but I remembered a clarifying question that I just wanted to double check before we get further into the weeds on this.

603
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:28,415
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my understanding from the research and the conversations that I've had so far about this, that this change, if it were to go forward, would not render ineligible any applicant within the fire department that's currently eligible for the role that would just extend the pool wider than it currently is.

604
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:30,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Can the administration confirm if that's true?

605
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:36,180
[SPEAKER_55]: go to the chief of staff or go to the mayor has raised her hand, I'll go to the mayor.

606
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:40,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears.

607
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:48,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Councilor Collins and the committee, the application pool would of course allow internal candidates to apply.

608
00:48:50,899 --> 00:48:51,620
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

609
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,262
[SPEAKER_53]: So a question from Councilor Scarpelli.

610
00:48:55,463 --> 00:49:07,652
[SPEAKER_36]: So for clarity, now we have within the civil service, there's a process in place that if we hire within through the civil service process, we know exactly what

611
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:14,696
[SPEAKER_36]: the fiscal point will be when we hire that chief, correct?

612
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:22,099
[SPEAKER_36]: We know exactly there's a formula in place that says firefighters make A, the chief is eligible to make B, correct?

613
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:34,976
[SPEAKER_36]: So if that's correct, we allow to open that up and eliminate civil service, we can have people come in to ask for $200,000 a year, 210,000, 180,000.

614
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:37,997
[SPEAKER_36]: So they can come in and really inflate that cost in that department, correct?

615
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:45,745
[SPEAKER_36]: matter.

616
00:49:46,665 --> 00:49:48,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that is the current salary, actually.

617
00:49:48,947 --> 00:50:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you took it out of civil service, there would not, it would not be an at will, fire chief, it would be a contracted fire chief from somebody either in the department in the state or even broader.

618
00:50:02,237 --> 00:50:02,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think

619
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:13,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the way that it has to be versus last time where four deputies signed up to take the test, only one took it.

620
00:50:13,528 --> 00:50:18,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seemed like the chief was handpicked by the union.

621
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:24,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And that too, that did a disservice to our captains who could have signed up for and

622
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:39,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Taken the test to be a potential candidate But once four signed up it blocked everybody else and you did hear from other people within the department upset with that process, too I'm gonna I think you want the best candidate in this situation.

623
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a situation at the beginning of the month Where it cost the city almost a hundred thousand dollars to pay for overtime

624
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:53,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was not the entire fire department's fault.

625
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:58,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was just a misguided situation that got out of hand.

626
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:04,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's unfortunate because there are good members of the fire department that should be able to rise up.

627
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:12,558
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to make sure that the best person for this job is the proper candidate.

628
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:16,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to gain some control

629
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:27,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the membership we need to make sure that we're helping people rise rise up with integrity And that we have a respected department versus what we're seeing

630
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,687
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you, Madam Mayor.

631
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:33,188
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

632
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:36,128
[SPEAKER_36]: I have a follow up then because you said something very important.

633
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:44,791
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam Mayor, you said that the concern of the overtime because of this so-called concern that you had.

634
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:46,851
[SPEAKER_36]: Let me ask you something point blank.

635
00:51:47,411 --> 00:51:52,133
[SPEAKER_36]: Are you not promoting positions that are costing us overtime right now?

636
00:51:52,253 --> 00:51:53,413
[SPEAKER_36]: Something you have control of?

637
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, we promote pretty quickly.

638
00:51:57,491 --> 00:52:02,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it does take HR a week or two or myself to review.

639
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:07,336
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a retirement several weeks back.

640
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It came before myself and HR.

641
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I started to review it.

642
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:36,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoping that I could just promote and push that and get that checked off the list But when I went to look to see who who was on the list because it's not an assessment center Like I I wish it was it's whoever's at the top is how we promote within our fire department and that that's all well and good That's how it's it's taken place and how the process has has landed the last several, you know

643
00:52:36,676 --> 00:52:38,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I think since I've been around.

644
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:49,191
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we have now is not only a review of what happened the first weekend in February, not because I want to review it, it's because we had people

645
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:52,503
[SPEAKER_06]: 21 people call out out of 23.

646
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:57,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I, as mayor, have an obligation to look into why that happened.

647
00:52:57,825 --> 00:52:59,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't just Saturday.

648
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,926
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 12, 13 people call out on Friday.

649
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,567
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 or 13 people call out on Saturday.

650
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday got a little better.

651
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:16,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, 12 or 13 people until we're scrambling to get a legal letter to the union president saying please stop this behavior.

652
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:18,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's putting the city at risk.

653
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's causing $100,000 in overtime.

654
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:24,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Overtime has already been skyrocketing.

655
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to get control of it and get a review on overtime.

656
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:33,163
[SPEAKER_06]: because I did suspect what the data is showing, we're going to continue to review it.

657
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:47,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I have people on that list that should be promoted, that were misguided and happened to take time off during that, what I say is an orchestrated event, I have to take a time out and make sure we're promoting

658
00:53:48,587 --> 00:54:02,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Through this review, investigation, whatever this comes about, I need to make sure that the leaders in the department are going to lead the department with integrity and show their younger members how a department should be led.

659
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: and the behavior that should be in our proud Medford Fire Department who are risking their lives to protect us.

660
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:13,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It happened to me.

661
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:17,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat Ripley, he's retired, came in when we had an electrical fire.

662
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be ever, ever grateful.

663
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:22,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not taking away from what they do every day.

664
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:23,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect that.

665
00:54:24,204 --> 00:54:26,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect the job they do every day.

666
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:29,367
[SPEAKER_06]: What I don't respect is the fact that we have a contract.

667
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:30,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It is settled.

668
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was an orchestrated event.

669
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what lesson they were trying to teach me.

670
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that was.

671
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: They just had met with our HR director and our diversity equity inclusion director the day before.

672
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:46,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, how did those meetings go?

673
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:48,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody said they went fine.

674
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,071
[SPEAKER_06]: They have questions.

675
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:51,772
[SPEAKER_06]: We have concerns.

676
00:54:51,812 --> 00:54:52,373
[SPEAKER_06]: They have concerns.

677
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:53,113
[SPEAKER_06]: But it went well.

678
00:54:53,954 --> 00:54:57,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next day, there was an orchestrated event.

679
00:54:57,716 --> 00:54:58,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know why.

680
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:01,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people in the residents don't deserve it.

681
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:06,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, we have a school deficit we have over time, it's out of control in the fire department.

682
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:08,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have an orchestrated event that's making it worse.

683
00:55:08,643 --> 00:55:15,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I as mayor have to look into that I have to figure out why that was, and I have to make sure it doesn't happen again.

684
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:17,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to

685
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,137
[SPEAKER_36]: So so thank you, Madam Mayor.

686
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:37,621
[SPEAKER_36]: I have some questions because I just think that a contractual obligation as the mayor to to promote an internal candidate that I believe has cost the city over $50,000 to date for overtime.

687
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:41,403
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think that's one.

688
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:47,931
[SPEAKER_36]: So I know that you're making it sound like fluff, but this is something that's going to destroy and divide our city, even more than you think.

689
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:58,304
[SPEAKER_36]: So you have decided as the mayor of this community to now is becoming investigated the jury and the judge to say that this was orchestrated, and it's done.

690
00:55:58,364 --> 00:55:59,726
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Leming wants

691
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:04,167
[SPEAKER_36]: our firefighters to explain something and how they can talk about this.

692
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,048
[SPEAKER_36]: But you, Madam Mayor, have called this an investigation.

693
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:11,950
[SPEAKER_36]: So I don't know what these people can say tonight legally to convince you.

694
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:20,892
[SPEAKER_36]: And what I fear tonight is you're going to vote yes on an issue that they have no control to support because the mayor is setting a dialogue.

695
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:22,773
[SPEAKER_36]: There's history here, Madam Mayor.

696
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:34,722
[SPEAKER_36]: If this is the first thing this mayor has done, if this is the first thing that you've done that has questioned the support for working men and women in this community, I would say, well, maybe we'd have to look into it.

697
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:43,088
[SPEAKER_36]: But is it contractual that these men and women in this department, they are given the right to have sick time?

698
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:44,809
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, they are.

699
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,072
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, as a former teacher, and listen,

700
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,124
[SPEAKER_36]: If I can ask the president of the teachers union to ask on a daily basis, how many teachers are off because they're sick?

701
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:58,648
[SPEAKER_36]: I would say there's probably 60, 70 a day sometimes.

702
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:10,080
[SPEAKER_36]: So this isn't crazy, but when you spin the dialogue that's doing something like deceiving, this is what divides this community, Madam Mayor.

703
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:16,422
[SPEAKER_36]: So until we find out what's going on, so isn't that confusing?

704
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:20,206
[SPEAKER_36]: They meet with the HR director the day before and everything's great.

705
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:23,469
[SPEAKER_36]: But could it be that maybe they're sick?

706
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,292
[SPEAKER_36]: Maybe there's a doubt in anybody's mind?

707
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:30,736
[SPEAKER_36]: Some have already made comments that they've already judged us.

708
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:32,378
[SPEAKER_36]: They've already judged these people.

709
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:34,962
[SPEAKER_36]: And this is what I find appalling.

710
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:41,765
[SPEAKER_36]: You're putting the cart ahead of the horse, and it's doing major, major destruction to our community.

711
00:57:42,485 --> 00:57:47,608
[SPEAKER_36]: You're saying that you need to do this because of the community, and you have this responsibility.

712
00:57:48,368 --> 00:57:49,628
[SPEAKER_36]: Look at this responsibility.

713
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:51,890
[SPEAKER_36]: Your family's calling you today.

714
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,530
[SPEAKER_36]: You're dividing the city.

715
00:57:55,311 --> 00:57:58,012
[SPEAKER_36]: We have so much more that we need to worry about right now, Madam Mayor.

716
00:57:58,293 --> 00:57:59,353
[SPEAKER_36]: Way too much more.

717
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:06,537
[SPEAKER_36]: To be dealing with this when we have competent people in place to do this is a waste of our taxpayers' time and taxpayer money.

718
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,682
[SPEAKER_36]: The question is, do we have these two questions?

719
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:26,262
[SPEAKER_36]: I apologize.

720
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:40,409
[SPEAKER_36]: The one question is, if she can speak to it, that are you familiar with the amount of money that we're paying because contractually you're not promoting a certain position?

721
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:40,909
[SPEAKER_36]: That's one.

722
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:54,254
[SPEAKER_36]: I was told today, whether you can speak on it or not, that you might have already offered this position to an outside candidate, whether it's intern or not, if that's the truth, that's against the law.

723
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:59,315
[SPEAKER_36]: That's against a chapter that I don't have in front of me, but I can get it for you.

724
00:58:59,695 --> 00:59:00,716
[SPEAKER_36]: What is it?

725
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:07,100
[SPEAKER_36]: 4238, so I would question that too.

726
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:15,447
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that would, the reason why I think that needs to be figured out, that this council have to understand, is this something prearranged?

727
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,649
[SPEAKER_36]: Does the mayor already have somebody in place?

728
00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:28,838
[SPEAKER_36]: Because if she's talking about this transparent process and something that we need in this community, if she's already pre-approved somebody to come in that declined the job today, that should be alarming to all of us.

729
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:32,939
[SPEAKER_36]: Because everything she just said means nothing, if that's the truth.

730
00:59:33,399 --> 00:59:40,740
[SPEAKER_37]: So thank you.

731
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:52,182
[SPEAKER_55]: The questions were about if a position hasn't been promoted and has the position been offered to anyone on an interim or permanent basis?

732
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yep.

733
00:59:54,343 --> 00:59:54,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

734
00:59:56,144 --> 01:00:20,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor scarpelli referenced 42 38 which is trumped by the city charter The city charter says the mayor has appointing authority to all department heads So yes, I did offer the interim position to a candidate that I thought could really work with the membership as well as how to explain why Something like the beginning of what happened in the beginning of february was just not helpful um

735
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:24,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was somewhat scared away.

736
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:32,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I believe a statement was put out telling everybody in, I don't know if it was in the state, not to apply for the interim role here in Medford.

737
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:34,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, I did offer it.

738
01:00:34,304 --> 01:00:41,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And he no longer will accept the position because he knows he's going to get major pushback if he does accept.

739
01:00:43,132 --> 01:00:52,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I can um, I can turn it over to attorney maser if you want to understand better how the charter trumps 42 38 With regards to just the dividing.

740
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:56,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Um I'm not dividing the community whatsoever.

741
01:00:57,395 --> 01:01:00,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I Am trying to get to the bottom of what happened at the beginning of the month.

742
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:04,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to hold those accountable that need accountability

743
01:01:05,148 --> 01:01:11,355
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one that divided is the person that put out the call allegedly to not come to work that weekend.

744
01:01:11,795 --> 01:01:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: That started the division.

745
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:14,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to fix it.

746
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe I'm going to turn it over to HR director Lisa Crowley.

747
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some overtime costs to not promoting, but I don't see how I can promote people until I have finished our review on what happened, who was involved, and continued the data research that I'm doing that is bringing up some other issues with regards to sick time.

748
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:43,958
[SPEAKER_06]: People do have sick time for when they're sick.

749
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,360
[SPEAKER_52]: Director Crowley.

750
01:01:48,796 --> 01:01:54,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Mr. President, to the council and all those that are in chambers.

751
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:57,562
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a cost of overtime for not hiring.

752
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I don't have the paperwork in front of me.

753
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:03,506
[SPEAKER_05]: If I knew the question was going to be asked, I would have made sure I was prepared.

754
01:02:04,306 --> 01:02:07,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mayor is not holding back on the promotions.

755
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:15,413
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're doing is we're making sure that we're going through the civil service process and putting forth the most qualified

756
01:02:16,494 --> 01:02:25,705
[SPEAKER_05]: On the list as civil service process, I'm not sure if, you know, the list comes out, you have your top candidates, depending on where they are on the list.

757
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:26,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we hire.

758
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we will be doing in the near future.

759
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:32,413
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is no, there's no.

760
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:40,381
[SPEAKER_05]: holds back for any kind of retaliation that, you know, has been stated here.

761
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:41,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that is not been the case.

762
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:46,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been working with bringing on five new firefighters.

763
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:49,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're walking through that whole process.

764
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:54,748
[SPEAKER_05]: That too in itself is a massive undertaking through the civil service process.

765
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are working with the fire department.

766
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:58,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect the fire department as well.

767
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had many conversations with President Buckley and Secretary

768
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:14,998
[SPEAKER_05]: of the union, and we are working through getting the promotions as soon as we can, but we are still working on getting five new firefighters on board.

769
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:18,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And that again has taken some time there's

770
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Exams they have to go through, they have to go through a rigorous process and we're still through that process.

771
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:33,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we can get them on board through their required examinations and hopefully get them into an academy sometime within the next couple of months.

772
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have control over when the academy accepts anybody.

773
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:44,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So once we get all the prerequisites done, then it's up to the academy to tell us when we can get those firefighters in.

774
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:48,858
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

775
01:03:48,898 --> 01:03:50,398
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll just end with this, two things.

776
01:03:50,678 --> 01:03:51,438
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll end with this.

777
01:03:51,958 --> 01:04:05,221
[SPEAKER_36]: Madam Mayor, when there was an issue with the gun clip and the place was filled, when you talk about divide, I wish you were here instead of on Zoom, because there are people outside waiting to get in here.

778
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:07,882
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a dividing issue, whether you want to believe it or not.

779
01:04:07,922 --> 01:04:12,423
[SPEAKER_36]: And second, more importantly, to my fellow councilors, everything the mayor stated,

780
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:21,705
[SPEAKER_36]: everything she said about equity and having this process, if she's already gone out and handpicked somebody that declined, how true is that?

781
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:42,069
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you, I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff.

782
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

783
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:50,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Through you to Councilor Scarapelli, just to be clear, we're talking about an interim appointment.

784
01:04:50,697 --> 01:05:01,588
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a normal process in which ensuring that there's leadership in the department for, you know, obviously operational and other important avenues.

785
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:03,429
[SPEAKER_11]: it needs to be done.

786
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_11]: That is something that the mayor is doing to try to ensure there's good communication between the department, our office, human resources office, all of those things would be incredibly important to have an interim fire chief.

787
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,156
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no scenario where we wouldn't want an interim in that position.

788
01:05:19,856 --> 01:05:23,318
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is an interim on a temporary basis to be clear.

789
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:23,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

790
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:40,282
[SPEAKER_36]: So, if I can, when Chief Sacco left, we had an interim police chief that was capable, an officer I believe was, I forget who it was, but we had, was it Clemente?

791
01:05:41,523 --> 01:05:43,404
[SPEAKER_36]: The acting chief who did an amazing job.

792
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:52,571
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm sure we had qualified candidates that could be appointed tonight as interim chiefs tonight that weren't part of it.

793
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:03,939
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

794
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:10,123
[SPEAKER_55]: We're gonna, you know, if there's a response to the administration or any other questions for the administration, we'll go there now.

795
01:06:10,844 --> 01:06:12,285
[SPEAKER_55]: Any other questions from Councilors?

796
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:17,468
[SPEAKER_55]: Anything you'd like to clarify on your end, Madam Chief of Staff or Madam Mayor?

797
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,170
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, seeing none.

798
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:27,154
[SPEAKER_55]: How many people in this room would like to speak tonight?

799
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:28,095
[SPEAKER_55]: Please raise your hand.

800
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:32,127
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, that is a reasonable number of people.

801
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:40,011
[SPEAKER_55]: Last week, two weeks ago, we had over 70 people speak in public comment, so I made a decision as chair to go to two minutes.

802
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:44,493
[SPEAKER_55]: Seeing that we have about 10 people tonight, we're gonna go by the city council rules, which are five minutes.

803
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:50,996
[SPEAKER_55]: and I'm going to ask you, just if you could, we have a piece of paper over there, Mr. Buckley, you can go after.

804
01:06:51,016 --> 01:06:54,858
[SPEAKER_55]: Just for the record, we have assistant clerk Sylvina with us tonight.

805
01:06:55,418 --> 01:07:00,560
[SPEAKER_55]: Just for our records, we're asking people to sign up, so we make sure we get your name and your address correct for speaking.

806
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:07,884
[SPEAKER_55]: So I'm gonna start timer, five minutes, I'll give a 30 second warning, and we will go to you, Mr. Buckley.

807
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:17,335
[SPEAKER_36]: just a point of information to the chair.

808
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:23,878
[SPEAKER_36]: A deputy retired on January 7th, and a promotion can take place the next day or two days after.

809
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:29,821
[SPEAKER_36]: January 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, all the way into February, there was no promotion made on that position.

810
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:33,023
[SPEAKER_36]: So it had nothing to do with any alleged sick time use.

811
01:07:33,943 --> 01:07:35,044
[SPEAKER_36]: That's just a point of information.

812
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:39,348
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening, Councilors, and thank you all tonight for your comments so far.

813
01:07:40,049 --> 01:07:45,491
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm here tonight to ask you to vote no on the Mayor's request to move the position of Fire Chief from Civil Service.

814
01:07:46,431 --> 01:07:50,633
[SPEAKER_36]: The following is an excerpt from a white letter written by the late Senator Ken Donnery.

815
01:07:51,693 --> 01:08:05,601
[SPEAKER_36]: The civil service system was instituted to manage how public employees are recruited, screened for legality and security purposes, trained, disciplined, classified, compensated, promoted, and in some case retired.

816
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:08,983
[SPEAKER_36]: Massachusetts was one of the first states that passed a merit system in 1883.

817
01:08:09,143 --> 01:08:20,290
[SPEAKER_36]: History will show that the implementation of this system became a necessity due to the inefficient workforce that came about because of political and patronage abuses.

818
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:25,332
[SPEAKER_36]: Before the inception of the civil service system, public service was in a serious decay.

819
01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:27,833
[SPEAKER_36]: Outright corruption was not uncommon.

820
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:31,014
[SPEAKER_36]: The spore system became an established institution.

821
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:37,057
[SPEAKER_36]: Decisions on appointments, promotions, and removal of jobs were made solely for political purposes.

822
01:08:37,817 --> 01:08:43,800
[SPEAKER_36]: The morale of the workforce was at an all-time low, and a system had to be devised to find a solution to these problems.

823
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,381
[SPEAKER_36]: The solution is to set up a merit system for the following reasons.

824
01:08:48,101 --> 01:08:53,222
[SPEAKER_36]: The merit system removes moralizing influence that political interference usually causes.

825
01:08:53,963 --> 01:09:00,904
[SPEAKER_36]: It ensures that the civil service servant's loyalty is given to the public they serve rather than the politician in power.

826
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:07,726
[SPEAKER_36]: It gives employees some job security without which no technical or professional officer can do their work.

827
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:13,388
[SPEAKER_36]: And it elevates the civil service workforce to a higher plane of professionalization.

828
01:09:14,653 --> 01:09:22,458
[SPEAKER_36]: This process has been a vital pathway for veterans and disabled veterans to obtain gainful and meaningful employment, grounded in a fair selection system.

829
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:31,525
[SPEAKER_36]: Although the mayor is only asking to remove the fire chief from civil service at this time, make no doubt about it, she will attempt to do the same with future new hires.

830
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:33,846
[SPEAKER_36]: Give an inch and they will take a mile.

831
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:43,553
[SPEAKER_36]: This will allow cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism to creep into our city, all of which is currently being mitigated through the civil service process.

832
01:09:45,088 --> 01:09:49,892
[SPEAKER_36]: position with someone of the mayor's choosing is a detriment to the city and a danger to the department.

833
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:56,776
[SPEAKER_36]: Appointed positions leave the door open to favoritism, coercion, and political patronage.

834
01:09:57,437 --> 01:10:04,261
[SPEAKER_36]: The chief must be able to stand their ground on the basis of safety, even if it is not a politically favorable position or decision.

835
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:13,708
[SPEAKER_36]: If appointed, making these decisions become almost impossible for fear of biting the hand that feeds you, or worse, for being terminated for doing the right thing.

836
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:16,092
B O O M

837
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:24,667
[SPEAKER_36]: The instability and chaos within a department created by a potentially revolving door for the fire chief's position is unmeasurable.

838
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:32,110
[SPEAKER_36]: Firefighters need to have confidence in their leader on the fire ground and administratively, even though he is not OVC eye to eye.

839
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:46,376
[SPEAKER_36]: Our city, specifically under the current mayor, has had multiple personal scandals involving the hiring, firing, disputes turning into legal battles, and a particularly tumultuous reputation with labor contract negotiations.

840
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:52,014
[SPEAKER_36]: There have been major positions within the city government that have gone vacant for months or even years.

841
01:10:52,816 --> 01:11:00,287
[SPEAKER_36]: The last thing the city should do is hand over the reins of hiring, firing, and directing of the fire chief to this current administration.

842
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:12,535
[SPEAKER_36]: Civil service has and will continue to be that governing body that will establish a set of regulations, timelines, procedures, qualifications to be met as a way to standardize the process.

843
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:20,620
[SPEAKER_36]: Within our ranks, we have decades of experience on the fire ground and a profound understanding of departmental procedures.

844
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:29,667
[SPEAKER_36]: These members have an intimate knowledge of the unique city infrastructure, the layout and size, and most importantly, respect for our citizens.

845
01:11:30,592 --> 01:11:34,953
[SPEAKER_36]: Our union and the membership of this department are invested in the well-being of this city.

846
01:11:35,773 --> 01:11:42,834
[SPEAKER_36]: Our investment is built on the oath we take as firefighters to do all we can for our city and the people who call us in an emergency.

847
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:50,136
[SPEAKER_36]: We only ask that you, the city, provide us with the necessary tools, equipment, and facilities and confidence to let us work.

848
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:57,197
[SPEAKER_36]: Today, it was very troubling to hear that the mayor had offered the chief to someone outside the city of the fire department.

849
01:11:57,987 --> 01:12:04,012
[SPEAKER_36]: Her decision was made unilaterally, without regard for this city charter, and has complete disregard for this council.

850
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:07,914
[SPEAKER_36]: its opinion or results of this meeting.

851
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:15,761
[SPEAKER_36]: The members of this council here today ran for office on the platform that fights for the people of Medford basic needs.

852
01:12:16,522 --> 01:12:27,551
[SPEAKER_36]: While supporting local labor with a quote from the platform reading, we commit to supporting local labor unions, keeping public jobs public by rejecting outsourcing.

853
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:27,931
[SPEAKER_51]: 30 seconds.

854
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:44,616
[SPEAKER_36]: We ask that the council acknowledge that we, as a union, feel that outsourcing a job that has always been hired from a pool of long-time and heavily invested members is damaging and goes against the ideal of this department, and we'd assume the ideals of this council.

855
01:12:45,216 --> 01:12:52,839
[SPEAKER_36]: We hope that this council declines the motion to hire a chief from outside the department, outside our union, and outside our city.

856
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:56,060
[SPEAKER_36]: Please keep politics out of public safety.

857
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:22,123
[SPEAKER_55]: As has been our principle, I'm going to go to Guy Manganiello on Zoom.

858
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:24,504
[SPEAKER_55]: You can speak for five minutes.

859
01:13:24,564 --> 01:13:26,224
[SPEAKER_55]: Please give your name and address for the record.

860
01:13:27,184 --> 01:13:28,245
[SPEAKER_55]: And the hand is gone.

861
01:13:28,265 --> 01:13:34,727
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm gonna ask you to unmute if you're on mute.

862
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:39,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Apologies, Mr. President.

863
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:45,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking at speaking this evening, but not particularly on this topic.

864
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:48,776
[SPEAKER_13]: When you had asked the question, you had asked if anybody planned on speaking this evening.

865
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:51,678
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was the- Thank you.

866
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:55,861
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, we'll go to Mr. Jones.

867
01:13:55,961 --> 01:13:57,702
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, and you'll have five minutes.

868
01:13:58,602 --> 01:13:59,723
[SPEAKER_36]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

869
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:00,644
[SPEAKER_36]: Mary's Street, Method Mass.

870
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:04,587
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, I think it might be what's up.

871
01:14:05,448 --> 01:14:06,569
[SPEAKER_55]: Tap the microphone base.

872
01:14:06,669 --> 01:14:07,530
[SPEAKER_55]: I think it shut off.

873
01:14:10,288 --> 01:14:11,669
[SPEAKER_58]: Here we go again.

874
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:15,432
[SPEAKER_58]: I am embarrassed to be here in front of the council for these issues.

875
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:19,775
[SPEAKER_36]: I'd like to address some of the city council's comments, concerns and questions.

876
01:14:20,395 --> 01:14:29,061
[SPEAKER_36]: First of all, second of all, we in this union as professionals try to keep our issues in house and internal.

877
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:31,383
[SPEAKER_36]: Apparently the mayor doesn't agree with that.

878
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:32,384
[SPEAKER_36]: So here we are.

879
01:14:33,144 --> 01:14:34,205
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's get them all out there.

880
01:14:35,005 --> 01:14:39,649
[SPEAKER_58]: Mr. Leming asked about the fact that

881
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,532
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm sorry, it was a question again to refresh my memory.

882
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,074
[SPEAKER_58]: There's so many things that I'd like to.

883
01:14:46,836 --> 01:14:49,258
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Leming, if you'd like to clarify and I'll pause your time.

884
01:14:49,338 --> 01:14:49,539
[SPEAKER_55]: So,

885
01:14:54,062 --> 01:15:00,485
[SPEAKER_21]: The two things that I brought up were first off the issue of the sick time abuse that occurred in early February.

886
01:15:00,545 --> 01:15:04,246
[SPEAKER_21]: The point that I was bringing up was that I

887
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:38,465
[SPEAKER_21]: need to be convinced that whatever future leader that is hired, is appointed, does not lead the fire department to a position where they're making the five o'clock news in the future.

888
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:46,027
[SPEAKER_21]: That to me is the bottom line behind, like even beyond a lot of the morale issues that have been brought up.

889
01:15:47,528 --> 01:15:49,568
[SPEAKER_21]: My perspective is that,

890
01:15:52,045 --> 01:16:00,068
[SPEAKER_21]: doing this would lead to people thinking that they could never make it to the top, which obviously affects motivation.

891
01:16:00,568 --> 01:16:20,136
[SPEAKER_21]: But at the same time, if you bring an outside officer to lead a new unit, that is more effective at inducing culture change than having somebody that has spent their entire career in that particular body.

892
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:39,869
[SPEAKER_21]: So I have not seen anything that can convince me that the current civil service process will effectively address any sick time abuse issues that are currently happening.

893
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,911
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where I'm at right now.

894
01:16:48,268 --> 01:16:50,869
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think this was another point that I brought up.

895
01:16:50,889 --> 01:17:05,733
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't necessarily a question, but it was kind of supporting that point was the fact that there was one person who actually took the exam this past time to go from deputy to higher chief.

896
01:17:05,814 --> 01:17:08,874
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I don't want to speculate as to the reasons for that.

897
01:17:09,195 --> 01:17:10,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Four people signed up, one person took it.

898
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:13,356
[SPEAKER_21]: That is a fact that has been established by both sides.

899
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:16,437
[SPEAKER_21]: But to me, that is evidence against

900
01:17:17,117 --> 01:17:30,140
[SPEAKER_21]: the idea that the civil service position, when applied every single promotional round, would actually hire competitive leadership.

901
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Those were the specific points that I brought up.

902
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:40,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, to my colleague's point about, you know, potential litigation here, I do respect that.

903
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:52,789
[SPEAKER_21]: I do respect that this is not something that firefighters of the union can necessarily speak directly to.

904
01:17:52,849 --> 01:18:07,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I have asked folks that I can find, and they typically have referred me to either representatives from the union or union lawyers, which that's the response that I've gotten.

905
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:09,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are my thoughts.

906
01:18:10,184 --> 01:18:13,906
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the result of where... That's the result.

907
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:25,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, to summarize, if an outside leader can keep the fire department from making the news with corruption allegations in the future, then I will be voting for an outside leader.

908
01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:31,250
[SPEAKER_55]: To refresh my memories... I'll put you back on.

909
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:31,871
[SPEAKER_55]: Sorry, go ahead.

910
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:32,591
[SPEAKER_55]: What's the clarification?

911
01:18:32,611 --> 01:18:33,611
[SPEAKER_36]: Who went to the news?

912
01:18:35,492 --> 01:18:36,192
[SPEAKER_55]: The early...

913
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:48,654
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a fair point.

914
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:12,606
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think the nature of the point of who went to the news is like, okay, so it was the mayor that presented the news release there.

915
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:26,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thought about that too, like clearly the idea here is the mayor, like, there's the sick time issue that happened, the mayor brought that to the news.

916
01:19:26,976 --> 01:19:30,439
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, this absolutely is a situation where

917
01:19:31,459 --> 01:19:33,121
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor brings something to the news.

918
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:36,423
[SPEAKER_21]: It is public points against the fire department.

919
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:40,646
[SPEAKER_21]: There's totally political maneuvering here.

920
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:53,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the thing, if the fire department is gonna do that, you can't put yourselves in a position where somebody can give your actions to a local news source and it's worth reporting.

921
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:56,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, does that make sense?

922
01:19:56,886 --> 01:19:57,807
[SPEAKER_36]: Not really.

923
01:19:57,847 --> 01:20:10,263
[SPEAKER_36]: I was surprised that you covered it, actually, with everything else that's going on in the city, the country, and the world, that our staffing issues was the second lead news story on the...

924
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,705
[SPEAKER_36]: on the 5 o'clock rules.

925
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:16,867
[SPEAKER_55]: If I may, I'd like to avoid further back and forth.

926
01:20:16,887 --> 01:20:18,148
[SPEAKER_55]: I appreciate the clarification.

927
01:20:18,168 --> 01:20:19,269
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't think we wanted to go on this.

928
01:20:19,329 --> 01:20:23,891
[SPEAKER_55]: We don't want to hear from everybody, but I appreciate you asking, Mr. Jones.

929
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:24,612
[SPEAKER_55]: I'll go back to you.

930
01:20:24,652 --> 01:20:27,073
[SPEAKER_55]: I think we have a clear understanding of what to respond to.

931
01:20:27,153 --> 01:20:31,315
[SPEAKER_36]: I'd like to answer all questions as far as the exam.

932
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:35,818
[SPEAKER_36]: As far as the exam, the deputy chief that took the exam, Chief Friedman, passed the exam, correct?

933
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:39,580
[SPEAKER_36]: So obviously, he studied and has a knowledge base to do that.

934
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:47,924
[SPEAKER_36]: As far as people not going to the exam and not taking the test, I don't know where that information came from, because I wasn't there, and I would dispute any of that.

935
01:20:49,084 --> 01:21:02,750
[SPEAKER_36]: As far as Councilor, I think it's Councilor Lazzaro, your comments, with the staffing we've been in my 23 years on this department, if we had sufficient staffing, then we wouldn't have had a hire all the time.

936
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:04,011
[SPEAKER_36]: We have had.

937
01:21:11,152 --> 01:21:13,353
[SPEAKER_36]: We haven't hired a firefighter in 15 months.

938
01:21:13,753 --> 01:21:16,173
[SPEAKER_36]: In that time, we've had approximately 10 retirements.

939
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:18,494
[SPEAKER_36]: So who's looking at that?

940
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:19,634
[SPEAKER_36]: We are.

941
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:21,655
[SPEAKER_36]: Apparently, nobody else cares about it.

942
01:21:22,475 --> 01:21:32,158
[SPEAKER_36]: Going back to the deputy chief that's not promoted, the deputy chief that's not promoted is causing another deputy chief to work overtime in his spot whenever he's supposed to work.

943
01:21:32,558 --> 01:21:35,559
[SPEAKER_36]: That's to the tune of about $45,000 at this point.

944
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,880
[SPEAKER_36]: Going back to the other promotional issues,

945
01:21:39,972 --> 01:21:44,316
[SPEAKER_36]: A chief leaving the department happens every day all across the state.

946
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:53,044
[SPEAKER_36]: Common procedure is to make the senior deputy chief interim chief until a search can be done and a permanent chief can be completed.

947
01:21:53,524 --> 01:21:56,767
[SPEAKER_32]: We have two deputies right here that could be named chief tomorrow.

948
01:21:57,408 --> 01:21:58,429
[SPEAKER_36]: We have five deputies.

949
01:22:05,725 --> 01:22:11,550
[SPEAKER_36]: There's five deputies that have over 20 years experience that could go into the job, no problem.

950
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:12,991
[SPEAKER_36]: No problem at all.

951
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:16,435
[SPEAKER_36]: There are just so many things.

952
01:22:16,455 --> 01:22:18,016
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't have a city solicitor, correct?

953
01:22:18,056 --> 01:22:20,138
[SPEAKER_36]: How many open jobs out there in the city right now?

954
01:22:21,379 --> 01:22:22,620
[SPEAKER_36]: Many, many jobs.

955
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,982
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand the mayor is an attorney.

956
01:22:25,763 --> 01:22:27,645
[SPEAKER_36]: Is there a city solicitor's job that's open?

957
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:29,666
[SPEAKER_36]: It has been for some time.

958
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:33,801
[SPEAKER_36]: So she's in the field, and she can't hire a city solicitor.

959
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:36,302
[SPEAKER_36]: But she's going to go outside and hire a chief for us.

960
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:45,245
[SPEAKER_36]: Does that make sense?

961
01:22:45,325 --> 01:22:47,126
[SPEAKER_36]: And the comments that we do have a contract.

962
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:48,426
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, we do have a contract.

963
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:54,128
[SPEAKER_36]: We had some negotiations with the team that's on Zoom for approximately three years.

964
01:22:54,748 --> 01:22:58,710
[SPEAKER_36]: And only when we decided to go to arbitration, we got a contract.

965
01:22:59,864 --> 01:23:03,827
[SPEAKER_36]: All the units in this room have to go to arbitration for a contract.

966
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,730
[SPEAKER_36]: We can't sit in a room and talk to each other.

967
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,091
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not done.

968
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:10,352
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not done with this administration.

969
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:14,596
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm glad to see the mayor was at least here on Zoom, but she didn't come to any of our meetings.

970
01:23:15,236 --> 01:23:20,861
[SPEAKER_36]: We have to have a back and forth with the administration.

971
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:31,622
[SPEAKER_36]: So as far as the city solicitor goes, one of the duties of the city solicitor is to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests, correct?

972
01:23:31,662 --> 01:23:32,523
[SPEAKER_36]: Is that one of the things that they do?

973
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:34,875
[SPEAKER_55]: Yeah, who does that now?

974
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:37,996
[SPEAKER_55]: We put one in- Public records officers, Janice.

975
01:23:38,316 --> 01:23:38,576
[SPEAKER_36]: Really?

976
01:23:38,616 --> 01:23:43,339
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, we put them in and it went unfilled, as all these other units have in the room.

977
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:44,720
[SPEAKER_36]: They go unfilled.

978
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:50,082
[SPEAKER_36]: They have to be, we have to file a complaint with the attorney general's office to get the information.

979
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:54,245
[SPEAKER_36]: The information that we had to get is for KP law.

980
01:23:54,265 --> 01:23:56,145
[SPEAKER_36]: $825,000 had been expended at that point.

981
01:24:04,326 --> 01:24:09,247
[SPEAKER_36]: was ever on a Zoom call, would anybody like to comment or update that number?

982
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,268
[SPEAKER_36]: Because I'm sure it's well over a million right now.

983
01:24:11,288 --> 01:24:14,449
[SPEAKER_36]: If you want to talk about money and wasting of money.

984
01:24:15,629 --> 01:24:17,370
[SPEAKER_36]: And we've had many cases.

985
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,410
[SPEAKER_36]: How much open litigation is it with the city?

986
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:27,512
[SPEAKER_36]: What is the value, the exposure of the lawsuits that the city is going to lose in the near future because of their actions?

987
01:24:30,073 --> 01:24:32,494
[SPEAKER_58]: KP Law, I don't know the case that they've won.

988
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:35,385
[SPEAKER_58]: Can you update that to the chair?

989
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:36,566
[SPEAKER_58]: Anybody on Zoom?

990
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:40,750
[SPEAKER_53]: I don't have the answer to that question.

991
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,911
[SPEAKER_53]: I'd love to get it.

992
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:44,613
[SPEAKER_55]: I will give the administration- I'd love to get it.

993
01:24:44,653 --> 01:24:47,756
[SPEAKER_36]: Another thing is open meeting violation requests.

994
01:24:48,437 --> 01:24:51,179
[SPEAKER_36]: If you're the city council and that's a legal opinion, what do you do?

995
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,542
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you call KP law?

996
01:24:53,562 --> 01:24:53,982
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah.

997
01:24:55,283 --> 01:24:55,444
[SPEAKER_36]: Why?

998
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,781
[SPEAKER_36]: and clear that they do not work for the city council.

999
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,723
[SPEAKER_36]: Special council, special council status.

1000
01:25:02,743 --> 01:25:09,869
[SPEAKER_55]: The current process is that we reach out to the mayor, the chief of staff, and KP Law when we need legal support.

1001
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:20,597
[SPEAKER_36]: Through the chair, so council president's right, if there's an issue right now and we need a legal representation, we don't know, we would have to ask if KP Law was on, and most of the time they're not.

1002
01:25:20,977 --> 01:25:26,722
[SPEAKER_36]: So we don't have anybody onsite ready to help us if we have issues, which would put us in some,

1003
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:28,443
[SPEAKER_36]: really bad situations.

1004
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:34,207
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's denying you the opportunity to get a legal opinion, which is denying you the ability to do your job.

1005
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:36,369
[SPEAKER_55]: It's delaying, I would say.

1006
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:38,931
[SPEAKER_36]: Have you got one that was fulfilled?

1007
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:42,033
[SPEAKER_55]: We have had legal representation at several times when we requested it, yeah.

1008
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:43,955
[SPEAKER_36]: All right, well, I'm glad they're being fulfilled.

1009
01:25:44,575 --> 01:25:47,397
[SPEAKER_36]: The other thing is taking the chief out of civil service.

1010
01:25:47,438 --> 01:25:52,521
[SPEAKER_36]: It's clearly a reaction to the mayor being upset about something.

1011
01:25:52,902 --> 01:25:55,223
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, you have people

1012
01:25:56,286 --> 01:26:04,030
[SPEAKER_36]: In this city, in this department, our contract states we will promote by civil service laws and rules.

1013
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,591
[SPEAKER_36]: That's what it is, like it or not.

1014
01:26:07,172 --> 01:26:09,293
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Jones, you have about 30 seconds.

1015
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:09,773
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay.

1016
01:26:10,153 --> 01:26:11,053
[SPEAKER_36]: I could be here all night.

1017
01:26:11,494 --> 01:26:21,499
[SPEAKER_36]: But the other thing is that when you hire an outside person, which I know the person that she's offered the job to, she's already been somewhere and been let go.

1018
01:26:22,895 --> 01:26:32,198
[SPEAKER_36]: people have a buy-in, people that are in this department, in this city, they have loyalty, they have a buy-in, they have institutional knowledge, they have ties to the city.

1019
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:48,124
[SPEAKER_36]: You go outside the city, where apparently that's okay in this administration, there are people that aren't from Medford, and apparently don't care about Medford, have no ties, no loyalty, just a job, when it's over, they'll go, and whatever happens, happens.

1020
01:26:49,225 --> 01:26:49,965
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you, Mr. Bowen.

1021
01:26:59,221 --> 01:27:04,713
[SPEAKER_55]: I do have, Mr. Kennedy, if you just give me a moment, we have the Chief of Staff has a hand raised, Madam Chief of Staff on Zoom.

1022
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:08,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1023
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:31,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Several things that were stated I feel the need to address first and foremost We've said many times before here and in other forums one-on-one with city Councilors We're not going to get into a scenario where we get into back and forth discussion on collective bargaining but one thing is very clear and I want to make sure that the council knows this because

1024
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:41,922
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, perhaps the narrative tonight from the union is convenient that we don't meet with the union, but in fact, we do have many meetings with the union on the side.

1025
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:48,463
[SPEAKER_11]: The union meets with our human resources department, the human resources director with legal involved as well.

1026
01:27:48,844 --> 01:27:51,984
[SPEAKER_11]: The union meets with the mayor when asked.

1027
01:27:52,425 --> 01:27:55,485
[SPEAKER_11]: The union has reached out to the mayor and the mayor has responded.

1028
01:27:55,505 --> 01:27:57,586
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor has reached out to the union in the past.

1029
01:27:57,946 --> 01:28:00,847
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been many meetings over the course of my time as chief of staff.

1030
01:28:01,207 --> 01:28:10,758
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want anyone to be under the impression that there haven't been one-on-one meetings with the mayor during negotiations on the side to try to attempt to resolve negotiations.

1031
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:14,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize that was an arduous road, but I just want to be clear about that one fact.

1032
01:28:15,313 --> 01:28:23,559
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as how much the city has spent on legal counsel, legal counsel has, the numbers that were presented tonight must be for multiple years.

1033
01:28:24,059 --> 01:28:29,183
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we've shared with the prior counsel, I realize new Councilors may not have this information, so sharing for them.

1034
01:28:29,563 --> 01:28:36,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that existing Councilors have this information, but we have spent approximately $450,000 a year.

1035
01:28:36,948 --> 01:28:41,491
[SPEAKER_11]: We also did a survey of 16 communities in our nearby area.

1036
01:28:41,872 --> 01:28:44,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And of those 16 communities, we only,

1037
01:28:45,274 --> 01:28:49,838
[SPEAKER_11]: We only had our numbers and their numbers.

1038
01:28:50,138 --> 01:28:55,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we did that, we found that we were the third lowest in total cost.

1039
01:28:56,222 --> 01:28:57,163
[SPEAKER_11]: We have that data.

1040
01:28:57,203 --> 01:28:58,664
[SPEAKER_11]: We shared it with the prior council.

1041
01:28:58,704 --> 01:29:00,546
[SPEAKER_11]: We're happy to share it with this current council.

1042
01:29:01,443 --> 01:29:24,305
[SPEAKER_11]: also um many times I know the council knows this but for the purposes of addressing an issue that came up earlier many times council chairs reach out to kp law directly as well not saying that the procedure isn't as was presented again tonight and but we are working with the council I believe I hope the council is you know generally feeling like kp law is responsive I believe they are um

1043
01:29:25,345 --> 01:29:29,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And they sometimes go to KP Law directly and schedule dates.

1044
01:29:29,528 --> 01:29:30,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just copied on it.

1045
01:29:30,609 --> 01:29:31,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't interfere.

1046
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:32,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have anything to do with it.

1047
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:33,191
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets completed.

1048
01:29:33,992 --> 01:29:44,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, a comment about someone coming into this community who's already been let go from another place, that's beyond reality.

1049
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: The reality is we're looking at retired individuals, not somebody who's been asked to leave another community or terminated from another community.

1050
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:53,887
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking for seasoned professionals.

1051
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:54,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1052
01:29:56,803 --> 01:29:57,944
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1053
01:29:58,284 --> 01:29:59,264
[SPEAKER_51]: We will go to the podium.

1054
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:00,585
[SPEAKER_51]: Name and address for the record, please.

1055
01:30:00,965 --> 01:30:01,546
[SPEAKER_51]: Five minutes.

1056
01:30:01,986 --> 01:30:02,466
[SPEAKER_35]: Good evening.

1057
01:30:02,506 --> 01:30:03,547
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Thomas Ross.

1058
01:30:03,727 --> 01:30:06,508
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a resident of 53 Irving Street in Medford.

1059
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:07,909
[SPEAKER_35]: Long time ties to the city.

1060
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:09,330
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been here over 27 years.

1061
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:12,672
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm also the vice president of the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts.

1062
01:30:13,112 --> 01:30:17,334
[SPEAKER_35]: And before I delve into my remarks, I just want to address a couple of the issues I heard.

1063
01:30:17,715 --> 01:30:21,377
[SPEAKER_35]: The mayor made a statement that overtime is out of control.

1064
01:30:21,397 --> 01:30:24,158
[SPEAKER_35]: Overtime is out of control, just to reiterate what

1065
01:30:25,839 --> 01:30:32,721
[SPEAKER_35]: Bobby Jones said, the city of Medford Fire Department is budgeted right now for 124 firefighters.

1066
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:36,062
[SPEAKER_35]: There are currently 102 firefighters on the job.

1067
01:30:36,782 --> 01:30:41,544
[SPEAKER_35]: Those extra 22 firefighters would go a long way to reducing the amount of overtime cost in the city.

1068
01:30:42,164 --> 01:30:47,986
[SPEAKER_35]: Number two, I think we're getting mixed up with the sick leave issue and taking the chief out of civil service.

1069
01:30:48,266 --> 01:30:50,406
[SPEAKER_35]: Those are two dramatically different things.

1070
01:30:50,726 --> 01:30:52,507
[SPEAKER_35]: Taking the chief out of civil service

1071
01:30:56,244 --> 01:30:58,866
[SPEAKER_35]: is a reaction to what has happened here.

1072
01:30:59,106 --> 01:31:01,708
[SPEAKER_35]: But things are getting out of control because maybe morale is bad.

1073
01:31:01,968 --> 01:31:03,669
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know what the exact issues are.

1074
01:31:03,909 --> 01:31:06,410
[SPEAKER_35]: But these two, these are two different automatically.

1075
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:10,052
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been on the fire department myself for almost 37 years.

1076
01:31:10,072 --> 01:31:12,514
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been elected union official for over 33 years.

1077
01:31:12,734 --> 01:31:15,736
[SPEAKER_35]: I know a little bit about civil service and the civil service process.

1078
01:31:15,996 --> 01:31:17,457
[SPEAKER_35]: And right now we're going through the process.

1079
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:24,601
[SPEAKER_35]: What we have to do in order to take the chief out of civil service, the board has to petition the courts, the general courts,

1080
01:31:24,921 --> 01:31:28,684
[SPEAKER_35]: Senate and the House of Representatives for a home rule petition.

1081
01:31:28,944 --> 01:31:35,129
[SPEAKER_35]: It has to be voted here, then it has to be approved and brought forward and voted in the House and Senate.

1082
01:31:35,689 --> 01:31:36,490
[SPEAKER_35]: This hasn't been done.

1083
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:37,891
[SPEAKER_35]: It hasn't been done.

1084
01:31:37,931 --> 01:31:39,352
[SPEAKER_35]: It hasn't gone through the council yet.

1085
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:43,695
[SPEAKER_35]: So until then, that is still a civil service position.

1086
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:47,158
[SPEAKER_35]: And the mayor, I wish we had a city solicitor.

1087
01:31:47,338 --> 01:31:50,601
[SPEAKER_35]: The mayor has no right to offer that job outside of civil service.

1088
01:31:50,861 --> 01:31:52,922
[SPEAKER_35]: And she's already done it.

1089
01:31:59,944 --> 01:32:09,951
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for allowing me my time to address the body regarding civil service and how important it is to keep the fire chief in civil service in order to be an effective fire chief.

1090
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:12,533
[SPEAKER_35]: You have to have intimate knowledge.

1091
01:32:13,614 --> 01:32:24,341
[SPEAKER_35]: Of the city that you were going to be working in in your community and Medford, not like unlike other communities, has unique challenges facing the fire service that require the chief to beware of many things.

1092
01:32:24,762 --> 01:32:26,203
[SPEAKER_35]: The layout and the design of the city.

1093
01:32:27,903 --> 01:32:31,385
[SPEAKER_35]: all the Title III facilities that house dangerous and hazardous materials.

1094
01:32:32,106 --> 01:32:38,129
[SPEAKER_35]: They need to know about large warehouses with heavy fire loads, mercantile as well as manufacturing companies.

1095
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:51,937
[SPEAKER_35]: They also need to know about special buildings, not limited to elderly housing, high rises, schools, bio labs, and of course, let's not forget the large campus that we have, Tufts University, which has a number of hazardous materials and bio labs.

1096
01:32:53,315 --> 01:33:02,564
[SPEAKER_35]: Medford also has a very complicated water delivery system that we need to have to provide our citizens with protection with proper water pressure.

1097
01:33:03,865 --> 01:33:12,352
[SPEAKER_35]: The way this is set up, the chief has to know how this water pressure affects different fires and how they use their resources.

1098
01:33:12,633 --> 01:33:18,178
[SPEAKER_35]: This is something that only a Medford chief that has many, many years of experience is going to understand.

1099
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:24,655
[SPEAKER_35]: They also need to utilize the resources that best meets the demands of the department.

1100
01:33:25,096 --> 01:33:27,698
[SPEAKER_35]: And one of those resources is our personnel.

1101
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:34,425
[SPEAKER_35]: The chief needs to have an understanding of the fire company officers and the firefighters, their special

1102
01:33:35,706 --> 01:33:52,524
[SPEAKER_35]: certificates that they have their years of experience, their knowledge, the areas that they grew up in, that they have a very intimate knowledge of the areas that they're providing serious service, where they may be working in the area they grew up, and they know every single street, every single building.

1103
01:33:52,784 --> 01:33:54,086
[SPEAKER_35]: And the same thing that deputy chiefs,

1104
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:55,446
[SPEAKER_35]: They're working right now.

1105
01:33:55,826 --> 01:33:59,688
[SPEAKER_35]: They've had many, many thousands of calls to different parts of the city.

1106
01:33:59,888 --> 01:34:00,888
[SPEAKER_35]: They're in these buildings.

1107
01:34:01,088 --> 01:34:02,869
[SPEAKER_35]: They have knowledge of the layout of the schools.

1108
01:34:03,089 --> 01:34:07,990
[SPEAKER_35]: They have knowledge of the layout of these larger buildings that have dangers in our community.

1109
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:09,811
[SPEAKER_35]: They know what to do.

1110
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:19,634
[SPEAKER_35]: And we need to have a professional, experienced fire chief coming within the ranks so they have that institutional knowledge that you'll never get.

1111
01:34:20,014 --> 01:34:22,375
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll never get that from somebody coming from outside the community.

1112
01:34:25,185 --> 01:34:26,126
[SPEAKER_35]: in about 30 seconds.

1113
01:34:26,266 --> 01:34:27,548
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, I'm going to finish up.

1114
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:37,058
[SPEAKER_35]: Any chief that works to appease just the mayor, instead of working to keep its firefighters and the citizen safe is going to be ineffective and dangerous.

1115
01:34:37,498 --> 01:34:44,746
[SPEAKER_35]: metric fire department is fortunate enough right now to have multiple fire deputies in its ranks that are willing and able to take over leadership roles department.

1116
01:34:45,007 --> 01:34:45,848
[SPEAKER_35]: There's no reason

1117
01:34:46,448 --> 01:34:49,909
[SPEAKER_35]: other than politics right now to remove this position from civil service.

1118
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:59,693
[SPEAKER_35]: Now's the time for level heads to prevail, put politics aside and open up a dialogue that's going to help resolve the issues that we have between the administration and labor in the city.

1119
01:34:59,993 --> 01:35:02,394
[SPEAKER_35]: Not just the fire labor, labor in general.

1120
01:35:02,895 --> 01:35:03,835
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you very much for your time.

1121
01:35:15,407 --> 01:35:19,371
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Jones, we're gonna let everybody who's had a chance, we wanna hear from everybody if you wanna speak.

1122
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:22,414
[SPEAKER_36]: Just to rebuttal on those comments of the chief of staff.

1123
01:35:22,475 --> 01:35:26,499
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm giving everyone five minutes, but once we've gone through everyone who likes to speak, once we can hear folks again.

1124
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:30,143
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there someone who'd like to speak next?

1125
01:35:31,244 --> 01:35:32,285
[SPEAKER_55]: Write your name down, thank you.

1126
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:36,830
[SPEAKER_55]: And if you have spoken or would like to speak, please give your name to the city messenger.

1127
01:35:41,476 --> 01:35:44,238
[SPEAKER_36]: Bill Young, 110 Lincoln Road, also a member of the Medford Fire Department.

1128
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:46,960
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for the council for hearing us tonight.

1129
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:49,721
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for everybody for coming, standing up for us.

1130
01:35:50,802 --> 01:35:53,864
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wanted to talk on keeping the chief's position in civil service.

1131
01:35:54,845 --> 01:35:56,426
[SPEAKER_36]: I thought of three reasons to cover.

1132
01:35:56,446 --> 01:36:01,509
[SPEAKER_36]: I thought I was gonna have two minutes, so I put together two minutes of... I appreciate that.

1133
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:02,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Could have went on and on.

1134
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:04,051
[SPEAKER_36]: First of all, safety.

1135
01:36:05,779 --> 01:36:07,400
[SPEAKER_36]: person at the top makes those decisions.

1136
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,643
[SPEAKER_36]: They make policy and it's disseminated through the ranks.

1137
01:36:11,403 --> 01:36:21,771
[SPEAKER_36]: And if you have an appointed person to a politician, I just don't have the faith that they're gonna find the right person for that job.

1138
01:36:22,231 --> 01:36:28,256
[SPEAKER_36]: As some of these gentlemen said, that it's a,

1139
01:36:29,235 --> 01:36:30,895
[SPEAKER_36]: It's everything in this job is about safety.

1140
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:34,196
[SPEAKER_36]: It's the safety of the fire community, as well as the citizens of Medford.

1141
01:36:34,236 --> 01:36:35,036
[SPEAKER_36]: That's our priority.

1142
01:36:35,056 --> 01:36:35,657
[SPEAKER_36]: That's number one.

1143
01:36:36,817 --> 01:36:38,757
[SPEAKER_36]: Number two is integrity.

1144
01:36:39,978 --> 01:36:46,319
[SPEAKER_36]: Civil service provides a checks and balances system so that you can make the best decision.

1145
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:47,740
[SPEAKER_36]: It levels the playing field.

1146
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:57,082
[SPEAKER_36]: And I've seen what an appointee can do in this city, and it's not working.

1147
01:36:58,152 --> 01:37:00,874
[SPEAKER_36]: We've had issues with different departments.

1148
01:37:00,894 --> 01:37:06,297
[SPEAKER_36]: I've had issues with different departments and an appointee is not gonna do the trick.

1149
01:37:06,317 --> 01:37:08,818
[SPEAKER_36]: You need somebody who knows the city and can do their job.

1150
01:37:09,718 --> 01:37:12,020
[SPEAKER_36]: The third point I wanted to make was upward mobility.

1151
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:20,384
[SPEAKER_36]: It's important to have a person at the top level that gives you something to attain.

1152
01:37:20,945 --> 01:37:26,187
[SPEAKER_36]: When you open these books and you start studying, it's a lot of work and

1153
01:37:27,248 --> 01:37:30,531
[SPEAKER_36]: And you have to have that one position that you can strive for.

1154
01:37:30,551 --> 01:37:32,233
[SPEAKER_36]: And you might not make it, you might not do it.

1155
01:37:32,693 --> 01:37:35,556
[SPEAKER_36]: But every day you open those books, it makes you a better firefighter.

1156
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:38,719
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that would be taken away if this is taken out of civil service.

1157
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:50,250
[SPEAKER_54]: I just want to say, you got one minute, 54 seconds, so you aced it.

1158
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:51,111
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, OK.

1159
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:51,471
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1160
01:37:51,511 --> 01:37:51,731
Thank you.

1161
01:37:58,001 --> 01:37:59,301
[SPEAKER_37]: the fire chief position from civil service.

1162
01:37:59,321 --> 01:38:02,882
[SPEAKER_37]: Um as a Medford resident and a wife of Deputy Chief William Young, you just met.

1163
01:38:02,942 --> 01:38:03,362
[SPEAKER_17]: He I see

1164
01:38:27,489 --> 01:38:30,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Like this shows the commitment and the dedication that this family has.

1165
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:40,914
[SPEAKER_17]: However, the current efforts of the mayor wreak the worst kind of backhanded political power play you can make.

1166
01:38:41,394 --> 01:38:47,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Her actions are born out of revenge, and it's not what we elected her to do.

1167
01:38:48,775 --> 01:38:54,325
[SPEAKER_17]: As a mother of children who attend Medford schools, I recognize there is a movement to eradicate bullying.

1168
01:38:55,367 --> 01:39:01,778
[SPEAKER_17]: This is difficult when the nucleus of this behavior happens on a regular basis right here in City Hall.

1169
01:39:13,044 --> 01:39:18,546
[SPEAKER_17]: As my mother instilled in me and my sisters when we were growing up, treat others the way you want to be treated.

1170
01:39:19,226 --> 01:39:26,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your time and consideration, and I please ask you to vote no and help keep the integrity of the Medford Fire Department.

1171
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:36,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1172
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,151
[SPEAKER_53]: Who would like to speak at the podium?

1173
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:42,052
[SPEAKER_53]: Do we have anyone else to speak at the podium?

1174
01:39:44,315 --> 01:39:45,456
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, I will go back.

1175
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:46,176
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll go to round two.

1176
01:39:46,196 --> 01:39:48,799
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, first I'll go to the chief of staff, then I'll go to Mr. Jones.

1177
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:54,763
[SPEAKER_55]: And as we've noted, all of us would like to not have this be an extensive back and forth, but I will recognize folks for a second time.

1178
01:39:54,783 --> 01:39:57,525
[SPEAKER_55]: Chief of staff Nazarian, and then Mr. Jones.

1179
01:39:58,606 --> 01:39:59,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Understood, President Bears.

1180
01:39:59,647 --> 01:40:06,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Through you, to the council, and to the members of the audience, both on Zoom and present in the chambers.

1181
01:40:08,594 --> 01:40:11,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So some things that have been stated,

1182
01:40:13,063 --> 01:40:15,524
[SPEAKER_11]: The HR director is on the line, Lisa Crowley, as you know.

1183
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:26,447
[SPEAKER_11]: She can definitely speak to what effect this has because it does not affect the department, but I'll defer to her to make a clear statement about that.

1184
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:35,890
[SPEAKER_11]: What it does is it provides this community the opportunity to provide for a process that is not hamstrung by the civil service process.

1185
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:45,313
[SPEAKER_11]: the fire department employees, not at all, other than that a leadership will be the most qualified in any pool.

1186
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And that very well may be an internal candidate.

1187
01:40:48,134 --> 01:40:52,916
[SPEAKER_11]: None of this precludes them from applying and rising to the top of that process.

1188
01:40:53,856 --> 01:40:58,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be on this call and not comment as to the

1189
01:41:00,231 --> 01:41:11,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Allegations or or I don't even know what to call them the the comments about the mayor and her Intentions, I i've never worked for somebody who has more integrity than mayor.

1190
01:41:11,099 --> 01:41:12,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Brianna lungo kern.

1191
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:25,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I I really truly cannot say that I have worked for somebody who has more integrity than she does I can tell you I can tell you president bears and council members that in my time serving under mayor lungo kern

1192
01:41:26,764 --> 01:41:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I have found a person who's passionate about moving the city forward, a person who wants to ensure that everyone gets a fair opportunity, that there's equity within the community, and that there's an opportunity to disperse resources in the city in a way that provides services to every piece of our community.

1193
01:41:48,596 --> 01:41:50,136
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a difficult job that she has.

1194
01:41:50,196 --> 01:41:57,718
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can appreciate that people can easily stand there and make accusations as to her leadership.

1195
01:41:58,218 --> 01:42:02,799
[SPEAKER_11]: But does anybody understand the complexity, truly, of the work that she has to do?

1196
01:42:03,299 --> 01:42:06,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure anyone really does, because I'm not sure anyone's walked in their shoes.

1197
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:11,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like I and she probably do not understand the complexity of others and their work.

1198
01:42:12,421 --> 01:42:15,624
[SPEAKER_11]: So we try every day to make sure we do those things.

1199
01:42:15,744 --> 01:42:22,209
[SPEAKER_11]: We also want to make sure that everyone understands that this is a simple modification.

1200
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:25,392
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to remove the fire chief's position.

1201
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:27,994
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all from the civil service process.

1202
01:42:28,474 --> 01:42:33,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Allow this community to build a process that's robust and has the control of this community.

1203
01:42:33,578 --> 01:42:35,780
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many communities that have gone this direction.

1204
01:42:36,141 --> 01:42:39,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Most recently, there have been communities that have gone in this direction.

1205
01:42:39,283 --> 01:42:39,723
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact,

1206
01:42:40,504 --> 01:42:45,068
[SPEAKER_11]: There are the city of lemonster recently went in this direction november 2022.

1207
01:42:45,128 --> 01:42:56,337
[SPEAKER_11]: They removed the captain and the fire chief from the civil service process President Bears if you call me out of order, I will stop speaking.

1208
01:42:56,377 --> 01:43:04,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But until then I will continue to speak sir show some basic respect Greenfield recently removed their um

1209
01:43:06,438 --> 01:43:08,844
[SPEAKER_11]: police and fire chiefs from civil service.

1210
01:43:09,386 --> 01:43:14,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Chelmsford is in the process of removing their deputy fire chief and the chief was already out prior.

1211
01:43:15,026 --> 01:43:16,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Needham removed their fire chief.

1212
01:43:17,428 --> 01:43:21,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopedale is in the process of, Needham and Hopedale are in the process of removing their fire chief.

1213
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:23,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Rentham is removing their deputy fire chief.

1214
01:43:23,632 --> 01:43:24,533
[SPEAKER_11]: The chief was removed in 2007.

1215
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:27,936
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not new work.

1216
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:38,143
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an important step to ensure that this community can select the best candidate and a candidate that has opportunities to be selected from a wide range.

1217
01:43:38,343 --> 01:43:38,904
[SPEAKER_11]: This would bring

1218
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:52,294
[SPEAKER_11]: any opportunities for review on the process and ensure that this community can select candidates that are also outside of just one pigeon-held, very stringent process.

1219
01:43:53,433 --> 01:43:58,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I don't know where this word revenge comes from, but it's so far from the truth.

1220
01:43:58,756 --> 01:44:02,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't work for a community where my supervisor was seeking revenge on anyone.

1221
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:04,218
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no such thing here.

1222
01:44:04,698 --> 01:44:08,580
[SPEAKER_11]: To be clear, I would not put my name in a community like that.

1223
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:15,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And to anyone who thinks otherwise, I'm happy to have a meeting with you because I can't even understand those words.

1224
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:16,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1225
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:20,571
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

1226
01:44:21,852 --> 01:44:25,115
[SPEAKER_53]: We can take a recess and folks who want to do outbursts can step out if they want.

1227
01:44:27,097 --> 01:44:28,258
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, thank you.

1228
01:44:28,858 --> 01:44:34,383
[SPEAKER_55]: There were a couple people I saw stand up, which is why I didn't want to do the back and forth, because if we do back and forth people keep standing up trying to rebut each other.

1229
01:44:34,403 --> 01:44:36,565
[SPEAKER_55]: I saw Mr. Cormier, I saw Mr. Souza.

1230
01:44:36,905 --> 01:44:40,248
[SPEAKER_55]: You haven't had a chance to speak yet, so I'd like to let them go, Mr. Jones, if you don't mind.

1231
01:44:40,268 --> 01:44:40,609
[SPEAKER_55]: I'll be brief.

1232
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:45,551
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, and let's stay with that.

1233
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:52,052
[SPEAKER_32]: Just to the individual that was off at the chief shop was chief in another community, correct?

1234
01:44:52,633 --> 01:44:54,073
[SPEAKER_36]: Recently has been let go.

1235
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:56,794
[SPEAKER_36]: I've talked to the people under his command at length.

1236
01:44:57,474 --> 01:45:06,536
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't want to really talk too much about this other individual because he removed himself, which if I was not concerned, he did the right thing in that in that question for the chief of staff.

1237
01:45:06,976 --> 01:45:10,337
[SPEAKER_36]: Have you been with the mayor since her initial election?

1238
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:15,610
[SPEAKER_53]: Mr. Jones, I mean, we're not gonna get in direct questions back and forth.

1239
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:16,090
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm just asking.

1240
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,030
[SPEAKER_53]: I mean, I'm just wondering.

1241
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:19,610
[SPEAKER_53]: The chief of staff was not the first chief of staff, no.

1242
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,071
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, okay, all right.

1243
01:45:21,091 --> 01:45:24,331
[SPEAKER_36]: That seems to be business as usual here.

1244
01:45:25,051 --> 01:45:32,953
[SPEAKER_36]: So, and again, I apologize for having to hear these comments, but the mayor wanted to go public with these things, so here we are.

1245
01:45:33,793 --> 01:45:36,693
[SPEAKER_36]: The mayor has not been to one bargaining session that I have been at.

1246
01:45:36,874 --> 01:45:37,794
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm on the bargaining team.

1247
01:45:37,974 --> 01:45:39,054
[SPEAKER_36]: She has not been to one.

1248
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:43,501
[SPEAKER_36]: There has been a revolving door of bargaining people at the sessions.

1249
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:49,845
[SPEAKER_36]: You're going to see, if you talk to every other union in the city, it's the same thing.

1250
01:45:50,145 --> 01:45:51,286
[SPEAKER_36]: Business as usual.

1251
01:45:52,006 --> 01:45:54,068
[SPEAKER_36]: Nothing gets done until you file paperwork.

1252
01:45:57,013 --> 01:45:58,514
[SPEAKER_36]: just a few words about Chief Friedman.

1253
01:45:58,774 --> 01:46:00,554
[SPEAKER_36]: Probably one of the smartest guys I ever met.

1254
01:46:00,574 --> 01:46:04,035
[SPEAKER_36]: Lived, breathed, and ate the fire department.

1255
01:46:04,476 --> 01:46:08,437
[SPEAKER_36]: All he ever wanted to do, 100% commitment to this fire department.

1256
01:46:09,157 --> 01:46:12,158
[SPEAKER_36]: Once he came back from meeting with the mayor, he doesn't even want to work there anymore.

1257
01:46:13,398 --> 01:46:14,619
[SPEAKER_36]: He's trying to paint it as us.

1258
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,199
[SPEAKER_36]: It absolutely is not.

1259
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:20,621
[SPEAKER_36]: Look at the wounded soldiers from City Hall.

1260
01:46:20,641 --> 01:46:22,001
[SPEAKER_36]: A lot of turnover.

1261
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:23,882
[SPEAKER_36]: Not in the fire department.

1262
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:29,897
[SPEAKER_36]: Could you please leave the fire department, public safety up to the firefighters?

1263
01:46:30,237 --> 01:46:33,898
[SPEAKER_58]: And one question, people are gonna hire a chief for us.

1264
01:46:34,338 --> 01:46:35,619
[SPEAKER_58]: Does anybody know what our schedule is?

1265
01:46:36,379 --> 01:46:38,080
[SPEAKER_58]: Somebody who's gonna pick the chief?

1266
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:39,400
[SPEAKER_58]: What's our schedule?

1267
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:44,962
[SPEAKER_36]: Personnel director, KP Law, the mayor, what's our schedule?

1268
01:46:45,422 --> 01:46:48,263
[SPEAKER_55]: We're not gonna go into the direct back and forth, but I appreciate the question.

1269
01:46:48,324 --> 01:46:49,184
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't think anybody knows.

1270
01:46:54,883 --> 01:46:56,646
[SPEAKER_37]: I'd like to alternate.

1271
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:57,046
[SPEAKER_37]: Thanks.

1272
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:09,408
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm Eleanor O'Leary, 30 Norwood Circle, Medford, Mass.

1273
01:47:09,969 --> 01:47:12,430
[SPEAKER_56]: I am Secretary of the Teachers Union.

1274
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:25,418
[SPEAKER_56]: I would just like to state to the Chief of Staff, I sat in numerous negotiations for a few years, and we only saw the mayor once when we went to operation.

1275
01:47:26,118 --> 01:47:30,741
[SPEAKER_56]: So I'm sure I'm just wondering where

1276
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:38,682
[SPEAKER_56]: this mayor was during our negotiations and where the school committee was during negotiations.

1277
01:47:39,062 --> 01:47:43,823
[SPEAKER_56]: They never showed up once until we were told we were going to arbitration.

1278
01:47:44,483 --> 01:47:49,985
[SPEAKER_56]: So I would like to know where you say you met with the unions numerous times.

1279
01:47:50,485 --> 01:47:55,106
[SPEAKER_56]: I sat in on every negotiation and no one sat in with us.

1280
01:47:57,547 --> 01:47:57,927
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

1281
01:48:06,192 --> 01:48:07,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Ricky, call me at 150 Middle Six Ave.

1282
01:48:08,734 --> 01:48:09,674
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know much about this issue.

1283
01:48:09,714 --> 01:48:10,455
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not a firefighter.

1284
01:48:10,635 --> 01:48:12,236
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't even know much about it till tonight.

1285
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:16,879
[SPEAKER_26]: But from what I've heard, it just sounds like this is a punishment.

1286
01:48:17,559 --> 01:48:25,644
[SPEAKER_26]: It sounds like something happened that the mayor thinks happened anyways, an organized call-out, and now they're being punished by removing the top position in the departments.

1287
01:48:26,184 --> 01:48:27,986
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems like a pretty significant punishment.

1288
01:48:29,099 --> 01:48:33,904
[SPEAKER_26]: and just being trying to pass it off as we're trying to broaden our search and make it more available for more people.

1289
01:48:34,445 --> 01:48:36,627
[SPEAKER_26]: But it's ultimately, it's just a punishment.

1290
01:48:36,848 --> 01:48:41,653
[SPEAKER_26]: And even most of your questions that revolve around, was this because of a sick call?

1291
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:43,074
[SPEAKER_26]: Was this an organized call?

1292
01:48:44,569 --> 01:48:51,292
[SPEAKER_26]: Is this the appropriate punishment to remove the chief to have to go to the state house and have a home rule petition and completely remove a position?

1293
01:48:51,312 --> 01:48:55,113
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a pretty significant punishment for a couple of guys calling out one day.

1294
01:48:55,673 --> 01:48:57,254
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, I don't understand.

1295
01:48:57,274 --> 01:48:58,014
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't make sense.

1296
01:48:58,694 --> 01:49:02,656
[SPEAKER_26]: Seems really a really tough punishment to lay down.

1297
01:49:03,296 --> 01:49:04,597
[SPEAKER_26]: Treating them like children, basically.

1298
01:49:05,517 --> 01:49:08,638
[SPEAKER_26]: Grown men and women that protect your city every day and you're treating them like children.

1299
01:49:08,898 --> 01:49:11,299
[SPEAKER_26]: You did this bad thing and now you lose your chief.

1300
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:12,580
[SPEAKER_26]: That's crazy.

1301
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:13,360
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1302
01:49:24,087 --> 01:49:25,368
[SPEAKER_37]: anyone who hasn't spoken yet?

1303
01:49:25,588 --> 01:49:26,469
[SPEAKER_54]: I don't think you have, John.

1304
01:49:26,729 --> 01:49:27,790
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record, please.

1305
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:28,530
[SPEAKER_54]: You have five minutes.

1306
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:31,633
[SPEAKER_36]: John Souza, 359 Winthrop Street.

1307
01:49:33,794 --> 01:49:44,982
[SPEAKER_36]: I wasn't originally gonna speak on this particular topic, but I think, you know, luckily, Ricky and Eleanor gave a resident's perspective on the matter.

1308
01:49:45,723 --> 01:49:49,466
[SPEAKER_36]: But it clearly seems, and I've heard a word that

1309
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:55,823
[SPEAKER_36]: doesn't really sit well with me that was used earlier, control.

1310
01:49:57,003 --> 01:50:04,306
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a department that does not need to be controlled.

1311
01:50:04,466 --> 01:50:16,371
[SPEAKER_36]: That is an unnecessary response to a situation that simply takes place in all facets of employment.

1312
01:50:16,511 --> 01:50:17,211
[SPEAKER_36]: People get sick.

1313
01:50:18,331 --> 01:50:22,512
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, we are muddling two separate issues into one.

1314
01:50:23,393 --> 01:50:28,974
[SPEAKER_36]: So because control cannot be had, we will now take control.

1315
01:50:29,514 --> 01:50:31,135
[SPEAKER_36]: I disagree with this fundamentally.

1316
01:50:31,495 --> 01:50:40,618
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that this council specifically needs to understand, they need to deeply understand that a vote yes here

1317
01:50:42,978 --> 01:50:50,980
[SPEAKER_36]: is a direct slap in the face of the entire room and the people that support this city.

1318
01:51:04,183 --> 01:51:04,523
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1319
01:51:05,403 --> 01:51:05,723
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1320
01:51:10,929 --> 01:51:15,392
[SPEAKER_54]: Is there anyone who has not spoken yet who'd like to speak before I come back to someone to speak a second time?

1321
01:51:16,693 --> 01:51:17,474
[SPEAKER_54]: Mr. Merritt, go ahead.

1322
01:51:17,494 --> 01:51:19,475
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Merritt, name and address for the record, please.

1323
01:51:19,495 --> 01:51:20,096
[SPEAKER_55]: You have five minutes.

1324
01:51:20,156 --> 01:51:20,576
[SPEAKER_30]: Sure thing.

1325
01:51:20,596 --> 01:51:22,197
[SPEAKER_30]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1326
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:25,339
[SPEAKER_30]: I have to agree with the last speaker, and that was my comment.

1327
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:29,282
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry, this is so full that we got another separate room watching on the video.

1328
01:51:30,963 --> 01:51:31,624
[SPEAKER_55]: Glad we could do that.

1329
01:51:32,478 --> 01:51:32,979
[SPEAKER_30]: Absolutely.

1330
01:51:34,741 --> 01:51:38,725
[SPEAKER_30]: When I'm starting to hear questions about, well, how would you guarantee, how would this, how would that?

1331
01:51:39,186 --> 01:51:44,271
[SPEAKER_30]: The position of fire chief is it's a leadership position, but it's not a dictator and it's not a king.

1332
01:51:45,293 --> 01:51:50,138
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, all the men and women here are going to work for that person, and they give orders on a fire ground.

1333
01:51:51,018 --> 01:51:59,066
[SPEAKER_30]: But you know, there's the emergency time, there's incident, you know, commanders and management that happens, versus them, there's the administrative and personnel side.

1334
01:51:59,767 --> 01:52:08,195
[SPEAKER_30]: So let's say hypothetically, that whatever happened with sick time, this and that happened again, do you expect the fire chief to be able to sit there and unilaterally go, you're fired?

1335
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:10,555
[SPEAKER_30]: Does that happen?

1336
01:52:10,575 --> 01:52:13,116
[SPEAKER_30]: Does that happen in any leadership position that you know of?

1337
01:52:13,876 --> 01:52:17,497
[SPEAKER_30]: And through the chair to Councilor Leming, I mean, do you think that happens in the military?

1338
01:52:18,738 --> 01:52:19,918
[SPEAKER_30]: I expect you know the answer.

1339
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:22,659
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't.

1340
01:52:23,539 --> 01:52:25,540
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's kind of a conflated issue.

1341
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:30,441
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever happened with sick time and this and that is completely separate from what to do with civil service.

1342
01:52:31,101 --> 01:52:33,402
[SPEAKER_30]: This seems very reactionary on its face.

1343
01:52:34,342 --> 01:52:36,303
[SPEAKER_30]: And you all know me, I've been here for over a decade.

1344
01:52:37,506 --> 01:52:42,250
[SPEAKER_30]: I try to weigh in with logical, you know, logic on some of these things and be very balanced.

1345
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:45,052
[SPEAKER_30]: This appears and smells reactionary.

1346
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:49,335
[SPEAKER_30]: When do you install a sprinkler system in a building, before or after the fire?

1347
01:52:51,757 --> 01:52:52,418
[SPEAKER_30]: They know the answer.

1348
01:52:54,259 --> 01:52:55,200
[SPEAKER_30]: You do it before the fire.

1349
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:59,644
[SPEAKER_30]: So if you're putting out a fire now, right, it's kind of too little too late.

1350
01:52:59,664 --> 01:53:02,026
[SPEAKER_30]: This is the wrong time for this particular topic.

1351
01:53:02,346 --> 01:53:04,608
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't mean you shouldn't necessarily address it in the future.

1352
01:53:05,981 --> 01:53:07,303
[SPEAKER_30]: But why are you doing it now?

1353
01:53:09,065 --> 01:53:10,587
[SPEAKER_30]: Because the opportunity presented itself?

1354
01:53:10,647 --> 01:53:13,231
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, okay, but now's not the time.

1355
01:53:14,373 --> 01:53:16,175
[SPEAKER_30]: When would you rather buy a car?

1356
01:53:17,317 --> 01:53:22,904
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you buy a car when your old one's crapped out or do you proactively think, you know, maybe I should upgrade while I still have wheels?

1357
01:53:24,997 --> 01:53:34,366
[SPEAKER_30]: So before you make your decision, reactionary, maybe consider this in a proactive manner, maybe revisit it and table it, but now is not the time.

1358
01:53:34,386 --> 01:53:35,548
[SPEAKER_30]: This stinks to high heaven.

1359
01:53:36,028 --> 01:53:36,268
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1360
01:53:44,246 --> 01:53:44,466
[SPEAKER_55]: Nate.

1361
01:53:45,106 --> 01:53:45,566
[SPEAKER_55]: Hey, Nate.

1362
01:53:46,326 --> 01:53:47,227
[SPEAKER_55]: Could you just put your name down?

1363
01:53:47,247 --> 01:53:50,187
[SPEAKER_55]: We have a sign in list for this one so we get the records right.

1364
01:53:52,448 --> 01:53:53,868
[SPEAKER_55]: The clerk's not here tonight.

1365
01:53:53,908 --> 01:53:56,268
[SPEAKER_55]: We have assistant clerk Sylvia DePlaza.

1366
01:53:57,128 --> 01:53:57,448
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1367
01:53:58,309 --> 01:53:59,349
[SPEAKER_55]: You haven't spoken yet, Ms.

1368
01:53:59,389 --> 01:54:00,769
[SPEAKER_54]: Ellis, so I'd like to take you first.

1369
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:02,369
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm trying to be quiet.

1370
01:54:02,389 --> 01:54:05,010
[SPEAKER_54]: We'll go to you, and then we'll go to Jess Healy on Zoom.

1371
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:06,490
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm keeping a stack in my head.

1372
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:10,191
[SPEAKER_55]: We also have the chief of staff who wants to speak a third time, but we'll let him speak a second time.

1373
01:54:12,182 --> 01:54:12,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1374
01:54:12,543 --> 01:54:13,143
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1375
01:54:13,163 --> 01:54:13,904
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1376
01:54:14,625 --> 01:54:14,945
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1377
01:54:30,982 --> 01:54:38,867
[SPEAKER_50]: someone to stand up here and lie and state that the mayor attended meetings and negotiations with the union.

1378
01:54:39,328 --> 01:54:40,709
[SPEAKER_50]: She came once.

1379
01:54:41,269 --> 01:54:43,911
[SPEAKER_50]: She tried to say she came more than once.

1380
01:54:44,431 --> 01:54:50,415
[SPEAKER_50]: I stood in front of the school committee and read an email where she admitted to doing that.

1381
01:54:51,036 --> 01:54:55,279
[SPEAKER_50]: So please stop lying to the public and to us.

1382
01:54:56,667 --> 01:54:57,988
[SPEAKER_50]: The word control.

1383
01:54:58,008 --> 01:55:01,490
[SPEAKER_50]: How dare you use that word?

1384
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:03,611
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to get control?

1385
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:06,172
[SPEAKER_50]: You want to control the unions?

1386
01:55:06,533 --> 01:55:08,574
[SPEAKER_50]: Is that what this body is about?

1387
01:55:08,994 --> 01:55:10,695
[SPEAKER_50]: Is that what we're doing here?

1388
01:55:11,035 --> 01:55:13,016
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to control Mr. Beers?

1389
01:55:14,577 --> 01:55:17,360
[SPEAKER_50]: You know me, and you know me well.

1390
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,581
[SPEAKER_50]: I know you did not.

1391
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:20,823
[SPEAKER_50]: But the word control?

1392
01:55:21,363 --> 01:55:23,185
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to control the firemen!

1393
01:55:23,485 --> 01:55:25,287
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to control the teachers!

1394
01:55:25,667 --> 01:55:27,409
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to control the police!

1395
01:55:27,829 --> 01:55:28,830
[SPEAKER_50]: The custodians!

1396
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:31,693
[SPEAKER_50]: We still don't have a contract!

1397
01:55:32,293 --> 01:55:36,417
[SPEAKER_50]: The cafeteria workers who still don't have a contract.

1398
01:55:36,958 --> 01:55:39,140
[SPEAKER_50]: And what did you, the school committee do?

1399
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:42,563
[SPEAKER_50]: Oh, they made sure they got their raises, didn't they?

1400
01:55:42,724 --> 01:55:45,767
[SPEAKER_50]: And we have labor with no contracts.

1401
01:55:46,788 --> 01:55:50,111
[SPEAKER_37]: How dear and how insulting is this?

1402
01:55:56,861 --> 01:56:01,763
[SPEAKER_50]: I have lived in the city since I was in the second grade.

1403
01:56:03,063 --> 01:56:08,645
[SPEAKER_50]: And I really am ashamed to say that this is my city and my hometown.

1404
01:56:10,866 --> 01:56:12,907
[SPEAKER_50]: I am beyond ashamed.

1405
01:56:12,927 --> 01:56:20,170
[SPEAKER_50]: We finally, the pet group, are meeting with the mayor on March 6th.

1406
01:56:21,257 --> 01:56:24,619
[SPEAKER_50]: Your whole pet group, which is the insurance.

1407
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:29,303
[SPEAKER_50]: We've been negotiating with our insurance contract.

1408
01:56:29,343 --> 01:56:33,105
[SPEAKER_50]: Of course, we're under Chapter 19, so it just rolls over, okay?

1409
01:56:33,485 --> 01:56:40,770
[SPEAKER_50]: But we are finally meeting with her on March 6th, because we demanded it, finally, for the first time.

1410
01:56:41,111 --> 01:56:46,995
[SPEAKER_50]: So please, stop insulting us, stop lying, and stop pretending.

1411
01:56:48,598 --> 01:56:51,099
[SPEAKER_50]: We took a vote of no confidence on this mayor.

1412
01:56:52,859 --> 01:56:59,961
[SPEAKER_50]: Is the next vote of no confidence from every union going to be on the mayor, the school committee, and the city council?

1413
01:57:00,481 --> 01:57:01,481
[SPEAKER_50]: Do what's right.

1414
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:04,422
[SPEAKER_50]: You were elected to represent these people.

1415
01:57:05,262 --> 01:57:06,183
[SPEAKER_50]: Do what's right.

1416
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:08,923
[SPEAKER_50]: That's all I have to say.

1417
01:57:11,644 --> 01:57:13,465
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna go to Zoom real quick.

1418
01:57:13,665 --> 01:57:14,865
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sorry I can't delay any longer.

1419
01:57:16,462 --> 01:57:19,783
[SPEAKER_55]: We're gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom.

1420
01:57:19,843 --> 01:57:22,784
[SPEAKER_55]: Jess, please give your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.

1421
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:26,345
[SPEAKER_61]: Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road.

1422
01:57:26,365 --> 01:57:29,466
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm following up from Ms.

1423
01:57:29,506 --> 01:57:31,766
[SPEAKER_61]: Douglas, who was my teacher in eighth grade.

1424
01:57:31,786 --> 01:57:34,487
[SPEAKER_61]: She taught me that it's okay to speak up.

1425
01:57:36,268 --> 01:57:40,409
[SPEAKER_61]: And I just wanna say that I'm ashamed with this city.

1426
01:57:41,684 --> 01:57:47,290
[SPEAKER_61]: trying to tell our men and women who protect us every single day, put their lives on the risk.

1427
01:57:48,371 --> 01:57:53,156
[SPEAKER_61]: And our mayor wants to tell them what's best for them is not okay.

1428
01:57:54,257 --> 01:57:57,761
[SPEAKER_61]: They need they know what the best thing for them is.

1429
01:57:57,781 --> 01:58:02,846
[SPEAKER_61]: I personally did not know much about this topic until I watched the meeting tonight.

1430
01:58:04,031 --> 01:58:10,017
[SPEAKER_61]: And for people to say that the mayor is amazing, and she's doing all of these things.

1431
01:58:10,257 --> 01:58:12,199
[SPEAKER_61]: Clearly something is not working.

1432
01:58:12,939 --> 01:58:16,823
[SPEAKER_61]: If all of these different unions are having all these different issues with her.

1433
01:58:18,064 --> 01:58:20,026
[SPEAKER_61]: So please respect the firefighters.

1434
01:58:20,186 --> 01:58:21,967
[SPEAKER_61]: They fight for us every single day.

1435
01:58:22,308 --> 01:58:23,729
[SPEAKER_61]: They protect our families.

1436
01:58:24,209 --> 01:58:25,991
[SPEAKER_61]: And when we need them, they're always there.

1437
01:58:26,612 --> 01:58:29,714
[SPEAKER_61]: So please support them and what their mission is tonight.

1438
01:58:29,854 --> 01:58:30,295
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1439
01:58:38,017 --> 01:58:39,477
[SPEAKER_37]: for the record.

1440
01:58:39,497 --> 01:58:39,818
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1441
01:58:40,758 --> 01:58:42,598
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, Thomas Ross 53 Irving Street.

1442
01:58:42,838 --> 01:58:43,598
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1443
01:58:43,618 --> 01:58:45,379
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for watching me for a while.

1444
01:58:45,459 --> 01:58:46,899
[SPEAKER_35]: One more bite of the apple.

1445
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:52,701
[SPEAKER_35]: Of course, I forgot to mention a very important topic is the city ordinance.

1446
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:55,101
[SPEAKER_35]: And if you want to write this down, so you guys can look it up.

1447
01:58:55,161 --> 01:58:56,001
[SPEAKER_35]: It's section 42 dash 38.

1448
01:58:58,362 --> 01:59:11,469
[SPEAKER_35]: It says appointments to the department shall be made in accordance with civil service laws and rules and all promotions, all promotions shall be appointed from within the ranks of the city fire department.

1449
01:59:11,809 --> 01:59:15,991
[SPEAKER_35]: It's in the ordinance, and in order to even move forward,

1450
01:59:16,311 --> 01:59:30,484
[SPEAKER_35]: with the petition, you guys technically if you had a city solicitor should be making a ruling, whether you can even move forward with the whole without changing, changing the city ordinance, so that may have to be voted on before we even move forward with this petition.

1451
01:59:30,964 --> 01:59:31,184
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

1452
01:59:31,284 --> 01:59:37,570
[SPEAKER_35]: Secondly, I'd just like to address real quick, some of the Councilors had some concerns about these people really sick.

1453
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:43,615
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, no one had to provide any sick time, where our doctors notes, but we are in the middle of cold and flu season.

1454
01:59:44,095 --> 01:59:45,196
[SPEAKER_35]: COVID is still rampant.

1455
01:59:45,536 --> 01:59:48,039
[SPEAKER_35]: We have new respiratory virus viruses going around.

1456
01:59:48,359 --> 01:59:50,981
[SPEAKER_35]: And sometimes firefighters have to take care of family members.

1457
01:59:51,201 --> 01:59:55,505
[SPEAKER_35]: We have a number of family members that could have, you know, sickness and they have to take care of them.

1458
01:59:55,525 --> 01:59:56,546
[SPEAKER_35]: How do they come back to work?

1459
01:59:56,826 --> 02:00:01,410
[SPEAKER_35]: Why do they go back to work when maybe their wife or their other spouse or somebody had

1460
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:04,933
[SPEAKER_35]: able to come in and provide some extra help for their children.

1461
02:00:05,273 --> 02:00:09,557
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, if you look at this at first glance, you're making assumptions.

1462
02:00:09,897 --> 02:00:14,781
[SPEAKER_35]: And I don't think we should be making assumptions and automatically saying these people are doing something nefarious.

1463
02:00:15,322 --> 02:00:18,164
[SPEAKER_35]: You're taking a very simple, simplest approach.

1464
02:00:18,705 --> 02:00:20,366
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that we need to rethink that.

1465
02:00:20,627 --> 02:00:21,948
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is two separate issues.

1466
02:00:22,328 --> 02:00:23,949
[SPEAKER_35]: The fire department sick problem.

1467
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:27,913
[SPEAKER_35]: and taking the chief out of civil service if we even have the ability to do it now.

1468
02:00:28,174 --> 02:00:45,792
[SPEAKER_35]: But I think that we should take a deep dive into the city ordinance and find out if the mayor actually has a right to send this petition to our city council and ask them to file for a home rule petition because it may be out of order and maybe we really do need a new city solicitor.

1469
02:00:46,132 --> 02:00:46,873
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for your time.

1470
02:00:52,301 --> 02:00:55,163
[SPEAKER_37]: to anyone who'd like to speak for the first time.

1471
02:00:55,183 --> 02:00:58,045
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. McGilvery, you haven't spoken yet.

1472
02:00:58,645 --> 02:00:59,506
[SPEAKER_55]: I would have known if you did.

1473
02:01:01,007 --> 02:01:02,467
[SPEAKER_55]: If you could just leave your name with Larry, thank you.

1474
02:01:03,729 --> 02:01:04,169
[SPEAKER_55]: Five minutes.

1475
02:01:04,689 --> 02:01:06,730
[SPEAKER_32]: Harry McGill before Piedmont Road, Medford.

1476
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:10,831
[SPEAKER_32]: Currently, I'm a police officer.

1477
02:01:10,851 --> 02:01:12,612
[SPEAKER_32]: Before I was a police officer, I was a firefighter.

1478
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:14,073
[SPEAKER_32]: So I've worked both sides.

1479
02:01:14,873 --> 02:01:24,696
[SPEAKER_35]: I know that when you're a police officer or a firefighter and you're out on the road or you're at a fire scene, you depend on leadership to keep you safe.

1480
02:01:25,276 --> 02:01:28,878
[SPEAKER_35]: And leadership needs to come up through the ranks.

1481
02:01:30,152 --> 02:01:42,716
[SPEAKER_32]: People coming in from the outside don't don't know Personnel they don't know the layout of the city and this has all been said but The rank-and-file need to have confidence in their leaders.

1482
02:01:43,317 --> 02:01:49,639
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been on fire grounds with these guys and they're competent You want to do a worldwide search?

1483
02:01:49,659 --> 02:01:52,640
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, here's your worldwide search it ends right here so

1484
02:02:01,473 --> 02:02:06,076
[SPEAKER_36]: We live in turbulent times, and any day, anything can happen now.

1485
02:02:06,096 --> 02:02:12,000
[SPEAKER_35]: We live in turbulent times, and when chaos, when we're dealing with chaos, we need steady leadership.

1486
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,862
[SPEAKER_35]: And steady leadership is right here in this city.

1487
02:02:15,322 --> 02:02:20,625
[SPEAKER_35]: I know we have it on the police department, and I know the firefighters have the same steady leadership.

1488
02:02:21,806 --> 02:02:22,587
[SPEAKER_32]: Promote from within.

1489
02:02:22,967 --> 02:02:23,267
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1490
02:02:32,812 --> 02:02:34,794
[SPEAKER_54]: Luis Pacheco on Zoom.

1491
02:02:35,114 --> 02:02:36,235
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record.

1492
02:02:36,275 --> 02:02:37,236
[SPEAKER_54]: You have five minutes.

1493
02:02:38,137 --> 02:02:39,838
[SPEAKER_45]: Good evening, City Council.

1494
02:02:39,858 --> 02:02:40,739
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is Mark Pacheco.

1495
02:02:40,779 --> 02:02:42,060
[SPEAKER_45]: Luis logged in as my wife.

1496
02:02:43,241 --> 02:02:45,703
[SPEAKER_45]: Just wanted to say a few things from my perspective on this.

1497
02:02:45,944 --> 02:02:47,205
[SPEAKER_45]: I had 31 Calvary Street.

1498
02:02:47,225 --> 02:02:50,848
[SPEAKER_45]: I've been a resident homeowner for 14 years in Medford.

1499
02:02:52,069 --> 02:02:56,332
[SPEAKER_45]: Someone that works for a state agency that routinely works with the fire department.

1500
02:02:57,253 --> 02:03:00,695
[SPEAKER_45]: at my work, working with significant incidents.

1501
02:03:01,855 --> 02:03:07,278
[SPEAKER_45]: Probably no one on the city council will ever have to deal with bomb threats, significant safety concerns.

1502
02:03:08,359 --> 02:03:19,385
[SPEAKER_45]: Having that continuity of firefighters is important, not just the rank and file, but also as the other agencies that work within

1503
02:03:20,205 --> 02:03:20,966
[SPEAKER_45]: these departments.

1504
02:03:21,567 --> 02:03:28,456
[SPEAKER_45]: For me, my perspective is to work with the current chief, we had a significant incident in the municipality where I work.

1505
02:03:29,217 --> 02:03:31,920
[SPEAKER_45]: And I have worked with him since he was a lieutenant.

1506
02:03:32,501 --> 02:03:35,044
[SPEAKER_45]: So his his institutional knowledge of that building,

1507
02:03:35,945 --> 02:03:38,127
[SPEAKER_45]: how to work with me, that matters.

1508
02:03:38,587 --> 02:03:43,272
[SPEAKER_45]: And that's something that city council should really keep in mind when they make their decision about this.

1509
02:03:44,092 --> 02:03:52,019
[SPEAKER_45]: The fire department, secondly, the fire department is a brotherhood that no one on the city council will ever understand unless you work directly with them.

1510
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:53,741
[SPEAKER_45]: To take that

1511
02:03:55,788 --> 02:04:07,134
[SPEAKER_45]: chance for them to move up to a level to reach the pinnacle of their career and take that from them just to have a candidate from outside of the department.

1512
02:04:08,594 --> 02:04:14,557
[SPEAKER_45]: I think you're going to lose and miss the really the big point of this if you really should consider that.

1513
02:04:14,818 --> 02:04:15,138
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1514
02:04:23,823 --> 02:04:25,585
[SPEAKER_53]: anyone who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak.

1515
02:04:26,386 --> 02:04:30,351
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there anyone who has spoken once who'd like to speak again?

1516
02:04:30,371 --> 02:04:33,575
[SPEAKER_36]: There's another gentleman behind Councilor Bearsley, President Beasley.

1517
02:04:33,976 --> 02:04:34,596
[SPEAKER_55]: Sure.

1518
02:04:34,677 --> 02:04:35,057
[SPEAKER_36]: Come on up.

1519
02:04:35,077 --> 02:04:35,438
[SPEAKER_36]: Come on up.

1520
02:04:47,216 --> 02:04:47,936
[SPEAKER_55]: Welcome, thank you.

1521
02:04:48,016 --> 02:04:49,377
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, you have five minutes.

1522
02:04:49,697 --> 02:04:53,679
[SPEAKER_66]: Joe Spinelli, 340 Salem Street, Medford Fire Department, Vice President.

1523
02:04:54,519 --> 02:04:56,380
[SPEAKER_66]: I wasn't gonna come up tonight and speak.

1524
02:04:57,020 --> 02:05:03,183
[SPEAKER_66]: One is I'm not a good speaker, I don't enjoy it, but I couldn't listen to this without bringing up a couple of things.

1525
02:05:03,443 --> 02:05:08,045
[SPEAKER_36]: And I actually wanna thank the administration for almost making this vote pretty simple for this council.

1526
02:05:10,606 --> 02:05:12,407
[SPEAKER_36]: They start off with transparency.

1527
02:05:12,767 --> 02:05:15,348
[SPEAKER_36]: That's what this city ran, that's what this administration ran on.

1528
02:05:17,591 --> 02:05:25,774
[SPEAKER_35]: And the first thing she does after this incident that she says happens, decides to take the chief out of civil service.

1529
02:05:27,234 --> 02:05:29,275
[SPEAKER_28]: Within two weeks, she finds somebody.

1530
02:05:30,295 --> 02:05:42,299
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd love to know what the background on that person was, when she had 20, 30 year deputy chiefs sitting there, waiting to step up and be in charge of the city.

1531
02:05:43,561 --> 02:05:45,622
[SPEAKER_35]: but find somebody in a week and a half.

1532
02:05:45,962 --> 02:05:47,023
[SPEAKER_35]: They talk about a pool.

1533
02:05:47,703 --> 02:05:48,644
[SPEAKER_35]: She said it would be fair.

1534
02:05:48,724 --> 02:05:49,444
[SPEAKER_35]: We all heard that.

1535
02:05:49,624 --> 02:05:50,384
[SPEAKER_35]: It would be fair.

1536
02:05:51,085 --> 02:06:02,611
[SPEAKER_36]: How fair was it when they went behind the backs of the fire department and this council and the city to appoint somebody and not ask one other person to be involved in that?

1537
02:06:03,211 --> 02:06:06,313
[SPEAKER_36]: Not one deputy chief was part of that interview process, were they?

1538
02:06:07,782 --> 02:06:13,046
[SPEAKER_35]: I think she made it very simple on how she's going to act with this new power and this new leadership she says she has.

1539
02:06:13,667 --> 02:06:14,347
[SPEAKER_35]: We know what this is.

1540
02:06:14,388 --> 02:06:15,288
[SPEAKER_35]: This is control.

1541
02:06:15,548 --> 02:06:16,429
[SPEAKER_35]: This is wrong.

1542
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:18,691
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think you guys know how to vote on this.

1543
02:06:18,911 --> 02:06:19,272
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1544
02:06:24,556 --> 02:06:30,821
[SPEAKER_37]: Would you like to speak first or second time?

1545
02:06:32,863 --> 02:06:34,184
[SPEAKER_55]: You can come up if you'd like to speak.

1546
02:06:43,123 --> 02:06:45,024
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record you have five minutes.

1547
02:06:45,224 --> 02:07:00,575
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Marie Masio, I live at six coverage treatment wasn't here tonight because of the firefighters but I'm listening to everything being said, and I feel you guys elected officials of the city of Medford.

1548
02:07:01,395 --> 02:07:05,078
[SPEAKER_42]: And I've lived in Medford for 61 years.

1549
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:16,087
[SPEAKER_42]: And listening to all of this, I feel that I want to know that the fire chief of the city of Medford has a good knowledge of the city.

1550
02:07:16,567 --> 02:07:19,410
[SPEAKER_42]: And for me, we are in really challenging times.

1551
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:28,318
[SPEAKER_42]: And if something's going to happen, I want to know that the chief is somebody that I can feel confident is really going to take care of all of us.

1552
02:07:28,839 --> 02:07:32,522
[SPEAKER_42]: I think that it should be somebody that comes within the fire department.

1553
02:07:33,423 --> 02:07:35,084
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's my personal opinion.

1554
02:07:43,807 --> 02:07:44,967
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate it, thank you.

1555
02:07:45,488 --> 02:07:47,708
[SPEAKER_37]: The boss had some line blocking.

1556
02:07:48,929 --> 02:07:51,490
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, anyone else who'd like to speak for the first or second time?

1557
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:54,851
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff for the third one.

1558
02:07:54,891 --> 02:07:56,751
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd really like to keep it to three for everyone.

1559
02:07:57,431 --> 02:08:00,812
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd like us all to respect everyone who's spoken, even if we disagree with them.

1560
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:07,034
[SPEAKER_52]: Madam Chief of Staff, you have five minutes.

1561
02:08:07,455 --> 02:08:08,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1562
02:08:08,795 --> 02:08:09,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be brief.

1563
02:08:09,535 --> 02:08:11,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a number of items, but I will go through them quickly.

1564
02:08:12,785 --> 02:08:18,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as stated by the mayor at the start of this call, or the start of this meeting, uh, on this topic.

1565
02:08:19,894 --> 02:08:30,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Our legal counsel attorney Brian Mazer is on the line and I welcome and I encourage the council to speak with him this evening regarding the authority that this council has to move this resolution.

1566
02:08:32,031 --> 02:08:40,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The second item is to be clear again, it's been stated, but it should be restated because I think we're getting a little lost in some of the nuances here.

1567
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:49,344
[SPEAKER_11]: This request to the city council is because there is a vacancy pending, like imminent vacancy.

1568
02:08:49,804 --> 02:08:51,946
[SPEAKER_11]: That is why this is before the council.

1569
02:08:51,986 --> 02:08:54,628
[SPEAKER_11]: This wouldn't be before the council if there wasn't a vacancy.

1570
02:08:55,048 --> 02:08:56,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So that I just want to be explicit on.

1571
02:08:58,047 --> 02:09:07,072
[SPEAKER_11]: If for some reason, my comments were perceived to refer to other unions, when I was saying that the mayor has met with the union, I was referring to the fire union.

1572
02:09:07,452 --> 02:09:13,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I was never attempting to describe or capture other union negotiations.

1573
02:09:13,835 --> 02:09:14,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I do take exception.

1574
02:09:14,936 --> 02:09:22,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll circle back on that in a moment about other unions, but I want to be clear with the caller on zoom and the members of the public who spoke.

1575
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:25,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't attempting to speak to other union negotiations.

1576
02:09:25,441 --> 02:09:26,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I was referring to the fire union.

1577
02:09:26,961 --> 02:09:28,161
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will circle back on this.

1578
02:09:28,221 --> 02:09:31,582
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do take significant exception with being called a liar.

1579
02:09:32,722 --> 02:09:39,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I even think I may have stated earlier on this call that it was the Lemonster fire chief and fire captain.

1580
02:09:39,984 --> 02:09:42,024
[SPEAKER_11]: If I stated that, I was incorrect.

1581
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant to state police chief and police captain.

1582
02:09:45,325 --> 02:09:54,631
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the type of person I am is I restate statements, if I believe that I may have made a mistake, or may have attempted to mislead unintentionally.

1583
02:09:56,412 --> 02:09:59,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So to be clear, that that's, that's who I am.

1584
02:09:59,274 --> 02:10:00,175
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who the mayor is.

1585
02:10:01,416 --> 02:10:08,841
[SPEAKER_11]: But also getting back to union negotiations, there are so many nuances to this process as it relates to school union negotiations.

1586
02:10:09,181 --> 02:10:14,905
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor is not the chief negotiating officer on the school side, as I'm sure the city council knows, but for members of the public.

1587
02:10:15,445 --> 02:10:29,742
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor is one member of the school committee, certainly the leader as the chair of the school committee, but the mayor doesn't unilaterally, it would be inappropriate for the mayor to be at negotiating sessions because of the structure of the school committee.

1588
02:10:30,023 --> 02:10:31,424
[SPEAKER_11]: The school committee is a seven member

1589
02:10:32,606 --> 02:10:47,516
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, body seven member body, unless they were to vote to allow the mayor to sit in on all negotiations and then that were to somehow be, um, appropriate in accordance with the school superintendent, those things, that is not how this works to be clear.

1590
02:10:47,776 --> 02:10:52,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, furthermore, there's other note, um, nuances to this process.

1591
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:56,802
[SPEAKER_11]: The chief, the mayor is also not the chief negotiating officer on the city side.

1592
02:10:56,862 --> 02:11:01,325
[SPEAKER_11]: That role falls between the chief of staff and the HR director who have always been at the table.

1593
02:11:01,365 --> 02:11:02,146
[SPEAKER_11]: At least one of us.

1594
02:11:02,686 --> 02:11:11,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And furthermore, the mayor does have union negotiations on her calendar on all city-side negotiations.

1595
02:11:12,192 --> 02:11:13,673
[SPEAKER_11]: She may have them on the school side.

1596
02:11:13,833 --> 02:11:15,174
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest with you, I don't know.

1597
02:11:15,274 --> 02:11:16,455
[SPEAKER_11]: She maintains her own calendar.

1598
02:11:16,895 --> 02:11:23,199
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you as a fact, because the HR director and I put them on her calendar, she is almost always on call.

1599
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:28,203
[SPEAKER_11]: She is almost always in the room with me and the HR director when we caucus.

1600
02:11:28,903 --> 02:11:29,583
[SPEAKER_11]: We are there.

1601
02:11:29,683 --> 02:11:32,084
[SPEAKER_11]: We just may not physically be in that same room.

1602
02:11:32,104 --> 02:11:34,385
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is a typical negotiation process.

1603
02:11:34,645 --> 02:11:38,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And our HR director can back that up based on her experience in other communities.

1604
02:11:40,368 --> 02:11:50,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, I will reiterate, no one's taking anything from the department if this were to move out of the fire chief position, were to move out of the civil service process.

1605
02:11:51,552 --> 02:11:56,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Union employees, members of the department would very much have the opportunity.

1606
02:11:58,306 --> 02:12:08,158
[SPEAKER_11]: A fire department employee who rises through the ranks and ensures a clean slate and does a good job.

1607
02:12:08,939 --> 02:12:11,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that doesn't even mean that the person doesn't make mistakes.

1608
02:12:11,442 --> 02:12:12,143
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all human.

1609
02:12:12,183 --> 02:12:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: We make mistakes and our office understands that.

1610
02:12:15,831 --> 02:12:26,375
[SPEAKER_11]: but has to be with integrity, has to do the job, you know, with the kind of integrity that this community deserves.

1611
02:12:27,156 --> 02:12:32,338
[SPEAKER_11]: That person can very well make fire chief with or without civil service.

1612
02:12:32,818 --> 02:12:33,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1613
02:12:35,259 --> 02:12:36,780
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1614
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:42,182
[SPEAKER_54]: Is there anyone, members of the public who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak?

1615
02:12:44,378 --> 02:12:46,779
[SPEAKER_55]: Seeing none, I will go to the podium.

1616
02:12:46,839 --> 02:12:48,439
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. McGilvrey, just give your name and address.

1617
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:48,759
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1618
02:12:48,779 --> 02:12:50,219
[SPEAKER_35]: Harry McGilvrey, 4P Mark Road.

1619
02:12:51,219 --> 02:12:58,341
[SPEAKER_35]: So if the city is going in that direction to take the fire chief position out of civil service, I think it's a fair question.

1620
02:12:59,401 --> 02:13:02,502
[SPEAKER_32]: Are we taking the police chief out of civil service also?

1621
02:13:11,944 --> 02:13:12,424
[SPEAKER_38]: Because

1622
02:13:14,814 --> 02:13:26,420
[SPEAKER_35]: Chief, and I'm probably gonna get, you know, ragged on when I get back at the station, but our chief's doing a heck of a job, and he's really, you know, brought this department along, and he's a civil service chief.

1623
02:13:27,581 --> 02:13:39,067
[SPEAKER_35]: So I think it's a fair question, and I think that the council is obligated, if that's the direction the city's going, I think there's an obligation to the city to answer that question.

1624
02:13:39,087 --> 02:13:39,327
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1625
02:13:48,092 --> 02:13:48,532
[SPEAKER_53]: Douglas.

1626
02:13:48,952 --> 02:13:50,293
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1627
02:13:50,753 --> 02:13:51,233
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1628
02:13:52,613 --> 02:13:52,993
[SPEAKER_55]: Me too.

1629
02:13:53,333 --> 02:13:55,174
[SPEAKER_50]: I know, I know.

1630
02:13:55,834 --> 02:13:56,534
[SPEAKER_50]: I know.

1631
02:13:59,535 --> 02:14:00,255
[SPEAKER_50]: That's what I'm saying.

1632
02:14:00,295 --> 02:14:11,317
[SPEAKER_50]: I've been here really third grade second, second, third grade went to the public schools went to went to public schools, teacher at Wesleyan University, very proud of the city, but not so much anymore.

1633
02:14:11,657 --> 02:14:12,458
[SPEAKER_50]: I'm not going to pretend.

1634
02:14:13,518 --> 02:14:13,678
[SPEAKER_50]: So

1635
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:21,308
[SPEAKER_50]: I want to set the record straight about who negotiates with the school department, and it's not the superintendent.

1636
02:14:22,398 --> 02:14:30,184
[SPEAKER_50]: Our contract is signed by the mayor and I are the two signatures on there.

1637
02:14:30,965 --> 02:14:35,288
[SPEAKER_50]: She is the chair of the school committee.

1638
02:14:36,009 --> 02:14:42,954
[SPEAKER_50]: It is her responsibility to determine who negotiates.

1639
02:14:43,014 --> 02:14:44,376
[SPEAKER_50]: Now, can she appoint someone?

1640
02:14:44,856 --> 02:14:45,556
[SPEAKER_50]: Absolutely.

1641
02:14:46,357 --> 02:14:53,101
[SPEAKER_50]: But there have been multiple times and multiple places where it is stated she has been in negotiations.

1642
02:14:53,121 --> 02:14:56,303
[SPEAKER_50]: Now, she may be in a back room, but I don't know that.

1643
02:14:57,083 --> 02:14:57,403
[SPEAKER_50]: OK?

1644
02:14:57,483 --> 02:15:00,485
[SPEAKER_50]: Or she may be on a phone call, but I don't know that.

1645
02:15:02,349 --> 02:15:03,710
[SPEAKER_50]: We let it go to mediation.

1646
02:15:04,370 --> 02:15:05,431
[SPEAKER_50]: You wanna know something?

1647
02:15:06,312 --> 02:15:07,993
[SPEAKER_50]: The teachers won in mediation.

1648
02:15:08,513 --> 02:15:16,920
[SPEAKER_50]: And we're probably the first union ever, ever, to not have to pay one dime to the mediation.

1649
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:18,721
[SPEAKER_50]: The city paid it all.

1650
02:15:19,261 --> 02:15:19,581
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1651
02:15:19,642 --> 02:15:27,067
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone else who hasn't spoken yet?

1652
02:15:27,187 --> 02:15:29,729
[SPEAKER_53]: If anyone else who hasn't spoken would like to speak.

1653
02:15:31,229 --> 02:15:32,610
[SPEAKER_53]: Seeing none, Mr. Buckley.

1654
02:15:33,411 --> 02:15:35,053
[SPEAKER_36]: Walter Buckley, Liberal 1032 president.

1655
02:15:36,174 --> 02:15:37,375
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to end with this.

1656
02:15:38,236 --> 02:15:45,263
[SPEAKER_36]: The mayor and the chief of staff was on transparency in this pool of people that are going to be interviewed.

1657
02:15:45,783 --> 02:15:48,266
[SPEAKER_36]: And she said, if you have a clean slate and all that stuff.

1658
02:15:49,409 --> 02:15:51,812
[SPEAKER_36]: Billy Young's here, I know he has a clean slate.

1659
02:15:52,693 --> 02:15:54,536
[SPEAKER_36]: Danny Shea's here, he's got a clean slate.

1660
02:15:54,976 --> 02:15:57,700
[SPEAKER_36]: Tommy Brennan's working right now, he's got a clean slate.

1661
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:01,224
[SPEAKER_36]: Todd Evans worked yesterday, he's got a clean slate.

1662
02:16:01,685 --> 02:16:04,208
[SPEAKER_58]: Frank Gilberti, he definitely got a clean slate.

1663
02:16:07,315 --> 02:16:10,278
[SPEAKER_36]: Was she discriminating against our members by not interviewing them?

1664
02:16:10,978 --> 02:16:14,101
[SPEAKER_36]: She likes to throw discrimination around and equality and all that stuff.

1665
02:16:14,581 --> 02:16:17,784
[SPEAKER_36]: I believe she discriminated against our members by not even telling them.

1666
02:16:18,164 --> 02:16:26,091
[SPEAKER_36]: And I believe she just, excuse my language, crapped all over you guys by going behind your backs and trying to hire somebody without your vote.

1667
02:16:26,471 --> 02:16:27,092
[SPEAKER_36]: Think about that.

1668
02:16:38,167 --> 02:16:41,508
[SPEAKER_55]: The hand is gone.

1669
02:16:41,548 --> 02:16:43,469
[SPEAKER_55]: If you would like to speak, please raise your hand again.

1670
02:16:43,489 --> 02:16:47,690
[SPEAKER_55]: In the meantime, I'll go to just Healy on zoom name and address for the record.

1671
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:48,551
[SPEAKER_53]: You have five minutes.

1672
02:16:50,571 --> 02:16:52,232
[SPEAKER_61]: Jessica Healy for lock road.

1673
02:16:53,052 --> 02:16:59,635
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm sorry, I just had to say, following what this gentleman also just said, the way she put it stating that

1674
02:17:00,694 --> 02:17:12,082
[SPEAKER_61]: you know, firefighters that are already been in Medford for probably 30 plus years protecting us day in and day out, that if they have a clean slate, they're also eligible.

1675
02:17:12,823 --> 02:17:23,010
[SPEAKER_61]: But are we saying that we don't have those type of firefighters here in Medford, and that we have to outsource and that's the only way we're going to get a great chief.

1676
02:17:23,831 --> 02:17:29,715
[SPEAKER_61]: I find that very disrespectful to our firefighters who've been in Medford for 30 something years.

1677
02:17:30,711 --> 02:17:42,495
[SPEAKER_61]: You're going to tell them that no, sorry, we're going to go out and find a new chief, someone who's going to come in know nothing about the city and not know how to protect us properly.

1678
02:17:42,575 --> 02:17:48,477
[SPEAKER_61]: Because like they stated, you have to know a magnitude of different circumstances.

1679
02:17:50,018 --> 02:17:56,860
[SPEAKER_61]: But I feel like they're pushing down the firefighters that we already have that are amazing.

1680
02:17:57,660 --> 02:17:59,921
[SPEAKER_61]: And that would be able to be promoted to chief.

1681
02:18:01,104 --> 02:18:09,807
[SPEAKER_61]: But they're just pushing it out as already finding someone within a week and a half and not looking within our own department.

1682
02:18:10,788 --> 02:18:11,868
[SPEAKER_61]: It's disrespectful.

1683
02:18:13,049 --> 02:18:14,129
[SPEAKER_61]: I just had to say that.

1684
02:18:14,429 --> 02:18:18,051
[SPEAKER_61]: And I appreciate all the firefighters that are there tonight.

1685
02:18:18,711 --> 02:18:20,512
[SPEAKER_61]: And we all thank you for everything you do.

1686
02:18:29,919 --> 02:18:31,100
[SPEAKER_53]: name and address for the record.

1687
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:32,360
[SPEAKER_53]: You have five minutes.

1688
02:18:38,243 --> 02:18:39,223
[SPEAKER_63]: Hi, Kathleen St.

1689
02:18:39,263 --> 02:18:41,364
[SPEAKER_63]: Germain, 34 Harrison Street, Medford.

1690
02:18:42,487 --> 02:18:52,555
[SPEAKER_63]: I just want to say coming from a family of fire and police, I can't tell you what a great job these firefighters do in our county, in our city.

1691
02:18:53,856 --> 02:18:55,057
[SPEAKER_63]: And I want to say thank you for that.

1692
02:18:55,238 --> 02:19:01,943
[SPEAKER_63]: And I really hope that the council thinks very hard about this and does not vote in favor.

1693
02:19:02,363 --> 02:19:07,388
[SPEAKER_63]: We need to have the civil service process in order to keep it fair and consistent going forward.

1694
02:19:07,408 --> 02:19:08,609
[SPEAKER_63]: That's all I have.

1695
02:19:08,669 --> 02:19:08,929
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

1696
02:19:17,176 --> 02:19:18,336
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further public comment?

1697
02:19:18,597 --> 02:19:21,137
[SPEAKER_55]: Mrs. Lonergan, name and address for the record, please.

1698
02:19:21,398 --> 02:19:21,838
[SPEAKER_55]: Uh-oh.

1699
02:19:22,378 --> 02:19:24,679
[SPEAKER_57]: I just have two questions.

1700
02:19:24,779 --> 02:19:29,921
[SPEAKER_57]: I know that you're in the service for a minute.

1701
02:19:30,741 --> 02:19:31,821
[SPEAKER_57]: You have a rank, right?

1702
02:19:32,842 --> 02:19:35,663
[SPEAKER_57]: You have a rank in the Navy?

1703
02:19:35,683 --> 02:19:39,144
[SPEAKER_57]: You have to go through the process to reach this point that you have a rank.

1704
02:19:40,384 --> 02:19:44,786
[SPEAKER_57]: How come you don't feel that they don't deserve the same as you have?

1705
02:19:52,499 --> 02:19:55,280
[SPEAKER_55]: If you could keep it brief, I would like to learn quite a bit.

1706
02:19:55,681 --> 02:19:56,801
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only an ensign.

1707
02:19:57,182 --> 02:19:59,423
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't care what you are.

1708
02:19:59,483 --> 02:20:01,304
[SPEAKER_47]: Your goal is to be an admiral, right?

1709
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,645
[SPEAKER_47]: At some point in time.

1710
02:20:02,905 --> 02:20:08,409
[SPEAKER_47]: And you know you have to work yourself up through that rank to become an admiral or whatever you are.

1711
02:20:09,129 --> 02:20:14,493
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just think it's unfair for you to state that these guys don't deserve the same

1712
02:20:15,922 --> 02:20:21,206
[SPEAKER_47]: same with the stability that you're getting, or what you're open to, or opportunity to do it.

1713
02:20:21,286 --> 02:20:29,952
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's my other, my second comment is, if a police chief is brought in, he's obviously served many years in whatever community he's in.

1714
02:20:30,812 --> 02:20:32,713
[SPEAKER_47]: Now we hire somebody from outside.

1715
02:20:33,094 --> 02:20:35,175
[SPEAKER_47]: Are they gonna stay three years or five years?

1716
02:20:35,435 --> 02:20:36,596
[SPEAKER_47]: Do we give them a pension?

1717
02:20:37,417 --> 02:20:38,617
[SPEAKER_47]: That's a big deal to me.

1718
02:20:40,338 --> 02:20:41,239
[SPEAKER_54]: I can speak to that.

1719
02:20:47,421 --> 02:21:03,761
[SPEAKER_55]: My understanding is if they had already had enough credit, then it would add to their credit, but if they... I don't see how it would be possible that someone would start at zero years as a chief of fire in the state, so... Fair, fair point, fair point.

1720
02:21:03,841 --> 02:21:04,182
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1721
02:21:05,652 --> 02:21:08,295
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, any further comment from members of the public?

1722
02:21:08,595 --> 02:21:09,696
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record, please.

1723
02:21:09,716 --> 02:21:10,537
[SPEAKER_54]: You have five minutes.

1724
02:21:11,058 --> 02:21:13,400
[SPEAKER_28]: Patrick Kearse, 178 Woburn Street.

1725
02:21:14,542 --> 02:21:17,985
[SPEAKER_28]: President Bearsky, I want to ask the committee a question, if they can answer it.

1726
02:21:18,806 --> 02:21:21,009
[SPEAKER_28]: Is anybody on the committee born and raised Medford?

1727
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:25,393
[SPEAKER_55]: We're not going to, we can't just ask those questions.

1728
02:21:28,305 --> 02:21:30,486
[SPEAKER_37]: to say why that's not a valid question.

1729
02:21:30,846 --> 02:21:33,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of the people on here said that we voted for them.

1730
02:21:33,968 --> 02:21:35,528
[SPEAKER_28]: Not all of us voted for them.

1731
02:21:35,728 --> 02:21:38,410
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just trying to figure out who here

1732
02:21:39,736 --> 02:21:40,716
[SPEAKER_28]: lives in Medford?

1733
02:21:40,876 --> 02:21:42,877
[SPEAKER_28]: Do they pay property tax?

1734
02:21:43,257 --> 02:21:44,597
[SPEAKER_28]: Do they pay property tax?

1735
02:21:44,637 --> 02:21:46,918
[SPEAKER_55]: Have they been in Medford for two years?

1736
02:21:46,938 --> 02:21:50,819
[SPEAKER_55]: The qualification to be a voter is the same as an elected official.

1737
02:21:50,839 --> 02:21:52,559
[SPEAKER_55]: Everyone here is a registered voter in the city of Medford.

1738
02:21:52,599 --> 02:21:53,679
[SPEAKER_28]: Have they been here two years?

1739
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:54,140
[SPEAKER_28]: Five years?

1740
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:55,540
[SPEAKER_55]: Answer personal questions.

1741
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:59,801
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, my question is, I've lived here for 50 years.

1742
02:22:00,421 --> 02:22:01,281
[SPEAKER_28]: I work in the town.

1743
02:22:01,421 --> 02:22:02,762
[SPEAKER_28]: I pay property taxes.

1744
02:22:03,182 --> 02:22:07,243
[SPEAKER_28]: I have firefighter friends in this town that have worked for this town for over 30 years.

1745
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:13,523
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, all of a sudden, people are going to be coming in here and they don't get elected by everybody.

1746
02:22:13,723 --> 02:22:14,603
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's the problem.

1747
02:22:15,364 --> 02:22:16,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Many more people should vote.

1748
02:22:17,165 --> 02:22:18,546
[SPEAKER_28]: So we know who gets into office.

1749
02:22:18,786 --> 02:22:24,349
[SPEAKER_28]: But when people up here tell me that they were voted in, they weren't voted in by all of us, maybe some of us.

1750
02:22:24,989 --> 02:22:26,831
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm just trying to say we are

1751
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:32,312
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to know how long you've been in Medford, what you have invested in Medford.

1752
02:22:32,572 --> 02:22:35,033
[SPEAKER_55]: I think many, many, many people know how long I've been here.

1753
02:22:35,073 --> 02:22:37,814
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm not going to ask any of my colleagues to respond.

1754
02:22:37,874 --> 02:22:38,154
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, Ms.

1755
02:22:38,194 --> 02:22:41,335
[SPEAKER_55]: Douglas is one of my great teachers.

1756
02:22:41,675 --> 02:22:42,415
[SPEAKER_55]: And I respect that.

1757
02:22:42,515 --> 02:22:45,236
[SPEAKER_55]: And every person who is a resident of the city has a voice and a vote.

1758
02:22:45,956 --> 02:22:46,996
[SPEAKER_55]: And we have a majority vote.

1759
02:22:47,016 --> 02:22:52,438
[SPEAKER_28]: But then you're going to go outside of Medford, when you have so many employees of the fire department.

1760
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:53,439
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not even here for this.

1761
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:55,059
[SPEAKER_55]: That's fine.

1762
02:22:55,479 --> 02:22:56,239
[SPEAKER_55]: I respect your opinion.

1763
02:22:56,259 --> 02:22:57,140
[SPEAKER_55]: You can continue to speak.

1764
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:59,881
[SPEAKER_55]: But we're not going to be obligated to answer your questions.

1765
02:22:59,901 --> 02:23:00,461
[SPEAKER_55]: You should be.

1766
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:01,501
[SPEAKER_55]: You work for us.

1767
02:23:01,541 --> 02:23:02,001
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not.

1768
02:23:02,181 --> 02:23:02,982
[SPEAKER_55]: So thank you.

1769
02:23:03,122 --> 02:23:04,922
[SPEAKER_37]: I have a question for you.

1770
02:23:06,223 --> 02:23:06,483
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1771
02:23:12,133 --> 02:23:15,094
[SPEAKER_53]: Seeing none, I will go to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli.

1772
02:23:15,114 --> 02:23:16,034
[SPEAKER_53]: Vice President Collins.

1773
02:23:18,375 --> 02:23:19,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

1774
02:23:19,236 --> 02:23:21,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I see there are a couple hands still raised on Zoom.

1775
02:23:21,056 --> 02:23:22,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to defer to those.

1776
02:23:22,057 --> 02:23:25,218
[SPEAKER_55]: Sorry, I think these have been raised for a while.

1777
02:23:25,238 --> 02:23:29,099
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Director Crowley is waiting to speak, and I see a hand that looks new.

1778
02:23:29,119 --> 02:23:32,221
[SPEAKER_55]: Director Crowley, would you like to speak?

1779
02:23:32,361 --> 02:23:33,281
[SPEAKER_55]: I'll ask you to unmute.

1780
02:23:38,916 --> 02:23:41,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Beas.

1781
02:23:42,077 --> 02:23:46,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Through you, to the council, to everybody out there, I just want to clear up a few things.

1782
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:50,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chief of staff and others have stated this already.

1783
02:23:51,322 --> 02:23:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not, truly we're not trying to block a firefighter, a captain, a deputy chief from becoming chief.

1784
02:24:00,077 --> 02:24:04,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to open the pool up, which would actually open the pool up to our firefighters.

1785
02:24:05,459 --> 02:24:17,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the mayor stated a little while ago that four deputy captains had to apply for the job, and then only one took the test that blocked the captains.

1786
02:24:19,183 --> 02:24:27,146
[SPEAKER_05]: In this process, those captains would have also had the opportunity to take a shot at the captain's position.

1787
02:24:29,321 --> 02:24:37,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my intention nor do I think it's the administration's intention to block any of our current personnel from the position.

1788
02:24:38,528 --> 02:24:45,634
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to open it up so that it's fair and that the, I'm sorry, deputy chiefs, not deputy captains.

1789
02:24:47,155 --> 02:24:54,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to make sure that even our captains or whoever else might be qualified on the force could actually go for the position.

1790
02:24:55,391 --> 02:24:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not trying to hold anybody back.

1791
02:24:58,814 --> 02:25:00,375
[SPEAKER_05]: That would never be my intention.

1792
02:25:01,296 --> 02:25:07,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked in HR for many, many years, and it's never been my intention to hold anybody back.

1793
02:25:08,041 --> 02:25:13,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just trying to open up the field so that more qualified people could go for the job.

1794
02:25:14,026 --> 02:25:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no control.

1795
02:25:14,967 --> 02:25:16,608
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not trying to control anybody.

1796
02:25:17,068 --> 02:25:21,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just trying to control a process like we control any other

1797
02:25:22,953 --> 02:25:28,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Hiring process is checks and balances along the way and I'm sure if we got to that point.

1798
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:32,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And the council voted on that to go to that point.

1799
02:25:33,043 --> 02:25:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have members of the department help us with the decision.

1800
02:25:38,949 --> 02:25:39,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe.

1801
02:25:41,178 --> 02:25:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had said, we don't know your schedule.

1802
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:44,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely right.

1803
02:25:44,201 --> 02:25:45,162
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know your schedule.

1804
02:25:45,202 --> 02:25:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never stood in your shoes.

1805
02:25:47,144 --> 02:25:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nephews who are firefighters.

1806
02:25:48,805 --> 02:25:52,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nieces and nephews who are police officers, never stood in their shoes.

1807
02:25:52,829 --> 02:25:54,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand the job you have in front of you.

1808
02:25:55,492 --> 02:26:04,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to make sure that you understand that it would open up the field to more of you to be able to move forward.

1809
02:26:05,526 --> 02:26:12,067
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's inside or out, you would not be precluded from this process, nor would we want to preclude you from the process.

1810
02:26:12,747 --> 02:26:14,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make that clear.

1811
02:26:15,048 --> 02:26:16,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the job they do.

1812
02:26:16,588 --> 02:26:18,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they do a fantastic job.

1813
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:23,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not been with the city for a long time, but I'm looking forward to help move the city forward.

1814
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Working with the fire department, I've had great conversations and I'm hoping to continue those conversations.

1815
02:26:29,331 --> 02:26:30,171
[SPEAKER_05]: My door is opened.

1816
02:26:31,368 --> 02:26:43,371
[SPEAKER_05]: All day long, anybody wants to come in and have a conversation, I'm always open for that, but we're really truly not trying to preclude anybody from taking a position as chief.

1817
02:26:44,032 --> 02:26:44,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1818
02:26:45,512 --> 02:26:46,092
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you, Madam Director.

1819
02:26:46,112 --> 02:26:54,315
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm going to go to the podium, then I'm going to go to Melissa Tobin on Zoom, then Mr. Pacheco on Zoom, then Councilor Collins, then Councilor Scarpellilli, then Councilor Callahan.

1820
02:26:54,755 --> 02:26:55,895
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

1821
02:26:56,275 --> 02:26:57,936
[SPEAKER_43]: Ellen Lovecchia, 27 Ramstad Road.

1822
02:27:00,373 --> 02:27:04,216
[SPEAKER_43]: I wasn't here to talk about this, but I couldn't take it anymore.

1823
02:27:05,637 --> 02:27:06,518
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's get real.

1824
02:27:07,338 --> 02:27:10,661
[SPEAKER_43]: Does this come across to you as authentic?

1825
02:27:11,882 --> 02:27:17,085
[SPEAKER_43]: What the chief of staff is saying and what this person is saying, does that come across to you as authentic?

1826
02:27:17,806 --> 02:27:20,848
[SPEAKER_43]: Does anybody in this room believe what they're saying?

1827
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,730
[SPEAKER_44]: That's number one.

1828
02:27:24,471 --> 02:27:28,214
[SPEAKER_44]: Number two, their only argument

1829
02:27:32,763 --> 02:27:42,313
[SPEAKER_44]: The only argument they have is that no one in this world who does the job every day understands what they're trying to do for us.

1830
02:27:43,254 --> 02:27:45,096
[SPEAKER_37]: None of us understand.

1831
02:27:50,586 --> 02:27:51,787
[SPEAKER_37]: None of us get it.

1832
02:27:52,588 --> 02:27:54,110
[SPEAKER_44]: They think those two get it.

1833
02:27:54,570 --> 02:27:55,892
[SPEAKER_44]: Those two get it, I guess.

1834
02:27:55,992 --> 02:27:56,893
[SPEAKER_44]: But none of us do.

1835
02:27:57,493 --> 02:27:58,815
[SPEAKER_44]: So those are their two points.

1836
02:27:58,895 --> 02:27:59,575
[SPEAKER_44]: They're in a dick.

1837
02:27:59,936 --> 02:28:01,097
[SPEAKER_44]: They're disingenuous.

1838
02:28:01,778 --> 02:28:06,042
[SPEAKER_44]: And they're telling these people who do the job every day that they don't understand.

1839
02:28:06,483 --> 02:28:07,524
[SPEAKER_44]: And it doesn't affect them.

1840
02:28:07,664 --> 02:28:08,525
[SPEAKER_44]: They just don't get it.

1841
02:28:22,065 --> 02:28:23,966
[SPEAKER_51]: Melissa Tobin, name and address for the record.

1842
02:28:23,986 --> 02:28:25,007
[SPEAKER_51]: You have five minutes.

1843
02:28:25,887 --> 02:28:27,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Melissa Tobin.

1844
02:28:27,508 --> 02:28:29,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 97 Taft Street in Medford.

1845
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:38,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was just listening in tonight to see, and after listening for the past three and a half hours, a lot of light has come.

1846
02:28:39,195 --> 02:28:42,317
[SPEAKER_12]: A lifetime Medford resident, I own a home here.

1847
02:28:44,078 --> 02:28:48,800
[SPEAKER_12]: In taking a step back from all this, we've had a process for years

1848
02:28:50,233 --> 02:28:53,115
[SPEAKER_12]: with the civil service exam and it's worked.

1849
02:28:54,735 --> 02:28:58,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now we're trying to change something that's not broken.

1850
02:28:59,398 --> 02:29:05,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So why are we using our resources and energy to attempt to fix something that is working?

1851
02:29:07,262 --> 02:29:08,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So my first point.

1852
02:29:08,182 --> 02:29:16,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Second is the chief of staff mentioned various communities in the Commonwealth that have gone away from the civil service exam.

1853
02:29:18,649 --> 02:29:23,835
[SPEAKER_12]: She stated that they were surveyed about what they have done.

1854
02:29:23,855 --> 02:29:30,463
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very hard to look at some of those communities because they're not like Medford.

1855
02:29:31,805 --> 02:29:37,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need to take that off the table because they are not apples to apples.

1856
02:29:39,451 --> 02:29:48,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And until you can compare a Medford to a Malden or a Somerville or a Cambridge in what they're doing, that should be a baseline.

1857
02:29:49,335 --> 02:29:57,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I also ask the council to take a step back and really look, what is the root problem, the root cause of this problem?

1858
02:29:58,619 --> 02:30:06,383
[SPEAKER_12]: There's lots of issues going on, whether it's this, they're saying the fire department had like a sick out,

1859
02:30:07,726 --> 02:30:14,248
[SPEAKER_12]: The civil service exam, you're bringing the two together and they need to be two totally separate issues.

1860
02:30:16,649 --> 02:30:23,651
[SPEAKER_12]: And I stand with the firefighters, keep the process as is and let the civil service exam do its job.

1861
02:30:25,061 --> 02:30:29,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And my last question is, why is there only four?

1862
02:30:30,106 --> 02:30:38,594
[SPEAKER_12]: They mentioned that four people signed up for the test, but then only one took it and there were other qualified candidates in the pool.

1863
02:30:39,314 --> 02:30:49,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Why isn't it open up to all within the fire department or any other unions moving forward with promotions?

1864
02:30:52,333 --> 02:30:56,796
[SPEAKER_55]: Um, to the last question, I think the reason that it is the way it is because of the civil service process.

1865
02:30:56,816 --> 02:31:03,140
[SPEAKER_53]: So I'm sitting just answering factual questions.

1866
02:31:04,881 --> 02:31:05,642
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, thanks.

1867
02:31:07,483 --> 02:31:11,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something that you could get back to the community on about why?

1868
02:31:11,326 --> 02:31:12,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1869
02:31:12,827 --> 02:31:13,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1870
02:31:20,174 --> 02:31:25,757
[SPEAKER_55]: Sorry, Miss Tobin, we can look into that and we can try to get the answer to that question.

1871
02:31:27,297 --> 02:31:35,401
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you can get the answer, not just try, because I think it will be very helpful for the community to see why it's not possible.

1872
02:31:36,442 --> 02:31:44,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Because right now with the civil service exam, as long as you meet the qualifications, you can take the exam.

1873
02:31:44,145 --> 02:31:44,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now,

1874
02:31:45,891 --> 02:31:54,996
[SPEAKER_12]: you're limiting this pool of candidates that may feel that are probably qualified for some of these jobs and you're not allowing them the advantage to take it.

1875
02:31:55,016 --> 02:31:58,137
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1876
02:31:58,157 --> 02:32:02,700
[SPEAKER_55]: We're going to go to who I think may be Luis Pacheco now on Zoom.

1877
02:32:04,505 --> 02:32:05,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

1878
02:32:05,266 --> 02:32:07,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Luis Pacheco, 31 Carberry Street.

1879
02:32:07,748 --> 02:32:12,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as I sit here, I was there earlier and then I came home and I continue listening.

1880
02:32:12,871 --> 02:32:16,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think how undermining this whole entire process has been.

1881
02:32:17,455 --> 02:32:25,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you you want to open it up to everybody else, like Crowley just said, but you never spoke within.

1882
02:32:26,658 --> 02:32:28,140
[SPEAKER_03]: A leader speaks within.

1883
02:32:28,541 --> 02:32:32,887
[SPEAKER_03]: They speak within their police department, their firefighters, their schools.

1884
02:32:33,308 --> 02:32:34,430
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask what they want.

1885
02:32:34,470 --> 02:32:35,551
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask what they need.

1886
02:32:35,572 --> 02:32:40,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been opened up to somebody else to take a position that was a week ago.

1887
02:32:42,110 --> 02:32:45,511
[SPEAKER_03]: but yet the firefighters are sitting here and they're blindsided.

1888
02:32:46,412 --> 02:32:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Communication is so huge.

1889
02:32:50,093 --> 02:33:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is so disheartening as I grew up in Medford and now I own a house in Medford and I'm raising kids in Medford and I want the city of Medford to continue to bleed Medford.

1890
02:33:02,257 --> 02:33:06,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want people that are born and raised here to continue to work within this city.

1891
02:33:06,899 --> 02:33:08,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is so sad.

1892
02:33:10,182 --> 02:33:14,246
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so disheartening to see that nobody knew.

1893
02:33:14,626 --> 02:33:19,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor, the city councilors have conversations.

1894
02:33:19,971 --> 02:33:21,132
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a process.

1895
02:33:21,532 --> 02:33:34,364
[SPEAKER_03]: People have put their lives into working for Medford and nobody thought about like pausing the button and having larger conversations, bringing it to the leaders to bring down to the workers.

1896
02:33:36,756 --> 02:33:41,081
[SPEAKER_03]: This is absolutely disgusting to hear what's going on in our community today.

1897
02:33:42,983 --> 02:33:43,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

1898
02:33:43,844 --> 02:33:47,869
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1899
02:33:49,251 --> 02:33:49,792
[SPEAKER_53]: Jamie.

1900
02:33:51,153 --> 02:33:52,855
[SPEAKER_53]: Mr. Thompson, name and address for the record, please.

1901
02:33:55,834 --> 02:33:57,355
[SPEAKER_55]: And if you could just sign in with Larry when you're done.

1902
02:33:57,655 --> 02:33:57,975
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1903
02:33:58,595 --> 02:33:58,835
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1904
02:33:58,895 --> 02:33:59,995
[SPEAKER_29]: Jamie Thompson, 80s Road.

1905
02:34:01,656 --> 02:34:03,256
[SPEAKER_29]: Wasn't here originally to talk about this.

1906
02:34:03,276 --> 02:34:05,917
[SPEAKER_29]: I am amazed by the debate.

1907
02:34:05,957 --> 02:34:22,423
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate all the conversation, but you're here to discuss a major change to the fire chief role in the promotion chain for community organization where those people have built institutional knowledge and relationships in the organization and in this community.

1908
02:34:23,502 --> 02:34:27,884
[SPEAKER_29]: The conversation about the sick call out has nothing to do with that decision.

1909
02:34:28,724 --> 02:34:37,488
[SPEAKER_29]: And if it does, it makes me question based on all this conversation, the lack of transparency, whether this is a retaliatory decision.

1910
02:34:39,249 --> 02:34:39,529
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1911
02:34:53,396 --> 02:34:54,777
[SPEAKER_55]: Lisa, I've unmuted you.

1912
02:34:54,817 --> 02:34:56,257
[SPEAKER_55]: You have five minutes.

1913
02:34:56,277 --> 02:34:57,618
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

1914
02:34:58,438 --> 02:35:00,439
[SPEAKER_46]: Lisa Falanga, 88 Dudley Street, Medford.

1915
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,541
[SPEAKER_46]: I just have a couple of comments.

1916
02:35:02,581 --> 02:35:06,623
[SPEAKER_46]: I had no intention of responding at all, but after listening, especially to Ms.

1917
02:35:06,703 --> 02:35:09,704
[SPEAKER_46]: Nazarian, a couple of things.

1918
02:35:10,705 --> 02:35:12,345
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, does she live in the city of Medford?

1919
02:35:13,306 --> 02:35:14,887
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a really important thing.

1920
02:35:14,927 --> 02:35:16,147
[SPEAKER_46]: I know you're not going to respond to that.

1921
02:35:16,187 --> 02:35:19,489
[SPEAKER_46]: You don't have to, but as a council, you need to think about that.

1922
02:35:20,518 --> 02:35:34,290
[SPEAKER_46]: Secondly, you know, everybody makes mistakes was one of her comments her mistakes can't kill somebody a firefighter's mistake can Change the course of their life forever.

1923
02:35:34,970 --> 02:35:46,841
[SPEAKER_46]: They need to have solid leadership And they have to have faith in their leader And a lot of that comes by built with the come, you know, the brotherhood that they have and the other thing is

1924
02:35:48,564 --> 02:35:51,406
[SPEAKER_46]: To be a lawyer, I could go to law school, right?

1925
02:35:51,706 --> 02:35:52,547
[SPEAKER_46]: I could go to law school.

1926
02:35:52,967 --> 02:35:54,468
[SPEAKER_46]: I think I'm smart enough to go to law school.

1927
02:35:55,249 --> 02:35:57,971
[SPEAKER_46]: But I still have to pass a bar exam to be a lawyer.

1928
02:36:00,152 --> 02:36:03,034
[SPEAKER_46]: So why wouldn't a civil service exam not apply?

1929
02:36:05,276 --> 02:36:10,860
[SPEAKER_46]: I think when you make decisions, you have to make it based on the people who do the job.

1930
02:36:11,641 --> 02:36:12,401
[SPEAKER_46]: They know what's right.

1931
02:36:13,782 --> 02:36:17,265
[SPEAKER_46]: And the other thing that I was a little perplexed about, and I don't know what the answer is,

1932
02:36:18,331 --> 02:36:25,935
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, it said that the firefighters who called out some of them went in and got paid overtime Why would they get paid overtime if it was their shift?

1933
02:36:27,056 --> 02:36:28,157
[SPEAKER_46]: That is the most ridiculous thing.

1934
02:36:28,197 --> 02:36:42,505
[SPEAKER_46]: I would have heard that is totally mismanagement of funds So, I don't know if that really happened but that's what somebody said Um, but that's something you should really be thinking about who's writing the policies of overtime

1935
02:36:44,997 --> 02:36:45,637
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's it.

1936
02:36:45,757 --> 02:36:52,820
[SPEAKER_46]: I just think, like I said, Miss Nazarian, I don't think, I don't think she's, of course, she's going to support Mayor LaRonde O'Connor.

1937
02:36:52,860 --> 02:36:53,461
[SPEAKER_46]: She works for her.

1938
02:36:53,921 --> 02:36:54,761
[SPEAKER_46]: She gets her paycheck.

1939
02:36:55,681 --> 02:36:58,643
[SPEAKER_46]: But I think as a council, you need to listen to the people.

1940
02:36:59,843 --> 02:37:01,944
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think the people support the firefighters.

1941
02:37:01,964 --> 02:37:06,826
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1942
02:37:12,372 --> 02:37:16,753
[SPEAKER_55]: You may come to the podium, you have five minutes, name and address for the record, and sign in with Larry if you have to.

1943
02:37:16,773 --> 02:37:19,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, so my name is Melissa Miguel, I live on Bowen Ave in Medford.

1944
02:37:20,774 --> 02:37:25,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in 2019, none of you were here, not a single one of you were here.

1945
02:37:26,035 --> 02:37:32,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I served on Breonna Lungo-Koehn's transition team, where she promised that she ran on the platform of transparency.

1946
02:37:34,153 --> 02:37:39,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here tonight to deal with the other nonsense that you're gonna put forward tonight as a 20 year homeowner here in Medford.

1947
02:37:40,197 --> 02:37:48,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I stand here listening to the firefighters talk, the bottom line here is there has been zero transparency in this entire process.

1948
02:37:48,662 --> 02:37:56,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know where Brianna is tonight, but I'd like to remind her when I sat with her in 2019, her platform was transparency.

1949
02:37:57,327 --> 02:38:00,749
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to see her walk the walk.

1950
02:38:02,423 --> 02:38:05,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So Brianna, wherever you are, I know you know who I am.

1951
02:38:06,124 --> 02:38:07,764
[SPEAKER_10]: You ran on transparency.

1952
02:38:08,324 --> 02:38:20,087
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's do that.

1953
02:38:20,107 --> 02:38:21,107
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1954
02:38:21,167 --> 02:38:23,147
[SPEAKER_55]: Anyone else in the room who hasn't spoken would like to speak?

1955
02:38:24,848 --> 02:38:27,288
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, I'm going to go to Melissa Tobin on Zoom.

1956
02:38:28,068 --> 02:38:29,549
[SPEAKER_55]: This is your second time.

1957
02:38:29,609 --> 02:38:30,549
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record.

1958
02:38:30,569 --> 02:38:31,369
[SPEAKER_55]: You have five minutes.

1959
02:38:32,435 --> 02:38:34,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi again, Melissa Tobin 97 tap street.

1960
02:38:35,196 --> 02:38:38,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't finished previously and I was muted.

1961
02:38:38,098 --> 02:38:40,639
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I'm back.

1962
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:52,325
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my last points is that as like the city council, you've been elected by all the residents in the city.

1963
02:38:53,938 --> 02:39:05,489
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's been a lot of tension, but I ask that we all check our egos at the door and do what's right for our community and our firefighters tonight.

1964
02:39:05,689 --> 02:39:06,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1965
02:39:14,497 --> 02:39:17,838
[SPEAKER_54]: Councilor Scarpelli has a legal question.

1966
02:39:18,058 --> 02:39:20,279
[SPEAKER_54]: This is not my way, steps ahead.

1967
02:39:20,419 --> 02:39:23,821
[SPEAKER_54]: All right, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli with a legal question, then Vice President Collins.

1968
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:24,541
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1969
02:39:24,581 --> 02:39:26,001
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1970
02:39:26,102 --> 02:39:33,624
[SPEAKER_36]: If we can ask the attorney from KP Law, I believe the process that

1971
02:39:36,064 --> 02:39:40,885
[SPEAKER_36]: We are mandated by law now to have a chief.

1972
02:39:41,145 --> 02:39:42,506
[SPEAKER_36]: Now the chief Freeman is gone.

1973
02:39:42,526 --> 02:39:45,727
[SPEAKER_36]: This chief that you offer the job to is gone.

1974
02:39:45,747 --> 02:39:49,268
[SPEAKER_36]: I want to know legally who was that chief right now?

1975
02:39:49,288 --> 02:39:54,209
[SPEAKER_36]: Attorney Mazer, I recognize you to respond to the question.

1976
02:39:54,789 --> 02:39:55,829
[SPEAKER_36]: Chief retires tomorrow.

1977
02:39:55,849 --> 02:39:58,030
[SPEAKER_36]: So after tomorrow, who will be our chief?

1978
02:39:59,954 --> 02:40:09,785
[SPEAKER_67]: Mr. Chairman, through you, upon Chief Reuben's retirement, if the position is vacant, the department does not have a chief.

1979
02:40:11,306 --> 02:40:15,751
[SPEAKER_67]: And my understanding right now is that there's no current

1980
02:40:17,052 --> 02:40:31,529
[SPEAKER_67]: civil service list in existence for the position of chief in light of the fact that Chief Freeman was the only name on the prior list and he was subsequently appointed from that list and from the test that was administered that led to that list.

1981
02:40:31,549 --> 02:40:35,253
[SPEAKER_67]: So basically, you don't have a chief until a provisional

1982
02:40:36,534 --> 02:40:38,495
[SPEAKER_67]: appointment is made to that position.

1983
02:40:39,656 --> 02:40:51,101
[SPEAKER_67]: And if the position remains in civil service, it would be a provisional or temporary appointment until such time as the city can schedule either an exam or some type of an assessment center through the civil service process.

1984
02:40:51,701 --> 02:40:55,763
[SPEAKER_67]: And as a result of that process, a list of eligible candidates would be generated.

1985
02:40:56,263 --> 02:41:00,025
[SPEAKER_67]: And then the city would make an appointment from that list of eligible candidates.

1986
02:41:01,596 --> 02:41:01,997
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you.

1987
02:41:02,017 --> 02:41:02,878
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Councilor.

1988
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:07,386
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Scarpelli or any other Councilors, do you have questions for Attorney Major at this time?

1989
02:41:07,466 --> 02:41:08,047
[SPEAKER_36]: No, that was it.

1990
02:41:08,568 --> 02:41:09,089
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1991
02:41:09,550 --> 02:41:11,273
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comment from members of the public?

1992
02:41:12,199 --> 02:41:12,939
[SPEAKER_35]: just real quick.

1993
02:41:12,979 --> 02:41:14,660
[SPEAKER_55]: And last name and address for the record, please.

1994
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:17,061
[SPEAKER_35]: Thomas Ross 53 Irving Street.

1995
02:41:17,421 --> 02:41:20,102
[SPEAKER_35]: Just to make a comment on the attorney's last remarks.

1996
02:41:20,542 --> 02:41:23,103
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not an attorney, but I'm pretty sure he's wrong.

1997
02:41:23,683 --> 02:41:34,527
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, so what happens when we have a vacancy, according to the collective bargaining agreement when there's a permanent vacancy, and there is no established civil service list, the next senior deputy will shout

1998
02:41:34,887 --> 02:41:40,894
[SPEAKER_35]: Whether it's a senior deputy chief, it's a deputy's position that's vacant, a captain's position is vacant, a lieutenant's position is vacant.

1999
02:41:41,215 --> 02:41:49,525
[SPEAKER_35]: In such a case, when you don't have a qualified civil service list in place, and we don't right now, the senior deputy shall take over that position immediately.

2000
02:41:50,165 --> 02:41:53,289
[SPEAKER_35]: That's in the collective bargain agreement, and it's part of civil service law.

2001
02:41:53,509 --> 02:41:54,711
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know what this guy's talking about.

2002
02:42:05,102 --> 02:42:08,124
[SPEAKER_53]: Any further comments from members of the public?

2003
02:42:08,224 --> 02:42:19,313
[SPEAKER_36]: Just to follow up, if we can, out of necessity of safety for our community, we need some action before 4 o'clock tomorrow when Chief Friedman steps down.

2004
02:42:19,594 --> 02:42:20,414
[SPEAKER_36]: We need some action.

2005
02:42:21,275 --> 02:42:23,497
[SPEAKER_36]: So we have qualified deputies, I believe.

2006
02:42:23,897 --> 02:42:31,442
[SPEAKER_36]: We need answers for this community because without a head at the table, I fear what can happen.

2007
02:42:31,482 --> 02:42:33,483
[SPEAKER_36]: So we're talking about public safety, Mr. President.

2008
02:42:33,904 --> 02:42:43,270
[SPEAKER_36]: So we need the mayor to respond to this with some sort of letter or communication with the community and what we're gonna do.

2009
02:42:43,310 --> 02:42:45,511
[SPEAKER_36]: We have conflicting reports.

2010
02:42:45,592 --> 02:42:51,656
[SPEAKER_36]: We have an expert on civil service and rules, and we have an attorney that didn't seem to be too sure.

2011
02:42:52,056 --> 02:42:53,097
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you.

2012
02:42:55,378 --> 02:42:56,838
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpellilli.

2013
02:42:57,638 --> 02:42:58,219
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. Jones.

2014
02:42:58,359 --> 02:43:07,002
[SPEAKER_36]: On a clarification, there was a City Ordinance that says in absence of the Chief, week or more, the Senior Deputy Chief will be sworn in as Chief.

2015
02:43:07,862 --> 02:43:08,822
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a City Ordinance.

2016
02:43:09,463 --> 02:43:09,843
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2017
02:43:09,863 --> 02:43:18,346
[SPEAKER_54]: Madam Chief of Staff.

2018
02:43:20,077 --> 02:43:21,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

2019
02:43:21,338 --> 02:43:23,799
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed that Attorney Mazer had raised his hand.

2020
02:43:23,819 --> 02:43:36,548
[SPEAKER_54]: I just want to say something before I... And if we could respond to Councilor Scarpellilli's question about notifying the public by 4 p.m.

2021
02:43:36,568 --> 02:43:36,948
[SPEAKER_54]: tomorrow.

2022
02:43:36,988 --> 02:43:37,328
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2023
02:43:39,634 --> 02:43:45,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, president bears through you, uh, certainly, uh, obviously the mayor would need to make an appointment.

2024
02:43:46,641 --> 02:43:49,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that would be the only logical thing.

2025
02:43:49,683 --> 02:43:52,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, this process is going to be one that we're working on.

2026
02:43:53,307 --> 02:44:00,994
[SPEAKER_11]: We had been working on it over the course of the time, between the time that chief Friedman had, um, announced his resignation to the mayor and today, um,

2027
02:44:02,575 --> 02:44:04,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So obviously, there will be further action.

2028
02:44:05,396 --> 02:44:14,058
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do ask that Attorney Mazur, through you, President Bears, if possible, could respond to the issue presented by the last speaker.

2029
02:44:14,198 --> 02:44:14,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2030
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:20,300
[SPEAKER_55]: Attorney Mazur, you have the floor.

2031
02:44:22,459 --> 02:44:28,546
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, through you to the other members of the council as well as those in attendance.

2032
02:44:29,747 --> 02:44:33,490
[SPEAKER_67]: The position of fire chief is not a position that's covered by the collective bargaining agreement.

2033
02:44:34,391 --> 02:44:37,555
[SPEAKER_67]: The collective bargaining agreement has no authority over that position.

2034
02:44:38,395 --> 02:44:40,696
[SPEAKER_67]: nor do any of the members of local 1032.

2035
02:44:40,996 --> 02:44:55,741
[SPEAKER_67]: It's a managerial position and pursuant to the charter, which trumps any city ordinances, as it is the force of law, the mayor is the appointing authority for the position of fire chief and all of the department heads under chapter, I think it's 52, you know, of the charter.

2036
02:44:56,701 --> 02:45:05,725
[SPEAKER_67]: So while the ordinance may say one thing, the charter, again, if it conflicts, prevails, as it is the force of law, it's a special act that was elected or essentially enacted by the voters of the city.

2037
02:45:06,645 --> 02:45:06,925
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you.

2038
02:45:08,564 --> 02:45:08,888
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2039
02:45:11,129 --> 02:45:22,256
[SPEAKER_36]: So just to follow up, just to end this, I think that, again, with the question I already asked the mayor, this banter going back and forth doesn't help us.

2040
02:45:22,756 --> 02:45:39,106
[SPEAKER_36]: We have people right now that are qualified to step in that role, whether it's the mayor's responsibility or not, or that's her role now, legally or by ordinance, I'm requesting that we please put one of these people in place so our fire department and our city is safe.

2041
02:45:39,146 --> 02:45:40,087
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2042
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:49,532
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

2043
02:45:49,712 --> 02:45:50,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

2044
02:45:51,953 --> 02:45:53,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to everybody who's spoken.

2045
02:45:53,274 --> 02:45:59,557
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's been a lot of members of public service who have spoken tonight and are otherwise here in support.

2046
02:45:59,597 --> 02:46:02,899
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's never a bad opportunity to say thank you for your service.

2047
02:46:03,239 --> 02:46:04,140
[SPEAKER_18]: So I didn't say it before.

2048
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:04,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being here.

2049
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:05,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for speaking.

2050
02:46:06,361 --> 02:46:07,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us on this.

2051
02:46:07,902 --> 02:46:09,343
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for your service.

2052
02:46:10,527 --> 02:46:13,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we've heard a lot.

2053
02:46:13,348 --> 02:46:14,648
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not ready to vote on this tonight.

2054
02:46:14,668 --> 02:46:24,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we have some, we have some, I think we've all, many of us have put forward a lot of questions.

2055
02:46:24,692 --> 02:46:27,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them to me have not been answered satisfactorily.

2056
02:46:27,232 --> 02:46:28,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them have conflicting answers.

2057
02:46:34,198 --> 02:46:36,480
[SPEAKER_18]: I think everybody can agree that this is a serious issue.

2058
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:38,201
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to give it the time that it deserves.

2059
02:46:38,801 --> 02:46:42,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I need more time to consider this and evaluate the proposal on the merits.

2060
02:46:42,304 --> 02:46:46,487
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of people have pointed out that this has been conflated with other allegations against the Fire Department.

2061
02:46:46,988 --> 02:46:48,329
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a serious paper before us.

2062
02:46:48,449 --> 02:46:56,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like the opportunity to continue the conversation in Committee of the Whole with my colleagues and evaluate this proposal on the merits without conflating it with other issues.

2063
02:46:58,476 --> 02:47:00,837
[SPEAKER_18]: What we're voting on is a change to the civil service position.

2064
02:47:00,937 --> 02:47:02,457
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to have that conversation.

2065
02:47:03,017 --> 02:47:07,919
[SPEAKER_18]: My motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole, and also to have legal counsel present for that discussion.

2066
02:47:08,599 --> 02:47:13,941
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to Committee of the Whole and have legal counsel present at the meeting, seconded by.

2067
02:47:13,961 --> 02:47:16,781
[SPEAKER_55]: Seconded by Councilor Fleming.

2068
02:47:16,921 --> 02:47:18,082
[SPEAKER_55]: Further discussion?

2069
02:47:18,122 --> 02:47:20,002
[SPEAKER_54]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2070
02:47:20,022 --> 02:47:20,463
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2071
02:47:21,043 --> 02:47:24,824
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand what my fellow colleague is asking, but they're here.

2072
02:47:28,957 --> 02:47:30,658
[SPEAKER_37]: We're here now.

2073
02:47:31,078 --> 02:47:37,842
[SPEAKER_36]: To postpone this just pushes this down the line and puts our community more and more in danger.

2074
02:47:38,382 --> 02:47:39,343
[SPEAKER_36]: They're here right now.

2075
02:47:39,963 --> 02:47:44,486
[SPEAKER_36]: You said that the questions that have to be answered, well, ask the answers, they're here.

2076
02:47:45,266 --> 02:47:49,729
[SPEAKER_36]: This isn't something that, this isn't a political game that we can play back and forth.

2077
02:47:50,149 --> 02:47:51,289
[SPEAKER_36]: This is something serious.

2078
02:47:51,329 --> 02:47:55,452
[SPEAKER_36]: This is something that might have one of our lives to deal with in the future.

2079
02:47:56,132 --> 02:47:57,253
[SPEAKER_36]: This is too serious.

2080
02:47:57,293 --> 02:48:00,896
[SPEAKER_36]: This is safety for our firefighters and understanding the process we're going through.

2081
02:48:01,417 --> 02:48:02,758
[SPEAKER_36]: I think people are very clear.

2082
02:48:02,798 --> 02:48:04,880
[SPEAKER_36]: I think, listen, we're all educated people.

2083
02:48:05,561 --> 02:48:10,665
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think common sense has to come forward here and understand what we just heard.

2084
02:48:11,666 --> 02:48:16,751
[SPEAKER_36]: The points that were made are so moving in the sense that it is two separate issues.

2085
02:48:18,092 --> 02:48:19,634
[SPEAKER_36]: And the issues are still questionable.

2086
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:24,982
[SPEAKER_36]: We have a mayor that is historically, everyone, now listen, we all understand this.

2087
02:48:25,442 --> 02:48:33,767
[SPEAKER_36]: Historically, the mayor has used her position for what she thought was the right thing to do because she was losing control.

2088
02:48:34,667 --> 02:48:41,131
[SPEAKER_36]: Ask Aleesha Nunley, ask Michael Durham, ask other department heads in this community that are gone, good people.

2089
02:48:41,391 --> 02:48:41,571
[SPEAKER_36]: Ms.

2090
02:48:41,591 --> 02:48:45,553
[SPEAKER_36]: Kibby, ask our elections coordinator, ask them.

2091
02:48:46,173 --> 02:48:48,355
[SPEAKER_36]: This is, if you could see it,

2092
02:48:49,295 --> 02:48:54,078
[SPEAKER_36]: It's, it's a path that this is now it's playing in a bigger picture.

2093
02:48:54,358 --> 02:49:02,443
[SPEAKER_36]: And I don't like the fact that I feel like I'm glanced in because I'm not I'm speaking to from my heart and understanding something very simple here.

2094
02:49:03,163 --> 02:49:05,845
[SPEAKER_36]: We have people here that can answer all of our questions.

2095
02:49:06,465 --> 02:49:17,073
[SPEAKER_36]: The questions that Councilor Leming brought up, that there is some fraudulent absenteeism, we're not a trial, we're not a jury.

2096
02:49:17,613 --> 02:49:19,674
[SPEAKER_36]: That still has to be figured out down the line.

2097
02:49:20,215 --> 02:49:29,722
[SPEAKER_36]: What we did here is that we have qualified people in the civil service process that have worked their way to the position and have earned it.

2098
02:49:30,751 --> 02:49:37,078
[SPEAKER_36]: Now to look back, they're talking about how the process and how they would do that.

2099
02:49:37,498 --> 02:49:38,379
[SPEAKER_36]: They lied to us.

2100
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:49,491
[SPEAKER_36]: If we didn't find out by a firefighter calling me saying that this person contacted them to ask about the climate of Medford, this is why he denied the job that they offered them.

2101
02:49:49,952 --> 02:49:51,313
[SPEAKER_36]: They didn't, in true faith,

2102
02:49:52,114 --> 02:49:55,195
[SPEAKER_36]: They didn't bring in the deputy chiefs.

2103
02:49:55,556 --> 02:50:00,738
[SPEAKER_36]: They didn't bring in anybody else to say, listen, we're looking at this person and this is what's happening.

2104
02:50:00,958 --> 02:50:02,079
[SPEAKER_36]: They did it on their own.

2105
02:50:03,179 --> 02:50:04,320
[SPEAKER_36]: So what makes you sure?

2106
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,300
[SPEAKER_36]: What makes you strong?

2107
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:10,402
[SPEAKER_36]: What makes you give you the common sense to understand that this isn't a political issue?

2108
02:50:10,422 --> 02:50:11,883
[SPEAKER_36]: This isn't a control issue.

2109
02:50:12,223 --> 02:50:17,365
[SPEAKER_36]: This isn't an issue of anger driven by that, because it reeks of it.

2110
02:50:17,826 --> 02:50:20,207
[SPEAKER_36]: You don't have to be a genius to understand this, everyone.

2111
02:50:21,107 --> 02:50:21,948
[SPEAKER_36]: We're smart people.

2112
02:50:21,988 --> 02:50:22,988
[SPEAKER_36]: We're elected by the people.

2113
02:50:23,369 --> 02:50:25,390
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, you can say one side or the other.

2114
02:50:25,490 --> 02:50:25,910
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not.

2115
02:50:25,990 --> 02:50:27,211
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm really speaking to everybody.

2116
02:50:27,231 --> 02:50:31,574
[SPEAKER_36]: Because firefighters don't knock on the door and say, what political party do you belong to?

2117
02:50:32,234 --> 02:50:34,395
[SPEAKER_36]: They kick the door in and they go into the fire.

2118
02:50:34,415 --> 02:50:37,777
[SPEAKER_36]: And to question that right now is a problem to me.

2119
02:50:38,338 --> 02:50:39,358
[SPEAKER_36]: So please, they're here.

2120
02:50:39,639 --> 02:50:40,339
[SPEAKER_36]: It's 10 o'clock.

2121
02:50:40,419 --> 02:50:42,761
[SPEAKER_36]: I know we have more important issues.

2122
02:50:42,781 --> 02:50:44,402
[SPEAKER_36]: We have issues to follow.

2123
02:50:44,622 --> 02:50:44,722
[SPEAKER_36]: But

2124
02:50:45,242 --> 02:50:59,323
[SPEAKER_36]: they're here let's ask the questions and get to a resolution so tomorrow the mayor understands that she has to figure out a way with her team to work with the civil servants that are here that have worked their tails off to earn the right to be the next chief of Medford and that's it.

2125
02:51:12,642 --> 02:51:13,703
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm gonna end with this.

2126
02:51:14,223 --> 02:51:19,487
[SPEAKER_36]: Because the mayor doesn't she said publicly that she doesn't understand that this is a divide.

2127
02:51:19,627 --> 02:51:20,648
[SPEAKER_36]: Of course it's a divide.

2128
02:51:21,008 --> 02:51:29,174
[SPEAKER_36]: Because honestly, between my relationships with my colleagues, if you can't see the common sense behind this, it has nothing to do with our political ties.

2129
02:51:29,794 --> 02:51:33,237
[SPEAKER_36]: If we can't see the common sense with this, guys, this is what divides us.

2130
02:51:34,304 --> 02:51:36,747
[SPEAKER_36]: This is what's dividing the city.

2131
02:51:36,867 --> 02:51:42,312
[SPEAKER_36]: And if she can't see that, come on outside.

2132
02:51:42,332 --> 02:51:44,414
[SPEAKER_36]: They're still out in the parking lot waiting to get in.

2133
02:51:45,055 --> 02:51:47,137
[SPEAKER_36]: And that says a lot.

2134
02:51:47,637 --> 02:51:50,560
[SPEAKER_36]: And to the rest of the people here, I'm going to pander a little bit.

2135
02:51:51,461 --> 02:51:53,063
[SPEAKER_36]: But where were you on November 4?

2136
02:51:59,386 --> 02:52:01,867
[SPEAKER_36]: want to talk about it now, we'll stand up and understand.

2137
02:52:02,287 --> 02:52:04,248
[SPEAKER_36]: This has been a pattern for the last four years.

2138
02:52:05,169 --> 02:52:10,371
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, so we need to figure out as a community and a council for this one issue.

2139
02:52:10,731 --> 02:52:11,411
[SPEAKER_36]: This is all it is.

2140
02:52:12,051 --> 02:52:14,232
[SPEAKER_36]: It's one issue that we know the answer to.

2141
02:52:14,733 --> 02:52:16,073
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's not pander to politics.

2142
02:52:16,573 --> 02:52:17,954
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's not take this to a committee.

2143
02:52:18,134 --> 02:52:18,934
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't need a committee.

2144
02:52:18,954 --> 02:52:19,855
[SPEAKER_36]: We're going to do the same thing again.

2145
02:52:20,646 --> 02:52:21,327
[SPEAKER_36]: We're gonna hear it again.

2146
02:52:21,947 --> 02:52:24,911
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's help our city move forward and heal from this.

2147
02:52:25,491 --> 02:52:28,655
[SPEAKER_36]: Hire the people that are qualified and make everybody feel safe.

2148
02:52:28,935 --> 02:52:31,978
[SPEAKER_36]: Because what we don't know, we don't know what they know.

2149
02:52:32,318 --> 02:52:32,779
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't.

2150
02:52:33,199 --> 02:52:36,543
[SPEAKER_36]: No one can sit here and say that I understand what a firefighter do.

2151
02:52:36,903 --> 02:52:40,627
[SPEAKER_36]: No matter if you're a boss, no matter if you're a director, you don't know what they know.

2152
02:52:41,588 --> 02:52:43,209
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's what I'm getting out of this, everyone.

2153
02:52:43,349 --> 02:52:45,550
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's pretty clear.

2154
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:47,471
[SPEAKER_36]: Please, let's put our politics aside.

2155
02:52:47,752 --> 02:52:48,932
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's put egos aside.

2156
02:52:49,152 --> 02:52:57,817
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's ask the question so we can get to a resolution tonight, which has to be no.

2157
02:53:01,940 --> 02:53:06,862
[SPEAKER_36]: So I make the motion that we deny the mayor's request to take the chief's position out of civil service.

2158
02:53:06,882 --> 02:53:07,403
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2159
02:53:14,970 --> 02:53:15,765
[SPEAKER_37]: That's a powerhead.

2160
02:53:19,309 --> 02:53:22,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thanks so much to everyone who has come tonight.

2161
02:53:24,172 --> 02:53:36,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I consider myself to be a pro-worker and pro-union person, and I know that there are other Councilors on this council who agree with that statement about themselves.

2162
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:46,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the absolute minimum that we can do if we are pro-worker, pro-union people, is to not make this permanent change

2163
02:53:47,208 --> 02:53:55,611
[SPEAKER_04]: to essentially at will employment based solely on flimsy corporate arguments and a totally unproven allegation.

2164
02:53:57,491 --> 02:54:03,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the arguments standpoint, I have heard a number of things tonight.

2165
02:54:04,899 --> 02:54:14,968
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like this process should not be hamstrung by all sorts of bureaucratic blah blah blah.

2166
02:54:15,909 --> 02:54:20,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure is real simple when you can fire anybody for no reason and

2167
02:54:24,113 --> 02:54:27,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Process is something that helps us have good democracy.

2168
02:54:27,475 --> 02:54:29,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps us have good workplaces.

2169
02:54:30,597 --> 02:54:38,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not think that this argument of needing to have a quick process is one that I would agree with or that vibes with me.

2170
02:54:40,443 --> 02:54:44,585
[SPEAKER_04]: This idea that we need leadership that is most qualified, that we're going to find the best candidate.

2171
02:54:45,066 --> 02:54:51,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked at length with firefighters who described the process, the civil service process, and believe me,

2172
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:57,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a mayor select someone is not merit-based.

2173
02:54:57,996 --> 02:55:09,050
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want the best candidate or most qualified candidate, then you're going to go with a civil service process because that in fact is totally merit-based.

2174
02:55:10,625 --> 02:55:19,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And this question that this decision does not affect other people in the department is, frankly, totally not true.

2175
02:55:19,691 --> 02:55:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true to say that it does not remove those other people from civil service, but it totally affects them, aside from the fact that all these promotions, you know, would, you know, waterfall down.

2176
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:39,883
[SPEAKER_04]: and affect a lot of people every time there would be a new fire chief.

2177
02:55:40,243 --> 02:55:41,064
[SPEAKER_04]: That, of course, is true.

2178
02:55:41,284 --> 02:55:44,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to know if it affects the department, look around the room.

2179
02:55:44,465 --> 02:55:45,686
[SPEAKER_04]: It affects the department.

2180
02:55:45,826 --> 02:55:47,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Why else are all of these people here?

2181
02:55:47,747 --> 02:55:57,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the allegation, you know, I am very concerned that we are being pushed into this decision based on

2182
02:55:58,152 --> 02:56:08,676
[SPEAKER_04]: a totally unproven allegation that the mayor herself says she doesn't even have any idea why these people would do a coordinated sick out.

2183
02:56:09,496 --> 02:56:16,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, people don't do a coordinated, like, they don't through their union coordinate to all be sick at the same time without a demand.

2184
02:56:17,278 --> 02:56:19,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, like, that just isn't the thing.

2185
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:27,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing about being sick is that, you know, diseases are contagious.

2186
02:56:28,283 --> 02:56:28,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2187
02:56:28,783 --> 02:56:31,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So people all get sick at the same time when they work in the same place.

2188
02:56:31,385 --> 02:56:32,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That is normal.

2189
02:56:33,526 --> 02:56:37,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can think what you want about that particular instance.

2190
02:56:37,488 --> 02:56:42,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever you think, there is no proven anything going on here.

2191
02:56:43,370 --> 02:56:47,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not the time for us to make this kind of decision.

2192
02:56:48,973 --> 02:56:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It also I really have to urge Councilors to understand that there is not one firefighter that is in favor of this.

2193
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:08,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am, again, as I said at the beginning, really boggles my mind how we could possibly improve our fire department with leadership that they themselves will refuse.

2194
02:57:09,569 --> 02:57:11,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It simply does not make any sense.

2195
02:57:13,112 --> 02:57:20,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am not in favor of this, and I don't think that it helps us to move this to a committee where we'll discuss it more.

2196
02:57:22,338 --> 02:57:23,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I have made my decision.

2197
02:57:24,100 --> 02:57:24,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2198
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:31,001
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2199
02:57:31,281 --> 02:57:32,522
[SPEAKER_53]: There's two motions on the floor.

2200
02:57:32,542 --> 02:57:34,723
[SPEAKER_53]: Is there anyone Councilor would like to speak?

2201
02:57:36,504 --> 02:57:37,845
[SPEAKER_53]: Councilor Tseng? President Bears?.

2202
02:57:38,325 --> 02:57:39,966
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2203
02:57:40,086 --> 02:57:48,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Talking to people coming in here today, I said that I had, as I said to the union reps, I have questions about this proposal.

2204
02:57:48,651 --> 02:57:53,353
[SPEAKER_25]: I have points where I'm not very happy with how it's presented.

2205
02:57:54,794 --> 02:57:58,136
[SPEAKER_25]: I think coming out of here tonight, hearing from the perspectives,

2206
02:57:58,496 --> 02:57:59,736
[SPEAKER_25]: those questions still exist.

2207
02:58:00,197 --> 02:58:14,921
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Councilor Callaghan is making important points about how reform has to be complete, comprehensive, that we need to take our time with

2208
02:58:16,722 --> 02:58:18,763
[SPEAKER_25]: any policy issue that comes before us.

2209
02:58:21,364 --> 02:58:31,887
[SPEAKER_25]: There are really great questions that the union reps have brought up tonight, legal questions, technical questions that I think need to be answered with time.

2210
02:58:32,588 --> 02:58:37,829
[SPEAKER_25]: And as residents have stated, this particular timing is

2211
02:58:46,007 --> 02:58:47,169
[SPEAKER_25]: questionable, it's difficult.

2212
02:58:48,290 --> 02:58:57,924
[SPEAKER_25]: But taking our time with it, as a resident supporting the firefighters said, tabling it, postponing it, moving it to committee is something I would be comfortable with.

2213
02:58:59,205 --> 02:59:01,028
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Councilor Schell.

2214
02:59:03,927 --> 02:59:05,048
[SPEAKER_55]: We have a motion on the floor.

2215
02:59:05,068 --> 02:59:05,989
[SPEAKER_55]: We have motions on the floor.

2216
02:59:06,009 --> 02:59:07,390
[SPEAKER_55]: We're going to take the motions at this point.

2217
02:59:07,430 --> 02:59:09,071
[SPEAKER_54]: We've had public comment, Mr. Chairman.

2218
02:59:09,091 --> 02:59:11,313
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm just here to answer whatever questions you have.

2219
02:59:11,353 --> 02:59:16,377
[SPEAKER_54]: Unless there's a motion to reopen public comment.

2220
02:59:16,437 --> 02:59:24,684
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President, I think that we have two councils that are very capable, and we have the people tonight to answer these questions.

2221
02:59:24,704 --> 02:59:27,006
[SPEAKER_36]: So if we can, I would recommend that we do reopen.

2222
02:59:27,286 --> 02:59:31,289
[SPEAKER_36]: Just have them answer the questions that maybe can move this forward.

2223
02:59:32,230 --> 02:59:37,394
[SPEAKER_36]: If in a month or two months, the mayor wants to revisit this process, she can.

2224
02:59:37,454 --> 02:59:41,376
[SPEAKER_36]: But right now, we're in a tough situation right now.

2225
02:59:42,257 --> 02:59:46,280
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is why I think it needs to be something that needs to be voted on tonight.

2226
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:47,941
[SPEAKER_36]: So if we can, reopen it, please.

2227
02:59:47,981 --> 02:59:50,142
[SPEAKER_36]: And give them the answers.

2228
02:59:50,262 --> 02:59:50,943
[SPEAKER_36]: Ask them the answers.

2229
02:59:51,363 --> 02:59:52,043
[SPEAKER_36]: Ask them the questions.

2230
02:59:52,504 --> 02:59:54,445
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's get the answers that we need to make a decision.

2231
02:59:54,845 --> 02:59:56,046
[SPEAKER_36]: We're educated people, everybody.

2232
02:59:56,086 --> 02:59:56,406
[SPEAKER_36]: Come on.

2233
02:59:56,446 --> 02:59:56,967
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't need that.

2234
02:59:56,987 --> 02:59:58,948
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a pandemic.

2235
02:59:58,968 --> 03:00:00,089
[SPEAKER_37]: It's dangerous.

2236
03:00:03,865 --> 03:00:11,127
[SPEAKER_55]: do councilors have questions at this time to ask of the city administration or other parties?

2237
03:00:11,147 --> 03:00:12,667
[SPEAKER_36]: Whatever you want to ask, we're here to answer.

2238
03:00:12,707 --> 03:00:13,548
[SPEAKER_36]: That's why we're here.

2239
03:00:15,988 --> 03:00:22,050
[SPEAKER_37]: I have questions for the administration, but I don't think this is the venue.

2240
03:00:22,230 --> 03:00:22,610
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2241
03:00:22,670 --> 03:00:25,051
[SPEAKER_54]: All right, we have two motions on the floor.

2242
03:00:26,477 --> 03:00:31,039
[SPEAKER_55]: One is a motion by Councilor Collins to refer to committee, seconded by Councilor Leming.

2243
03:00:31,579 --> 03:00:35,441
[SPEAKER_55]: Second is a motion to reject by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

2244
03:00:35,461 --> 03:00:48,547
[SPEAKER_37]: It's Councilor Collins, you can unmute and then speak.

2245
03:00:56,246 --> 03:00:56,906
[SPEAKER_55]: Oh, you cannot be.

2246
03:00:56,926 --> 03:01:00,627
[SPEAKER_55]: Please respect the meeting.

2247
03:01:00,647 --> 03:01:02,628
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan.

2248
03:01:02,648 --> 03:01:03,928
Thank you.

2249
03:01:04,228 --> 03:01:04,628
I second.

2250
03:01:04,688 --> 03:01:06,649
[SPEAKER_54]: I second Councilor Scarpelli's motion.

2251
03:01:26,169 --> 03:01:36,315
[SPEAKER_55]: pursuant to Robert's rules, a motion to refer to committee takes precedence over a motion on the main motion, so we will take a vote on the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to committee, seconded by Councilor Leming.

2252
03:01:37,376 --> 03:01:39,157
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2321
03:15:12,870 --> 03:15:20,722
[SPEAKER_55]: 3.

03:16:10,785 --> 03:16:11,145
[SPEAKER_62]: Certainly.

2327
03:16:11,465 --> 03:16:13,427
[SPEAKER_62]: Good evening, councillors, members of the public.

2328
03:16:13,467 --> 03:16:15,668
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you so much for sticking out with us.

2329
03:16:16,208 --> 03:16:17,449
[SPEAKER_62]: My name is Therese Dupont.

2330
03:16:17,549 --> 03:16:21,211
[SPEAKER_62]: I am the community preservation grant manager here in the city of Medford.

2331
03:16:21,231 --> 03:16:26,194
[SPEAKER_62]: Tonight, we have 10 applications for community preservation funding.

2332
03:16:26,695 --> 03:16:29,476
[SPEAKER_62]: These were part of our annual funding round.

2333
03:16:30,257 --> 03:16:39,022
[SPEAKER_62]: So we are now at the final step, which is to hopefully gain approval from this honorable body on each of these applications appropriations.

2334
03:16:41,243 --> 03:16:46,529
[SPEAKER_62]: happy to answer any questions that folks may have on individual applications or the process itself.

2335
03:16:47,470 --> 03:16:48,250
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Teresa.

2336
03:16:48,631 --> 03:16:49,332
[SPEAKER_36]: I just have one.

2337
03:16:50,373 --> 03:16:52,094
[SPEAKER_36]: Everything everything seems in order.

2338
03:16:52,114 --> 03:16:54,957
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that we should all support just one question.

2339
03:16:54,997 --> 03:17:03,326
[SPEAKER_36]: I know that the question that was that the housing, the housing family, the proposal for what was that?

2340
03:17:06,633 --> 03:17:08,695
[SPEAKER_36]: pro bono legal services.

2341
03:17:08,915 --> 03:17:09,636
[SPEAKER_36]: The house is 69,000.

2342
03:17:10,317 --> 03:17:12,780
[SPEAKER_36]: I was under the impression that Ms.

2343
03:17:12,820 --> 03:17:20,648
[SPEAKER_36]: Cameron said that this is funding for paying rents in the rears.

2344
03:17:22,049 --> 03:17:42,786
[SPEAKER_36]: But somebody sent a message saying that on the application, the Housing Families Homeless Prevention and Legal Services Program provides legal assistance and rental assistance to the residents of Malden, Medford, Everett, Pueblo West as legal assistance services include representing families, rental assistance, administering.

2345
03:17:43,746 --> 03:17:47,789
[SPEAKER_36]: So the question is defined, is this for rental assistance?

2346
03:17:49,070 --> 03:17:54,174
[SPEAKER_36]: What she's saying is this for legal services, because I think that was one of the questions some will be brought up.

2347
03:17:54,194 --> 03:17:55,355
[SPEAKER_36]: They just want a clarification.

2348
03:17:57,016 --> 03:17:57,797
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Teresa.

2349
03:17:57,817 --> 03:17:59,358
[SPEAKER_55]: If you could answer that question.

2350
03:18:00,677 --> 03:18:02,138
[SPEAKER_62]: Yes, and I won't mute myself again.

2351
03:18:02,198 --> 03:18:02,798
[SPEAKER_62]: Sorry about that.

2352
03:18:03,198 --> 03:18:11,802
[SPEAKER_62]: This is for rental assistance for residents facing arrears and potentially eviction.

2353
03:18:11,842 --> 03:18:13,423
[SPEAKER_62]: So this is for rental assistance.

2354
03:18:14,483 --> 03:18:23,147
[SPEAKER_62]: I believe in the application, some description of the entire body of housing families work may have, you know,

2355
03:18:24,238 --> 03:18:27,560
[SPEAKER_62]: It ended up in the application as a description of the organization.

2356
03:18:27,661 --> 03:18:31,023
[SPEAKER_62]: So I can see where folks might be confused, but it is for rental arrears.

2357
03:18:32,264 --> 03:18:33,505
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, thank you for the clarity.

2358
03:18:33,525 --> 03:18:34,946
[SPEAKER_36]: I would move approval, Mr. President.

2359
03:18:35,006 --> 03:18:38,548
[SPEAKER_36]: We've already had the meetings and talked about all these projects in length.

2360
03:18:38,728 --> 03:18:44,072
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that they're all super, super successful for our community.

2361
03:18:44,112 --> 03:18:47,575
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we'll benefit from these projects, and I would move approval.

2362
03:18:48,836 --> 03:18:50,397
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2363
03:18:50,437 --> 03:18:52,999
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by...

2364
03:18:54,235 --> 03:18:56,096
[SPEAKER_55]: seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2365
03:18:56,677 --> 03:18:58,038
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2366
03:18:59,759 --> 03:19:00,679

[SPEAKER_55]: It's going to take a minute here.

2399
03:22:34,780 --> 03:22:37,481
[SPEAKER_55]: Could you provide a pre-verbal introduction to the project?

2400
03:22:44,224 --> 03:22:46,284
[SPEAKER_55]: I could also share the presentation I received earlier.

2401
03:22:46,304 --> 03:22:46,384
[SPEAKER_55]: Sure.

2402
03:23:10,094 --> 03:23:11,935

03:23:12,115 --> 03:23:13,855
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, we can start right there.

2404
03:23:14,235 --> 03:23:14,915
[SPEAKER_32]: Great.

2405
03:23:14,955 --> 03:23:15,376
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening.

2406
03:23:15,396 --> 03:23:16,856
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Jeffrey Driscoll.

2407
03:23:16,936 --> 03:23:19,617
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm the executive director of the Medford Housing Authority.

2408
03:23:20,497 --> 03:23:29,440
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to thank the city council for allowing us to appear before you tonight, and also thank the members of the Medford Community Development Board.

2409
03:23:30,460 --> 03:23:38,326
[SPEAKER_32]: for a meeting with our MHA team and their comprehensive review of our application at our meeting with them on February 7th.

2410
03:23:38,866 --> 03:23:45,811
[SPEAKER_32]: We are here before you to describe the site plan review and special permit application today.

2411
03:23:47,072 --> 03:23:51,354
[SPEAKER_32]: If you could go to slide number, we've streamlined this because of the hour.

2412
03:23:51,955 --> 03:23:54,617
[SPEAKER_32]: If you could go to slide number six, please.

2413
03:23:58,055 --> 03:23:58,275
[SPEAKER_32]: go.

2414
03:23:59,056 --> 03:24:03,459
[SPEAKER_32]: An overview of Walking Court redevelopment goals of the project.

2415
03:24:04,060 --> 03:24:14,729
[SPEAKER_32]: This picture shows an elevated view of the corner of North Street and Auburn Street, showing what the proposed development will look like, with a senior mid-rise building toward the south of the site.

2416
03:24:16,581 --> 03:24:26,863
[SPEAKER_32]: The building is a six-story building with the first story being podium parking, and some community and administrative spaces, and then five floors of residential apartments.

2417
03:24:27,343 --> 03:24:39,445
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a smaller mid-rise building, which is four stories, with the first floor being podium parking, or possible podium parking, some community space, and then three floors of residential units.

2418
03:24:40,085 --> 03:24:42,486
[SPEAKER_32]: Then three townhouses that directly abut

2419
03:24:43,226 --> 03:24:50,359
[SPEAKER_32]: the typical two family homes in the neighborhood, the height of the townhouses will be similar to those neighborhood houses.

2420
03:24:51,180 --> 03:24:51,882
[SPEAKER_32]: Next slide, please.

2421
03:24:57,574 --> 03:25:02,696
[SPEAKER_32]: This slide overview of a walk in court resident and neighborhood engagement process.

2422
03:25:02,756 --> 03:25:06,977
[SPEAKER_32]: The resident engagement process started in late summer, early fall of 2022.

2423
03:25:08,497 --> 03:25:11,699
[SPEAKER_32]: We've had an active and well attended engagement process.

2424
03:25:12,199 --> 03:25:16,100
[SPEAKER_32]: We held eight resident meetings, each one of those

2425
03:25:16,580 --> 03:25:18,243
[SPEAKER_32]: dates where there was a resident meeting.

2426
03:25:18,484 --> 03:25:23,572
[SPEAKER_32]: There were multiple meetings in order to accommodate the number of residents at the site.

2427
03:25:24,153 --> 03:25:25,876
[SPEAKER_32]: And there were five neighborhood meetings.

2428
03:25:25,936 --> 03:25:29,081
[SPEAKER_32]: For all of the meetings, we sent mailings to the property owners.

2429
03:25:30,287 --> 03:25:35,751
[SPEAKER_32]: the owners that abut the walking court property and those beyond 400 feet.

2430
03:25:35,911 --> 03:25:48,240
[SPEAKER_32]: We also delivered flyers throughout the neighborhood where the blue area shows past the 400 feet to houses and more traffic to areas as well as posting notices on the poles.

2431
03:25:49,321 --> 03:26:06,769
[SPEAKER_32]: The MHA has met with a variety of city departments, fire department, building department, DPW, engineering, and also attended a number of public meetings held in relation to the community preservation funding that we received and zoning we received in the fall.

2432
03:26:09,991 --> 03:26:10,751
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, go to slide 32.

2433
03:26:10,811 --> 03:26:10,951
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

2434
03:26:17,469 --> 03:26:22,353
[SPEAKER_41]: Good evening, President, Chair, and members of the City Council.

2435
03:26:22,853 --> 03:26:30,179
[SPEAKER_40]: My name is Hannah Kilson of the law firm of Nolan Sheehan Patent in Boston, Mass., and I am counsel to Medford Housing Authority.

2436
03:26:30,960 --> 03:26:34,523
[SPEAKER_40]: Continuing with the presentation, I'd like to make two points to begin with.

2437
03:26:35,143 --> 03:26:41,949
[SPEAKER_40]: One, we've asked our development team, they are also on Zoom watching us, and we're doing a much more

2438
03:26:42,809 --> 03:26:49,013
[SPEAKER_40]: truncated presentation, but they are available to engage in any questions that are presented by you.

2439
03:26:49,813 --> 03:27:02,301
[SPEAKER_40]: As you can see, we are here with the PD for the issuance of our special permit to show that we are in compliance with the PD3 special permit requirements that are set forth in the zoning ordinance.

2440
03:27:02,821 --> 03:27:05,203
[SPEAKER_40]: The ordinance establishes four criteria

2441
03:27:05,663 --> 03:27:11,410
[SPEAKER_40]: that need to be considered by this board in issuing the special permit under the PDD-3.

2442
03:27:12,071 --> 03:27:21,061
[SPEAKER_40]: One is that the site development and use plan that was submitted as part of our application is substantially conforms to the preliminary plan.

2443
03:27:24,006 --> 03:27:31,731
[SPEAKER_40]: It does, and it only has insubstantial differences, and I'd like to highlight those insubstantial differences.

2444
03:27:32,532 --> 03:27:35,894
[SPEAKER_40]: As was noted, this site will have five buildings on the site.

2445
03:27:36,394 --> 03:27:39,636
[SPEAKER_40]: Building A, can you move to slide 25?

2446
03:27:40,077 --> 03:27:41,738
[SPEAKER_40]: We'll have five buildings on the site.

2447
03:27:42,518 --> 03:27:48,360
[SPEAKER_40]: Building A, six-story, 198-unit senior disabled housing.

2448
03:27:48,860 --> 03:28:07,446
[SPEAKER_40]: Building B, which is a four-story mid-rise family units, and four townhomes, C, D, and E, which will contain the balance of the 16 family units.

2449
03:28:08,166 --> 03:28:31,413
[SPEAKER_40]: The only difference between the preliminary plan and the site development plan that was filed with our application and use plan that was filed with our application is changes to building A. The width of building A has been reduced by three feet six inches from what was originally proposed in the PDD submission.

2450
03:28:31,433 --> 03:28:37,235
[SPEAKER_40]: The building square footage has increased by one percent.

2451
03:28:38,035 --> 03:28:47,281
[SPEAKER_40]: from the PDD submission to the special permit plan application, and the total gross floor area at the site has decreased by about 2%.

2452
03:28:48,802 --> 03:29:06,294
[SPEAKER_40]: These changes are insubstantial, and the other related changes are to usable open space, which has also decreased by about 4%, and landscape open space, which has increased by about 4% as a result of changes between the two plans.

2453
03:29:09,075 --> 03:29:14,797
[SPEAKER_40]: So the site development and use plan is substantially conforms to the preliminary plan.

2454
03:29:15,257 --> 03:29:26,880
[SPEAKER_40]: The third criteria that this council needs to consider is that the project meets the special permit criteria that is set forth in the zoning code at section 94-11.6.2.

2455
03:29:26,920 --> 03:29:27,560
[SPEAKER_40]: Those six criteria

2456
03:29:34,082 --> 03:29:53,407
[SPEAKER_40]: are social economic and community needs size scale and design traffic flow and safety, public utility and services impacts on the environmental condition and compatibility with the city's comprehensive plan, and the city's housing production plan.

2457
03:29:54,167 --> 03:30:22,796
[SPEAKER_40]: This project meets the social, economic, and community needs of Medford as we are preserving 144 units of existing deeply affordable housing for low-income, senior, and disabled households, while at the same time adding 94 new additional deeply affordable units in a transit-rich neighborhood and creating a range of housing types, from elevator-accessible, small family units, and family units.

2458
03:30:23,596 --> 03:30:33,103
[SPEAKER_40]: As noted before, the size, scale, and design of Rockling Court has been intentionally and carefully developed to be responsive to the larger neighborhood.

2459
03:30:41,095 --> 03:30:42,656
[SPEAKER_40]: No, that's okay.

2460
03:30:43,056 --> 03:30:47,319
[SPEAKER_40]: So let me say on the size, scale, and design.

2461
03:30:47,780 --> 03:30:58,687
[SPEAKER_40]: So as you all know, the boundaries, the neighborhoods that abut this parcel, the Southwest Corridor by building A, that is an industrial area.

2462
03:30:58,867 --> 03:31:07,973
[SPEAKER_40]: And so our largest plan building has been located in that proximity, close to the traffic area and an industrial zoned area.

2463
03:31:08,954 --> 03:31:12,457
[SPEAKER_40]: to the rest of the project where we have Whole Foods.

2464
03:31:12,977 --> 03:31:19,022
[SPEAKER_40]: That is where we situate our building B, our four-story family unit plan.

2465
03:31:19,542 --> 03:31:31,412
[SPEAKER_40]: The north and the east boundaries of the parcel, they abut residential settings, and that's where the three townhome buildings are situated.

2466
03:31:31,832 --> 03:31:49,281
[SPEAKER_40]: So the size and scale and design of Auckland Court has really been responsive to the larger neighborhood, trying to create a welcoming and pedestrian-friendly neighborhood through the using of planting, trees, and by installing certain kinds of pedestrian safety measures.

2467
03:31:49,741 --> 03:32:00,586
[SPEAKER_40]: So traffic flow and safety, what is up before you on the screen, shows the traffic calming measures being utilized at Auckland Court to ensure

2468
03:32:01,767 --> 03:32:12,595
[SPEAKER_40]: that we have safe flow of traffic through the site by the use of gateway entries, midway entries where we have raised sidewalks.

2469
03:32:13,315 --> 03:32:18,359
[SPEAKER_40]: We're utilizing the speed tables that you can see in the lower left corner.

2470
03:32:18,959 --> 03:32:27,946
[SPEAKER_40]: And you will see a narrowing of the roadway through the development and with a curvature in order to reduce speed of traffic as it flows through.

2471
03:32:29,747 --> 03:32:35,511
[SPEAKER_40]: The next criteria in the review of a special permit is public utility and services.

2472
03:32:36,552 --> 03:32:54,644
[SPEAKER_40]: Our consultants, Fuss and O'Neill, have engaged directly with the city engineer, DPW, to ensure that we have readily available and sufficient public utilities in the area to support the project without undue burden on the existing structure.

2473
03:32:55,604 --> 03:32:57,245
[SPEAKER_40]: Impacts to natural environment.

2474
03:32:58,326 --> 03:33:02,088
[SPEAKER_40]: This development has really been designed to be sustainable and resilient.

2475
03:33:02,748 --> 03:33:06,590
[SPEAKER_40]: We're meeting both the state and the city's sustainability requirements.

2476
03:33:07,490 --> 03:33:10,871
[SPEAKER_40]: We will have enterprise green community standards.

2477
03:33:10,891 --> 03:33:18,695
[SPEAKER_40]: The electricity is being utilized for heating and cooling and we are developing this project in a way to be solar ready.

2478
03:33:19,415 --> 03:33:25,857
[SPEAKER_40]: We are working to reduce the carbon footprint of the buildings by this use of solar and electricity for heating.

2479
03:33:25,877 --> 03:33:33,100
[SPEAKER_40]: In addition at the project, we would note that there will be tree removal as a part of this development.

2480
03:33:33,680 --> 03:33:36,161
[SPEAKER_40]: Currently on site, there are 52 trees.

2481
03:33:36,701 --> 03:33:45,725
[SPEAKER_40]: As part of the development, 12 of those trees will be removed and they are pear trees and they will be located in other parts of the city.

2482
03:33:46,625 --> 03:33:48,767
[SPEAKER_40]: eight of the mature trees will remain.

2483
03:33:49,327 --> 03:33:57,132
[SPEAKER_40]: The remainder of the trees will be removed, but they will be replaced such that our net trees added to the project will be 26.

2484
03:33:57,232 --> 03:34:02,836
[SPEAKER_40]: We will have 78 trees on site when the project is completed.

2485
03:34:03,436 --> 03:34:10,201
[SPEAKER_40]: Additionally, the Medford Housing Authority has agreed to make a payment to the City of Medford of $50,000

2486
03:34:12,363 --> 03:34:27,385
[SPEAKER_40]: to be paid at the time of the issuance of the building permit to be utilized by the city for further tree enhancement and development throughout the city, and we're asking today that that in fact be a condition of our special permit issuance.

2487
03:34:28,106 --> 03:34:37,334
[SPEAKER_40]: The last special permit factor that we'd like to note is that the project must be compatible with Medford's comprehensive plan and housing production plan.

2488
03:34:37,994 --> 03:34:44,500
[SPEAKER_40]: These plans really focus on the critical and urgent need in Medford for additional affordable housing.

2489
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:51,226
[SPEAKER_40]: And the housing development plan includes specific references to the need to redevelop Walkling Court.

2490
03:34:51,666 --> 03:34:56,170
[SPEAKER_40]: The development of the buildings and structures at Walkling will help satisfy

2491
03:34:56,710 --> 03:35:04,194
[SPEAKER_40]: the city's objective of more than 600 new units of affordable housing over the next three fiscal years.

2492
03:35:08,977 --> 03:35:12,499
[SPEAKER_40]: So those are the criteria for the special permit.

2493
03:35:12,539 --> 03:35:18,382
[SPEAKER_40]: The last piece that needs to be considered, sorry, it's not the last, my apologies.

2494
03:35:19,773 --> 03:35:27,277
[SPEAKER_40]: So the special permit criteria, as you know, is that the adverse effects of the project do not outweigh the beneficial impacts.

2495
03:35:27,677 --> 03:35:43,006
[SPEAKER_40]: And we really do believe that that is clear here, that we've demonstrated in this discussion the beneficial impacts of the development to bring more affordable housing, to improve the movement and the use of the site,

2496
03:35:44,387 --> 03:35:54,174
[SPEAKER_40]: The other standard that we need to satisfy as part of our permit request is that the project meets the standards of approval set forth in the site plan provisions of the ordinance.

2497
03:35:54,674 --> 03:36:04,061
[SPEAKER_40]: And we believe that has been demonstrated by the CDB's issuance of their approval with recommended conditions at the meeting on the 7th of February.

2498
03:36:05,287 --> 03:36:16,971
[SPEAKER_40]: The last element of the special permit criteria under the PDD3 that needs to be addressed is that the site development and the use plan incorporates the recommendations of the CDB.

2499
03:36:18,111 --> 03:36:31,156
[SPEAKER_40]: We have worked with the engineering, has worked with the city's engineer to incorporate many of the recommendations already into our plans relative to stormwater and sewer.

2500
03:36:31,896 --> 03:36:49,281
[SPEAKER_40]: We have agreed to to in consultation with the traffic department and the DCR to reach agreement as to the conditions recommended relative to the crosswalks and the intersections adjacent to the parcel.

2501
03:36:50,241 --> 03:37:03,012
[SPEAKER_40]: And we would ask that all of those conditions that have been set forth and given to you by the CDB would be incorporated as conditions of this special permit to be satisfied prior to the issuance of the building permit for the project.

2502
03:37:05,234 --> 03:37:06,996
[SPEAKER_40]: And with that, I will conclude my remarks.

2503
03:37:07,416 --> 03:37:10,178
[SPEAKER_47]: And so if we could go to slide 33.

2504
03:37:10,238 --> 03:37:10,559
[SPEAKER_52]: Slide 33.

2505
03:37:13,281 --> 03:37:14,542
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you for bearing with me.

2506
03:37:20,157 --> 03:37:26,962
[SPEAKER_32]: As Executive Director, I'm cognizant of the impact the Housing Authority can have upon the community.

2507
03:37:26,982 --> 03:37:37,491
[SPEAKER_32]: The Housing Authority has provided a lifeline for low-income individuals and families who in many instances face housing insecurity and homelessness.

2508
03:37:38,271 --> 03:37:49,380
[SPEAKER_32]: These are issues that we deal with on a daily basis and through our efforts and the skilled designers who have assisted us to get to this point, we're happy to be here, which will hopefully allow us to carry on with our mission.

2509
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:54,023
[SPEAKER_32]: Our efforts go beyond what a housing authority would ordinarily be undertaking.

2510
03:37:54,564 --> 03:38:02,190
[SPEAKER_32]: We're one of the more progressive agencies in Massachusetts and beyond what we're doing at 121 Riverside Avenue by adding

2511
03:38:03,290 --> 03:38:06,371
[SPEAKER_32]: 22 units to a 200 unit development.

2512
03:38:06,712 --> 03:38:09,873
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a $146 million project.

2513
03:38:10,393 --> 03:38:31,802
[SPEAKER_32]: The redevelopment of Walkland Court, which has traditionally been thought of as the poor sister of the housing authorities, is what sets the Medford Housing Authority apart, as we are not looking to only maintain our units, but to extend those beyond what most housing authorities today can do, and that is to increase the amount of affordable housing in the city of Medford.

2514
03:38:33,046 --> 03:38:41,148
[SPEAKER_32]: The Medford Housing Authority will preserve 144 existing deeply affordable units, as was stated, for low-income seniors and disabled individuals.

2515
03:38:41,628 --> 03:38:49,391
[SPEAKER_32]: We're not capable of currently providing adequate assistance and housing services to individuals who are there at that site at this time.

2516
03:38:50,011 --> 03:38:57,633
[SPEAKER_32]: The authority has attempted through years of limited funding to maintain Walkling Court, and Walkling Court, though, is in a much better condition today

2517
03:38:59,008 --> 03:39:02,890
[SPEAKER_32]: but does not compare with the Housing Authority's federal developments.

2518
03:39:03,750 --> 03:39:10,413
[SPEAKER_32]: We're building units in a transit-rich community, as was stated, within walking distance of the Tufts Green Line stop nearby.

2519
03:39:11,154 --> 03:39:13,335
[SPEAKER_32]: We are looking to provide accessible family

2520
03:39:14,455 --> 03:39:20,242
[SPEAKER_32]: apartments through the inclusion of an elevator, accessible family apartments in housing industry.

2521
03:39:20,822 --> 03:39:28,511
[SPEAKER_32]: It's extraordinarily rare to find accessible units on the private market, never mind in public subsidized housing.

2522
03:39:29,292 --> 03:39:31,093
[SPEAKER_32]: It is in dire need of being provided.

2523
03:39:31,553 --> 03:39:46,178
[SPEAKER_32]: We're addressing climate change, meaning state and city sustainability requirements, enterprise communities, improving energy efficiency, ventilation, stormwater management, removing hazardous waste on the site, as well as HVAC improvements.

2524
03:39:46,798 --> 03:39:56,928
[SPEAKER_32]: The goal of the Housing Authority is to affirmatively impact the lives of our residents, both those who reside at this property today and those who will reside at Walkland Court sometime in the future.

2525
03:39:57,388 --> 03:40:08,679
[SPEAKER_32]: Remember that elderly or disabled resident or family who one day may reside in these new apartments may be someone you know or may be a neighbor or even a member of your own family.

2526
03:40:10,140 --> 03:40:12,201
[SPEAKER_32]: integrating walk and court into the neighborhood.

2527
03:40:12,861 --> 03:40:15,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Medford Housing Authority wants to be a good neighbor.

2528
03:40:15,223 --> 03:40:21,606
[SPEAKER_32]: We've taken great strides in attempting to take into consideration the comments and input from the community.

2529
03:40:22,026 --> 03:40:28,890
[SPEAKER_32]: Our design team has received and incorporated recommendations on street design and site density from the fire department.

2530
03:40:29,310 --> 03:40:36,414
[SPEAKER_32]: We've had numerous discussions as far as the landscaping, and we'll attempt to save as many of the trees as possible, as was earlier stated.

2531
03:40:36,974 --> 03:40:41,715
[SPEAKER_32]: We will continue to work with the city departments through design and during construction.

2532
03:40:42,655 --> 03:40:53,857
[SPEAKER_32]: The economic benefit is that $166 million in local economic activity through the construction will be generated, which will support up to 968 jobs.

2533
03:40:54,318 --> 03:41:01,719
[SPEAKER_32]: With the contribution of the city, this has enabled the Housing Authority to receive millions of dollars in projected and committed funding from the state.

2534
03:41:02,279 --> 03:41:04,140
[SPEAKER_32]: That commitment is over $25 million at this point in time.

2535
03:41:06,420 --> 03:41:08,822
[SPEAKER_32]: Walkley Court is presently a polling place.

2536
03:41:09,502 --> 03:41:14,505
[SPEAKER_32]: Walkley Court will continue to be a polling place and will be for the upcoming March 5th election.

2537
03:41:15,145 --> 03:41:24,491
[SPEAKER_32]: The facilities will have a community room which can hold an estimated 150 to 200 people and can be used by the local neighborhood and by the community at large.

2538
03:41:25,231 --> 03:41:34,454
[SPEAKER_32]: So the aspect of being a good neighbor is important to us, and is one of the reasons we've had numerous meetings with residents, neighbors, and city departments, as well as interest groups.

2539
03:41:35,094 --> 03:41:50,219
[SPEAKER_32]: On behalf of the Medford Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, our employees, our residents, our current residents, and those who will one day live in one of these apartments at Walkland Court, I thank you for the opportunity to come before you tonight and ask for your support.

2540
03:41:50,860 --> 03:41:51,480
[SPEAKER_32]: Again, thank you.

2541
03:41:53,148 --> 03:41:54,088
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Director Driscoll.

2542
03:41:54,449 --> 03:41:56,029
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you all for the presentation.

2543
03:41:56,790 --> 03:41:57,670
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you for bearing with me.

2544
03:41:58,110 --> 03:42:01,852
[SPEAKER_55]: We have considered this at this point several times as a city council.

2545
03:42:01,912 --> 03:42:05,413
[SPEAKER_55]: We passed the PDD3 zoning and a number of other things.

2546
03:42:05,473 --> 03:42:11,016
[SPEAKER_55]: So when we talk about an abbreviated presentation, we have seen this presentation several times at this point.

2547
03:42:11,036 --> 03:42:12,236
[SPEAKER_55]: We're well aware of what it contains.

2548
03:42:12,637 --> 03:42:16,558
[SPEAKER_55]: I have one technical question for you, and then we'll open up the public hearing.

2549
03:42:18,599 --> 03:42:22,721
[SPEAKER_55]: is the $50,000 for the tree fund, or for trees.

2550
03:42:23,181 --> 03:42:24,542
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll leave tree fund for another day.

2551
03:42:26,083 --> 03:42:28,984
[SPEAKER_55]: Is that a condition of the Community Development Board recommendations?

2552
03:42:29,224 --> 03:42:32,586
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, so we'll need to do that along with the Community Development Board recommendations.

2553
03:42:33,246 --> 03:42:33,626
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2554
03:42:33,646 --> 03:42:37,828
[SPEAKER_55]: At this point, do councilors have any questions for the petitioner?

2555
03:42:39,709 --> 03:42:41,790
[SPEAKER_55]: Any comments they'd like to make to Vice President Collins?

2556
03:42:44,531 --> 03:42:45,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

2557
03:42:45,652 --> 03:42:46,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for being here.

2558
03:42:47,073 --> 03:42:51,496
[SPEAKER_18]: As President Bears said, we've had this conversation many times before.

2559
03:42:51,536 --> 03:42:56,559
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is one of the first things that, I think this was the subject of one of my first committees of the whole in my first term.

2560
03:42:57,620 --> 03:43:06,185
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been great to get to know this project very well through our various meetings about it as it's gone through its various approval stages with the CPA, the CBB.

2561
03:43:07,126 --> 03:43:12,369
[SPEAKER_18]: It's exciting that we're getting to this stage and this very long, very considered process.

2562
03:43:14,767 --> 03:43:16,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, there's a lot to talk about here.

2563
03:43:16,889 --> 03:43:17,910
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a lot of detail.

2564
03:43:17,970 --> 03:43:19,231
[SPEAKER_18]: It's baked into the process.

2565
03:43:20,853 --> 03:43:32,503
[SPEAKER_18]: But for me, still the most compelling thing is preserving those 144 existing deeply affordable units, adding 94 deeply affordable units to our community.

2566
03:43:32,543 --> 03:43:40,130
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I said this the last time we talked about this, but it is so incredibly rare that we get the chance to make a double digit percentage increase towards our

2567
03:43:40,831 --> 03:43:46,933
[SPEAKER_18]: known affordable housing goals in the city, especially when we're leveraging funding that comes from outside of our community, our community.

2568
03:43:46,953 --> 03:43:53,175
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, it's such a rare opportunity I know it's a value that shared behind this rail throughout so much of the community.

2569
03:43:53,876 --> 03:43:57,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's so important not only to be increasing affordable housing in the community but really

2570
03:43:58,537 --> 03:44:02,379
[SPEAKER_18]: excellent, dignified, affordable housing for people at all stages of life.

2571
03:44:03,720 --> 03:44:09,603
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an area where I think Medford is really leading, and thank you so much to your leadership on this and making sure that this project is shepherded through.

2572
03:44:09,623 --> 03:44:16,287
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have a lot of questions because I've had the opportunity to ask you tons of nitty gritty questions before.

2573
03:44:17,768 --> 03:44:22,230
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't opened the public hearing yet, so I'll save my motion for later, but thank you so much for being here.

2574
03:44:22,791 --> 03:44:23,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2575
03:44:25,466 --> 03:44:27,208
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah, I can.

2576
03:44:27,308 --> 03:44:27,568
[SPEAKER_36]: Thanks.

2577
03:44:27,728 --> 03:44:28,048
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2578
03:44:28,068 --> 03:44:48,044
[SPEAKER_36]: And again, thank you for all you know that you've been in front of us many times and tonight wasn't an easy night, and appreciate you sticking through it I know that I think the biggest, the biggest feedback we get, there's always two sides and in talking to residents that are actually living in the court right now, and understanding

2579
03:44:49,830 --> 03:44:54,814
[SPEAKER_36]: the quality of life increase that they're gonna go through, I think really weighed on me.

2580
03:44:54,894 --> 03:45:05,221
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that as we move forward and we talk about affordable housing and having family affordable housing, I think that's something you don't see too often, especially in such a dense community.

2581
03:45:05,981 --> 03:45:15,248
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that the phone calls I received from a lot of people that were against it, I don't think they're really against the process and understanding it.

2582
03:45:15,728 --> 03:45:17,950
[SPEAKER_36]: From what I heard really was a lack of really

2583
03:45:19,429 --> 03:45:22,031
[SPEAKER_36]: understanding through communication on the city side.

2584
03:45:23,572 --> 03:45:30,315
[SPEAKER_36]: Something that I think that even if things don't go right, we have an opportunity that I've heard over and over again with traffic.

2585
03:45:30,736 --> 03:45:39,181
[SPEAKER_36]: These are the biggest concerns that I hear is that in the neighborhood, in a densely populated area, that's the biggest fear they have and what's happening in that area.

2586
03:45:39,321 --> 03:45:42,543
[SPEAKER_36]: Now that existed way before this project.

2587
03:45:43,123 --> 03:45:58,788
[SPEAKER_36]: But I also give us, there's an opportunity there as well that as we move forward with this project, and we have families and we have a place that everybody can use like you've talked about, and I think that revisiting the different traffic flows and making sure that

2588
03:45:59,488 --> 03:46:02,971
[SPEAKER_36]: We're there for the members of the community that are concerned about that.

2589
03:46:02,991 --> 03:46:07,896
[SPEAKER_36]: And again, like I said, I think my concern more isn't really with you.

2590
03:46:08,456 --> 03:46:13,001
[SPEAKER_36]: It's really with the lack of communication or the lack of response.

2591
03:46:13,962 --> 03:46:16,964
[SPEAKER_36]: See, I come from a service industry.

2592
03:46:17,485 --> 03:46:20,988
[SPEAKER_36]: So an understanding when somebody doesn't like something,

2593
03:46:21,869 --> 03:46:24,650
[SPEAKER_36]: All they need to do sometimes is just pick up the phone and talk to someone.

2594
03:46:25,191 --> 03:46:28,392
[SPEAKER_36]: So even if it's the same person 55 times I'm sure you guys have heard that.

2595
03:46:28,992 --> 03:46:38,096
[SPEAKER_36]: So and I think that that's the issue that I have with our administration that I find it a little lackluster and I and I hope they would work on that but other than that.

2596
03:46:40,339 --> 03:46:56,963
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, it's, everything isn't most popular for everybody, but I think this is a project that really will, it's really thought through in the process that really would enhance the people, like I said, that live there now and really build their quality of life, what they deserve.

2597
03:46:57,023 --> 03:46:57,543
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you.

2598
03:46:58,523 --> 03:46:58,863
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2599
03:46:59,823 --> 03:47:00,924
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2600
03:47:00,944 --> 03:47:01,884
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further questions?

2601
03:47:01,924 --> 03:47:02,444
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Tseng.

2602
03:47:03,590 --> 03:47:12,821
[SPEAKER_25]: I, in a very similar manner as Council Columns and Councilor Scarpelli, want to thank you for the time that you've put into this project, I know it's been years.

2603
03:47:14,563 --> 03:47:19,669
[SPEAKER_25]: I think very importantly, you've put a lot of time to get to know the community to talk to the residents.

2604
03:47:20,249 --> 03:47:27,414
[SPEAKER_25]: to, you know, sometimes you don't see eye to eye with them on things, but you talk and compromise and have made adjustments.

2605
03:47:27,434 --> 03:47:29,255
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that's really important.

2606
03:47:29,275 --> 03:47:36,440
[SPEAKER_25]: You've coordinated a lot with city staff in a way that we wish every project were done in that manner.

2607
03:47:36,900 --> 03:47:41,523
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's really important to underscore how rare it is for our city to have this opportunity.

2608
03:47:41,944 --> 03:47:49,569
[SPEAKER_25]: I think any municipality in Massachusetts would be kicking its heels to get at this opportunity and the opportunity like this to increase its affordable housing stock.

2609
03:47:50,749 --> 03:47:53,971
[SPEAKER_25]: to better the living conditions of the seniors.

2610
03:47:54,872 --> 03:48:05,597
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's really important to talk about how there'll be better ventilation in these buildings, there's better noise guards against outside noise in these buildings as well.

2611
03:48:05,798 --> 03:48:07,659
[SPEAKER_25]: There's more space, there are elevators.

2612
03:48:08,719 --> 03:48:10,820
[SPEAKER_25]: seniors can get the care that they need.

2613
03:48:11,280 --> 03:48:15,901
[SPEAKER_25]: When, you know, Walken Court, when it was first designed, was state of its art.

2614
03:48:16,061 --> 03:48:19,182
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, time changes, and needs change.

2615
03:48:19,782 --> 03:48:25,464
[SPEAKER_25]: And as those needs have changed, I'm very happy to see that the MHA has taken that into account.

2616
03:48:26,404 --> 03:48:35,587
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's not been the easiest process, and I know that, as Councilor Scarpell mentioned, there are still residents with some concerns, but I think you have negotiated in good faith.

2617
03:48:36,167 --> 03:48:37,528
[SPEAKER_25]: to address those concerns.

2618
03:48:37,588 --> 03:48:49,918
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm also very happy to see that, to see the 50,000 in tree mitigation agreement that you've reached with trees, which I think speaks to that good faith negotiations.

2619
03:48:51,279 --> 03:48:53,140
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2620
03:48:53,580 --> 03:48:55,282
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comments by members of the council?

2621
03:48:56,752 --> 03:49:01,496
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, whereas this is a public hearing, I'm going to open the public hearing to comment.

2622
03:49:02,277 --> 03:49:06,020
[SPEAKER_55]: People can give comment, put their comments on the record.

2623
03:49:06,740 --> 03:49:09,503
[SPEAKER_55]: They can comment that they're in favor, they're against, or otherwise.

2624
03:49:10,263 --> 03:49:12,565
[SPEAKER_55]: So I'm opening the public hearing now.

2625
03:49:12,585 --> 03:49:20,452
[SPEAKER_55]: If you'd like to speak regarding this project, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom, and we will recognize you.

2626
03:49:20,472 --> 03:49:25,055
[SPEAKER_55]: If you are in the room, I do ask that you just give your name and address to Messenger.

2627
03:49:25,996 --> 03:49:30,462
[SPEAKER_55]: Lepore, Lepore, who hates when I call him that, to Larry.

2628
03:49:33,126 --> 03:49:34,468
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

2629
03:49:40,086 --> 03:49:44,349
[SPEAKER_49]: On February 7th, the Community Development Board had a hearing about this.

2630
03:49:46,170 --> 03:49:55,355
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't have email, I don't have a computer, so my comments have to be made either in person or via letter.

2631
03:49:55,655 --> 03:49:56,236
[SPEAKER_49]: I type a letter.

2632
03:49:57,219 --> 03:50:02,725
[SPEAKER_49]: On February 7th, I actually brought my comments in the letter to City Hall.

2633
03:50:03,106 --> 03:50:17,762
[SPEAKER_49]: I happened to bump into Chairman, President Bears, and I handed him his, and I also told him that I was going to bring copies for the rest of the council to the clerk's office, which I did.

2634
03:50:19,003 --> 03:50:23,965
[SPEAKER_49]: in speaking to one Councilor, they did not receive my comments yet.

2635
03:50:24,045 --> 03:50:26,085
[SPEAKER_49]: Either they didn't pick them up or whatever.

2636
03:50:26,626 --> 03:50:30,227
[SPEAKER_49]: So I don't know if the rest of you got my comments or not.

2637
03:50:31,007 --> 03:50:36,008
[SPEAKER_49]: But I wanna explain what happened on the Community Development Board meeting.

2638
03:50:36,028 --> 03:50:37,029
[SPEAKER_49]: They,

2639
03:50:41,770 --> 03:50:43,091
[SPEAKER_49]: First of all, they changed the meeting.

2640
03:50:43,131 --> 03:50:44,972
[SPEAKER_49]: It was supposed to be held two weeks prior.

2641
03:50:45,532 --> 03:50:47,053
[SPEAKER_49]: They had to send out a new notice.

2642
03:50:47,673 --> 03:50:59,979
[SPEAKER_49]: And in that notice, the first notice said that you could respond by email or by voicemail.

2643
03:51:00,779 --> 03:51:06,102
[SPEAKER_49]: Then they had to redo that because they didn't accept voicemails anymore because once before on a

2644
03:51:08,163 --> 03:51:19,413
[SPEAKER_49]: October 4th meeting, they accepted voicemails, but then at the very end, they said there were five people who claimed that they were not gonna count their comments, even though they had advertised to send in voicemail.

2645
03:51:20,694 --> 03:51:21,775
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, so that's that.

2646
03:51:21,835 --> 03:51:27,840
[SPEAKER_49]: So now on the October 4th meeting, we had a meeting,

2647
03:51:31,076 --> 03:51:35,020
[SPEAKER_49]: They opened it up for public comments.

2648
03:51:36,342 --> 03:51:41,807
[SPEAKER_49]: Three people spoke in person, and then they closed the public comment portion of it.

2649
03:51:43,849 --> 03:51:49,715
[SPEAKER_49]: Then Alicia Hunt mentioned that they had received my paper letter that day.

2650
03:51:50,436 --> 03:51:54,418
[SPEAKER_49]: And she asked the chair if she had read them, and she said she did not.

2651
03:51:54,978 --> 03:52:01,721
[SPEAKER_49]: And the rest of the board said they did not, well, they didn't respond at all, so I would assume that they didn't read them either.

2652
03:52:01,741 --> 03:52:07,344
[SPEAKER_49]: So Director Hunt asked them if they wanted to have her read my comments, and they said no.

2653
03:52:08,205 --> 03:52:16,649
[SPEAKER_49]: But Director Hunt briefly mentioned a couple of my topics with a questioning inflection voice, which,

2654
03:52:17,978 --> 03:52:21,845
[SPEAKER_49]: appeared that she was confused about the points I was raising in my comments.

2655
03:52:22,806 --> 03:52:24,709
[SPEAKER_49]: I immediately tried to clarify that.

2656
03:52:26,286 --> 03:52:33,108
[SPEAKER_49]: I pressed six because I was on the phone, because I don't have email, and I can't do it electronically, but I wasn't recognized.

2657
03:52:33,829 --> 03:52:36,470
[SPEAKER_49]: So my comments that day didn't matter.

2658
03:52:36,490 --> 03:52:44,573
[SPEAKER_49]: It was a public hearing, but my comments, they didn't read my letter, and they didn't let me respond when I tried to call in.

2659
03:52:44,593 --> 03:52:46,413
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, that's the first thing.

2660
03:52:49,309 --> 03:53:06,245
[SPEAKER_49]: So, if this Council did not receive or read my comments, I know Council did because I handed it to them, then this is the public comment period, public hearing didn't happen because my comments were not heard.

2661
03:53:09,921 --> 03:53:19,884
[SPEAKER_49]: I would propose that you not take a vote tonight, because you have not allowed the public to speak, me, and people like me.

2662
03:53:21,665 --> 03:53:22,825
[SPEAKER_49]: So, there it is.

2663
03:53:22,885 --> 03:53:26,926
[SPEAKER_49]: I mean, I don't wanna go over the points in my letter to you, Councilor Bears.

2664
03:53:28,907 --> 03:53:34,769
[SPEAKER_49]: In that letter, I also mentioned that I had submitted a petition back in September,

2665
03:53:35,948 --> 03:53:37,309
[SPEAKER_49]: and a letter along with that.

2666
03:53:37,449 --> 03:53:43,451
[SPEAKER_49]: So rather than reiterate all the comments in my letter, I just made reference to it, it was on file in the clerk's office.

2667
03:53:44,691 --> 03:53:49,693
[SPEAKER_49]: So just for the new Councilors, here's the petition.

2668
03:53:49,713 --> 03:54:02,078
[SPEAKER_49]: 1,131 people signed the petition, not because we're opposed to affordable housing, not because we're opposed to them redeveloping Lockwood Court.

2669
03:54:03,311 --> 03:54:11,435
[SPEAKER_49]: We in the neighborhood, we know it best, because these are immediate neighbors, are opposed to the design that's being presented.

2670
03:54:12,695 --> 03:54:14,156
[SPEAKER_49]: One of the issues is the traffic.

2671
03:54:14,516 --> 03:54:18,218
[SPEAKER_49]: They did a traffic study, but it was only three days.

2672
03:54:20,899 --> 03:54:26,802
[SPEAKER_49]: I spoke to Todd Blake this morning about this traffic study, and he said that,

2673
03:54:29,183 --> 03:54:35,845
[SPEAKER_49]: The traffic volume in our area between 2021 and 2023 has increased 78%.

2674
03:54:36,445 --> 03:54:43,027
[SPEAKER_49]: And he said the traffic on Knott Street alone has increased by 20%.

2675
03:54:43,248 --> 03:54:56,752
[SPEAKER_49]: Now, the street, one of the streets, the two streets there connecting, going through Welcome Court, exits or enters, I don't know which way they're gonna put the direction, on Knott Street.

2676
03:54:57,592 --> 03:55:18,166
[SPEAKER_49]: And one of my concerns was the fact that it would become a very dangerous intersection, given the fact that it's at the foot of the North Street Bridge, which is very steep, and it's a truck road, and the trucks that deliver to Whole Foods, 18 Wheels, and the liquor store come down that bridge with momentum and speed.

2677
03:55:19,267 --> 03:55:25,932
[SPEAKER_49]: If anyone from the New Rockland Court presents themselves in that intersection, it would be an accident waiting to happen.

2678
03:55:27,722 --> 03:55:35,069
[SPEAKER_49]: So I am proposing, if you all didn't read my letter, that this vote not be taken tonight.

2679
03:55:36,390 --> 03:55:37,030
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

2680
03:55:37,050 --> 03:55:40,774
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't know who said they didn't receive it, but your letter was included in the packets.

2681
03:55:40,874 --> 03:55:44,697
[SPEAKER_55]: I watched Larry put them in the folders, so somebody didn't look at them.

2682
03:55:44,737 --> 03:55:46,099
[SPEAKER_49]: But did you read them prior to tonight?

2683
03:55:46,779 --> 03:55:47,160
[SPEAKER_55]: I read them.

2684
03:55:47,180 --> 03:55:47,700
[SPEAKER_55]: You did?

2685
03:55:47,960 --> 03:55:48,120
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

2686
03:55:48,140 --> 03:55:48,381
[SPEAKER_55]: I know.

2687
03:55:48,881 --> 03:55:53,025
[SPEAKER_55]: I can't speak for exactly what people have read, but I do know that the material was provided to them.

2688
03:55:54,500 --> 03:55:56,582
[SPEAKER_49]: But when is that folder provided, tonight?

2689
03:55:57,463 --> 03:55:58,864
[SPEAKER_55]: We received it last Thursday.

2690
03:55:58,884 --> 03:56:03,448
[SPEAKER_49]: All right, well, I don't know, as I said, how many of them read it.

2691
03:56:05,410 --> 03:56:09,254
[SPEAKER_49]: But the points, I don't want to go over all my points in my letter.

2692
03:56:09,594 --> 03:56:11,816
[SPEAKER_49]: If they've all read it, they understand what I'm talking about.

2693
03:56:12,785 --> 03:56:19,249
[SPEAKER_49]: but there are concerns in the neighborhood for the design that's being presented, for the size of the complex.

2694
03:56:19,869 --> 03:56:22,170
[SPEAKER_49]: We don't mind it being for affordable housing.

2695
03:56:22,471 --> 03:56:24,051
[SPEAKER_49]: We don't mind it being redone.

2696
03:56:24,732 --> 03:56:32,656
[SPEAKER_49]: We are concerned about the increase in, it's a very, you have to, I don't know if anyone's made a site visit there.

2697
03:56:32,676 --> 03:56:34,758
[SPEAKER_49]: It's one thing seeing it on paper,

2698
03:56:35,728 --> 03:56:45,211
[SPEAKER_49]: But it's another thing actually making a site visit and trying to visualize what it is that they're proposing there.

2699
03:56:45,431 --> 03:56:50,732
[SPEAKER_49]: It's really a lot for a small lot with flaws.

2700
03:56:52,593 --> 03:56:55,394
[SPEAKER_49]: So that's about all I want to say at the moment.

2701
03:56:56,004 --> 03:56:56,464
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2702
03:56:57,345 --> 03:57:00,907
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm going to go to Tom Lincoln on Zoom next.

2703
03:57:00,927 --> 03:57:06,711
[SPEAKER_55]: I also just want to say we did receive two written comments, at least I did by email.

2704
03:57:06,751 --> 03:57:08,072
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't know what the clerk received.

2705
03:57:08,652 --> 03:57:11,914
[SPEAKER_55]: One from Trees Medford regarding the $50,000 mitigation.

2706
03:57:14,716 --> 03:57:16,917
[SPEAKER_55]: They said this is an excellent first step.

2707
03:57:16,957 --> 03:57:19,517
[SPEAKER_55]: They made two points concerning the condition.

2708
03:57:20,217 --> 03:57:27,179
[SPEAKER_55]: First, that the funds be exclusively to the cost of purchasing and planting additional trees, and they'd like that to be clear in the special permit language.

2709
03:57:27,679 --> 03:57:37,442
[SPEAKER_55]: And the second, that the 50,000 represents about half of their estimated cost for mitigation, and that the Medford Housing Authority agreed to collaborate in the search for grant funds.

2710
03:57:38,322 --> 03:57:41,503
[SPEAKER_55]: Of course, it is incumbent on the city of Medford to secure full mitigation funding.

2711
03:57:42,463 --> 03:57:48,544
[SPEAKER_55]: to address the effects of climate change and the enhanced critical role of trees and climate resiliency and quality of life.

2712
03:57:49,444 --> 03:57:51,625
[SPEAKER_55]: I will go to Tom Lincoln on Zoom.

2713
03:57:52,045 --> 03:57:53,705
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please, Tom.

2714
03:57:55,946 --> 03:58:00,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street, the Owl Rizzly.

2715
03:58:00,987 --> 03:58:03,928
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of wearing the Trees Medford hat tonight.

2716
03:58:05,708 --> 03:58:10,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Council President Zach Baer stole most of our thunder here by reading the letter, but that's okay.

2717
03:58:11,656 --> 03:58:12,637
[SPEAKER_19]: moving things along here.

2718
03:58:13,938 --> 03:58:18,240
[SPEAKER_19]: First, we want to say, I think I can speak for Trees Medford when working with them on this.

2719
03:58:19,922 --> 03:58:34,351
[SPEAKER_19]: We are really happy that this project is adding so much affordable housing, which is certainly a huge societal and community need in Medford and probably just about everywhere else.

2720
03:58:36,072 --> 03:58:41,396
[SPEAKER_19]: We look forward to working further with MHA on additional

2721
03:58:42,060 --> 03:58:48,842
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, tree plantings, uh, through, uh, 82 and et cetera, uh, on the outside, uh, of, of the project.

2722
03:58:49,562 --> 03:58:52,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but it did want to reiterate a couple of things here.

2723
03:58:53,083 --> 03:59:00,385
[SPEAKER_19]: One is, um, this project, uh, this tree cutting and the tree planting is really a first instance.

2724
03:59:01,485 --> 03:59:07,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, really a test case on the city's, uh, commitment to no net loss of tree canopy.

2725
03:59:08,670 --> 03:59:10,912
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked with Aggie Tudin recently.

2726
03:59:10,972 --> 03:59:18,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't take her thunder either, but I think she's bringing out a report soon on her activities in terms of tree plantings.

2727
03:59:19,657 --> 03:59:24,500
[SPEAKER_19]: But the bottom line is that we are still behind the proverbial eight ball.

2728
03:59:24,540 --> 03:59:38,028
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you can use that expression anymore, but that is what comes to mind in terms of both the tree plantings, stump removal and tree plantings on that aspect.

2729
03:59:39,968 --> 03:59:49,435
[SPEAKER_19]: We at Trees Medford will, I'm hoping, have further proposals along these lines.

2730
03:59:50,275 --> 04:00:03,384
[SPEAKER_19]: We really think, as our letter indicates, that making up the rest of the mitigation, which was very carefully calculated based on information from MHA, thank you, Gabe,

2731
04:00:05,488 --> 04:00:14,230
[SPEAKER_19]: making up the rest of the deficit, so to speak, in terms of the trees cut, size of the trees cut versus trees planted.

2732
04:00:15,310 --> 04:00:20,231
[SPEAKER_19]: This really needs to come with help from the City of Medford.

2733
04:00:20,611 --> 04:00:23,212
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know what the tree budget is.

2734
04:00:23,412 --> 04:00:27,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm understanding it's certainly bigger than it was when I moved here 500 years ago.

2735
04:00:29,059 --> 04:00:30,740
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't 500 years ago, close to that.

2736
04:00:31,961 --> 04:00:40,288
[SPEAKER_19]: It's certainly larger than that, but it certainly has not met the actual needs in terms of catching up.

2737
04:00:40,968 --> 04:00:45,692
[SPEAKER_19]: There've been many, many street trees cut down because they were all planted at the same time.

2738
04:00:46,993 --> 04:00:56,760
[SPEAKER_19]: And there were many years, certainly I think in the late 80s and 90s, maybe beyond, which virtually no tree planting occurred.

2739
04:00:57,610 --> 04:00:58,991
[SPEAKER_19]: in Medford.

2740
04:00:59,951 --> 04:01:01,252
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're optimistic.

2741
04:01:01,712 --> 04:01:04,513
[SPEAKER_19]: We're hoping for bigger and better things here.

2742
04:01:04,533 --> 04:01:07,114
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an ongoing process.

2743
04:01:07,734 --> 04:01:15,137
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, we appreciate the efforts of the MHA in this regard.

2744
04:01:15,237 --> 04:01:15,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

2745
04:01:16,918 --> 04:01:17,878
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Mr. Lincoln.

2746
04:01:17,898 --> 04:01:19,199
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll go to the podium.

2747
04:01:19,919 --> 04:01:21,340
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

2748
04:01:23,080 --> 04:01:25,242
[SPEAKER_48]: Angela Murphy, 16 Codding Street.

2749
04:01:25,983 --> 04:01:29,465
[SPEAKER_48]: I live in the neighborhood down the street a couple blocks from Walking Court.

2750
04:01:29,585 --> 04:01:33,508
[SPEAKER_48]: I've been there 68 years when Walking Court was originally built.

2751
04:01:34,429 --> 04:01:40,553
[SPEAKER_48]: And once again, I want to reiterate what Mary Ann said, that we are not against the proposed redevelopment site.

2752
04:01:41,254 --> 04:01:49,199
[SPEAKER_48]: We are concerned with the placement of the buildings on the site and the overcrowding that it's going to cause with all these

2753
04:01:50,641 --> 04:01:53,263
[SPEAKER_48]: new residents that are going to be accommodated there.

2754
04:01:54,084 --> 04:02:03,033
[SPEAKER_48]: It's a small site if any of you have ever been there, you can see that this site can handle just so much before it gets too crowded.

2755
04:02:04,074 --> 04:02:12,982
[SPEAKER_48]: And the placement if the housing authority really cared about seniors and disabled residents that the two six story buildings will house.

2756
04:02:13,863 --> 04:02:30,654
[SPEAKER_48]: They would not place them parallel to the tracks with the back units only have an access to a view of train tracks and fumes and vibrations and noise, because knowing from experience that the condos that they built that Wellington up against the green line tracks.

2757
04:02:31,294 --> 04:02:33,357
[SPEAKER_48]: They people paid a million dollars there.

2758
04:02:33,897 --> 04:02:45,531
[SPEAKER_48]: And upon a person I know who worked in the condos, one woman complained because all she heard was noise, but yet they were guaranteed the windows would be soundproof and cut down on vibrations and things and they don't.

2759
04:02:46,661 --> 04:03:03,354
[SPEAKER_48]: So, concern for these vulnerable housebound residents looking out those windows and then they got the building, the six-story building across the other side of the tracks, that six stories are higher elevation, they're gonna be deprived most of the day of sunlight.

2760
04:03:03,734 --> 04:03:08,257
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not gonna improve these seniors, all these disabled people's quality of life.

2761
04:03:09,378 --> 04:03:17,962
[SPEAKER_48]: They're going to cut down green space, they're going to relegate the community gardens there to a corner of the lot, which is not conducive to growing anything.

2762
04:03:17,982 --> 04:03:20,743
[SPEAKER_48]: And the residents there.

2763
04:03:22,341 --> 04:03:37,932
[SPEAKER_48]: they're not gonna have sufficient parking, which is gonna overspill these vehicles into the surrounding neighborhood, because they don't account for seniors who do still drive in their 70s and 80s, such as myself and everything, having an extra car.

2764
04:03:38,392 --> 04:03:43,456
[SPEAKER_48]: They don't count for all the visitors, the family members who might drive there and visit.

2765
04:03:43,756 --> 04:03:47,398
[SPEAKER_48]: They don't count for caregivers who have to drive and park somewhere.

2766
04:03:47,739 --> 04:03:50,481
[SPEAKER_48]: They haven't made an account, in my opinion,

2767
04:03:51,201 --> 04:03:58,443
[SPEAKER_48]: any accommodations for these people and the people who are going to come to aid the residents there.

2768
04:03:59,564 --> 04:04:07,206
[SPEAKER_48]: And my thing is that we're not opposed to redeveloping it, just rethink the proposal.

2769
04:04:07,747 --> 04:04:11,088
[SPEAKER_48]: And as far as community meetings and public meetings,

2770
04:04:12,309 --> 04:04:22,486
[SPEAKER_48]: I was at a couple of those meetings, and each time I was verbally berated because I asked too many questions they didn't want to answer.

2771
04:04:24,284 --> 04:04:38,339
[SPEAKER_48]: And that was to one point where I was afraid to walk out because my vehicle was parked at Whole Foods next to the vehicle of the housing authority employee who berated me during the meeting was parked next to me.

2772
04:04:38,619 --> 04:04:43,785
[SPEAKER_48]: So I kind of held back and did not go to my cop and everything.

2773
04:04:44,165 --> 04:04:44,646
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not...

2774
04:04:46,235 --> 04:04:47,155
[SPEAKER_48]: a good plan.

2775
04:04:47,255 --> 04:04:48,436
[SPEAKER_48]: It has lots of flaws.

2776
04:04:48,576 --> 04:05:01,681
[SPEAKER_48]: If a thousand people in the surrounding community, including some residents who are afraid to voice their voice from walking court, are opposed to the placement in this proposal, they're pushing down our throats in this neighborhood.

2777
04:05:02,381 --> 04:05:03,501
[SPEAKER_48]: They need to rethink it.

2778
04:05:03,541 --> 04:05:04,342
[SPEAKER_48]: We need to be heard.

2779
04:05:04,682 --> 04:05:09,484
[SPEAKER_48]: I was on the phone two and a half hours at that meeting that Marianne was talking about.

2780
04:05:09,884 --> 04:05:11,484
[SPEAKER_48]: Not once was I unmuted.

2781
04:05:11,885 --> 04:05:14,886
[SPEAKER_48]: Not once was I recognized as being

2782
04:05:15,726 --> 04:05:24,351
[SPEAKER_48]: a public person who had, I had to write a letter and take it the next day and hand it to the development board to tell them what I wanted to say on the phone that night.

2783
04:05:25,051 --> 04:05:29,933
[SPEAKER_48]: And all they talked about was a conference or some kind of committee meeting they had to go to.

2784
04:05:30,454 --> 04:05:36,277
[SPEAKER_48]: They did not want to address anybody who may have had a comment opposing the current proposal.

2785
04:05:36,997 --> 04:05:43,801
[SPEAKER_48]: So please, I ask again, you do not vote on anything tonight considering what they're asking for.

2786
04:05:44,881 --> 04:05:53,388
[SPEAKER_48]: and tell them to reconsider and go back and look at what they proposed and see if it's the right proposal for that particular complex.

2787
04:05:54,128 --> 04:06:01,654
[SPEAKER_48]: It needs to be the beautiful, suburban, serene senior community that it was meant to be when it was built originally.

2788
04:06:02,215 --> 04:06:02,615
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

2789
04:06:03,036 --> 04:06:05,477
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2790
04:06:05,558 --> 04:06:07,939
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm going to go to Navar on Zoom.

2791
04:06:13,342 --> 04:06:20,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

2792
04:06:21,907 --> 04:06:25,268
[SPEAKER_07]: My public comment is that I support the project.

2793
04:06:26,629 --> 04:06:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be downsized.

2794
04:06:29,030 --> 04:06:36,214
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were to respond to concerns by overcrowding, by downsizing the project, that would mean you're building less housing.

2795
04:06:36,895 --> 04:06:42,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people who live there, they would, you know, they'd either be homeless, have to leave town,

2796
04:06:43,502 --> 04:06:50,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Or perhaps, ironically, they would have to actually overcrowd with more roommates in some other unit somewhere in Bedford.

2797
04:06:50,988 --> 04:06:53,290
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not really many other possibilities.

2798
04:06:54,011 --> 04:06:57,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that's the way to go.

2799
04:06:57,414 --> 04:07:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you're helping less people, you're achieving less housing, if you were to go that route.

2800
04:07:02,458 --> 04:07:08,443
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's an important project as is, and I hope the city council approves it.

2801
04:07:08,584 --> 04:07:08,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2802
04:07:12,025 --> 04:07:12,367
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2803
04:07:12,387 --> 04:07:14,617
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll go to anyone in the room who would like to speak.

2804
04:07:14,838 --> 04:07:16,606
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Cross, name and address for the record, please.

2805
04:07:19,187 --> 04:07:19,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, is that on?

2806
04:07:19,827 --> 04:07:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

2807
04:07:20,788 --> 04:07:21,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2808
04:07:21,668 --> 04:07:36,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Ken Kraus, my home is at 50 Mystic Street in Medford, about four and a half blocks from the Walkling Court, albeit on the other side of the Mystic River, Mystic Valley Parkway.

2809
04:07:36,674 --> 04:07:43,957
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanna register my support for the project as it was presented, as I did at the Community Development Board

2810
04:07:44,637 --> 04:07:52,942
[SPEAKER_14]: meeting on February 7th where the first speaker's letter was acknowledged at that meeting and summarized and shared with the board just for the record.

2811
04:07:56,180 --> 04:07:59,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Reworking of Wapping Court is decades overdue.

2812
04:07:59,381 --> 04:08:04,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the building is still in its original condition for the 1960s.

2813
04:08:05,304 --> 04:08:12,787
[SPEAKER_14]: It desperately needs to be brought up to the standards that people who live there deserve, particularly with regard to accessibility.

2814
04:08:13,007 --> 04:08:16,008
[SPEAKER_14]: As I mentioned, there's no elevators in the buildings at all.

2815
04:08:18,889 --> 04:08:37,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm especially excited about being able to add more units more affordable housing units as was mentioned, very rare community has an opportunity to do that with an existing site, especially excited about the addition of family housing as well the family component.

2816
04:08:38,357 --> 04:08:42,740
[SPEAKER_14]: which is in bad need in the affordable family units.

2817
04:08:43,261 --> 04:08:56,291
[SPEAKER_14]: And it'll add vitality and vibrancy to the neighborhood too, in a way that traditionally with complexes more geared towards seniors and people with disabilities might not have as much of.

2818
04:08:56,331 --> 04:08:57,672
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm excited about that as well.

2819
04:08:58,552 --> 04:08:59,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think the,

2820
04:09:00,974 --> 04:09:09,744
[SPEAKER_14]: issues that have been brought up are sound ones that have been taken into consideration by the developers.

2821
04:09:10,284 --> 04:09:19,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the concern about parking is a little overstated in traffic just because the nature of the people that live in these type of facilities are not particularly car dependent.

2822
04:09:19,894 --> 04:09:36,536
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that is, there's plenty of plenty of parking to accommodate the needs, though I think it would be wise to continue to find ways to accommodate people to get to and from the facility, and other means they didn't mention it but there's a large bike parking facility there for

2823
04:09:38,118 --> 04:09:47,485
[SPEAKER_14]: residents who can bike and guests as well, but look to make shuttles available to the nearby transit stations.

2824
04:09:47,825 --> 04:09:53,650
[SPEAKER_14]: We continue to advocate for the not elimination of the 94 bus that goes by there.

2825
04:09:53,970 --> 04:09:59,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So the more we can do to improve conditions for bicycling and walking and

2826
04:09:59,854 --> 04:10:04,276
[SPEAKER_14]: shuttles and other ways to get to and from the facility will be helpful.

2827
04:10:04,316 --> 04:10:09,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to register my support again and urge approval for the paper that's in front of you.

2828
04:10:10,278 --> 04:10:10,538
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

2829
04:10:10,558 --> 04:10:10,778
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

2830
04:10:10,798 --> 04:10:14,420
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm going to go to Carol on Zoom.

2831
04:10:17,221 --> 04:10:19,182
[SPEAKER_52]: Carol, name and address for the record, please.

2832
04:10:20,622 --> 04:10:22,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my name is Carol Koskulowski.

2833
04:10:22,583 --> 04:10:23,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 624 High Street.

2834
04:10:26,338 --> 04:10:27,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mindful of the time.

2835
04:10:28,559 --> 04:10:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to voice my strong support for the proposal and for the project.

2836
04:10:38,324 --> 04:10:45,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in support of both preserving and adding deeply affordable housing.

2837
04:10:45,567 --> 04:10:51,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the accessibility

2838
04:10:53,931 --> 04:10:57,477
[SPEAKER_02]: accommodations that are built into the proposal.

2839
04:10:58,539 --> 04:11:03,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it is a good move for the city of Medford.

2840
04:11:03,066 --> 04:11:06,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a unique opportunity that we should support.

2841
04:11:07,553 --> 04:11:07,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2842
04:11:10,316 --> 04:11:11,076
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Carol.

2843
04:11:11,456 --> 04:11:15,718
[SPEAKER_55]: Mary Ann, I'm going to let people who haven't spoken yet speak.

2844
04:11:15,738 --> 04:11:20,659
[SPEAKER_55]: So if there's anyone who'd like to speak in the chamber, and then there's one more person on Zoom, then I can come back to you.

2845
04:11:21,339 --> 04:11:22,520
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

2846
04:11:22,560 --> 04:11:24,860
[SPEAKER_55]: And if you could leave it with the messenger, thank you.

2847
04:11:24,880 --> 04:11:27,041
[SPEAKER_64]: Steve Dougherty, 55 Horn Avenue, Medford.

2848
04:11:27,981 --> 04:11:34,143
[SPEAKER_64]: Tonight's, as you can tell by the color I'm wearing, I wasn't here for this issue, but it looks like an interesting project.

2849
04:11:34,183 --> 04:11:39,585
[SPEAKER_64]: But given the state of the economy these days, how is this being funded?

2850
04:11:40,626 --> 04:11:41,666
[SPEAKER_64]: Can someone address that?

2851
04:11:43,467 --> 04:11:45,228
[SPEAKER_55]: That's a complicated question.

2852
04:11:47,069 --> 04:11:59,175
[SPEAKER_55]: There's a, I don't wanna speak for Jeff, but there's a lot of variety of funding, a small amount from the CPA, 800,000 of $145 million project.

2853
04:12:00,635 --> 04:12:02,576
[SPEAKER_55]: There's low income housing tax credits.

2854
04:12:02,956 --> 04:12:06,098
[SPEAKER_55]: There's some state aid, maybe some ARPA.

2855
04:12:07,239 --> 04:12:25,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know pretty much covered the rest the bulk of the money is coming from outside of Medford we've been relying on the CPA funds to get the project started in all there'll be 1.95 million of CPA funds, but for every $1 CPA funds, the housing authorities levering $58 of

2856
04:12:27,170 --> 04:12:40,345
[SPEAKER_09]: other resources primarily a combination of state and federal housing resources that will support the renovation be about $85 million in construction, but $116 million in total.

2857
04:12:44,629 --> 04:13:08,247
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a combination of federal low-income housing tax credits, Section 8 vouchers, some debt supported by the Section 8 vouchers, and as Executive Director Driscoll mentioned, we've received over $25 million of awarded funds from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to redevelop a property because of it being state public housing.

2858
04:13:08,627 --> 04:13:12,613
[SPEAKER_55]: So mostly state and federal, and it sounds like only 1 to 2% city.

2859
04:13:13,053 --> 04:13:13,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

2860
04:13:13,574 --> 04:13:13,935
[SPEAKER_55]: All right.

2861
04:13:13,955 --> 04:13:23,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the CPA was only able to fund less than 2% of this project, which I think is an ideal outcome for the use of CPA funds in terms of return to the community.

2862
04:13:24,089 --> 04:13:24,410
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

2863
04:13:28,117 --> 04:13:30,698
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm gonna go to Alex on Zoom.

2864
04:13:31,318 --> 04:13:33,618
[SPEAKER_55]: Alex, name and address for the record, please.

2865
04:13:35,299 --> 04:13:38,499
[SPEAKER_23]: Alex Lassenhop, 30 Right Ave, Medford.

2866
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:54,263
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just like to express my strong, unreserved support for this project and echo some of what Councilor Collins and other supporters, well, I won't speak for Councilor Collins, but some of what she said resonated with me as well as public commenters who have spoken up in support.

2867
04:13:55,164 --> 04:13:56,964
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an extremely rare opportunity

2868
04:13:57,682 --> 04:14:08,985
[SPEAKER_23]: that we do not often get in Medford or anywhere in the state of Massachusetts to fund the preservation and addition of deeply affordable housing units for disabled seniors and families.

2869
04:14:09,005 --> 04:14:15,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just urge the council and everyone there to take advantage of this opportunity, approve whatever is needed for this project.

2870
04:14:16,107 --> 04:14:17,787
[SPEAKER_23]: It will be a great asset to our community.

2871
04:14:17,807 --> 04:14:18,587
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

2872
04:14:20,248 --> 04:14:20,948
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Alex.

2873
04:14:22,168 --> 04:14:25,149
[SPEAKER_55]: Anyone else in the room who hasn't spoken yet on this topic, would they like to speak?

2874
04:14:26,994 --> 04:14:28,975
[SPEAKER_55]: come to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2875
04:14:28,995 --> 04:14:29,616
[SPEAKER_55]: I got two of you.

2876
04:14:30,557 --> 04:14:31,417
[SPEAKER_55]: Who wants to go first?

2877
04:14:32,018 --> 04:14:32,338
[SPEAKER_52]: All right.

2878
04:14:32,738 --> 04:14:36,101
[SPEAKER_65]: Gianna Spontanetti, 126 Lincoln Road.

2879
04:14:36,421 --> 04:14:38,222
[SPEAKER_65]: How do you expect to fund the 2%?

2880
04:14:38,743 --> 04:14:42,065
[SPEAKER_65]: Can we elaborate on that from the state?

2881
04:14:42,665 --> 04:14:43,486
[SPEAKER_65]: I mean, from the city?

2882
04:14:43,866 --> 04:14:45,808
[SPEAKER_55]: The city funds have already been approved from the CPA.

2883
04:14:46,673 --> 04:14:50,094
[SPEAKER_65]: Okay, so is that coming from the homeowner when they sell their home?

2884
04:14:50,394 --> 04:14:53,874
[SPEAKER_55]: It's the Community Preservation Committee.

2885
04:14:54,555 --> 04:14:56,655
[SPEAKER_55]: It's already done.

2886
04:14:57,115 --> 04:15:00,916
[SPEAKER_55]: It's the 1.5% CPA surcharge that's matched by state funds.

2887
04:15:00,976 --> 04:15:08,057
[SPEAKER_55]: It goes to fund affordable housing, open space and recreation, and historical preservation.

2888
04:15:08,097 --> 04:15:09,458
[SPEAKER_55]: It's been in effect for about seven years.

2889
04:15:09,478 --> 04:15:10,378
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, okay.

2890
04:15:15,775 --> 04:15:17,882
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm actually going to go to Zoom and link them back to you.

2891
04:15:18,203 --> 04:15:21,434
[SPEAKER_55]: Roberta Cameron, name and address for the record, please.

2892
04:15:24,104 --> 04:15:40,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberta Cameron, I'm at 12 North Street, and I would like to, as a very close neighbor of the Wakling Court Housing Development Project, I would like to express my full support for this project.

2893
04:15:41,675 --> 04:15:49,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is going to bring much needed improvement to the quality of life for Wakling Court residents and

2894
04:15:50,541 --> 04:16:12,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I am impressed with the community engagement that occurred during the planning of this project and I've seen how the neighborhood has been responded to in planning the project and I feel that this development really fits in

2895
04:16:14,641 --> 04:16:15,622
[SPEAKER_01]: into the neighborhood.

2896
04:16:16,022 --> 04:16:21,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate the work that went into developing the design for this project.

2897
04:16:21,406 --> 04:16:33,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it will, I'm excited by the opportunity to add additional senior and disabled and family housing to the neighborhood.

2898
04:16:33,815 --> 04:16:34,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2899
04:16:34,216 --> 04:16:36,257
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Roberta.

2900
04:16:38,059 --> 04:16:39,720
[SPEAKER_52]: Name and address for the record, please.

2901
04:16:39,740 --> 04:16:42,302
[SPEAKER_52]: And thank you for logging in with the messenger.

2902
04:16:43,829 --> 04:16:46,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Andrew Bankson, 11 Hastings Lane in Medford.

2903
04:16:47,392 --> 04:16:50,134
[SPEAKER_20]: And just real quick, I just appreciate what y'all do.

2904
04:16:50,715 --> 04:16:57,120
[SPEAKER_20]: And through all of this, it's really amazing how y'all keep your composure.

2905
04:16:57,140 --> 04:16:58,221
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty remarkable.

2906
04:16:59,061 --> 04:16:59,782
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think I could.

2907
04:17:01,503 --> 04:17:08,549
[SPEAKER_20]: So as an architect who only works in affordable and supportive housing, I strongly support this project.

2908
04:17:08,569 --> 04:17:10,130
[SPEAKER_20]: 200 and how many?

2909
04:17:10,150 --> 04:17:10,311
[SPEAKER_20]: 38 units?

2910
04:17:13,493 --> 04:17:21,196
[SPEAKER_20]: It's incredible to see that could happen in one project, and it looks like a really beautiful project.

2911
04:17:21,416 --> 04:17:25,097
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, and I support the project.

2912
04:17:25,537 --> 04:17:26,298
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you very much.

2913
04:17:27,218 --> 04:17:29,299
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

2914
04:17:29,339 --> 04:17:30,979
[SPEAKER_55]: I see Director Hunt.

2915
04:17:31,159 --> 04:17:32,560
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

2916
04:17:36,257 --> 04:17:42,543
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening Councilors, thank you very much, Alicia hunt, the director of planning development for the city of Medford.

2917
04:17:42,563 --> 04:17:57,997
[SPEAKER_34]: I just thought I would chime in, so that you have it on the record that we as the staff planners for the city feels very strongly this supports our goals and the housing production plan and our comprehensive plan.

2918
04:17:58,798 --> 04:18:11,926
[SPEAKER_34]: And this presentation didn't get into it, but we also feel that it supports our goals in climate adaptation for the city with all the very energy efficient buildings that they are going to be building as part of this project.

2919
04:18:13,387 --> 04:18:15,768
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just wanted you to have that officially.

2920
04:18:16,729 --> 04:18:26,434
[SPEAKER_34]: And then just to mention that if there's any questions about the procedures and what needs to be voted on this evening that I am available if you need any guidance on the technical piece.

2921
04:18:26,695 --> 04:18:27,035
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2922
04:18:28,015 --> 04:18:29,176
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

2923
04:18:31,899 --> 04:18:37,284
[SPEAKER_52]: Any further comment than during this public hearing on this special permit for Wakling Court?

2924
04:18:41,128 --> 04:18:41,669
[SPEAKER_52]: Mr. Ducey?

2925
04:18:46,687 --> 04:18:48,168
[SPEAKER_49]: You're introducing two non-straight.

2926
04:18:48,749 --> 04:18:50,150
[SPEAKER_49]: I just want to correct the record.

2927
04:18:51,071 --> 04:19:01,441
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. Crouse did not see my letter, so it was presumptuous to him to say it was summarized correctly in his comments that he just made.

2928
04:19:03,242 --> 04:19:05,444
[SPEAKER_49]: So I just wanted to set the record straight on that.

2929
04:19:08,960 --> 04:19:17,365
[SPEAKER_49]: and the fact that the community board acknowledged that they hadn't read the comments that were delivered to them that day.

2930
04:19:19,246 --> 04:19:28,451
[SPEAKER_49]: Even though Director Hunt basically just bullet-itemed the things that she thought should be mentioned.

2931
04:19:29,471 --> 04:19:34,674
[SPEAKER_49]: But she didn't explain them, or she didn't read them, and they didn't want the memo read to her, read to them.

2932
04:19:35,614 --> 04:19:37,956
[SPEAKER_49]: So, there it is.

2933
04:19:39,375 --> 04:19:48,381
[SPEAKER_49]: And I don't think the traffic study that was done was actually complete.

2934
04:19:48,722 --> 04:19:50,203
[SPEAKER_49]: It was only done for three days.

2935
04:19:50,223 --> 04:19:55,967
[SPEAKER_49]: And I don't think they captured enough correct information in three days.

2936
04:19:58,389 --> 04:20:01,431
[SPEAKER_49]: So I just want to make that clear.

2937
04:20:02,471 --> 04:20:02,812
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

2938
04:20:03,632 --> 04:20:04,073
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2939
04:20:05,914 --> 04:20:08,756
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comment by members in person or on Zoom?

2940
04:20:11,701 --> 04:20:14,583
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Angela Murphy 16 Carding Street.

2941
04:20:15,924 --> 04:20:27,292
[SPEAKER_48]: Once again, I want to say that from the beginning, there's only been one design proposal acceptable and presented to the residents in the abutting neighbors and the other community.

2942
04:20:28,772 --> 04:20:32,898
[SPEAKER_48]: They haven't even considered any different proposals.

2943
04:20:33,558 --> 04:20:37,384
[SPEAKER_48]: All we're saying is that we know walking court needs to be redeveloped.

2944
04:20:37,964 --> 04:20:40,568
[SPEAKER_48]: The buildings have left to deteriorate over 60 years.

2945
04:20:43,712 --> 04:20:45,253
[SPEAKER_48]: common sense to rebuild them.

2946
04:20:45,773 --> 04:20:54,539
[SPEAKER_48]: But why cannot they consider a different proposal that won't overcrowd the site won't have such a negative impact on the surrounding neighbors.

2947
04:20:54,939 --> 04:21:04,645
[SPEAKER_48]: I mean 1000 neighbors, both the mothers and surrounding neighbors in the street from winter street all the way down to almost high street in West Bedford.

2948
04:21:05,405 --> 04:21:15,809
[SPEAKER_48]: Why are a thousand neighbors who are concerned and want to reconsider another proposal to reposition the new buildings on the site?

2949
04:21:16,229 --> 04:21:21,592
[SPEAKER_48]: Can they not leave the nine buildings in the positions they are and go up two floors?

2950
04:21:22,788 --> 04:21:24,189
[SPEAKER_48]: and have some similar.

2951
04:21:24,549 --> 04:21:38,720
[SPEAKER_48]: No, they want to overhaul the area, put too many people in a small place, limit green space, limit the quality of life for the seniors and the residents in that back building along the tracks, and they don't have any regard for them at all.

2952
04:21:39,601 --> 04:21:42,643
[SPEAKER_48]: They're only proposing one set of plans.

2953
04:21:43,607 --> 04:21:44,628
[SPEAKER_48]: And it doesn't fit.

2954
04:21:45,528 --> 04:21:50,791
[SPEAKER_48]: And if you go down to the site and actually walk it and see it, you can tell.

2955
04:21:51,291 --> 04:21:54,873
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't think some of you even know what Rockland Court is, in my opinion.

2956
04:21:55,453 --> 04:22:00,055
[SPEAKER_48]: Because to tell you the truth, it's a beautiful community and always has been.

2957
04:22:01,236 --> 04:22:06,999
[SPEAKER_48]: And they proposed to build a projects there, a housing projects, not a community.

2958
04:22:08,359 --> 04:22:13,022
[SPEAKER_48]: And I'll tell you, within a year, the residents there are going to be sorry they did.

2959
04:22:15,282 --> 04:22:15,722
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2960
04:22:16,822 --> 04:22:17,663
[SPEAKER_51]: Any further comment?

2961
04:22:19,163 --> 04:22:19,863
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. Castagnetti?

2962
04:22:19,883 --> 04:22:20,523
[SPEAKER_51]: Yes, sir.

2963
04:22:21,263 --> 04:22:22,764
[SPEAKER_51]: You have some divine wisdom to share?

2964
04:22:24,144 --> 04:22:26,545
[SPEAKER_58]: Just three simple questions.

2965
04:22:26,565 --> 04:22:27,925
[SPEAKER_51]: Just name and address, just so we have it.

2966
04:22:28,245 --> 04:22:30,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Castagnetti Andrew from East Medford.

2967
04:22:31,286 --> 04:22:31,666
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2968
04:22:33,766 --> 04:22:34,566
[SPEAKER_27]: Three questions.

2969
04:22:34,946 --> 04:22:36,927
[SPEAKER_27]: What is the total cost of this project?

2970
04:22:38,676 --> 04:22:44,060
[SPEAKER_55]: Um, but to the to the city, I believe the total city contribution is 1.95 million in CPA funding.

2971
04:22:44,381 --> 04:22:45,401
[SPEAKER_55]: Uh, the total cost is 100.

2972
04:22:45,441 --> 04:22:47,423
[SPEAKER_55]: I get around 140 116,000,016 million and a total of how many units will end up.

2973
04:22:53,447 --> 04:22:53,567
[SPEAKER_52]: to 238.

2974
04:22:53,607 --> 04:22:57,731
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is strictly for Method residents, sir.

2975
04:22:58,832 --> 04:23:07,579
[SPEAKER_55]: That I'm, I can't answer I'm not sure how the public housing law works on that, but I do know that all the residents in that development have a right to return to it once it's complete.

2976
04:23:07,659 --> 04:23:11,343
[SPEAKER_58]: Is this state, federal, or local?

2977
04:23:12,412 --> 04:23:18,919
[SPEAKER_55]: It is managed by the Medford Housing Authority, but I believe this project is turning it from state public housing to federal public housing.

2978
04:23:19,319 --> 04:23:20,180
[SPEAKER_58]: I think I understand.

2979
04:23:20,220 --> 04:23:20,661
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, sir.

2980
04:23:20,701 --> 04:23:23,023
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

2981
04:23:27,428 --> 04:23:28,649
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further public comment?

2982
04:23:32,853 --> 04:23:33,153
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2983
04:23:33,193 --> 04:23:34,455
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

2984
04:23:35,981 --> 04:23:38,002
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, I'm Javier Bellini, 42 Circuit Street.

2985
04:23:38,682 --> 04:23:41,403
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was here for a different conversation.

2986
04:23:41,443 --> 04:23:45,665
[SPEAKER_31]: But in my observation, it looks like this is pretty much a done deal.

2987
04:23:45,685 --> 04:23:51,228
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think anyone's opposed to the project in itself, the concept.

2988
04:23:51,248 --> 04:23:53,189
[SPEAKER_36]: I really want to support the housing and city method.

2989
04:23:53,349 --> 04:23:56,910
[SPEAKER_36]: I really want to support seniors and those with disabilities.

2990
04:23:57,851 --> 04:24:04,034
[SPEAKER_31]: I think a limited traffic study, anybody that really knows the area, it's not,

2991
04:24:05,862 --> 04:24:11,406
[SPEAKER_33]: have trains at which, if you were walking to the Green Line from here, it's over a mile.

2992
04:24:12,666 --> 04:24:23,253
[SPEAKER_33]: From Dix to Wellington Station, we don't see people walking down the parkway in abundance to use the Orange Line and the Commuter Rail in the same station, right?

2993
04:24:24,093 --> 04:24:25,755
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't think we're gonna see that in the Green Line.

2994
04:24:26,475 --> 04:24:32,359
[SPEAKER_33]: If there are people who are not really driving, they're not gonna be getting on bicycles either, right?

2995
04:24:32,639 --> 04:24:34,040
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think

2996
04:24:35,549 --> 04:24:42,252
[SPEAKER_33]: If you have 1,100 people signing a petition in an immediate area, that's a concern.

2997
04:24:43,152 --> 04:24:43,712
[SPEAKER_33]: Is it too much?

2998
04:24:43,732 --> 04:24:46,053
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, everybody wants Rockland Court to be redeveloped.

2999
04:24:46,113 --> 04:24:47,194
[SPEAKER_33]: It's falling apart.

3000
04:24:47,894 --> 04:24:50,355
[SPEAKER_33]: I grew up in the area, and I know it, and that's the case.

3001
04:24:50,935 --> 04:24:54,597
[SPEAKER_33]: But is this a case where it's too much on a restricted site?

3002
04:24:55,959 --> 04:24:59,560
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, so we should do the project.

3003
04:25:00,100 --> 04:25:05,762
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we should consider is 238 units too much for the site to support?

3004
04:25:07,283 --> 04:25:15,926
[SPEAKER_33]: And not disregard that it will put an additional strain on traffic in the area, additional parking in the area.

3005
04:25:15,946 --> 04:25:21,728
[SPEAKER_33]: And if you have 1100 people who live in the area, we should probably pause and see what their concerns are.

3006
04:25:23,154 --> 04:25:24,174
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's just my thoughts.

3007
04:25:24,294 --> 04:25:24,654
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

3008
04:25:24,874 --> 04:25:26,415
[SPEAKER_55]: Did you register your name with the messenger?

3009
04:25:27,295 --> 04:25:27,695
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

3010
04:25:28,936 --> 04:25:31,416
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further public comment in this public hearing?

3011
04:25:35,877 --> 04:25:37,978
[SPEAKER_55]: Seeing none, the public hearing is closed.

3012
04:25:38,698 --> 04:25:41,359
[SPEAKER_55]: We have the recommendations of the Community Development Board.

3013
04:25:42,099 --> 04:25:47,480
[SPEAKER_55]: We have the request for a specific language to incorporate into the conditions from Therese Medford.

3014
04:25:48,121 --> 04:25:49,601
[SPEAKER_55]: And I will go to Vice President Collins.

3015
04:25:51,220 --> 04:25:52,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

3016
04:25:52,360 --> 04:25:53,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I would motion to, um.

3017
04:25:55,762 --> 04:26:02,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Adopt the condition to approve and adopt the conditions recommended by the Community Development Board and adopt the.

3018
04:26:03,305 --> 04:26:03,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

3019
04:26:04,785 --> 04:26:05,545
[SPEAKER_55]: I have it here.

3020
04:26:07,746 --> 04:26:16,149
[SPEAKER_55]: It's a that $50,000 mitigation payment to the city of Medford by the Medford Housing Authority will be exclusively for the cost of purchasing and

3021
04:26:23,863 --> 04:26:38,909
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, Madam Clerk, please call the roll on the motion to approve and adopt the conditions of the Community Development Board for site plan review, as well as the language around the tree mitigation.

3022

3098
04:32:16,967 --> 04:32:23,271
[SPEAKER_60]: And we spoke with some members of the Medford Board of Health and Planning Department and

[SPEAKER_60]: And the next steps of that will be discussing space, and also the possibility of doing of exploring it as a joint regional project with Somerville, Arlington, other cities.

[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Lazzaro, Council Vice President Collins planning and permitting committee.

3105

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

3106
04:33:09,966 --> 04:33:26,571
[SPEAKER_18]: At the most recent planning and permitting committee meeting, which is the second meeting of that committee, in keeping with the theme of preliminary meetings, we picked up a two-year-old paper to explore a home rule petition around rent stabilization and just cause eviction protections.

3107
04:33:26,611 --> 04:33:36,133
[SPEAKER_18]: This will be the first of many conversations that we'll have on the paper with the end result being a home rule position, not an ordinance that the city council would or could pass outright.

3108
04:33:36,274 --> 04:33:37,194
[SPEAKER_18]: So more to come on that.

[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, great 70 affirmative.

3134
04:35:21,100 --> 04:35:33,062
[SPEAKER_55]: None of the negative motion passes 24-036 resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance be resolved by Vice President Collins be resolved at the Public Health and Community Safety Committee discuss an overgrowth ordinance Vice President Collins.

3135
04:35:34,223 --> 04:35:35,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

3136
04:35:36,843 --> 04:35:44,945
[SPEAKER_18]: The idea for this ordinance came out of conversations that I had with several members of city staff and several residents over the course of last year.

3137
04:35:47,560 --> 04:35:58,649
[SPEAKER_18]: residents were complaining about specific sidewalks and residential neighborhoods that were rendered impassable by vegetation starting on private properties that have grown so long that folks couldn't walk on the sidewalk.

3138
04:35:59,170 --> 04:36:08,778
[SPEAKER_18]: I've talked about this with code enforcement, and it seems like there may be a gap in our municipal code that prevents them from having the statute that they need to do enforcement when

3139
04:36:09,258 --> 04:36:13,900
[SPEAKER_18]: the public way is impacted by plant growth, essentially, from private properties.

3140
04:36:14,280 --> 04:36:31,649
[SPEAKER_18]: So this would just be a really targeted project to make sure that there's enabling language in our code of ordinances so that code enforcement does have the ability to issue warnings and potentially tickets if need be when folks cannot travel on the public way because of stuff coming out of private property.

3141
04:36:31,669 --> 04:36:38,432
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would move the question to proceed this along to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

3142
04:36:39,119 --> 04:36:44,203
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion by Vice President Collins to refer this paper to Public Health and Community Safety Committee, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

[SPEAKER_55]: Whereas the city of Medford requires approval from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to impose a real estate transfer fee.

3160
04:37:19,565 --> 04:37:25,047
[SPEAKER_55]: And whereas 18 other communities in Massachusetts have submitted home roll petitions to impose local real estate transfer fees.

3161
04:37:25,227 --> 04:37:31,950
[SPEAKER_55]: And whereas real estate transfer fees can create a sustainable funding stream for needed housing production and affordable housing production in Medford.

3162
04:37:32,330 --> 04:37:34,811
[SPEAKER_55]: by levying a small fee on certain real estate transactions.

3163
04:37:35,291 --> 04:37:43,655
[SPEAKER_55]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Committee on Planning and Permitting meet to develop a Home Rule petition, quote, an act authorizing the City of Medford to impose a real estate transfer fee.

3164
04:37:44,075 --> 04:37:44,855
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Collins.

3165
04:37:46,576 --> 04:37:47,396
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3166
04:38:00,339 --> 04:38:12,943
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Scarpelli has invoked rule 21, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table when such action is requested by any member.

3167
04:38:13,783 --> 04:38:15,343
[SPEAKER_55]: So that is an automatic action.

3168
04:38:15,423 --> 04:38:18,564
[SPEAKER_55]: This paper is on the table for our next regular meeting. 24041.

3169
04:38:32,657 --> 04:38:38,361
[SPEAKER_55]: 24-042, resolution to discuss implementation of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.

3170
04:38:39,581 --> 04:38:47,306
[SPEAKER_55]: Be it resolved that the Planning and Permitting Committee meet with relevant city staff to discuss and evaluate the implementation and enforcement of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance 22-377.

3171
04:38:47,326 --> 04:38:48,567
[SPEAKER_55]: Vice President Collins.

3172
04:38:53,629 --> 04:38:57,194
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're talking about the housing stability notification ordinance right now.

3173
04:38:57,214 --> 04:39:00,438
[SPEAKER_55]: So if we could just clear the room, please, so we can continue the meeting.

3174
04:39:00,518 --> 04:39:00,978
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

3175
04:39:00,998 --> 04:39:07,627
[SPEAKER_37]: So this was an ordinance.

3176
04:39:12,421 --> 04:39:20,249
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an ordinance that we passed one year ago, actually just almost exactly a year ago, the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.

3177
04:39:20,569 --> 04:39:23,092
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Collins, it's still a little hard to hear me, just wait one more moment.

3178
04:39:23,432 --> 04:39:27,376
[SPEAKER_55]: We can take our conversations outside to the hall, please.

3179
04:39:34,444 --> 04:39:35,325
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Collins.

3180
04:39:35,862 --> 04:39:36,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3181
04:39:36,562 --> 04:39:41,964
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's been almost exactly a year since this council passed the housing stability notification ordinance.

3182
04:39:43,264 --> 04:39:52,287
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a pretty specific pretty limited ordinance that says when a property owner has a tenant in a building.

3183
04:39:53,948 --> 04:40:06,319
[SPEAKER_18]: The city shall develop a document that outlines just very, very basic tenants rights and resources, and the property owner renting to attendants to send that document to their tenant at the beginning or end of every lease.

3184
04:40:06,799 --> 04:40:13,985
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a document that the landlord has to create it's something that they can download off of the city website and make sure that it's conveyed to their tenant this is opposed to.

3185
04:40:15,146 --> 04:40:23,191
[SPEAKER_18]: kind of empower people with information, and hopefully answer some questions before questions come up in the landlord tenant relationship.

3186
04:40:23,671 --> 04:40:34,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said this was passed about a year ago there's been some turnover in the planning development sustainability office this is the first time we tried to do something like this in Medford so the point of this resolution is to hold a meeting.

3187
04:40:34,958 --> 04:40:46,366
[SPEAKER_18]: with Planning, Development and Sustainability staff and some others been working on this in the Office of Outreach and Prevention to check in on how gearing up for implementation and enforcement of this ordinance is going.

3188
04:40:46,406 --> 04:40:52,129
[SPEAKER_18]: There are several questions to discuss, including where are we at in terms of developing that document.

3189
04:40:52,210 --> 04:40:56,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that staff has been running it by legal and trying to get it to a place of completion.

3190
04:40:57,273 --> 04:40:59,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Then there's the matter of how to make sure that

3191
04:41:00,495 --> 04:41:02,557
[SPEAKER_18]: property owners are properly informed about this.

3192
04:41:02,697 --> 04:41:10,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we have to make sure that we're conveying this in the communication channels to make sure that people really going to hear about it.

3193
04:41:10,903 --> 04:41:12,424
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not intended to be punitive.

3194
04:41:12,524 --> 04:41:13,945
[SPEAKER_18]: This is intended to be informational.

3195
04:41:14,285 --> 04:41:21,111
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that city staff was looking at very many communications, communication channels to make sure that the folks who need to know about this do know about this.

3196
04:41:21,771 --> 04:41:25,294
[SPEAKER_18]: So the point of this meeting is to meet with city staff and say, how's it going?

3197
04:41:25,814 --> 04:41:26,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are we at in the process?

3198
04:41:27,355 --> 04:41:27,856
[SPEAKER_18]: How can we help?

3199
04:41:29,554 --> 04:41:33,737
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would move to refer this conversation to the Committee on Planning and Permitting.

3200
04:41:34,237 --> 04:41:35,538
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

3201
04:41:35,618 --> 04:41:40,140
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to the Committee on Planning and Permitting.

3202
04:41:40,461 --> 04:41:46,064
[SPEAKER_55]: Seconded by... Sorry, what was that, Emily?

3203
04:41:46,084 --> 04:41:47,445
[SPEAKER_60]: I was just seconding it.

3204
04:41:47,645 --> 04:41:48,726
[SPEAKER_60]: Can I second from Zoom?

3205
04:41:50,607 --> 04:41:50,867
[SPEAKER_55]: Great.

3206
04:41:51,547 --> 04:41:52,508
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further discussion?

3207
04:41:54,349 --> 04:41:55,530
[SPEAKER_55]: Any discussion by members of the public?

3208
04:41:57,202 --> 04:42:00,844
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3209
04:42:04,205 --> 04:42:05,125
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

3210
04:42:07,426 --> 04:42:10,568
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Callahan is absent and we can mark her absent for the remainder of the meeting.

3211
04:42:10,588 --> 04:42:12,108
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

3212
04:42:12,208 --> 04:42:12,449
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

3213
04:42:13,289 --> 04:42:13,909
[SPEAKER_55]: Do you want to speak?

3214
04:42:15,450 --> 04:42:18,731
[SPEAKER_55]: You almost missed it.

3215
04:42:18,771 --> 04:42:22,433
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Castagnetti, you can come to the podium and give your name and address for the rec.

3216
04:42:26,220 --> 04:42:27,661
[SPEAKER_52]: Hey, you leave Larry alone.

3217
04:42:27,861 --> 04:42:28,461
[SPEAKER_52]: He's my buddy.

3218
04:42:29,942 --> 04:42:31,343
[SPEAKER_27]: He hasn't had a spoke in four hours.

3219
04:42:31,403 --> 04:42:31,703
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

3220
04:42:31,723 --> 04:42:32,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Or five.

3221
04:42:34,645 --> 04:42:35,626
[SPEAKER_27]: My sympathies.

3222
04:42:36,827 --> 04:42:37,687
[SPEAKER_27]: It's more like six.

3223
04:42:38,208 --> 04:42:39,689
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a nasty habit.

3224
04:42:41,530 --> 04:42:44,011
[SPEAKER_27]: This is about housing stability, right Councilor?

3225
04:42:45,252 --> 04:42:45,512
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

3226
04:42:46,713 --> 04:42:47,514
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a problem.

3227
04:42:48,354 --> 04:42:49,155
[SPEAKER_27]: When I get out of,

3228
04:42:50,285 --> 04:42:55,529
[SPEAKER_27]: The old high school, 68, it still stands like the Coliseum.

3229
04:42:55,549 --> 04:42:59,933
[SPEAKER_27]: You have new high schools going to hell because of the leaks, no one takes care of.

3230
04:42:59,953 --> 04:43:01,234
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just sad.

3231
04:43:01,835 --> 04:43:07,319
[SPEAKER_27]: You have over 8,000 houses in this community made of wood, over 100 years old.

3232
04:43:07,719 --> 04:43:12,423
[SPEAKER_27]: Most of the immigrants bought them, and with low pay, kept them alive without leaks.

3233
04:43:12,804 --> 04:43:13,844
[SPEAKER_27]: It's sad to condemn.

3234
04:43:14,645 --> 04:43:22,930
[SPEAKER_27]: Picking more buildings like the library, the police station, the fire station cries, the new high school ain't so new anymore.

3235
04:43:23,350 --> 04:43:27,533
[SPEAKER_27]: It's sad what we did to our buildings through lack of maintenance.

3236
04:43:27,573 --> 04:43:30,495
[SPEAKER_27]: We have this problem, Houston, and it's terrible.

3237
04:43:31,135 --> 04:43:37,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, when I graduated high school, of course, my father was equivalent to sixth grade in Northern Italy.

3238
04:43:40,181 --> 04:43:43,283
[SPEAKER_27]: But I remember they were telling me that this is a

3239
04:43:45,185 --> 04:43:51,666
[SPEAKER_27]: capitalistic society and it's based on supply and demand, nothing to do with our president.

3240
04:43:52,506 --> 04:43:53,927
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just the way it is.

3241
04:43:54,907 --> 04:44:06,449
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can't understand how we have such a housing crisis and a shortage of houses if supply and demand usually dictates when they're gonna build.

3242
04:44:07,089 --> 04:44:10,890
[SPEAKER_27]: Something is amiss, maybe government has to be more involved.

3243
04:44:11,850 --> 04:44:12,450
[SPEAKER_27]: It's sad.

3244
04:44:13,669 --> 04:44:22,218
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, some of us here are paying over $1,000 in rent, maybe $2,000, maybe we go to three, maybe it's four.

3245
04:44:28,626 --> 04:44:29,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Since I'm around five.

3246
04:44:29,166 --> 04:44:29,827
[SPEAKER_27]: It's horrible.

3247
04:44:30,167 --> 04:44:32,009
[SPEAKER_27]: You're gonna be making tons of cash.

3248
04:44:32,449 --> 04:44:33,130
[SPEAKER_27]: It's terrible.

3249
04:44:33,690 --> 04:44:34,891
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel bad for people.

3250
04:44:35,492 --> 04:44:36,953
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't even afford my cigarettes.

3251
04:44:37,113 --> 04:44:38,954
[SPEAKER_27]: Camels are $18 a pack.

3252
04:44:39,495 --> 04:44:40,896
[SPEAKER_27]: I won't tell you it was 28 cents.

3253
04:44:41,216 --> 04:44:43,178
[SPEAKER_27]: 28 cents went to Dr. Nolkemar in 1962.

3254
04:44:43,558 --> 04:44:45,920
[SPEAKER_27]: You really care about us?

3255
04:44:46,220 --> 04:44:48,062
[SPEAKER_27]: If we ever quit smoking, they want us to quit.

3256
04:44:48,422 --> 04:44:50,824
[SPEAKER_27]: We'd have to redo a prop two and a half override.

3257
04:44:51,905 --> 04:44:52,486
[SPEAKER_27]: Get my drift?

3258
04:44:53,086 --> 04:44:55,168
[SPEAKER_27]: But anyways, I have a solution.

3259
04:44:55,308 --> 04:44:57,870
[SPEAKER_27]: I brought this up when you had 50, 60 people

3260
04:44:58,649 --> 04:45:09,655
[SPEAKER_27]: When they were being evicted, the developer bought the apartment building behind Gaffey's Funeral, it used to be called, Captain Isaac Hall's house back in 1776.

3261
04:45:11,596 --> 04:45:13,717
[SPEAKER_27]: And they were upset, and I don't blame them.

3262
04:45:14,277 --> 04:45:19,600
[SPEAKER_27]: After so many years of paying short rent, five, 600 bucks, and they were on the street.

3263
04:45:19,900 --> 04:45:22,482
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what happened to these people, but they came here that night.

3264
04:45:22,762 --> 04:45:27,825
[SPEAKER_27]: You might remember, Councilor, through the chair, Councilor K. Collins.

3265
04:45:28,860 --> 04:45:34,122
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we have an expression in Northern Italy, saying, la punda més que la crida.

3266
04:45:35,683 --> 04:45:41,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Translation is, on the first of the month, who's laughing and who's crying?

3267
04:45:42,537 --> 04:45:52,603
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, but if you don't get in on the action, and I don't have the stones to do so myself until I finally pull the trigger, it's hard to get into the game.

3268
04:45:52,943 --> 04:46:00,627
[SPEAKER_27]: When you're talking, you need three, $400,000 salary in order to qualify for a damn mortgage at a million plus.

3269
04:46:01,367 --> 04:46:01,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Am I wrong?

3270
04:46:06,950 --> 04:46:07,611
[SPEAKER_55]: You're making $1,700,000.

3271
04:46:07,671 --> 04:46:09,332
[SPEAKER_55]: All right, we're gonna keep it here, thank you.

3272
04:46:13,055 --> 04:46:14,776
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

3273
04:46:14,836 --> 04:46:15,017
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

3274
04:46:16,057 --> 04:46:17,619
[SPEAKER_55]: Andrew, if you could just direct your comments to the chair.

3275
04:46:17,979 --> 04:46:19,941
[SPEAKER_27]: I couldn't help I get it from the gallery.

3276
04:46:20,101 --> 04:46:20,481
[SPEAKER_55]: I hear you.

3277
04:46:20,581 --> 04:46:21,282
[SPEAKER_55]: And I apologize.

3278
04:46:21,322 --> 04:46:22,122
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my job.

3279
04:46:22,383 --> 04:46:22,823
[SPEAKER_27]: I apologize.

3280
04:46:22,983 --> 04:46:23,724
[SPEAKER_27]: My job usually.

3281
04:46:24,024 --> 04:46:24,284
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

3282
04:46:24,825 --> 04:46:31,230
[SPEAKER_27]: So anyways, I have a solution, which I brought up after I said, Oh, well, who cries?

3283
04:46:32,267 --> 04:46:36,330
[SPEAKER_27]: And I mentioned it, it happens in New York City all the time.

3284
04:46:36,690 --> 04:46:46,277
[SPEAKER_27]: For decades, I don't know of one building in this Boston area that uses the co-op ownership method.

3285
04:46:47,238 --> 04:46:48,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you understand what I'm talking about now?

3286
04:46:50,083 --> 04:46:56,045
[SPEAKER_27]: No, anyways, I brought you, don't get offended, the New York Post.

3287
04:46:56,145 --> 04:46:57,905
[SPEAKER_27]: It's December's issue.

3288
04:46:58,445 --> 04:47:07,007
[SPEAKER_27]: I wrote here, save C page 33, which is right there, for City Councilor Kit Collins.

3289
04:47:07,928 --> 04:47:09,728
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm gonna make you get up for a change.

3290
04:47:10,228 --> 04:47:11,268
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you give this to her please?

3291
04:47:11,529 --> 04:47:13,549
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a story, it's a story.

3292
04:47:13,749 --> 04:47:14,809
[SPEAKER_27]: Now he needs the exercise.

3293
04:47:14,889 --> 04:47:16,030
[SPEAKER_27]: Let him do his job.

3294
04:47:16,130 --> 04:47:16,870
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, let him do his job.

3295
04:47:17,662 --> 04:47:22,724
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a story kit about co-op ownership in New York City.

3296
04:47:24,025 --> 04:47:33,109
[SPEAKER_27]: In a nutshell, I'm guesstimating with my six-year education that you have a million-dollar condo, which means you get to make $300,000 in order to afford it, right?

3297
04:47:33,870 --> 04:47:46,516
[SPEAKER_27]: Instead of you paying a million dollars for a condominium in Medford or Allentown or anywhere, with a co-op ownership, you will have that same square footage, around a thousand's average,

3298
04:47:47,551 --> 04:47:51,092
[SPEAKER_27]: for a third of the million, $233,000.

3299
04:47:51,432 --> 04:47:52,613
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a co-op ownership.

3300
04:47:53,553 --> 04:47:57,155
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't own it totally, you own shares.

3301
04:47:57,775 --> 04:47:59,776
[SPEAKER_27]: The price stays the same for decades.

3302
04:48:00,336 --> 04:48:00,676
[SPEAKER_27]: Good night.

3303
04:48:01,476 --> 04:48:02,517
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

3304
04:48:04,657 --> 04:48:11,300
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to refer to the subcommittee on planning, or the planning and permitting committee.

3305
04:48:12,860 --> 04:48:14,041
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3306

[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Fiennes?

3319
04:48:34,323 --> 04:48:34,663
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

3320
04:48:34,763 --> 04:48:36,423
[SPEAKER_55]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

3321
04:48:36,823 --> 04:48:37,603
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

3322
04:48:37,623 --> 04:48:40,104
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Vice Chair, if you would take the chair for my paper.

3323
04:48:45,541 --> 04:48:47,023
[SPEAKER_37]: No problem.

3324
04:48:47,123 --> 04:48:47,523
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3325
04:49:15,953 --> 04:49:17,535
[SPEAKER_18]: City clerk.

3326
04:49:17,555 --> 04:49:22,299
[SPEAKER_18]: 24045 offered by as various council president resolution regarding scheduled annual budget process for FY 2025.

3327
04:49:22,359 --> 04:49:27,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the council president request City

3328
04:49:33,410 --> 04:49:36,731
[SPEAKER_18]: for consideration in a Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, March 6, 2024.

3329
04:49:37,971 --> 04:49:48,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that, based on the schedule included in the soon-to-be finalized budget ordinance, the City Council and City Administration will follow the budget schedule for the FY 2025 City Budget.

3330
04:49:49,015 --> 04:49:56,597
[SPEAKER_18]: By March 1, 2024, City Councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration by Administration and Finance Committee,

3331
04:49:57,995 --> 04:50:03,902
[SPEAKER_18]: By Friday, March 22nd, 2024, City Council submits collective budget recommended to the mayor.

3332
04:50:05,464 --> 04:50:12,131
[SPEAKER_18]: From April 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2024, City Council holds preliminary budget meetings with department heads.

3333
04:50:13,553 --> 04:50:18,759
[SPEAKER_18]: By Friday, May 31st, 2024, mayor submits comprehensive budget proposal to the City Council.

3334
04:50:19,684 --> 04:50:20,124
[SPEAKER_18]: president bears.

3335
04:50:20,404 --> 04:50:22,045
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Madam President.

3336
04:50:22,065 --> 04:50:32,151
[SPEAKER_55]: Uh, resolution is pretty self explanatory, but one of the things we've been working on in the former ordinances and rules and now the administration and Finance Committee, um.

3337
04:50:33,604 --> 04:50:35,886
[SPEAKER_55]: is the budget ordinance.

3338
04:50:35,927 --> 04:50:40,111
[SPEAKER_55]: And the framework of the budget ordinance has us working on the budget significantly earlier than we normally would.

3339
04:50:40,671 --> 04:50:44,135
[SPEAKER_55]: We'll have it submitted to us in final form as it says here by May 31st.

3340
04:50:44,935 --> 04:50:51,542
[SPEAKER_55]: But also having preliminary budget meetings between April 15th and May 15th before the budget is released, which is new.

3341
04:50:52,103 --> 04:50:54,845
[SPEAKER_55]: So we will have input before the budget comes out.

3342
04:50:56,667 --> 04:51:03,290
[SPEAKER_55]: and then we can hold further meetings in June as we decide at our discretion of different departments after the budget comes out.

3343
04:51:04,551 --> 04:51:13,275
[SPEAKER_55]: But I wanted to make sure, just realizing that we're coming up against it, we're not gonna have the ordinance passed, but we agreed in principle to follow the timeline within the ordinance for this budget cycle.

3344
04:51:13,815 --> 04:51:20,439
[SPEAKER_55]: So that requires us to get going pretty soon, March 1, if councilors have budget recommendations,

3345
04:51:21,099 --> 04:51:23,981
[SPEAKER_55]: that they would like to send in for consideration.

3346
04:51:24,741 --> 04:51:27,663
[SPEAKER_55]: Please send those to the city clerk who will submit it.

3347
04:51:28,344 --> 04:51:29,244
[SPEAKER_55]: There's a typo in here.

3348
04:51:29,304 --> 04:51:30,065
[SPEAKER_55]: I apologize.

3349
04:51:30,525 --> 04:51:37,870
[SPEAKER_55]: It should say under by March 1st 2024 city councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration by committee of the whole.

3350
04:51:38,450 --> 04:51:41,212
[SPEAKER_55]: So if we could amend the paper to reflect that.

3351
04:51:42,472 --> 04:51:46,474
[SPEAKER_55]: We will then have a meeting on March 6th regarding those recommendations.

3352
04:51:47,815 --> 04:52:00,041
[SPEAKER_55]: We can have further meetings as needed with our deadline of submitting them to the mayor by March 22nd, and then having preliminary meetings from April 15th to May 15th with the deputants of the various departments.

3353
04:52:01,650 --> 04:52:04,852
[SPEAKER_55]: before the mayor submits the comprehensive budget proposal on May 31st.

3354
04:52:04,972 --> 04:52:11,815
[SPEAKER_55]: So I think this is a significant upgrade to the past where we've gotten budgets at the end of the day.

3355
04:52:11,915 --> 04:52:12,976
[SPEAKER_55]: We haven't had consideration.

3356
04:52:13,016 --> 04:52:13,656
[SPEAKER_55]: We haven't had meetings.

3357
04:52:13,696 --> 04:52:15,217
[SPEAKER_55]: We haven't had the time to ask questions.

3358
04:52:15,677 --> 04:52:16,838
[SPEAKER_55]: We certainly haven't had our

3359
04:52:17,778 --> 04:52:21,900
[SPEAKER_55]: recommendations duly considered before the budget was released.

3360
04:52:21,960 --> 04:52:26,781
[SPEAKER_55]: So I invite all councillors to submit and we can discuss it.

3361
04:52:26,841 --> 04:52:41,007
[SPEAKER_55]: And I am continually hopeful that the administration will meet us where we are on this and help us have a much more robust budget process over four months of where in the past it has happened in four weeks or less.

3362
04:52:41,647 --> 04:52:41,927
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

3363
04:52:43,690 --> 04:52:45,230
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

3364
04:52:45,791 --> 04:52:47,631
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Madam Chair, Vice President.

3365
04:52:48,371 --> 04:52:51,052
[SPEAKER_36]: Appreciate the effort Councilor Bears.

3366
04:52:51,112 --> 04:53:01,415
[SPEAKER_36]: I know that as the mayor talked to you about what the fiscal outlook so far, I mean, is it something that are we looking to?

3367
04:53:02,685 --> 04:53:12,576
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't want to make these, you know, when you look at going through this exercise, I think it's super important because it's a step closer to where we want to be and what we haven't done.

3368
04:53:13,197 --> 04:53:15,019
[SPEAKER_36]: But I also realize that

3369
04:53:16,365 --> 04:53:27,808
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't want to make it a dog and pony show, or go through the process and look and see what I want to request when we're hearing that we're already 2.4 in the hole, 2.5 in the hole in the school department.

3370
04:53:27,848 --> 04:53:32,629
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think it's a good idea.

3371
04:53:32,649 --> 04:53:35,670
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm going to follow through with the requests that I'll have.

3372
04:53:35,730 --> 04:53:40,292
[SPEAKER_36]: But from what I'm hearing on the state side,

3373
04:53:42,515 --> 04:53:45,278
[SPEAKER_36]: Our governor isn't giving a rosy picture of what we'll be getting.

3374
04:53:45,959 --> 04:53:50,004
[SPEAKER_36]: And without ARP ARESA, it just, it's frightening right now.

3375
04:53:50,024 --> 04:53:51,466
[SPEAKER_36]: I think people need to realize that.

3376
04:53:52,107 --> 04:53:56,512
[SPEAKER_36]: But again, what I, what I do appreciate is something that we've talked about for years here.

3377
04:53:57,675 --> 04:53:59,617
[SPEAKER_36]: especially when we talk about neighboring communities.

3378
04:53:59,777 --> 04:54:11,810
[SPEAKER_36]: I've been in my process personally with my department for the last two months and making sure that our council gets that information so they can make reasonable decisions.

3379
04:54:11,870 --> 04:54:14,052
[SPEAKER_36]: So I applaud your effort with that.

3380
04:54:14,112 --> 04:54:14,573
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you.

3381
04:54:23,956 --> 04:54:30,078
[SPEAKER_55]: Just to that question, had some conversations there has not been numbers included those conversations.

3382
04:54:30,918 --> 04:54:44,342
[SPEAKER_55]: My understanding is that we are still in a similar place to where we were a year ago with what we were discussing the fiscal 24 budget that fiscal 25 was going to be a cliff year with the ARPA and ESSER funding.

3383
04:54:46,525 --> 04:54:47,746
[SPEAKER_55]: I completely understand your point.

3384
04:54:47,766 --> 04:54:54,531
[SPEAKER_55]: I think my first hope is we can come up with our initial recommendations and then have discussions while we start to get the information from the mayor.

3385
04:54:54,551 --> 04:55:00,075
[SPEAKER_55]: I have heard from several department heads that they did get requests to start putting together their budget.

3386
04:55:00,656 --> 04:55:03,198
[SPEAKER_55]: Library trustees had a meeting with the mayor last week.

3387
04:55:03,218 --> 04:55:06,020
[SPEAKER_55]: So I think we're seeing some movement there.

3388
04:55:07,001 --> 04:55:09,303
[SPEAKER_55]: I think personally, it's just my philosophy.

3389
04:55:10,780 --> 04:55:32,239
[SPEAKER_55]: know we all know that we we've had a million times agreed we need five people for a sidewalk crew or whatever you know we know they're probably not going to happen this year but i think it's important to let people know we need it that's just my philosophy but i think more importantly uh if there are positions that are federal funded ARPA funded ESSER funded that we say are like we can't be losing this one those are the kinds of recommendations we may be in that kind of year like

3390
04:55:32,799 --> 04:55:34,400
[SPEAKER_55]: we really need one to stay on.

3391
04:55:35,401 --> 04:55:43,466
[SPEAKER_55]: And that's a tough, you know, obviously we don't wanna be picking and choosing it, but if that's where we are, that may be the kind of recommendation.

3392
04:55:43,846 --> 04:55:47,789
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd much rather be making a recommendation to do something new than save something we already have.

3393
04:55:47,889 --> 04:55:50,710
[SPEAKER_55]: But that's, I think that should be considered as part of this process as well.

3394
04:55:50,730 --> 04:55:57,415
[SPEAKER_55]: If there's a position or a program that any councilor identifies that is, you know, we really would like to keep it going.

3395
04:55:57,915 --> 04:55:59,976
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we amend that this just if we can.

3396
04:56:00,096 --> 04:56:13,981
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, because I think that if we can ask the city administration for the positions that are funded by opera that we possibly lose because the rumor is that the buzz around the city hall was Penelope's position, even though she left.

3397
04:56:14,841 --> 04:56:19,742
[SPEAKER_36]: was part of ARPA, and I think the fear of not being rehired might have played an impact.

3398
04:56:19,782 --> 04:56:27,083
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know if that's true, but, you know, these things that we want to get, you know, if we can get that to understand that's to your point, it'll be good to move this forward.

3399
04:56:27,103 --> 04:56:27,643
[SPEAKER_55]: So thank you.

3400
04:56:27,903 --> 04:56:31,764
[SPEAKER_55]: I accept the amendment happily to request the list of ARPA positions.

3401
04:56:37,365 --> 04:56:38,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any other comments from my fellow councillors?

3402
04:56:40,426 --> 04:56:42,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Any members of the public that would like to speak on this paper?

3403
04:56:46,555 --> 04:56:48,637
[SPEAKER_64]: Steve Darby, 55 Horn Avenue Mass.

3404
04:56:48,657 --> 04:57:00,644
[SPEAKER_64]: I don't know if it's directly related, but when you mentioned the budget, since as of four o'clock tomorrow, or four o'clock today, the fire department doesn't have a chief.

3405
04:57:00,964 --> 04:57:03,106
[SPEAKER_64]: Who's going to submit the budget for the fire department?

3406
04:57:09,790 --> 04:57:10,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3407
04:57:11,991 --> 04:57:14,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no further comment on the motion of

3408
04:57:15,486 --> 04:57:20,067
[SPEAKER_18]: President Bears as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3431
04:58:13,940 --> 04:58:19,043
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there any public participation on any topic that anyone would like to talk about?

3432
04:58:19,644 --> 04:58:23,847
[SPEAKER_55]: We get esoteric here sometimes, thanks to some of our guests.

3433
04:58:24,207 --> 04:58:27,789
[SPEAKER_55]: Some of y'all have been waiting forever, so just feel free to let it all out.

3434
04:58:29,371 --> 04:58:30,832
[SPEAKER_55]: We do have a hand on Zoom.

3435
04:58:31,612 --> 04:58:36,696
[SPEAKER_55]: Alyssa, I would ask that you, I will unmute you, but please give your name and address for the record, please.

3436
04:58:45,842 --> 04:58:48,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Alyssa Scott, 132 Monument Street.

3437
04:58:49,765 --> 04:59:08,736
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't normally attend these meetings, but I attended because someone had posted on a social media page that there would be discussions around rent stabilization, discussions around rent control and transfer fees.

3438
04:59:08,776 --> 04:59:12,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that is on the docket for discussion at some point?

3439
04:59:12,399 --> 04:59:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that's already in

3440
04:59:14,460 --> 04:59:16,721
[SPEAKER_00]: and play, it's sort of hard to follow as a layman.

3441
04:59:18,281 --> 04:59:23,143
[SPEAKER_55]: Transfer fee was on the agenda, but it was postponed to our next regular meeting on March 12th.

3442
04:59:24,044 --> 04:59:31,766
[SPEAKER_55]: Discussions on rent stabilization and other tenant rights and tenant protections is currently in the planning and permitting committee.

3443
04:59:31,787 --> 04:59:34,648
[SPEAKER_55]: Do you have a date for the next discussion on that?

3444
04:59:35,828 --> 04:59:36,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Not confirmed.

3445
04:59:36,848 --> 04:59:41,570
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, so it is in planning and permitting, but we do not have a confirmed date for the next discussion on those items.

3446
04:59:42,330 --> 04:59:43,091
[SPEAKER_37]: That's correct.

3447
04:59:43,471 --> 04:59:43,751
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3448
04:59:44,909 --> 04:59:45,369
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

3449
04:59:46,350 --> 04:59:47,511
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comment?

3450
04:59:47,531 --> 04:59:49,633
[SPEAKER_55]: We have Mike Kroll.

3451
04:59:50,854 --> 04:59:52,435
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record, please.

3452
04:59:53,676 --> 04:59:56,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, Mike Kroll, 32 Right Ave.

3453
04:59:57,038 --> 05:00:06,266
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually was attending for the same reason, so a little disappointed that now that it is, what, after midnight to find that we won't be speaking about those topics.

3454
05:00:09,251 --> 05:00:16,219
[SPEAKER_24]: how will it be best to keep track of when those discussions will be had in front of the City Council?

3455
05:00:17,290 --> 05:00:20,292
[SPEAKER_55]: So the city council meets every Tuesday and Wednesday.

3456
05:00:21,112 --> 05:00:24,575
[SPEAKER_55]: Generally, there are some exceptions to that, holidays, et cetera.

3457
05:00:26,196 --> 05:00:30,819
[SPEAKER_55]: And our agendas are available at medfordma.org for the planning and permitting committee.

3458
05:00:30,979 --> 05:00:34,841
[SPEAKER_55]: That meeting is every second and fourth Wednesday at 6 p.m.

3459
05:00:35,321 --> 05:00:40,325
[SPEAKER_55]: So that is where the rent stabilization petition is currently under consideration.

3460
05:00:41,045 --> 05:00:43,167
[SPEAKER_55]: however, no confirmed date for the next meeting.

3461
05:00:43,848 --> 05:00:48,151
[SPEAKER_55]: And for the transfer fee, that will be on the agenda for our March 12th regular meeting.

3462
05:00:50,193 --> 05:00:51,194
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, thank you very much.

3463
05:00:54,396 --> 05:00:54,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it is.

3464
05:00:57,699 --> 05:00:58,900
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comments?

3465
05:00:59,300 --> 05:01:01,462
[SPEAKER_55]: Yeah, exactly.

3466
05:01:02,183 --> 05:01:03,064
[SPEAKER_55]: Any further comment?

3467
05:01:04,024 --> 05:01:05,085
[SPEAKER_55]: Probably participation.

3468
05:01:05,145 --> 05:01:07,688
[SPEAKER_55]: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

3469
05:01:09,045 --> 05:01:11,867
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion by Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by?

3470
05:01:12,948 --> 05:01:16,310
[SPEAKER_55]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

3471
05:01:17,270 --> 05:01:20,453
[SPEAKER_55]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll one last time.

3472
05:01:20,593 --> 05:01:21,513
[SPEAKER_55]: Bring it home, baby.

[SPEAKER_54]: No, five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

[SPEAKER_54]: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
