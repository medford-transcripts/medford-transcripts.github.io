    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4.383s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4.843s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=7.084s">My</a>  name is Emily Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=8.544s">I</a>  am the chair of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=11.985s">Let</a>  me update my name real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=21.727s">And</a>  welcome to this evening's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=24.747s">I'm</a>  going to call the meeting to order, and we're going to begin with some obligatory procedural matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=30.592s">This</a>  hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=35.973s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=50.362s">A</a>  reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=61.249s">If</a>  despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=70.234s">A</a>  reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=78.267s">Please</a>  know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=87.37s">Clicking</a>  on current CD board filings and Danielle or Alicia or another member of the staff will drop the link in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=98.735s">I'm</a>  going to start with roll call attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=102.076s">Peter</a>  Calves?</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=104.557s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=106.141s">Hi,</a>  Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=107.602s">Ari</a>  Goffman-Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=109.103s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=110.264s">Hi,</a>  Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=111.925s">Sabrina</a>  Alpino? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=116.127s">Adam</a>  Behrens? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=120.87s">Annie</a>  Strang?</p>

    <p>[Ayni Strang]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=122.151s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=123.732s">Ben</a>  LaValle? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=127.554s">And</a>  myself, Chair Emily Hedeman, is also present. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=131.237s">Danielle,</a>  can you introduce any staff on the call, please?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=142.003s">Yes,</a>  myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=146.988s">I</a>  also have Director Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=152.535s">And</a>  I also have Sal DiStefano, our Director of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=157.24s">And</a>  I believe that is everyone from the City this evening.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=163.634s">Great,</a>  glad to have you all on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=166.335s">And</a>  then before we get into our first agenda item, I did want to do a quick plug because we have so many members of the public here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=172.958s">I</a>  recognize some names and faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=176.279s">So</a>  I know that these are some very, very engaged members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=182.721s">I</a>  wanted to make a plug for vacancies on various boards and commissions in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=190.516s">Selfishly,</a>  I think the Community Development Board is a great opportunity for people to kind of give back to their city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=198.58s">It</a>  is a paid position, you know, it's a nominal fee, but if you have any experience in law, real estate, transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=210.946s">housing,</a>  public service, economic development, really anything that kind of touches the built environment, the Community Development Board is a really great opportunity for you to serve and give back to your community and really kind of plug in to the larger Medford ecosystem. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=230.421s">So</a>  I'm dropping two links in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=235.562s">One</a>  is the recent publication or Medford News article <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=243.842s">mentioning</a>  the various vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=245.462s">So</a>  you'll see it's not just the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=248.503s">And</a>  then the other one is a website where you can apply to be on one of those boards or commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=256.765s">And</a>  all the board members that you see on this call have gone through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=262.346s">I</a>  applied as soon as I moved to Medford, because I'm very passionate about public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=266.587s">I</a>  got a call maybe a couple months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=269.348s">I</a>  went through a quick interview process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=273.809s">And</a>  then within a couple weeks, you know, was on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=277.692s">So,</a>  you know, it's not a really intensive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=282.115s">But</a>  I encourage everybody to do what they can, especially in these interesting times to give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=291.021s">And</a>  I'll get off that soapbox for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=296.128s">So</a>  the first item we have on our agenda is the Bridal Path Subdivision Covenant Approval and Endorsement of Subdivision Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=303.553s">Danielle,</a>  would you mind introducing this agenda item? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=307.176s">And</a>  then we'll pass it on to Attorney Desmond.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=312.099s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=313.94s">As</a>  you recall, you approved a definitive subdivision for the Bridal Path subdivision off of Franklin Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=324.628s">The</a>  certificate of approval was filed in the city clerk's office there are no appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=329.551s">So</a>  now, before you can endorse the plan to be recorded the registry of deeds, we need to have, you know, approve a form of surety that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=344.614s">Guarantees</a>  that the the road will be done, you know in case it goes belly-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=347.635s">So</a>  the the surety that they are proposing is a covenant and it's been reviewed by our legal counsel So I we don't have any issues with that so I would recommend that you vote to approve that authorize a director hunt to sign on your behalf and then <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=372.775s">endorse</a>  the plan and authorize Director Hunt to sign that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=378.082s">I</a>  believe that Attorney Desmond representing the applicant has some more to add regarding some <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=390.244s">stuff</a>  that is out of my wheelhouse with trustees and legalese and I'll let her go into that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=397.446s">Attorney</a>  Desmond, if you would.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=399.146s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=399.587s">So</a>  the covenant before you essentially prohibits the applicant or the owner from building on any of the lots or having any of the lots released until such time as the roadway is in place or the or the board <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=412.631s">decides</a>  that they will allow for some lots to be released. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=417.012s">In</a>  terms of the document itself, the only issue in council for the city has reviewed it, and we have no objection to the obligations within that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=425.635s">However,</a>  paragraph 13, which deals with the trustees, the owners of the trust, and their authority to act under the trust, the seller's attorney, and this is a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=440.58s">My</a>  client, who's the applicant, doesn't own the property as of yet, so what's going to occur is that the covenant and the subdivision plan are going to go on record and then the deed will go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=453.711s">and</a>  then the mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=455.732s">The</a>  Seller's Council has requested that he be permitted to, in the place of paragraph 13, prepare a separate document which globally deals with the trustee's authority to both convey the property and also to sign the covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=472.103s">That</a>  hasn't been resolved as between council yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=475.645s">but</a>  it doesn't impact the obligations with respect to the covenant of the parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=481.486s">So</a>  what would occur is either this language would stay in in paragraph 13 or alternatively there would be a document drafted by Seller's Council, what's called the trustee, which outlines that trustees have authority under the document and have been directed by the beneficiaries and the remaining trustees to sign the covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=505.447s">And</a>  that would be in the document that also recites that the trust authority to convey the property to my client. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=514.935s">I'd</a>  prefer to do one document than to have two separate documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=521.06s">So</a>  that request has been put before counsel for KP Law to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=526.325s">We</a>  haven't got a response on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=527.826s">But</a>  with respect to everything else in the covenant, we're in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=533.137s">And</a>  I think the board could approve it because they are going to have to, even to record the covenant or the deed, you're going to have to have what's called the trustee certificate, which sets forth the authority of the trust and the trustees.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=549.552s">So</a>  what I'm hearing is we could approve the covenant as it's written now, and then you would come back for the modification.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=558.662s">No,</a>  it would either be in the language in paragraph 13 would either be in this document or Sellers requested that he be permitted to do what's called the trustee certificate which would have the same language but it would be a second document that is just another rather than having it in paragraph 13 his clients would be signing what's called the trustee certificate and it would have the same language within that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=586.585s">And</a>  it was subject to Attorney Stein's approval, KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=590.427s">I</a>  see your hand.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=591.568s">Do</a>  you have any insight here? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=594.809s">Yes,</a>  Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=595.87s">I</a>  would add what Attorney Desmond just said, that to approve it pending legal counsel's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=604.574s">So</a>  if they're okay with that, then <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=612.603s">we</a>  would, you could direct Alicia to sign it, but if they're not okay with it, then we'll come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=617.907s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=621.649s">I</a>  know we weren't planning on having a board discussion on this item, but just curious, Peter, Ari, Annie, if there's any kind of initial reactions to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=632.577s">It</a>  sounds fine to me if there's a motion with a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=636.579s">Oh,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=640.615s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=641.796s">I</a>  was going to just say add on everything seems seems fine to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=646.119s">And</a>  so in that case, I'll move to do we need to approve it or is it kind of an authorized?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=658.069s">It's</a>  approved the covenant pending Casey law, KP law, excuse me, approval and authorizing Alicia to sign on behalf of the board.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=669.778s">Then</a>  in that case, I'll make a motion approving the covenant pending the approval of City Legal Counsel and authorizing Director Hunt to sign the covenant on behalf of the board.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=687.011s">Can</a>  I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=690.654s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=692.955s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=696.518s">We're</a>  going to do a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=698.781s">Peter</a>  calls.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=700.081s">Hi.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=701.282s">Ari</a>  Goffman Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=702.842s">Hi,</a>  Annie Strang. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=705.303s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=706.243s">And</a>  I am Lee Hedeman am also an eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=709.545s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=710.645s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Desmond.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=778.482s">And</a>  I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=781.964s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=783.145s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=785.467s">And</a>  thanks, Danielle, for <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=787.813s">making</a>  sure we completed that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=793.175s">All</a>  right, so we may have had additional people join the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=799.137s">So</a>  I'm just going to make another quick plug while we have engaged and excited members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=807.299s">You</a>  too can serve on the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=809.7s">There</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=813.848s">Current</a>  vacancies, there will be vacancies starting July 1st, I believe, on this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=821.711s">There</a>  are also other boards and commissions that have vacancies in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=826.453s">So</a>  for those of you that have the capacity, time, family, health, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=833.435s">mental</a>  load or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=834.656s">I</a>  encourage you to look at the boards and commissions that have vacancies in the city of Medford to see how you too can contribute to making Medford more of the wonderful place that we all love to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=848.324s">All</a>  right, back off that soapbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=853.587s">I</a>  promise I won't go back up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=857.189s">And</a>  I just want to set the tone for this public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=862.865s">We</a>  are not planning to vote on this agenda item this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=866.986s">We're</a>  planning to hear from our zoning consultant and his associates, and then we really want to hear from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=873.808s">It's</a>  going to take some time for us as a board to process the feedback from the public, and we want to give ourselves, as well as you all, some time for these important decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=883.963s">So</a>  I encourage everybody to share your comment, write in letters, we already have a good collection in our project folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=894.073s">But</a>  I just want to flag that the focus of tonight is going to be hearing from Emily and Paola, and then hearing from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=904.103s">So</a>  just wanted to set the tone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=907.082s">And</a>  now I need to do the fun official stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=911.104s">Because</a>  this is a new public hearing, I need to read the public hearing notice into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=915.786s">This</a>  is a long one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=919.167s">The</a>  Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on April 2nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=926.951s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed abetments to the city of Medford zoning

entitled Proposed Residential Districts Prepared by Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1025.085s">Danielle</a>  or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and team?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1036.092s">Madam</a>  Chair, I believe that Emily has <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1038.927s">built</a>  into her presentation, sufficient introductory comments about the process that we've been going through for anybody who might be new to it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1048.812s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1050.133s">Then</a>  I will hand it off to Emily and Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1052.314s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1055.956s">I</a>  believe you have the correct permissions, but please flag it for us if you need anything.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1061.877s">Thank</a>  you so much, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1063.297s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1064.718s">For</a>  the record, Emily Innes of Innes Associates, and I'm joined by my colleague Paola Ramos-Martinez. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1071.56s">We</a>  are delighted to be back here in front of you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1075.141s">Before</a>  I share my screen, I do want to recognize, I can recognize some of the names on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1080.882s">It's</a>  good to see some familiar names. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1084.283s">I</a>  want to let anybody know who came to the public meeting last week that they will see the same presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1092.245s">That's</a>  not because we're not listening, we absolutely are, but we wanted to hear the public input from this meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1100.21s">I</a>  think we already know in consultation with city planning staff that there will be some changes made to what you see tonight, but we didn't want to make some changes and then have people have to comment on those brand new changes with less than a week between the two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1116.259s">So</a>  we've kept the presentation the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1119.02s">We</a>  are very much looking at the input we received last week, and we are looking forward to hearing input this week that we will also take into consideration and see what changes that need to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1129.514s">So</a>  thank you very much, and I will now share my screen and walk you through this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1137.695s">So,</a>  as you know, we have been coming sort of step by step with the with the zoning changes tonight we are talking to you about the residential only neighborhoods, and I'm going to just because I know there's going to be some people who are on this, this meeting at this meeting who have not seen this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1158.158s">I</a>  just want to walk through why we're doing this and where we are in the process a little bit and then after we talk about the neighborhood districts as we've done previously, we'll talk a little bit about how people can get their input into this process in addition to tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1175.139s">So</a>  this has been a multi-year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1177.621s">The</a>  city started the recodification process in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1182.924s">That</a>  lasted through 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1186.146s">The</a>  comprehensive plan development also started, it says 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1189.928s">It</a>  was a little bit later than that, but that process was happening simultaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1196.792s">So</a>  we went back and forth between what was going on in the recodification and what was happening in the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1203.196s">in</a>  terms of future changes to the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1207.44s">In</a>  early 2023, or late 2023, we started doing the urgent edits, unintended consequences, the city was working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1217.348s">And</a>  then we came in in 2024 to now to do the major sort of what was in the comprehensive plan, what was in the climate action and adaptation plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1226.815s">and</a>  what implications does that have for zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1229.196s">So</a>  we've been working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1231.517s">This</a>  was the graphic for the different aspects of the comprehensive plan that we're looking at, the overarching goals, and this is the zoning map from when we first started. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1245.003s">This</a>  is what your zoning looked like, and we are taking it, a combination of geographic areas and topic areas throughout this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1254.707s">and</a>  were guided by the future land use map that was in the comprehensive plan, and that map had divided areas into neighborhoods, corridors, centers and squares, gateway nodes, civic and institutional anchors, and so we've been working our way through those as the geographic aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1274.217s">This</a>  is coming up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1275.397s">These</a>  are the corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1276.998s">We</a>  have already done the Mystic Avenue corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1280.218s">We've</a>  done the Salem Street neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1282.159s">We</a>  are now, we'll be discussing soon with you the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1289.06s">We've</a>  just talked about Medford Square with the City Council with the Planning and Permitting Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1294.741s">We're</a>  going to be talking about West Medford soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1297.422s">And</a>  then we will be talking about these other areas ending up with Wellington at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1302.667s">But</a>  for today, we're talking about residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1305.889s">And</a>  as part of that, back in July of 2024, we had done a workshop with the Planning and Permitting Committee and looked at a whole bunch of different data that we mapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1319.161s">Some</a>  of it was from MassGIS, some of it was from your assessor's data. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1324.225s">I'm</a>  going to show you a couple, just a few of the maps tonight that we used in our planning process and our evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1333.848s">Obviously,</a>  when you're mapping things, it's not the same as being on the ground and it's not the same as community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1339.67s">So</a>  we are really pleased that so many people joined us last week and also to see so many people on this call this week to continue to hear the community input portion of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1350.174s">So</a>  this map that you're looking at now is what exists on the ground now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1354.135s">This</a>  is the single family in the light lavender, two family in the light teal color, condo conversion, three family, four to eight units in the blue, nine plus units in that deep purple. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1369.037s">And</a>  so one of the things we want to know is what's on the ground now and what that means for thinking about what should be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1377.562s">As</a>  we've discussed before, zoning doesn't always match what's on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1382.684s">So</a>  many of our New England communities were <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1386.266s">actually</a>  fully developed or mostly developed before zoning came into place, which the earliest is around the 1920s, the latest is late 60s, for the first time that zoning has been developed, so so many of our communities are older than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1402.35s">So</a>  first we want to know what do you have, and then the comp plan, the comprehensive plan, some of the other things, let us know maybe what do you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1411.552s">We</a>  also looked at some dimensional standards, so zoning isn't just about controlling the uses, but it's also about controlling how those uses are placed on the lot, how big are the buildings, where are the buildings in relationship to the street, where are they in relationship to each other, what's the lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1429.197s">So</a>  this is a map of the lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1431.558s">The</a>  darker the color, the smaller the lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1434.438s">And</a>  again, these are existing lot sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1437.259s">So</a>  the darkest color is below 3,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1440.72s">That</a>  red is 3,000 to 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1443.421s">The</a>  orange is 4,000 to 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1445.001s">And</a>  then sort of the paler colors as you go up, anything in that very pale yellow is over 10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1451.382s">Again,</a>  we're looking at the residential districts here, or primarily residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1456.063s">We</a>  do have some of the commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1458.564s">You</a>  know, that lets us know what the development pattern is in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1462.026s">It</a>  lets us know if we're thinking of lots that might be conforming in that they meet the current zoning versus non-conforming in that they don't meet the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1471.991s">A</a>  lot of these smaller lot sizes are non-conforming and one of the considerations is how far do we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1479.015s">to</a>  make as many buildings as possible conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1484.019s">Frontage</a>  also goes into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1485.561s">So</a>  frontage is the distance, the length of the lot along the street, and it's expressed in feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1494.148s">So</a>  you see there's a few actually where the frontage is under five, five to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1499.892s">Most</a>  of these are in the 36 to 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1502.835s">There</a>  are some outliers, but again, this is a measure that we can use <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1506.938s">to</a>  understand how we should set the dimensional standards, if they should be changed at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1512.643s">Height,</a>  this is a frequent topic of conversation in many communities, so we look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1518.447s">The</a>  assessors does not have data for the height for all parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1523.031s">There's</a>  a couple, probably ones that have been recently redeveloped, and there's some that are vacant, so those have no building on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1531.577s">But</a>  in general, you can see from 1 to 1.75, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1535.88s">The</a>  bright yellow all the way up to the dark dark almost black 7 to 14 So again, we're looking at that range and that plays into how we think about the height of the districts This is a historic inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1548.748s">So</a>  one of the things that we're adding to the zoning here is the ability to preserve <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1555.132s">or</a>  an incentive to keep and preserve historic residential buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1559.618s">I'll</a>  talk about that as we go zone by zone, but knowing where the historic inventory is, this is from MACRIS, which is the Massachusetts Historical Commission's online database. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1570.691s">So</a>  we wanted to map those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1572.972s">And</a>  then also, what's the location of transit? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1575.632s">Where</a>  are the walk radii? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1577.593s">So</a>  the quarter mile radius and the half mile radius are the distances that most people will walk to significant transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1585.975s">And</a>  so we have those circles on here on the commuter rail and the T to understand where those walk radii, where those time limits factor in to where we should put housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1601.119s">So</a>  those are some of the mapping considerations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1604.281s">All</a>  of those maps are online and so on the city's website, I think the link was in here earlier, I encourage people to look at them, but we just wanted to share some of them with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1615.268s">We</a>  did set up a list of considerations, a little list of factors and thinking about where housing should be located and how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1623.873s">housing</a>  should be located where. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1625.594s">So</a>  proximity to public transit is one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1630.078s">This</a>  map that you see on here, this diagram that you see on here is from the comprehensive plan, and it's a map of job density. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1637.023s">So</a>  where are people working relative to where they live? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1641.266s">Thinking</a>  about lot sizes and topography, obviously buildings need a certain, you know, certain types of buildings need a certain amount of lot in order to be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1651.613s">They</a>  need it for parking, they need it for amenities, so thinking about lot sizes and what factors into that, and also topography and going into access. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1661.26s">There's</a>  quite a range of topography in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1665.283s">Private</a>  ways, I'm going to show you a draft map on the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1669.966s">The</a>  city has updated it for us, which is great, but it didn't make it into this presentation, but understanding where there are public roads and where there are private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1678.372s">existing</a>  residential types we've already talked about, and then the transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1681.954s">So</a>  we, as you know, we've worked on two corridors already, we're working on the squares, but the idea of what's happening in those areas and then how the uses, the height, whatever it might be that we're looking at transitions downward into the residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1697.223s">But</a>  understanding that there are some residential only areas that bump right up against what we've been calling corridors or the squares that you'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1705.448s">We</a>  want to think about how the relationships happen for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1709.07s">This</a>  is the map of the public ways, just so you know, and it's a little blurry on this, but the public streets are in the blue and the private ways are in green, so you can see there's a lot of private ways actually throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1723.312s">So</a>  with all of that, we are proposing several different residential districts for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1728.316s">This</a>  is the overall map of the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1731.218s">I'm</a>  going to break them down district by district. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1735.861s">I</a>  know some of the people who have been on the calls are professional planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1739.484s">These</a>  are not your characteristic land use colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1742.966s">Residential</a>  is generally yellow, but if you put this many shades of yellow on here, which we did try, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1748.59s">you</a>  go cross-eyed, so we were asked to break up the colors a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1752.452s">So</a>  Neighborhood Residential 1 is that light yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1757.213s">Neighborhood</a>  Residential 2 is green. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1759.954s">The</a>  orange is Neighborhood Residential 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1762.755s">The</a>  teal color down here is Urban Residential 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1766.997s">And</a>  the red is urban residential too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1769.019s">And</a>  I'm going to break each of those down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1771.382s">They</a>  have slightly different building types and number of units per building. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1780.899s">And</a>  this map and again, I encourage you we will give this to the city So it will be online, but this map shows the different districts overlaid on what currently exists So once we drew the district as we were working with the planning and permitting committee, we were going back and forth It's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1799.036s">What's</a>  in there now? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1800.177s">What</a>  are we suggesting be there? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1801.858s">Is</a>  there a match? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1802.759s">Is</a>  there not a match and <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1804.08s">We</a>  heard, as I noted last week, that there were still some questions about, hey, we the members of the public who spoke here think there's a bit of a mismatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1815.405s">Can</a>  you look at that more closely? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1816.886s">We</a>  are absolutely doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1818.547s">So</a>  I do want to stress that we are still discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1822.148s">We</a>  are absolutely open to new input, and we hope to hear that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1826.45s">But</a>  this lets us sort of do that back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1829.432s">And</a>  of course, we can also overlay this on the other maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1832.653s">So</a>  let's talk about Neighborhood Residential 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1835.315s">So</a>  that's this light yellow color. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1836.977s">This</a>  would be a single-unit dwelling, a historic conversion, and of course ADUs because accessory dwelling units, which is the shorthand for that is ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1851.208s">That's</a>  a new state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1852.429s">We</a>  are working on updating Medford's current accessory dwelling unit law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1857.473s">to</a>  be consistent with the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1859.533s">So</a>  you won't have seen that language yet, we're still tweaking some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1863.954s">But</a>  an accessory dwelling unit is a smaller dwelling unit that is accessory to a principal residential use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1872.416s">So</a>  in this case, your principal residential use in this district would be single unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1877.737s">You</a>  could have an accessory dwelling unit with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1880.518s">You'll</a>  see that, hopefully you can see, the historic conversion is at two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1885.041s">And</a>  this is where we get into the preservation of historic buildings or historic residences, is the idea that by allowing one additional unit than the district allows, we would be more likely to have those buildings preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1902.014s">They're</a>  an important part of the historic development fabric of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1907.63s">And</a>  there's a value to keeping those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1909.291s">So</a>  in a single-dwelling neighborhood, a single-unit neighborhood, allowing for a historic conversion of two units would help to preserve those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1920.2s">And</a>  these are, you're going to see throughout the building types that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1923.782s">So</a>  one-unit dwelling, that's detached. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1926.525s">Historic</a>  conversion, so the same thing, but allowing up to two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1932.429s">And</a>  then the accessory dwelling unit, I should note that the state law and obviously Medford's allows for accessory dwelling units within the dwelling itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1943.92s">So</a>  a single one-unit dwelling could have a smaller accessory dwelling unit in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1949.545s">The</a>  diagram here is showing that it can also have a detached <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1953.73s">accessory</a>  dwelling unit, so another building on the lot that is that accessory dwelling unit, and there are standards and requirements around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1962.977s">Neighborhood</a>  residential two is broadly familiar, so also the single unit dwelling, a two unit dwelling at this stage, so that's the NR2 portion, historic conversion up to three units, and accessory dwelling unit, and you can see it on this map in green, a couple of different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1982.172s">So</a>  again, in this we're just adding the two-unit dwelling, and two-unit dwellings can either be side-by-side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1989.817s">We're</a>  showing the side-by-side, we're showing the stacked, so one on top of each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=1993.539s">You</a>  could also have a two-unit dwelling that's back-to-back or L-shaped, but the idea is that it is a single building with two full dwelling units in it, not a single unit with an accessory dwelling unit, which is smaller, but two that may be the same size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2010.409s">and</a>  greater than the ADU requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2013.91s">This</a>  is neighborhood residential three in the orange here, single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, three unit dwelling, historic conversion up to four units, and of course accessory dwelling unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2027.895s">And</a>  here you see the types. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2029.057s">We've</a>  just added the three-unit dwelling, or you could have a townhouse with three townhouse units attached to each other, historic conversion up to four units, and then the ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2042.277s">Residential,</a>  so urban residential one rather, so this does not have the single unit dwelling and I should state that you already, although we've been trying to make as many parcels and buildings conforming as possible, you do have some protections in your existing ordinance which we would keep and possibly add to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2064.021s">You</a>  have protections for single unit and two unit dwellings already and they're quite good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2069.502s">So</a>  if you were <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2071.242s">to</a>  remove as a use, as we're proposing in the urban residential one, a single unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2078.371s">You</a>  could continue to live in that single unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2080.774s">You</a>  could continue to invest in that single unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2084.758s">You</a>  have protections under the law for that single unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2088.182s">What</a>  we're just simply saying is that <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2090.825s">No</a>  new, on a vacant piece of property, no new single-family dwelling could be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2096.532s">So</a>  just keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2098.474s">Historic</a>  conversion up to five units for this one, the townhouse, the three-unit dwelling, and what we're calling a multiplex, which is four to six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2109.871s">And</a>  here are how these would look. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2111.934s">So</a>  you can see the multiplex is that four to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2114.879s">It's</a>  a smaller size, larger, obviously, than what we've been talking about, but not a full apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2122.191s">It's</a>  just up to the six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2124.574s">And</a>  then finally, Urban Residential 2, you'll see it scattered in some of these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2130.956s">Townhouse,</a>  three-unit dwelling, the multiplex of four to six units, and the multiple-unit dwelling of greater than six units, but three stories maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2141.96s">Now</a>  we did hear some, I mean, obviously we heard a lot of comments in the public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2146.083s">We</a>  heard some people suggest maybe the multiplex could be a lower number of units in one district and the higher the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2153.769s">We</a>  also heard concerns about heights, some too high, some saying, why aren't you going higher? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2159.714s">So</a>  the why aren't we going higher is because these urban residential twos are primarily bumping up against the mixed use corridors and squares at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2168.641s">And</a>  those do allow that higher height. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2171.783s">In</a>  many of the places that we looked, three is the current maximum for these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2177.045s">So</a>  that's why we've made it the maximum here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2180.747s">But</a>  obviously we're still looking for public input on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2184.109s">Here's</a>  how you can see the buildings sort of matching up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2188.431s">So</a>  the three unit, the townhouse, the historic conversion up to five, the multiplex, and the residential building, which would be more than six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2198.522s">So</a>  I'm going to stop there because this is the overview presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2203.003s">I</a>  do want to let people know before I stop the entire presentation when else they can be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2208.345s">I</a>  think many people on this call may have seen this before, but not everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2213.326s">We</a>  are working with the City Council's Planning and Permitting Committee to present a new topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2218.348s">We</a>  are discussing it with that committee back and forth until it's ready to be referred to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2226.29s">The</a>  Community Development Board is, as they are tonight, holds a public hearing on it that may take more than one, again, as we're doing tonight, more than one meeting before they vote on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2238.255s">That</a>  gives us, through city staff or in conjunction with city staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2243.437s">to</a>  provide some recommendations based on what we've heard during the public hearing for the Community Development Board to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2251.345s">They</a>  then send a recommendation back to City Council, who then has a final vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2256.87s">All</a>  of these are public meetings, and you can see the schedule that we've had up through today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2263.336s">here,</a>  so this has been the timeline for the Planning and Permitting Committee for this particular topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2272.7s">We've</a>  been working on the others, so you can see that on April 9th we're going to be talking about West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2277.923s">We</a>  have been talking about Medford Square, and we're making some changes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2282.325s">April</a>  30th, we're going to be introducing the other topics, and then in May, we're going to be talking about Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2288.867s">Here</a>  we are for the CD board meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2291.868s">We</a>  talked about the green score in February, Salem Street in March, residential districts today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2297.009s">We'll</a>  be introducing the commercial and mixed districts to you sometime in May, depending on your other things on your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2305.252s">And</a>  then finally, we've been having public meetings, so February 10th, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2309.653s">was</a>  a public listening session for Salem Street, last week was a public listening session for the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2317.16s">We</a>  just want, we're looking in April to do the squares, but we just want to confirm that the Planning and Permitting Committee is ready for us to do that, so we haven't set that date yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2328.09s">So</a>  with that, where anybody who's watching, where can you get more information? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2334.196s">Planning</a>  Development and Sustainability Department has a brand new web page with zoning, and there's a QR code to get you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2343.383s">So</a>  with that, I have finished with my presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2348.027s">I</a>  think our goal, Paola's and my goal, is to listen, take notes, and then work with city staff and the Planning and Permitting Committee to come back to you with some additional recommendations based on what we've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2360.238s">And</a>  thank you very much for your time.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2363.621s">Thank</a>  you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2364.582s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2365.403s">That</a>  was really informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2368.565s">And</a>  yeah, just a quick audio note, Emily, your audio got very quiet towards the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2373.546s">I</a>  heard what you were saying, and I hope others did too, but I think it was just a wrap up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2383.869s">So</a>  I think we're okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2385.69s">But</a>  just flagging that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2387.33s">So</a>  I'm going to do a quick break before we get into public comment, and then we will get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2395.579s">If</a>  you anticipate participating in public comment, feel free to raise your hand now, and then we'll kind of get into things in about five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2404.568s">So</a>  let's say 726. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2405.168s">We</a>  shall return. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2418.492s">All</a>  right, we're going to get started shortly once members of the board are confirmed to be back and have their cameras on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2428.789s">I</a>  see a good number of hands already raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2431.531s">For</a>  those of you who are fortunate enough to not know how Zoom works very intimately and need some help finding the raise hand function, you should have a React option, which is a heart on the desktop version of Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2449.322s">Just</a>  click the heart, and then you will have an option to raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2455.423s">If</a>  you're having any technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia, and I'll reiterate that right before we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2471.588s">Let's</a>  see, we have Annie, Ari, Peter, and Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2475.73s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2478.315s">Um,</a>  so usually we'll do a, like a board discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2482.197s">Um,</a>  but if it's all right with the board, I'd like to go straight to the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2487.6s">Um,</a>  I think that will help us have a more well-rounded discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2490.341s">Um,</a>  once we get there, does that work for everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2494.623s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2494.943s">Seeing</a>  some thumbs nods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2496.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2496.904s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2501.026s">So</a>  I'm now going to open the, wait, is Emily and Paolo back? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2505.449s">Just</a>  want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2509.821s">Yes,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2512.383s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2513.924s">I'm</a>  now going to open the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2516.806s">Those</a>  who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2519.989s">You</a>  can also send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2524.112s">Before</a>  providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2527.334s">And</a>  a reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it's not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2538.422s">If</a>  you are having audio or other technical difficulties, you can message Alicia or Danielle about those technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2547.99s">Each</a>  participant, like we've done in the past, each participant is going to have two minutes to speak and will be able to speak once. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2554.556s">If</a>  your comment doesn't fit within the two minute limit, I truly and deeply encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2562.222s">with</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2563.383s">We</a>  read all public comments, and they do get added to public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2567.186s">We</a>  have some already in our folder from previous commenters, so thank you to everybody who's already provided their comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2576.775s">And</a>  just because you've provided a written comment does not mean you can't speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2579.958s">So</a>  all the comments, please, please bring them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2584.982s">And</a>  then one more note on written public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2588.884s">So</a>  we would appreciate that all public comments via letter or email just be shared with us 24 hours in advance of the meeting where we're planning to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2597.287s">We</a>  are not planning on voting this evening, so it'll likely be 24 hours in advance of the Community Development Board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2606.511s">I</a>  think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2610.083s">If</a>  we continue it to the 16th, you know, we would love to have comments in, you know, by 6pm on the 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2616.788s">That's</a>  just in recognition of, you know, most members of the board have families or jobs or other commitments, and we want to make sure to review all of the comments and insight that's shared with us in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2634.406s">I</a>  think I can manage the public comment queue for now, as long as I don't get kicked out like I did last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2640.348s">But</a>  if that happens, we do have our vice chair, Peter Calves, that will step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2649.332s">So</a>  with that, I see the first hand and you'll get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2657.901s">Please,</a>  Erica, please state your name and address for the record, and then Alicia will manage the timer.</p>

    <p>[Erika DeRoche]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2663.683s">Hi,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2668.025s">Erica</a>  DeRoche, 260 Willis Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2671.546s">I'm</a>  going to read a statement because I don't want to forget to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2675.628s">So</a>  thank you for indulging me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2681.87s">I</a>  wanted to say that I really appreciate that the planning consultant is presenting this more than once because I was not able to attend last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2694.378s">Just</a>  overall about the proposed neighborhood residential and urban residential zoning, I understand that NS Associates have studied existing uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2706.749s">and</a>  existing buildings extensively, and a primary goal is to permit, as of right, the successful existing uses, masses and heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2718.919s">But</a>  I just wanted to note that existing properties are not necessarily going to be affected by the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2728.948s">They</a>  might be, but not necessarily, and I would urge <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2733.967s">community</a>  development board to consider the needs in the future, which the decision is going to affect for increased mix of uses and increased density overall, far above what I see currently being presented in the neighborhood districts or in the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2758.623s">Regarding</a>  dimensions and use, as a South Medford resident, most of my comments are going to be directly from my 18 years of living in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2768.869s">So</a>  they'll be in reference to that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2773.693s">The</a>  proposed zoning is NR3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2776.694s">And</a>  my opinion is that most of my neighborhood should probably be UR1 to allow for up to six units to be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2787.757s">I'm</a>  less familiar with the NR1 and NR2 neighborhoods, but my opinion is there needs to be some more density in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2800.2s">Is</a>  that a sound? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2803.301s">I'm</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2803.841s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2805.182s">Well,</a>  my neighborhood is walking and transit-oriented neighborhood, and I think you could go higher and more dense overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2815.004s">I'll</a>  email the rest of my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2816.945s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2818.21s">Thank</a>  you, Erica. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2819.03s">Look</a>  forward to reading those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2828.193s">The</a>  next commenter that I see is Carlene. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2831.293s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2832.914s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2834.994s">I</a>  can't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2840.396s">You're</a>  unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2841.596s">We</a>  can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Carlene Campbell-Hegarty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2842.676s">Oh,</a>  I'm so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2843.576s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2844.297s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2844.437s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2846.465s">My</a>  name is Carly Campbell-Haggerty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2848.026s">I</a>  live at 49 Elmont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2850.048s">I</a>  have emailed comments, but I'm going to do an abridged version tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2853.59s">My</a>  family has lived on Elmont Street for 47 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2857.112s">Our</a>  neighborhood is a very diverse housing stock of 1, 2, 3, and sometimes 6 family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2867.599s">Because</a>  of this, we have an amazing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2870.882s">which</a>  is a lovely mix of young families, professionals, and strong senior population. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2875.746s">Each</a>  group contributes to making living, working, and raising a family a strong attribute in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2885.093s">Therefore,</a>  we are asking you to not move forward with Urban 1 or Urban 2 zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2891.501s">for</a>  the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2893.242s">One,</a>  builders will be more incentivized to purchase more than one property and build larger apartments, condo buildings that can't be supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2901.686s">Two,</a>  the loss of being able to replace a single family home after two years is the most ridiculous thing we've ever heard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2910.591s">People</a>  should be able to purchase a home, demolish it, do whatever they want to it and keep it one family. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2915.373s">We</a>  are not Cambridge who recently adopted this type of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2918.743s">Three,</a>  young families will not be able to move into our neighborhood due to lack of housing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2923.986s">The</a>  majority of individuals moving in will be transit individuals who are living in Medford for a few years and then will move to other communities with a one family homes and a yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2935.433s">Three,</a>  the city has not followed its own capital plan that recommended completing traffic shadow parking and infrastructure studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2947.053s">Four,</a>  the city has made it clear that they are going to change parking regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2953.037s">Where</a>  are these individuals going to park? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2955.619s">Contrary</a>  to many people speaking at the last community meeting, not everyone has a driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2960.702s">And</a>  if you change the zoning for two, three family or six unit buildings, where will they park, especially during a snowstorm when all of the cars on the Felsway come down and park on the side streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2976.996s">And</a>  then five, the concept of more density bring more housing that people can't can't can't afford isn't true under this type of zoning contractors will put condos and get top dollar for them and apartments will be if their apartments will be an exorbitant amount of money at this <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=2995.92s">This</a>  will price out our seniors, stop young families from moving in and living on Salem Street and change our neighborhood character.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3001.983s">Last</a>  week- Marlene, you're at 30 seconds over. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3004.665s">Would</a>  you mind finishing your last thought?</p>

    <p>[Carlene Campbell-Hegarty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3006.425s">My</a>  last statement is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3008.026s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3008.306s">Since</a>  this process has begun, it's been clear that the officials in Medford are listening to the residents who will directly be affected by these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3016.531s">We're</a>  hoping that tonight, you will be our voice and not allow zoning proposals of urban one or two in the Salem Street neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3025.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3026.616s">And</a>  thank you for letting me go a little older.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3114.698s">Yeah,</a>  it's nice to be in front of you all for hopefully a less contentious conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3119.284s">Thanks</a>  for the opportunity to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3121.908s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3124.83s">thank</a>  Emily and Paola and the city staff who have been championing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3131.636s">It's</a>  a really difficult and often thankless process, and it's very important for our city, so really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3139.462s">I'm</a>  generally supportive of the increased density in the current proposal, but I think it does fall short in a couple of areas that I just want to touch on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3147.088s">It</a>  was mentioned tonight that <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3150.491s">single</a>  family use, single family by right would be removed in the UR1 and UR2 zones, but that many of the non-conforming homes in these neighborhoods would have a variance or a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3164.384s">There's</a>  some kind of process to be able to replace your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3168.347s">In</a>  the four meetings around this that I've been to, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3171.33s">I've</a>  still not heard a clear, concise list of what those criteria are or how that process would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3177.562s">And</a>  I think it'd be really beneficial for the community and this board to have more clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3184.842s">let's</a>  not get in a situation where down the line somebody who thought they were going to have some kind of capability is then limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3191.807s">To</a>  that point, I think that this neighborhood is unique, at least to us, in that it's a lot of small lots, a lot of small houses, and it's really hard to see, for us now, a sixplex in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3206.317s">But</a>  I think there's a potential for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3209.158s">I</a>  hope, though, at the same time we can acknowledge the scale and the existing character, which is one of the founding goals and principles of this process, to recognize that there are single-family homes and that those people should be allowed to have some clear process to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3227.526s">The</a>  last thing I'll say is that as the map is drawn now in the Hillside neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3231.487s">It</a>  uses George Street and Winthrop Street as a dividing line. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3234.809s">My</a>  neighbor right on the other side of George Street being able to have more buy right options than me on this side is silly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3240.992s">People</a>  walk from far farther than the quarter mile radius to get to the T, and so that line really needs to be re-evaluated so that there's equity and really a balanced approach in these neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3255.721s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3256.805s">Thank</a>  you, Jeremy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3257.525s">And</a>  then just quick for the record, your name and address.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3260.827s">Oh,</a>  yeah, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3261.407s">Jeremy</a>  Martin, 65 Burgadette.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3264.008s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3277.955s">Hi</a>  there, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3282.939s">Basically,</a>  I support this, I think it's reasonable and good, but please, I would suggest you do in fact increase some of the heights, perhaps up to six stories or something like that, and you are one and you are two. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3293.166s">We</a>  talked about you are one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3295.809s">That's</a>  a GLX, Magoon Square, Ball Square type of situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3299.252s">That's</a>  where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3301.515s">Why</a>  should our neighborhood be held back in terms of height? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3304.578s">Because</a>  of something to do with the MX1, MX2, or MX1 that Emily mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3309.883s">As</a>  of now, MX1, MX2, those are sort of Salem Street things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3314.267s">That's</a>  not near here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3315.688s">If</a>  the community wants height in GLX, Magoon Square, type areas like where I live, then maybe the heights in our corridors need to be a little taller than what was done on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3328.615s">The</a>  existing MX2, etc, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3331.116s">All</a>  these numbers and letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3332.994s">NR1</a>  and NR2 areas, those are really low density as proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3338.597s">I</a>  think that especially in the northwestern part of Medford, we can get rid of those and upscale them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3345.461s">NR1,</a>  NR2, NR2 becomes NR3, whatever makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3349.524s">But</a>  we don't need so much NR1 and NR2, I think, and I think it's good if we have more housing across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3356.812s">I</a>  would also suggest that you consider, you know, create some kind of middle ground between NR3 and UR1, some NR4. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3365.597s">I</a>  think I heard that mentioned at the Q&A. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3367.318s">I</a>  like that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3368.598s">Maybe</a>  move all of the NR3 that's south of the river into this new NR4, so it's not quite as big of a jump from 6 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3375.322s">Maybe</a>  a few other areas like around West Bedford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3377.323s">I</a>  see I've run out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3378.304s">Thank</a>  you very much for indulging the- We still have 20 more seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3382.046s">Oh,</a>  it's still going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3382.986s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3384.807s">So</a>  I was going to say the NR4, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3386.762s">that</a>  I propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3387.322s">I</a>  could go like south of the river at R3 and maybe a little bit around West Bedford Square or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3392.606s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3392.966s">Thanks,</a>  William. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3397.029s">Appreciate</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3402.169s">Yeah,</a>  just quick note, we do have the two minute limit, but we typically encourage or I typically encourage people to kind of finish their thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3410.792s">So,</a>  you know, unless you hear the beep noise, just keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3414.634s">And</a>  if you start to go over, I'll do a polite little check in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3420.656s">And</a>  then it gets less polite, the longer it goes on, but we try to avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3426.478s">And</a>  the two minute is to help kind of with equity for people's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3432.585s">But</a>  again, if you exceed the two minutes, you can always email comments because we do see those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3438.509s">The</a>  next commenter that I see is Zachary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3441.912s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3444.983s">Zachary</a>  Chertok, 5 Almont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3447.204s">And</a>  Madam Chair, I apologize, my camera driver is not responding, otherwise I would be on camera.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3452.187s">Oh,</a>  you're good.</p>

    <p>[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3453.628s">I</a>  also want to say that I appreciate the plug for the qualifications for the CD board and also, you know, stating what the typical qualifications are and encouraging people to give back that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3463.933s">I</a>  have some continued engineering concerns around what's gone into this, but I will send those over in writing to the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3470.655s">I</a>  think that's a better, more equitable way to discuss those. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3473.716s">What</a>  I wanted to ask Emily, Innes, and Paola about is that with regard to the planned residential density changes, I still have some real reservations around the density imbalances that are continuing to pull density away from existing non-vehicular alternative transit modes, some of what some of the other speakers have noted tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3493.942s">And</a>  it's starting to pull density, particularly in those you are one and two zones away from the closest distance to be considered under past regulations, including the MBTA Communities Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3505.913s">That's</a>  been brought up in previous proposals, even going back to Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3509.696s">And</a>  no, I am not looking to reopen that at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3514.379s">As</a>  a caveat, I want to restate that I've been consistent in my own participation that I'm not against increased density, but that the nature of the current proposal with some continued reservations about incomplete assessments continues to show up in things like that density being pulled away from the transit nodes and some of the density imbalances that are showing between some of the single unit residential zones and where the multi-unit is being sort of squeezed and wedged in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3544.007s">Again,</a>  any further light on that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3545.807s">And</a>  that's all I wanted to discuss in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3548.449s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3548.789s">Thank</a>  you, Zachary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3550.87s">Appreciate</a>  your thoughtful comments, as always. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3556.352s">The</a>  next commenter that we have is Cheryl R.

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3578.267s">But</a>  it was in the past, but I did not see it for Zachary's comment.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3599.608s">Alicia,</a>  I saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3600.789s">It</a>  comes up in the top corner of my screen, but not in your little square.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3606.353s">Oh,</a>  when I turned my camera off.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3607.775s">Yeah,</a>  when your camera's off, it showed up in the top right corner, but just not in your square.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3640.37s">Cheryl</a>  Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3643.352s">So</a>  I was distressed to see that the Glenwood Sand Street area again finds itself being zoned for the highest residential density despite our lack of transit and small lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3653.525s">We</a>  were told all areas were being made more dense, but the reality is that many neighborhoods within the transit circles are being zoned less densely than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3663.393s">Our</a>  neighborhood is one of the only ones that doesn't have multiple zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3667.616s">While</a>  the South side of Salem Street is currently SF2 and is less dense than the North side, both are set to be the highest neighborhood density. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3676.623s">The</a>  South side would more appropriately be zoned as NR2. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3680.917s">More</a>  distressing is that NR3 has the smallest minimum lot size with the largest allowance for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3688.304s">As</a>  the lot sizes increase in the zones, the amount of housing allowed actually decreases. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3695.71s">The</a>  decrease is so sharp that NR1 in some cases has literally no change beyond the state required ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3704.275s">If</a>  density is a good, then why are the areas with the largest lot sizes going to add the least density? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3711.518s">The</a>  changes to those areas would happen much more slowly, even if they were made more dense in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3717.96s">The</a>  Glenwood area will change more rapidly given the sharp increase in what is allowed here on very small lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3725.102s">We</a>  already have a very active flipper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3727.583s">who</a>  is currently using the zoning to add two million plus each townhouses per lot, and the idea of him being allowed three plus a possible two ADUs will be far more enticing and profitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3741.03s">Please</a>  consider changing at least some sections of our NR3 to NR2, especially as there are many single family homes on the south side of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3751.575s">Please</a>  do not zone us at or greater density than our neighbors who live in transit rich areas and those with much larger lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3760.659s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Charles Fenton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3797.726s">Charles</a>  Benson, 26 Kearney Street, in the densest neighborhood in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3804.932s">I</a>  just wanted to state, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3807.023s">that</a>  I am against zoning West Medford and Lawrence Estates to only NR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3813.467s">I</a>  feel that if other areas of Medford are being packed and denser zoning, then the other areas of Medford should use the packed zoning standards that are being pushed to the Salem Street corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3827.116s">I</a>  am for setting West Medford and Lawrence Estates at a minimum of NR2. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3835.004s">And</a>  I sent an email with this information and I'm done.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3843.909s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3844.509s">Well,</a>  I appreciate you following up your written comments with the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3848.311s">I</a>  think it's helpful for other people to hear what comments come through if they haven't read the comments themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3854.915s">So</a>  thank you, Charles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3856.636s">Appreciate</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[Kaitlin Robinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3870.73s">Hi,</a>  my name is Caitlin Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3872.972s">I'm</a>  at 31 Everett Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3875.574s">First,</a>  I want to say thank you to the Community Development Board for your time and dedication, as well as to city staff and Enos Associates for all the work that's going into this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3886.043s">I'm</a>  generally in support of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3887.864s">I</a>  feel like it's a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3891.238s">I</a>  do have some concerns about not going far enough with increases in density. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3900.441s">Where</a>  I am in the Glenwood area is currently zoned for NR3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3907.123s">And</a>  I think that NR3 should be a minimum citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3911.305s">I</a>  feel like NR1 and NR2 are just too low for planning for future zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3919.412s">I</a>  also want to reiterate my concern about parking minimums, which I know are not being addressed at this time, but I am still deeply concerned about how those minimums, if they stay as they are, are going to prevent the intentions behind the zoning, how they might prevent that kind of development from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3941.565s">And</a>  another comment that I heard someone say earlier <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3946.865s">um,</a>  was in regard to like the circles around transit and the distance from transit and how we should be thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3954.228s">And</a>  I do think that we do need to be think when we think about major transit centers, um, a quarter mile or half mile, I think is just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3964.673s">Um,</a>  I live in Glenwood, but I regularly walk to both the Malden center orange line and Medford tough screen line. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3971.516s">There</a>  are also many options for micro micro mobility. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3976.374s">And</a>  it is so expensive to live next to a major transit center. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3980.735s">So</a>  I think that it makes sense to, you know, a lot of people are just are not able to live very close to a major transit center. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3988.377s">And</a>  I think it would still be helpful to have density in our neighborhoods and not need parking minimums too.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3995.319s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3997.059s">Thanks,</a>  Caitlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=3998.1s">Really</a>  appreciate the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4004.285s">The</a>  next commenter that I see is Michael von Korff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4008.868s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4010.469s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Michael Von Korff]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4012.47s">Hi,</a>  I'm Michael von Korff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4015.872s">I</a>  live at 44 Pitcher Ave in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4019.674s">And</a>  I'm really glad to see how the current rezoning is going to make it easier to build more homes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4024.937s">But</a>  like a lot of other folks tonight, I wish it went further. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4028.939s">I</a>  really want Medford to be a place where my kids can afford to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4034.083s">when</a>  they grow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4034.763s">I</a>  want my kid's teacher to be able to afford a home here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4038.345s">If</a>  that means a fourplex in my neighborhood, of course I want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4043.567s">If</a>  that means four stories in homes in my neighborhood, which is currently neighborhood residential three, of course I want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4052.83s">And</a>  more density is a change, and we should change thoughtfully, but I don't think we can afford to change slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4062.467s">I</a>  do agree there was an earlier speaker who suggested that maybe a single family could continue to be allowed by right in some of the places in Medford where this new zoning would disallow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4072.777s">I'm</a>  all for allowing people to build what they want to build, as long as we can get more places where there's permission to build more. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4081.885s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4083.907s">Thank</a>  you, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4084.528s">Appreciate</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4088.577s">The</a>  next commenter that we have is Gaston Fiore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4092.178s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4095.119s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4096.94s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4101.802s">Gaston</a>  Fiore, 61 Signet Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4104.283s">I</a>  just wanted to comment that <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4107.32s">So</a>  when people say that for NR1, then we're not going beyond the state law of an ADU, that's incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4115.885s">So</a>  the way that the zoning is being discussed right now, we will have, in addition to the protected ADU, which is by the way, 900 square feet, which is a two bedroom apartment allowed, we also have a local ADU, which requires special permit, but it's still allowed, which is 1,200 square feet, which is a three bedroom apartment, which means that combining two of them <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4137.406s">we</a>  could have a 2,100 square foot additional structure per lot in NR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4144.048s">That,</a>  to me, if you go to areas of West Medford versus States and North Medford, that's gonna, if everyone did that, or most people did that, would completely change the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4155.41s">So</a>  it is not true that we're not going beyond the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4159.182s">And</a>  second, I think that we should differentiate between West Medford and let's say like North Metro Lawrence State. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4165.227s">So</a>  where I live, I'm two miles from every transit, either from Malden T Station, the orange line, from the Medford, Tufts Green Line Station, or the commuter rail, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4176.915s">Same</a>  car park I actually just mapped it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4179.477s">So</a>  if you were to walk to Malden T Station, it's 1.6 miles, 1.6 miles shortest path by walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4187.702s">you</a>  know, we, the only means of efficient means of transportation we have is either biking or driving a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4194.745s">And</a>  some people cannot bike or they don't want to bike, particularly in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4199.507s">So,</a>  you know, if we increase density too much around these areas that we're too much from public transportation, how we're going to get to work, how we're going to go to places, there's going to be a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4210.511s">We</a>  have private waste as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4212.735s">So</a>  how are we going to handle that, too, compared to public waste, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4217.559s">So</a>  how much can we actually change that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4219.2s">So,</a>  you know, I can't even get the city to repave my private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4224.123s">So</a>  that's most of my input, and I will send more comments through email. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4228.126s">Thank</a>  you so much for letting us speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4230.048s">Thanks</a>  so much.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4319.407s">Thank</a>  you, Kate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4320.147s">That's</a>  really helpful perspective and maybe something that people don't consider on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4325.648s">So</a>  really appreciate you sharing those public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4334.73s">The</a>  next public commenter that I see, it's all one word. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4338.11s">So</a>  I'm gonna assume where the first name and last name breaks is Kyle Eaton. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4343.191s">You're</a>  gonna get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4345.952s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Eaton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4348.518s">It</a>  is Kyle Eaton, and I live at 168 Sheridan Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4354.462s">I'm</a>  really, really happy that this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4356.243s">This</a>  is really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4357.344s">I</a>  really appreciate all the work that you guys are doing on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4360.806s">I've</a>  lived in an apartment in Medford for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4363.628s">Our</a>  neighborhood definitely needs more housing stock, for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4367.29s">I</a>  strongly support increasing the density here in my neighborhood and everywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4375.196s">I</a>  echo the previous commenters that higher high limits are a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4379.778s">Limiting</a>  it now for the foreseeable future seems not very future oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4386.182s">I</a>  also think that keeping large swaths of the city as single family housing only is <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4395.807s">is</a>  not the right idea as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4397.469s">We,</a>  like I said, we definitely need more density and limiting it artificially there, I think is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4406.46s">Also</a>  echo the concerns about parking minimums continuing to block development, although that's as the previous commenter said not something handling now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4415.289s">On</a>  the short distance from major transit hubs, I regularly walk to Malden Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4419.451s">We</a>  also have buses in many areas of the city that I used to get around without me and my wife only have one car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4426.473s">So</a>  I don't think it's a requirement that we have assumed that every person that moves here needs a car, even if they aren't within a half mile of the major hubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4436.457s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4437.858s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4451.818s">Hi,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4452.558s">Eunice</a>  Brown, Greenleaf Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4453.979s">I</a>  am going to be speaking mainly on my area, which is kind of known as the lower hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4464.466s">And</a>  I have three points. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4467.491s">First</a>  of all, regarding narrow roads and access, at the Q&A last week, I think the consultant mentioned that one of the reasons that the NR1 areas are remaining as such <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4480.761s">is</a>  due to the narrow roads and access. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4484.024s">That</a>  included areas like the Heights, the Lawrence Estates, West Medford, utterly all the more affluent areas where there's the highest voter turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4492.891s">Anyway,</a>  the Lower Hellside is proposed for the increased density of UR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4498.156s">We</a>  also have extremely narrow roads with access issues too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4503.38s">I've</a>  been told by members of the Medford Fire Department that Greenleaf Avenue and the surrounding area is one of the worst streets and areas for the MFD to travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4513.565s">I've</a>  seen that myself, having had the fire department here at my home on a few occasions, and it was definitely borne out during a massive house fire on Greenleaf in December of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4525.21s">Listening</a>  to the scanner that morning, Dispatch was faced with access issues from the firefighters trying to get to the scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4533.177s">Has</a>  anyone bothered to consult with the MFD to see how the increased density and more cars might impact their ability to get through the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4544.461s">Four</a>  to six unit multiplexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4546.722s">Again,</a>  there's been a mention of protecting the culture of the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4551.704s">Adding</a>  four to six unit multiplexes do not fit in this area, either with the character of the neighborhood or the current density. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4559.628s">It</a>  also poses parking problems because there's more cars than driveways currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4565.07s">And</a>  the third thing is tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4568.285s">We</a>  know Tufts is not a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4570.586s">We</a>  just went through that a couple of months ago with the dorm proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4574.887s">Community</a>  development could have been better, and they certainly did not do a good job of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4582.569s">Matter</a>  of fact, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4583.349s">Hederman,</a>  you said yourself that after the dorm vote was taken, I hope to never see a proposal like that before this board ever again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4592.139s">Any</a>  zoning proposal made for the hillside area has got to be Tufts proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4597.123s">It</a>  has to be bulletproof to protect the neighborhood and not have a single loophole that Tufts can exploit to build as they wish. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4605.09s">We</a>  don't have the Dover amendment hanging over us this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4607.972s">Medford</a>  has that control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4610.054s">Exercise</a>  it and protect the Medford, the hillside neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4614.478s">Do</a>  I still have time?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4616.68s">You're</a>  about 45 seconds over.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4619.882s">Okay,</a>  I'll email the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4622.203s">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4623.504s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4626.105s">I</a>  like your sentiment about being Tufts-proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4628.827s">My</a>  hope is that they will be a better neighbor in the future, but, you know, we, yeah, I see you, Lori. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4636.551s">You</a>  know, you can't plan on a hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4643.616s">The</a>  next speaker that I see is Laurel Ruma. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4646.278s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4648.7s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4651.202s">My</a>  name is Laurel Ruma. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4652.243s">I</a>  live at 149 Burgett Avenue in the same neighborhood as both Lori and Eunice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4659.068s">So</a>  thank you very much for taking our notes today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4661.89s">Mike</a>  and I wrote a letter that gets into more of the detail of the things that we want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4667.714s">So</a>  please have a read at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4671.377s">And</a>  before <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4673.403s">We</a>  know you for most recent things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4675.605s">I</a>  actually spent 12 years working on the Green Line extension as a representative of the city to bring the Green Line to Medford, and it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4682.592s">It's</a>  here, it's literally in my backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4685.154s">They</a>  took part of my backyard to do it like I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4688.377s">So</a>  now I know it's here, all the chickens have come home to roost and everybody wants more dense housing around the Green Line station at Tufts and Ball Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4698.266s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4698.947s">We're</a>  totally for it, but we would also like the flexibility of keeping the option of single family homes here in the neighborhood just because then it gives us the opportunity to go from six floors to one floor to whatever needs to be in the in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4715.264s">The</a>  other thing that I would like to say is that the MBTA does <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4720.917s">declare</a>  the accessibility of train stations to be half a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4726.259s">So</a>  when you look at the current zoning maps, I call it the lower hillside bullseye because it is a quarter mile circle that's been drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4733.922s">And</a>  it's, as Jeremy said, from George Street to Winthrop Street, all the interior neighborhoods, streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4740.685s">And</a>  the issue with that is this is the densest part of the lower hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4745.426s">Our</a>  streets are very narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4747.227s">We</a>  call it the Warren for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4749.468s">because</a>  fire trucks can't make it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4751.508s">If</a>  two cars are parked on the same side, like forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4754.149s">So</a>  this is another issue of this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4756.75s">So</a>  if we expand the you are one designation past that the half mile designation that the MBTA gives it broadens the opportunities for everyone to take, you know, have a part of this density story. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4769.453s">Yeah,</a>  as does <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4772.976s">getting</a>  rid of NR1s. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4774.497s">So</a>  this is an opportunity for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4776.699s">So</a>  NR1 should be struck from the record and everyone should have an opportunity to participate in making Medford more dense with more housing opportunities for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4787.828s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4788.789s">Thank</a>  you, Laurel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4789.83s">And</a>  thanks for your work on the Green Line Extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4793.553s">I</a>  worked for the city of Somerville when we were trying to get some of that off the <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4799.913s">out</a>  of contracts and into execution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4801.714s">So</a>  I really appreciate your work on that and very insightful comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4805.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4808.179s">The</a>  next commenter that I see is Tara. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4811.122s">You're</a>  gonna get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4813.263s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Tara Shankar]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4815.245s">Hi,</a>  thank you, Madam Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4820.589s">Address</a>  is 397 High Street in West Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4824.892s">I</a>  am within the half a mile of the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4829.058s">like</a>  to speak to specifically the historic conversion aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4834.72s">I</a>  live in a historic house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4837.32s">And</a>  I do not believe, well, first of all, let me characterize in West Medford alone, historic houses can be quite small. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4847.203s">And</a>  they can also be bigger than many houses I've ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4851.884s">So</a>  there is an enormous, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4855.447s">diversity</a>  of housing stock in the historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4859.672s">In</a>  order to incentivize owners to preserve those historic houses, I think it needs to be more aggressive in terms of the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4871.919s">And</a>  also, specifically, because some of the houses have large properties, whether they are large residences or small residences, they have large properties, as many speakers have already represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4890.255s">Having</a>  a multiplex or an ADU by right within the historic conversion <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4897.489s">would</a>  help incentivize the maintenance of the historic building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4903.653s">The</a>  two to four units, I don't believe at this point, is financially viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4911.862s">and</a>  the three-unit townhouse would compete. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4917.103s">Like</a>  knocking the historic building down and just building townhouses is probably lucrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4923.184s">So</a>  think about that because our historic neighborhoods are gorgeous and all of the houses, small and large, are important for maintaining the character of our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4938.468s">And</a>  thinking creatively, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4940.79s">actually</a>  should be one of the things that is done within this zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4945.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=4947.655s">Thank</a>  you, Tara.</p>

    <p>[John Elliott]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5203.387s">I'm</a>  here.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5204.628s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5205.008s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[John Elliott]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5207.149s">John</a>  Elliott, 34 Emery Street in the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5211.23s">I</a>  have spent way too much time staring at maps and aerial photographs trying to make some sense of this in preparation for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5226.535s">There</a>  jumped out two or three things that I want to mention here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5232.547s">First</a>  of all, what Laurel Ruma calls the bullseye, I saw that and tried to make some sense of it because I don't think any of us has a personal transporter that will get us from our places of where we live to the track side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5257.335s">And</a>  then go away and come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5260.019s">So</a>  that's what the bullseye shows is as the crows fly distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5267.108s">I</a>  proceeded to measure from this point on the platform at the Medford Tufts station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5276.171s">across</a>  the platform, up one flight of stairs, turn left, up another flight of stairs, up to the sidewalk at Boston Ave, over the bridge, over the right-of-way, past the Cummings building, up the access road or service road that services</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5297.859s">John,</a>  just real quick, you have about 30 seconds left. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5300.681s">Oh,</a>  really? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5301.481s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Elliott]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5302.482s">Yeah,</a>  up to the end of Burgett Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5305.243s">And</a>  that's a quarter of a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5307.805s">From</a>  there, you can start measuring a quarter of a mile or a half mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5313.548s">The</a>  other thing that I saw on the maps was how much green space there was that is occupied by Tufts athletic fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5324.431s">There's</a>  a 20-acre plot up there that has 19-acre plot with five athletic fields, two acres unused right by the tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5336.214s">That</a>  would be a great place to put some high-density residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5342.396s">If</a>  you wanted it to be close to the station, that is a quarter of a mile, the farthest in that two-acre plot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5350.179s">OK,</a>  I'll quit.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5353.83s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5354.43s">I</a>  appreciate the comment and appreciate the process that you went through to measure those distances. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5359.513s">I</a>  think it provides some real kind of first-hand experience and helps to personify some of the data that we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5367.296s">I'm</a>  going to go back to Marion, see if I can do a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5381.503s">Where</a>  did they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5384.307s">The</a>  hand just dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5389.61s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5391.531s">Marian,</a>  if you raised, if you dropped your hand intentionally, no worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5395.774s">If</a>  you didn't, please raise your hand again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5397.535s">We</a>  want to make sure to hear your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5400.857s">But</a>  for now, we're going to move on, excuse me, to our next member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5407.28s">Jean,</a>  you're going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5409.702s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5412.17s">Good</a>  evening, can you hear me now, Madam Chairperson?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5415.292s">It's</a>  a little low, but I'm not sure if that's just me.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5417.474s">All</a>  right, let me get closer to my computer, is this better? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5420.816s">Yes,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5422.317s">I'll</a>  just hang close to my computer, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5424.378s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5425.439s">I'm</a>  at Parr Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5427.3s">I</a>  do have a letter prepared, but I have a few comments that I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5431.283s">I</a>  think it's important as we speak as a community to just be thoughtful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5436.326s">And</a>  I would like to share for people's consideration, it's great to kind of be wishful about what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5442.29s">But</a>  the sad fact here in Medford is that the city of Medford, whether we like it or not, does not attract transformative developers in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5452.536s">We</a>  simply attract flippers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5454.677s">And</a>  our most recent example of that was the four-acre, approximate four-acre RFP in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5461.081s">We</a>  had a room full of developers that were promised friendly PDUs and autonomy in what they were going to build there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5468.525s">And</a>  at the end of the day, we had a response from two, and they weren't even really the true transformative developers you see respond in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5478.774s">So</a>  we can talk about acres of land and what we'd like to do and what we'd like to see and what we think is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5485.94s">But</a>  I'm telling you as someone who is in the industry, and I have many a conversation with a variety of people in the industry, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5494.027s">there</a>  is a very low interest in Medford for anybody but a flipper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5499.17s">And</a>  so what we are developing here in this programmatical exercise in rezoning is nothing but <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5506.923s">what</a>  is friendly to flippers and speculative developers who are going to harass the residents as they do their monetary build-outs for their speculative projects and force long-time residents out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5523.0s">I</a>  just would like to, if you'll give me the little bit of latitude, I have a handful of other thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5527.942s">I</a>  want to displace people of this idea that if you build a four or a six-story building, that it's going to get an elevator and you're going to be able to travel where you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5539.465s">ADA</a>  compliance isn't driven by height, it's driven by statutory requirements, and it is a percentage of build-outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5548.347s">It</a>  is a percentage of what is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5550.767s">So</a>  each project will net a different type <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5554.228s">of</a>  ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5555.891s">You</a>  might not be able to visit your friends because there might not be an elevator or your friends might be on the ground floor in a back area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5563.022s">So</a>  this idea that every new building that's coming in is going to be 100% ADA is not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5568.921s">Also</a>  new construction does not, and higher units does not necessarily equate to affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5576.404s">If</a>  you don't hit the 10 unit threshold, you get no affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5580.146s">We</a>  saw that on Winthrop Street in West Medford, where they blasted away the land and were creative about how they subdivided it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5589.21s">And</a>  the city got zero affordable units in an environment where the units are selling at almost $2 million each.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5597.833s">Jean,</a>  you're about 50 seconds over. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5600.015s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to finish your last thought.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5603.698s">One</a>  final thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5604.959s">It</a>  is really troubling to me that we continue to talk about these things without studies and without using our best practices because we are going to be holding the bag for a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5616.808s">But</a>  the example I will leave you with is our plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5619.31s">In</a>  most instances, the plumbing and the utilities that run in our street are over 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5625.312s">It</a>  is not an incremental proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5627.952s">It</a>  is an overarching proposition when we're looking at the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5631.353s">I</a>  will submit the rest in writing, and I appreciate the latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5634.454s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5635.315s">Thank</a>  you, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5637.395s">The</a>  next public commenter that we have is Jennifer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5640.036s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5642.076s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer O'Callaghan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5645.632s">Hi,</a>  my name is Jennifer O'Callaghan, 19 Paris Street, and I wanted to express my opposition to what is currently proposed for the Salem Street Glenwood area in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5659.977s">I</a>  think it's important to point out that what we're talking about is what's going to be allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5667.36s">This</a>  ignores the fact that you are going to have greedy developer after greedy developer coming along <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5674.936s">In</a>  going for additional variances and potentially succeeding because medford wants to give it away The problem is not Your neighbor your longtime neighbor who wants to add an adu or needs to expand a little bit on their house It is the developers that we are seeing coming faster and stronger each time to our neighborhood to build things that are not <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5703.698s">high</a>  quality, nor attractive, nor what the neighbors would appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5711.625s">And</a>  so, therefore, I don't want to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5714.707s">I</a>  also would like to, before I complete my statement, point out that anyone who believes that the bus transit around here is equivalent or as good as rapid transit is delusional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5729.308s">despite</a>  whatever proposals are coming related to the 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5734.153s">As</a>  a person who takes the T from time to time, I can assure you it's not better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5739.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5740.058s">Bye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5741.8s">Thank</a>  you, Jennifer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5744.862s">The</a>  next commenter that I see is Lori. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5747.145s">You're</a>  going to get a request to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5749.146s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Laurie Krieger]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5752.961s">Hi,</a>  I'm Lori Krieger, 124 Brookings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5757.004s">I</a>  still have PTSD. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5758.465s">I'm</a>  working through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5760.767s">So</a>  my biggest concerns, I was at the meeting the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5765.291s">I</a>  haven't been in front of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5767.813s">My</a>  biggest concerns, we all, it's like the same thing with Tufts, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5772.917s">We</a>  all want density and all of that, but we don't want to, I think the most important things that you can do are Mike and Laurel wrote a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5782.67s">And</a>  the letter talks about putting institutional zoning first or Tufts first before we do the rest of the stuff for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5789.958s">And</a>  I think that's super important because we need to know what's going on with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5793.722s">And</a>  we need to make plans in regards to them or hopefully in conjunction with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5801.25s">So</a>  I think that's super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5802.75s">They</a>  own tons of property around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5805.111s">If</a>  all of a sudden it could be six family or six units, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5809.391s">They</a>  can buy a couple of lots and all of a sudden I'll be in the middle of Tufts property instead of on the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5814.892s">And</a>  that's a little bit, that's concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5818.813s">The</a>  other thing that I think that I want to reflect what Jean and Jennifer said is that we're very idealistic here in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5827.054s">We</a>  really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5827.795s">We</a>  care about our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5829.195s">We</a>  care about <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5830.79s">affordable</a>  housing, we care about all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5834.171s">But</a>  these zoning laws are not laws that control what developers do, just the framework within which they can operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5845.696s">And</a>  right now we live in a really the land of unregulated capitalism to the nth degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5851.559s">And</a>  if our concerns as families, as neighborhoods aren't met, then <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5857.54s">it's</a>  going to be like what Jennifer said or Jean said that like we have to find a way whatever y'all do take as much effort as you can to look at it from different angles and different vantage points so that the undone unintended consequences don't destroy everything that we have that is good and the final thing about like with the whole Tufts thing <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5880.832s">We're</a>  looking at planting, and I mentioned this before, we're looking at planting trees and stuff to kind of obscure if we can live long enough to obscure the Tufts buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5890.835s">But</a>  then you get somebody that wants to develop a lot and they take out all the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5895.836s">Like</a>  let's not, let's create rules that avoid an urban desert because that could happen too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5903.877s">There's</a>  buildings in Somerville and Cambridge that are just been built, and they're empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5909.722s">They're</a>  empty like 10 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5911.243s">I</a>  don't know what the laws were around that, but let's be as smart as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5916.187s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
