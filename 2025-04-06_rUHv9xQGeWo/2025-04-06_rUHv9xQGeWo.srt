[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to call the meeting to order, and we're going to begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

8
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:35,273

[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

25
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:02,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

26
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:04,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben LaValle?

27
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:10,076
[SPEAKER_21]: And myself, Chair Emily Hedeman, is also present.

28
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the call, please?

29
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:26,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

30
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:32,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have Director Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

31
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also have Sal DiStefano, our Director of Economic Development.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,084
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that is everyone from the City this evening.

33
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:45,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, glad to have you all on the line.

34
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:52,938
[SPEAKER_21]: And then before we get into our first agenda item, I did want to do a quick plug because we have so many members of the public here.

35
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,959
[SPEAKER_21]: I recognize some names and faces.

36
00:02:56,279 --> 00:03:02,461
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know that these are some very, very engaged members of the public.

37
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:09,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to make a plug for vacancies on various boards and commissions in the city of Medford.

38
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:17,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Selfishly, I think the Community Development Board is a great opportunity for people to kind of give back to their city.

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:28,605
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a paid position, you know, it's a nominal fee, but if you have any experience in law, real estate, transportation,

40
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:50,401
[SPEAKER_21]: housing, public service, economic development, really anything that kind of touches the built environment, the Community Development Board is a really great opportunity for you to serve and give back to your community and really kind of plug in to the larger Medford ecosystem.

41
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:52,883
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm dropping two links in the chat.

42
00:03:55,562 --> 00:04:02,139
[SPEAKER_21]: One is the recent publication or Medford News article

43
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,442
[SPEAKER_21]: mentioning the various vacancies.

44
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,483
[SPEAKER_21]: So you'll see it's not just the Community Development Board.

45
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:15,945
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the other one is a website where you can apply to be on one of those boards or commissions.

46
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:21,326
[SPEAKER_21]: And all the board members that you see on this call have gone through this process.

47
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I applied as soon as I moved to Medford, because I'm very passionate about public service.

48
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:29,328
[SPEAKER_21]: I got a call maybe a couple months later.

49
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,589
[SPEAKER_21]: I went through a quick interview process.

50
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:37,672
[SPEAKER_21]: And then within a couple weeks, you know, was on the board.

51
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,854
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, it's not a really intensive process.

52
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:49,260
[SPEAKER_21]: But I encourage everybody to do what they can, especially in these interesting times to give back to the community.

53
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,123
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll get off that soapbox for now.

54
00:04:56,128 --> 00:05:03,533
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first item we have on our agenda is the Bridal Path Subdivision Covenant Approval and Endorsement of Subdivision Plan.

55
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, would you mind introducing this agenda item?

56
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:10,098
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we'll pass it on to Attorney Desmond.

57
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:22,826
[SPEAKER_13]: As you recall, you approved a definitive subdivision for the Bridal Path subdivision off of Franklin Avenue.

59
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:28,930
[SPEAKER_13]: The certificate of approval was filed in the city clerk's office there are no appeals.

60
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:43,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So now, before you can endorse the plan to be recorded the registry of deeds, we need to have, you know, approve a form of surety that, you know,

61
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Guarantees that the the road will be done, you know in case it goes belly-up.

62
00:05:47,635 --> 00:06:10,581
[SPEAKER_13]: So the the surety that they are proposing is a covenant and it's been reviewed by our legal counsel So I we don't have any issues with that so I would recommend that you vote to approve that authorize a director hunt to sign on your behalf and then

63
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,880
[SPEAKER_13]: endorse the plan and authorize Director Hunt to sign that as well.

64
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:26,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that Attorney Desmond representing the applicant has some more to add regarding some

65
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:36,946
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff that is out of my wheelhouse with trustees and legalese and I'll let her go into that.

66
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:38,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Attorney Desmond, if you would.

67
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:39,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

68
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:51,710
[SPEAKER_15]: So the covenant before you essentially prohibits the applicant or the owner from building on any of the lots or having any of the lots released until such time as the roadway is in place or the or the board

69
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:55,812
[SPEAKER_15]: decides that they will allow for some lots to be released.

70
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:05,235
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the document itself, the only issue in council for the city has reviewed it, and we have no objection to the obligations within that.

71
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:19,700
[SPEAKER_15]: However, paragraph 13, which deals with the trustees, the owners of the trust, and their authority to act under the trust, the seller's attorney, and this is a situation where

72
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:33,190
[SPEAKER_15]: My client, who's the applicant, doesn't own the property as of yet, so what's going to occur is that the covenant and the subdivision plan are going to go on record and then the deed will go on record.

73
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,612
[SPEAKER_15]: and then the mortgage.

74
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:51,042
[SPEAKER_15]: The Seller's Council has requested that he be permitted to, in the place of paragraph 13, prepare a separate document which globally deals with the trustee's authority to both convey the property and also to sign the covenant.

75
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:54,985
[SPEAKER_15]: That hasn't been resolved as between council yet.

76
00:07:55,645 --> 00:08:01,386
[SPEAKER_15]: but it doesn't impact the obligations with respect to the covenant of the parties.

77
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:24,871
[SPEAKER_15]: So what would occur is either this language would stay in in paragraph 13 or alternatively there would be a document drafted by Seller's Council, what's called the trustee, which outlines that trustees have authority under the document and have been directed by the beneficiaries and the remaining trustees to sign the covenant.

78
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:34,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And that would be in the document that also recites that the trust authority to convey the property to my client.

79
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:40,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd prefer to do one document than to have two separate documents.

80
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So that request has been put before counsel for KP Law to review.

81
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't got a response on that.

82
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:52,570
[SPEAKER_15]: But with respect to everything else in the covenant, we're in agreement.

83
00:08:53,137 --> 00:09:08,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the board could approve it because they are going to have to, even to record the covenant or the deed, you're going to have to have what's called the trustee certificate, which sets forth the authority of the trust and the trustees.

84
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:16,378
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I'm hearing is we could approve the covenant as it's written now, and then you would come back for the modification.

85
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:45,195
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it would either be in the language in paragraph 13 would either be in this document or Sellers requested that he be permitted to do what's called the trustee certificate which would have the same language but it would be a second document that is just another rather than having it in paragraph 13 his clients would be signing what's called the trustee certificate and it would have the same language within that document.

86
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:49,827
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was subject to Attorney Stein's approval, KP law.

87
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:51,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I see your hand.

88
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:52,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any insight here?

89
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:55,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Madam Chair.

90
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:03,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I would add what Attorney Desmond just said, that to approve it pending legal counsel's approval.

91
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,716
[SPEAKER_13]: So if they're okay with that, then

92
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:16,986
[SPEAKER_13]: we would, you could direct Alicia to sign it, but if they're not okay with it, then we'll come back.

93
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:18,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

94
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:32,056
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we weren't planning on having a board discussion on this item, but just curious, Peter, Ari, Annie, if there's any kind of initial reactions to this.

95
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:36,559
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds fine to me if there's a motion with a condition.

96
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry.

97
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:41,776
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead.

98
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:45,459
[SPEAKER_28]: I was going to just say add on everything seems seems fine to me.

99
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:55,907
[SPEAKER_28]: And so in that case, I'll move to do we need to approve it or is it kind of an authorized?

100
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:09,018
[SPEAKER_21]: It's approved the covenant pending Casey law, KP law, excuse me, approval and authorizing Alicia to sign on behalf of the board.

101
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:25,790
[SPEAKER_28]: Then in that case, I'll make a motion approving the covenant pending the approval of City Legal Counsel and authorizing Director Hunt to sign the covenant on behalf of the board.

102
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:27,631
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I have a second?

103
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:30,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

104
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:35,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry.

105
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,619
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

106
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter calls.

107
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:40,202

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

114
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good night, folks.

115
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:54,106
[SPEAKER_21]: You as well.

116
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe you also need to endorse the plan.

117
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:06,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh,

118
00:12:08,638 --> 00:12:08,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

119
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to endorse the plan.

120
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:11,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

121
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Attorney Desmond, are you still there?

122
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it matters.

123
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:16,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I am.

124
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:17,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

125
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:18,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

126
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:19,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I only did 50%.

127
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:23,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Attorney Desmond, they need to endorse the plan, right?

128
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

129
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

130
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:26,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

131
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:27,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

132
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:34,768
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're also looking for a motion to endorse the plan and also authorize Alicia to sign on behalf of the board.

133
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:39,868
[SPEAKER_21]: I so move.

134
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:41,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ari.

135
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:41,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I have a second?

136
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second the motion.

137
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:49,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Annie.

00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,483
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

146
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:02,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

147
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

148
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,328
[SPEAKER_21]: And thanks, Danielle, for

149
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,194
[SPEAKER_21]: making sure we completed that task.

150
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:18,937
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we may have had additional people join the meeting.

151
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:26,419
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just going to make another quick plug while we have engaged and excited members of the community.

152
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:29,680
[SPEAKER_21]: You too can serve on the Community Development Board.

153
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,081
[SPEAKER_21]: There are

154
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:40,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Current vacancies, there will be vacancies starting July 1st, I believe, on this board.

155
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,692
[SPEAKER_21]: There are also other boards and commissions that have vacancies in Medford.

156
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:51,034
[SPEAKER_21]: So for those of you that have the capacity, time, family, health,

157
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:54,636
[SPEAKER_21]: mental load or otherwise.

158
00:13:54,656 --> 00:14:08,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I encourage you to look at the boards and commissions that have vacancies in the city of Medford to see how you too can contribute to making Medford more of the wonderful place that we all love to live in.

159
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:11,606
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, back off that soapbox.

160
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:14,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I promise I won't go back up there.

161
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,751
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to set the tone for this public hearing.

162
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,906
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not planning to vote on this agenda item this evening.

163
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:33,068
[SPEAKER_21]: We're planning to hear from our zoning consultant and his associates, and then we really want to hear from the public.

164
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:42,811
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to take some time for us as a board to process the feedback from the public, and we want to give ourselves, as well as you all, some time for these important decisions.

165
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:53,613
[SPEAKER_21]: So I encourage everybody to share your comment, write in letters, we already have a good collection in our project folder.

166
00:14:54,073 --> 00:15:02,401
[SPEAKER_21]: But I just want to flag that the focus of tonight is going to be hearing from Emily and Paola, and then hearing from the public.

167
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_21]: So just wanted to set the tone there.

168
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,143
[SPEAKER_21]: And now I need to do the fun official stuff.

169
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:15,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Because this is a new public hearing, I need to read the public hearing notice into the record.

170
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:17,927
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a long one.

171
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:26,190
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on April 2nd, 2025 after 6.30 p.m.

172
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:33,854
[SPEAKER_21]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed abetments to the city of Medford zoning ordinance and zoning map.

173
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:56,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend Section 94-2.1, Division into Districts, to add the Neighborhood Residential 1, NR1, Neighborhood Residential 2, NR2, Neighborhood Residential 3, NR3, Urban Residential 1, UR1, and Urban Residential 2, UR2 zoning districts.

[SPEAKER_21]: Amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, Table B, by incorporating NR1, NR2,

176
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:36,590
[SPEAKER_21]: NR3, UR1, and UR2 zoning districts into the existing table and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

177
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:44,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend section 94-12, definitions, to amend and add various definitions.

178
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:52,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Amending the zoning map to change the zoning district designations of various properties to the NR1, NR2, NR3,

179
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:03,345
[SPEAKER_21]: UR1 and UR2 zoning districts, as shown on a map entitled Proposed Residential Districts Prepared by Innes Associates.

180
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:10,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and team?

181
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Chair, I believe that Emily has

182
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:28,032
[SPEAKER_16]: built into her presentation, sufficient introductory comments about the process that we've been going through for anybody who might be new to it this evening.

183
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:29,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

184
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I will hand it off to Emily and Paola.

185
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:35,936
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

186
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:40,819
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe you have the correct permissions, but please flag it for us if you need anything.

187
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:43,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Madam Chair.

188
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everyone.

189
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:50,059
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, Emily Innes of Innes Associates, and I'm joined by my colleague Paola Ramos-Martinez.

190
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We are delighted to be back here in front of you again.

191
00:17:55,141 --> 00:18:00,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I share my screen, I do want to recognize, I can recognize some of the names on here.

192
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:03,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to see some familiar names.

193
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:11,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to let anybody know who came to the public meeting last week that they will see the same presentation.

194
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:19,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not because we're not listening, we absolutely are, but we wanted to hear the public input from this meeting as well.

195
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:36,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we already know in consultation with city planning staff that there will be some changes made to what you see tonight, but we didn't want to make some changes and then have people have to comment on those brand new changes with less than a week between the two meetings.

196
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've kept the presentation the same.

197
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:49,374
[SPEAKER_08]: We are very much looking at the input we received last week, and we are looking forward to hearing input this week that we will also take into consideration and see what changes that need to make.

198
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:56,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much, and I will now share my screen and walk you through this presentation.

199
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:17,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as you know, we have been coming sort of step by step with the with the zoning changes tonight we are talking to you about the residential only neighborhoods, and I'm going to just because I know there's going to be some people who are on this, this meeting at this meeting who have not seen this before.

200
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:34,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to walk through why we're doing this and where we are in the process a little bit and then after we talk about the neighborhood districts as we've done previously, we'll talk a little bit about how people can get their input into this process in addition to tonight's meeting.

201
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So this has been a multi-year process.

202
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The city started the recodification process in 2020.

203
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:45,505
[SPEAKER_08]: That lasted through 2022.

204
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:48,827
[SPEAKER_08]: The comprehensive plan development also started, it says 2020.

205
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:56,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little bit later than that, but that process was happening simultaneously.

206
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:02,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went back and forth between what was going on in the recodification and what was happening in the comprehensive plan.

207
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:06,479
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of future changes to the zoning.

208
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:16,707
[SPEAKER_08]: In early 2023, or late 2023, we started doing the urgent edits, unintended consequences, the city was working on that.

209
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:26,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we came in in 2024 to now to do the major sort of what was in the comprehensive plan, what was in the climate action and adaptation plan,

210
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,056
[SPEAKER_08]: and what implications does that have for zoning.

211
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:30,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been working on that.

212
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:44,963
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the graphic for the different aspects of the comprehensive plan that we're looking at, the overarching goals, and this is the zoning map from when we first started.

213
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:53,667
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what your zoning looked like, and we are taking it, a combination of geographic areas and topic areas throughout this whole process.

214
00:20:54,707 --> 00:21:12,597
[SPEAKER_08]: and were guided by the future land use map that was in the comprehensive plan, and that map had divided areas into neighborhoods, corridors, centers and squares, gateway nodes, civic and institutional anchors, and so we've been working our way through those as the geographic aspects.

215
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:15,337
[SPEAKER_08]: This is coming up to you.

216
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:16,938
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the corridors.

217
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:20,178
[SPEAKER_08]: We have already done the Mystic Avenue corridor.

218
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:22,139
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done the Salem Street neighborhood.

219
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:29,000
[SPEAKER_08]: We are now, we'll be discussing soon with you the squares.

220
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,701
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just talked about Medford Square with the City Council with the Planning and Permitting Committee.

221
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:36,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be talking about West Medford soon.

222
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:42,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we will be talking about these other areas ending up with Wellington at the end.

223
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But for today, we're talking about residential neighborhoods.

224
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:58,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And as part of that, back in July of 2024, we had done a workshop with the Planning and Permitting Committee and looked at a whole bunch of different data that we mapped.

225
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:03,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it was from MassGIS, some of it was from your assessor's data.

226
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:13,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to show you a couple, just a few of the maps tonight that we used in our planning process and our evaluation process.

227
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:19,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, when you're mapping things, it's not the same as being on the ground and it's not the same as community input.

228
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:29,934
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are really pleased that so many people joined us last week and also to see so many people on this call this week to continue to hear the community input portion of this.

229
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:33,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So this map that you're looking at now is what exists on the ground now.

230
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:48,196
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the single family in the light lavender, two family in the light teal color, condo conversion, three family, four to eight units in the blue, nine plus units in that deep purple.

231
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:57,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the things we want to know is what's on the ground now and what that means for thinking about what should be happening.

232
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:02,604
[SPEAKER_08]: As we've discussed before, zoning doesn't always match what's on the ground.

233
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:05,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So many of our New England communities were

234
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:22,310
[SPEAKER_08]: actually fully developed or mostly developed before zoning came into place, which the earliest is around the 1920s, the latest is late 60s, for the first time that zoning has been developed, so so many of our communities are older than that.

235
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:30,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So first we want to know what do you have, and then the comp plan, the comprehensive plan, some of the other things, let us know maybe what do you want.

236
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:49,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We also looked at some dimensional standards, so zoning isn't just about controlling the uses, but it's also about controlling how those uses are placed on the lot, how big are the buildings, where are the buildings in relationship to the street, where are they in relationship to each other, what's the lot size.

237
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:51,498
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a map of the lot size.

238
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,998
[SPEAKER_08]: The darker the color, the smaller the lot size.

239
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:56,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, these are existing lot sizes.

240
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So the darkest color is below 3,000 square feet.

241
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,660
[SPEAKER_08]: That red is 3,000 to 4,000.

242
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:04,781
[SPEAKER_08]: The orange is 4,000 to 5,000.

243
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:10,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And then sort of the paler colors as you go up, anything in that very pale yellow is over 10,000.

244
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:16,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're looking at the residential districts here, or primarily residential.

245
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:17,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have some of the commercial.

246
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:22,006
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that lets us know what the development pattern is in the area.

247
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:31,551
[SPEAKER_08]: It lets us know if we're thinking of lots that might be conforming in that they meet the current zoning versus non-conforming in that they don't meet the current zoning.

248
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:38,495
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of these smaller lot sizes are non-conforming and one of the considerations is how far do we go.

249
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:42,638
[SPEAKER_08]: to make as many buildings as possible conforming.

250
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Frontage also goes into that.

251
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:54,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So frontage is the distance, the length of the lot along the street, and it's expressed in feet.

252
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:59,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see there's a few actually where the frontage is under five, five to 20.

253
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:02,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of these are in the 36 to 100.

254
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,418
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some outliers, but again, this is a measure that we can use

255
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:11,602
[SPEAKER_08]: to understand how we should set the dimensional standards, if they should be changed at all.

256
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:17,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Height, this is a frequent topic of conversation in many communities, so we look at it.

257
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: The assessors does not have data for the height for all parcels.

258
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:31,197
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple, probably ones that have been recently redeveloped, and there's some that are vacant, so those have no building on them.

259
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,458
[SPEAKER_08]: But in general, you can see from 1 to 1.75,

260
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:48,708
[SPEAKER_08]: The bright yellow all the way up to the dark dark almost black 7 to 14 So again, we're looking at that range and that plays into how we think about the height of the districts This is a historic inventory.

261
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:53,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the things that we're adding to the zoning here is the ability to preserve

262
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:58,917
[SPEAKER_08]: or an incentive to keep and preserve historic residential buildings.

263
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:10,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk about that as we go zone by zone, but knowing where the historic inventory is, this is from MACRIS, which is the Massachusetts Historical Commission's online database.

264
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,111
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wanted to map those.

265
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, what's the location of transit?

266
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:17,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are the walk radii?

267
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:25,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So the quarter mile radius and the half mile radius are the distances that most people will walk to significant transit.

268
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:40,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we have those circles on here on the commuter rail and the T to understand where those walk radii, where those time limits factor in to where we should put housing.

269
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are some of the mapping considerations.

270
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:53,967
[SPEAKER_08]: All of those maps are online and so on the city's website, I think the link was in here earlier, I encourage people to look at them, but we just wanted to share some of them with you.

271
00:26:55,268 --> 00:27:02,332
[SPEAKER_08]: We did set up a list of considerations, a little list of factors and thinking about where housing should be located and how much.

272
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,494
[SPEAKER_08]: housing should be located where.

273
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:09,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So proximity to public transit is one of those.

274
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:16,963
[SPEAKER_08]: This map that you see on here, this diagram that you see on here is from the comprehensive plan, and it's a map of job density.

275
00:27:17,023 --> 00:27:20,245
[SPEAKER_08]: So where are people working relative to where they live?

276
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:30,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Thinking about lot sizes and topography, obviously buildings need a certain, you know, certain types of buildings need a certain amount of lot in order to be built.

277
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They need it for parking, they need it for amenities, so thinking about lot sizes and what factors into that, and also topography and going into access.

278
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,723
[SPEAKER_08]: There's quite a range of topography in Medford.

279
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:49,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Private ways, I'm going to show you a draft map on the next slide.

280
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:57,672
[SPEAKER_08]: The city has updated it for us, which is great, but it didn't make it into this presentation, but understanding where there are public roads and where there are private ways.

281
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:01,874
[SPEAKER_08]: existing residential types we've already talked about, and then the transitions.

282
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:16,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, as you know, we've worked on two corridors already, we're working on the squares, but the idea of what's happening in those areas and then how the uses, the height, whatever it might be that we're looking at transitions downward into the residential areas.

283
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:24,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But understanding that there are some residential only areas that bump right up against what we've been calling corridors or the squares that you'll see.

284
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:28,750
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to think about how the relationships happen for those.

285
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:41,876
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the map of the public ways, just so you know, and it's a little blurry on this, but the public streets are in the blue and the private ways are in green, so you can see there's a lot of private ways actually throughout Medford.

286
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:47,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So with all of that, we are proposing several different residential districts for you.

287
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the overall map of the residential districts.

288
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:55,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to break them down district by district.

289
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of the people who have been on the calls are professional planners.

290
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:02,166
[SPEAKER_08]: These are not your characteristic land use colors.

291
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:08,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Residential is generally yellow, but if you put this many shades of yellow on here, which we did try,

292
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: you go cross-eyed, so we were asked to break up the colors a little bit.

293
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:16,493
[SPEAKER_08]: So Neighborhood Residential 1 is that light yellow.

294
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Neighborhood Residential 2 is green.

295
00:29:19,954 --> 00:29:22,235
[SPEAKER_08]: The orange is Neighborhood Residential 3.

296
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:26,237
[SPEAKER_08]: The teal color down here is Urban Residential 1.

297
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And the red is urban residential too.

298
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to break each of those down.

299
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:38,969
[SPEAKER_08]: They have slightly different building types and number of units per building.

300
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:58,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And this map and again, I encourage you we will give this to the city So it will be online, but this map shows the different districts overlaid on what currently exists So once we drew the district as we were working with the planning and permitting committee, we were going back and forth It's okay.

301
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,077
[SPEAKER_08]: What's in there now?

302
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,658
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we suggesting be there?

303
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:02,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a match?

304
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there not a match and

305
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:15,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We heard, as I noted last week, that there were still some questions about, hey, we the members of the public who spoke here think there's a bit of a mismatch.

306
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:16,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you look at that more closely?

307
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:18,487
[SPEAKER_08]: We are absolutely doing that.

308
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:22,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do want to stress that we are still discussing this.

309
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:25,530
[SPEAKER_08]: We are absolutely open to new input, and we hope to hear that tonight.

310
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,392
[SPEAKER_08]: But this lets us sort of do that back and forth.

311
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, we can also overlay this on the other maps.

312
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about Neighborhood Residential 1.

313
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:36,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's this light yellow color.

314
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:49,687
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be a single-unit dwelling, a historic conversion, and of course ADUs because accessory dwelling units, which is the shorthand for that is ADU.

315
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a new state law.

316
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:57,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working on updating Medford's current accessory dwelling unit law.

317
00:30:57,473 --> 00:30:59,393
[SPEAKER_08]: to be consistent with the state law.

318
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:03,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So you won't have seen that language yet, we're still tweaking some of it.

319
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:12,356
[SPEAKER_08]: But an accessory dwelling unit is a smaller dwelling unit that is accessory to a principal residential use.

320
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:17,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this case, your principal residential use in this district would be single unit dwelling.

321
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:19,838
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have an accessory dwelling unit with that.

322
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see that, hopefully you can see, the historic conversion is at two units.

323
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is where we get into the preservation of historic buildings or historic residences, is the idea that by allowing one additional unit than the district allows, we would be more likely to have those buildings preserved.

324
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:46,778
[SPEAKER_08]: They're an important part of the historic development fabric of the city.

325
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a value to keeping those.

326
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:59,139
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a single-dwelling neighborhood, a single-unit neighborhood, allowing for a historic conversion of two units would help to preserve those buildings.

327
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are, you're going to see throughout the building types that we're talking about.

328
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:06,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So one-unit dwelling, that's detached.

329
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Historic conversion, so the same thing, but allowing up to two units.

330
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:23,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the accessory dwelling unit, I should note that the state law and obviously Medford's allows for accessory dwelling units within the dwelling itself.

331
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: So a single one-unit dwelling could have a smaller accessory dwelling unit in it.

332
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:33,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The diagram here is showing that it can also have a detached

333
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:41,916
[SPEAKER_08]: accessory dwelling unit, so another building on the lot that is that accessory dwelling unit, and there are standards and requirements around that.

334
00:32:42,977 --> 00:33:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Neighborhood residential two is broadly familiar, so also the single unit dwelling, a two unit dwelling at this stage, so that's the NR2 portion, historic conversion up to three units, and accessory dwelling unit, and you can see it on this map in green, a couple of different places.

335
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:09,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, in this we're just adding the two-unit dwelling, and two-unit dwellings can either be side-by-side.

336
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:13,479
[SPEAKER_08]: We're showing the side-by-side, we're showing the stacked, so one on top of each other.

337
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:29,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You could also have a two-unit dwelling that's back-to-back or L-shaped, but the idea is that it is a single building with two full dwelling units in it, not a single unit with an accessory dwelling unit, which is smaller, but two that may be the same size.

338
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,650
[SPEAKER_08]: and greater than the ADU requirements.

339
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:45,494
[SPEAKER_08]: This is neighborhood residential three in the orange here, single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, three unit dwelling, historic conversion up to four units, and of course accessory dwelling unit.

340
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:48,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And here you see the types.

341
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:59,610
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just added the three-unit dwelling, or you could have a townhouse with three townhouse units attached to each other, historic conversion up to four units, and then the ADU.

342
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:24,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Residential, so urban residential one rather, so this does not have the single unit dwelling and I should state that you already, although we've been trying to make as many parcels and buildings conforming as possible, you do have some protections in your existing ordinance which we would keep and possibly add to.

343
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:29,282
[SPEAKER_08]: You have protections for single unit and two unit dwellings already and they're quite good.

344
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:30,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were

345
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:37,950
[SPEAKER_08]: to remove as a use, as we're proposing in the urban residential one, a single unit dwelling.

346
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,754
[SPEAKER_08]: You could continue to live in that single unit dwelling.

347
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,537
[SPEAKER_08]: You could continue to invest in that single unit dwelling.

348
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:48,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You have protections under the law for that single unit.

349
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:50,105
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're just simply saying is that

350
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:56,412
[SPEAKER_08]: No new, on a vacant piece of property, no new single-family dwelling could be built.

351
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,934
[SPEAKER_08]: So just keep that in mind.

352
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:07,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Historic conversion up to five units for this one, the townhouse, the three-unit dwelling, and what we're calling a multiplex, which is four to six units.

353
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And here are how these would look.

354
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see the multiplex is that four to six.

355
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:22,130
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a smaller size, larger, obviously, than what we've been talking about, but not a full apartment building.

356
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:23,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just up to the six units.

357
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:30,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, Urban Residential 2, you'll see it scattered in some of these areas.

358
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:41,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Townhouse, three-unit dwelling, the multiplex of four to six units, and the multiple-unit dwelling of greater than six units, but three stories maximum.

359
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we did hear some, I mean, obviously we heard a lot of comments in the public meeting.

360
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:53,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We heard some people suggest maybe the multiplex could be a lower number of units in one district and the higher the other.

361
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:59,114
[SPEAKER_08]: We also heard concerns about heights, some too high, some saying, why aren't you going higher?

362
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:08,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So the why aren't we going higher is because these urban residential twos are primarily bumping up against the mixed use corridors and squares at this point.

363
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And those do allow that higher height.

364
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:16,945
[SPEAKER_08]: In many of the places that we looked, three is the current maximum for these areas.

365
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we've made it the maximum here.

366
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:23,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously we're still looking for public input on that.

367
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:28,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's how you can see the buildings sort of matching up.

368
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:36,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So the three unit, the townhouse, the historic conversion up to five, the multiplex, and the residential building, which would be more than six units.

369
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:41,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to stop there because this is the overview presentation.

370
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:48,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to let people know before I stop the entire presentation when else they can be heard.

371
00:36:48,345 --> 00:36:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I think many people on this call may have seen this before, but not everyone.

372
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:58,288
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the City Council's Planning and Permitting Committee to present a new topic.

373
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:05,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We are discussing it with that committee back and forth until it's ready to be referred to the Community Development Board.

374
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: The Community Development Board is, as they are tonight, holds a public hearing on it that may take more than one, again, as we're doing tonight, more than one meeting before they vote on the topic.

375
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:22,957
[SPEAKER_08]: That gives us, through city staff or in conjunction with city staff,

376
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:31,285
[SPEAKER_08]: to provide some recommendations based on what we've heard during the public hearing for the Community Development Board to consider.

377
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:36,370
[SPEAKER_08]: They then send a recommendation back to City Council, who then has a final vote.

378
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,855
[SPEAKER_08]: All of these are public meetings, and you can see the schedule that we've had up through today.

379
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:50,939
[SPEAKER_08]: here, so this has been the timeline for the Planning and Permitting Committee for this particular topic.

380
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,883
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been working on the others, so you can see that on April 9th we're going to be talking about West Medford Square.

381
00:37:57,923 --> 00:38:01,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been talking about Medford Square, and we're making some changes to that.

382
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:07,367
[SPEAKER_08]: April 30th, we're going to be introducing the other topics, and then in May, we're going to be talking about Wellington.

383
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:11,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are for the CD board meetings.

384
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:16,549
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about the green score in February, Salem Street in March, residential districts today.

385
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:24,772
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be introducing the commercial and mixed districts to you sometime in May, depending on your other things on your agenda.

386
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:28,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, we've been having public meetings, so February 10th,

387
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:36,459
[SPEAKER_08]: was a public listening session for Salem Street, last week was a public listening session for the residential districts.

388
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:47,089
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want, we're looking in April to do the squares, but we just want to confirm that the Planning and Permitting Committee is ready for us to do that, so we haven't set that date yet.

389
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, where anybody who's watching, where can you get more information?

390
00:38:54,196 --> 00:39:02,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Planning Development and Sustainability Department has a brand new web page with zoning, and there's a QR code to get you there.

391
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:07,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I have finished with my presentation.

392
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:20,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I think our goal, Paola's and my goal, is to listen, take notes, and then work with city staff and the Planning and Permitting Committee to come back to you with some additional recommendations based on what we've heard.

393
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:21,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you very much for your time.

394
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:24,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Emily.

395
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:25,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Paola.

396
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:26,424
[SPEAKER_21]: That was really informative.

397
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:33,526
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, just a quick audio note, Emily, your audio got very quiet towards the end.

398
00:39:33,546 --> 00:39:43,469
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard what you were saying, and I hope others did too, but I think it was just a wrap up.

399
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,570
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we're okay.

400
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,610
[SPEAKER_21]: But just flagging that.

401
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:55,078
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to do a quick break before we get into public comment, and then we will get started.

402
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:04,548
[SPEAKER_21]: If you anticipate participating in public comment, feel free to raise your hand now, and then we'll kind of get into things in about five minutes.

403
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,128
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's say 726.

404
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:05,709
[SPEAKER_21]: We shall return.

405
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:26,192
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we're going to get started shortly once members of the board are confirmed to be back and have their cameras on.

406
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:30,810
[SPEAKER_21]: I see a good number of hands already raised.

407
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:48,421
[SPEAKER_21]: For those of you who are fortunate enough to not know how Zoom works very intimately and need some help finding the raise hand function, you should have a React option, which is a heart on the desktop version of Zoom.

408
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:53,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Just click the heart, and then you will have an option to raise your hand.

409
00:40:55,423 --> 00:41:05,206
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're having any technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia, and I'll reiterate that right before we start.

410
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:15,630
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, we have Annie, Ari, Peter, and Emily.

411
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:15,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

412
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:22,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so usually we'll do a, like a board discussion.

413
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:26,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but if it's all right with the board, I'd like to go straight to the public hearing.

414
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I think that will help us have a more well-rounded discussion.

415
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:33,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, once we get there, does that work for everyone?

416
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:34,883
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

417
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:36,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing some thumbs nods.

418
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:36,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

419
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:39,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

420
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:44,348
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm now going to open the, wait, is Emily and Paolo back?

421
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:46,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Just want to make sure.

422
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:50,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, okay.

423
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:53,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, thank you.

424
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:56,106
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm now going to open the public comment period.

425
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,548
[SPEAKER_21]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

426
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:03,611
[SPEAKER_21]: You can also send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov.

427
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:07,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

428
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:17,041
[SPEAKER_21]: And a reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it's not part of the public record.

429
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:24,888
[SPEAKER_21]: If you are having audio or other technical difficulties, you can message Alicia or Danielle about those technical difficulties.

430
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Each participant, like we've done in the past, each participant is going to have two minutes to speak and will be able to speak once.

431
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:40,401
[SPEAKER_21]: If your comment doesn't fit within the two minute limit, I truly and deeply encourage you to email OCD at medford-ma.gov.

432
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:42,903
[SPEAKER_21]: with your comments.

433
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:46,646
[SPEAKER_21]: We read all public comments, and they do get added to public record.

434
00:42:47,186 --> 00:42:55,914
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some already in our folder from previous commenters, so thank you to everybody who's already provided their comment.

435
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:59,878
[SPEAKER_21]: And just because you've provided a written comment does not mean you can't speak tonight.

436
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:03,140
[SPEAKER_21]: So all the comments, please, please bring them on.

437
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,464
[SPEAKER_21]: And then one more note on written public comments.

438
00:43:08,884 --> 00:43:16,927
[SPEAKER_21]: So we would appreciate that all public comments via letter or email just be shared with us 24 hours in advance of the meeting where we're planning to vote.

439
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:26,491
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not planning on voting this evening, so it'll likely be 24 hours in advance of the Community Development Board meeting.

440
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:27,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's

441
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:36,348
[SPEAKER_21]: If we continue it to the 16th, you know, we would love to have comments in, you know, by 6pm on the 15th.

442
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:49,218
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just in recognition of, you know, most members of the board have families or jobs or other commitments, and we want to make sure to review all of the comments and insight that's shared with us in a timely manner.

443
00:43:54,406 --> 00:44:00,208
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I can manage the public comment queue for now, as long as I don't get kicked out like I did last time.

444
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:06,030
[SPEAKER_21]: But if that happens, we do have our vice chair, Peter Calves, that will step in.

445
00:44:09,332 --> 00:44:14,594
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, I see the first hand and you'll get a request to unmute.

446
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:23,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Please, Erica, please state your name and address for the record, and then Alicia will manage the timer.

447
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:27,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, thank you.

448
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:30,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Erica DeRoche, 260 Willis Avenue.

449
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:34,948
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to read a statement because I don't want to forget to say something.

450
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:39,029
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for indulging me.

451
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:52,617
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to say that I really appreciate that the planning consultant is presenting this more than once because I was not able to attend last week.

452
00:44:54,378 --> 00:45:05,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Just overall about the proposed neighborhood residential and urban residential zoning, I understand that NS Associates have studied existing uses.

453
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:17,598
[SPEAKER_18]: and existing buildings extensively, and a primary goal is to permit, as of right, the successful existing uses, masses and heights.

454
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:26,326
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just wanted to note that existing properties are not necessarily going to be affected by the zoning.

455
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:33,052
[SPEAKER_18]: They might be, but not necessarily, and I would urge

456
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:57,021
[SPEAKER_18]: community development board to consider the needs in the future, which the decision is going to affect for increased mix of uses and increased density overall, far above what I see currently being presented in the neighborhood districts or in the residential districts.

457
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:08,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Regarding dimensions and use, as a South Medford resident, most of my comments are going to be directly from my 18 years of living in South Medford.

458
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,971
[SPEAKER_18]: So they'll be in reference to that neighborhood.

459
00:46:13,693 --> 00:46:15,894
[SPEAKER_18]: The proposed zoning is NR3.

460
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:27,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And my opinion is that most of my neighborhood should probably be UR1 to allow for up to six units to be built.

461
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:40,140
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm less familiar with the NR1 and NR2 neighborhoods, but my opinion is there needs to be some more density in this neighborhood.

462
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a sound?

463
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:43,681
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.

464
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:44,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

465
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:54,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, my neighborhood is walking and transit-oriented neighborhood, and I think you could go higher and more dense overall.

466
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:56,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll email the rest of my comments.

467
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:57,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

468
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:58,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Erica.

469
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Look forward to reading those comments.

470
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:10,933
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Carlene.

471
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:12,834
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

472
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

473
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:20,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't unmute.

474
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:21,556
[SPEAKER_21]: You're unmuted.

475
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:22,256
[SPEAKER_21]: We can hear you.

476
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:23,516
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

477
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:24,237
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize.

478
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:24,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

479
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:24,537
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

480
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:28,006
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Carly Campbell-Haggerty.

481
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,667
[SPEAKER_25]: I live at 49 Elmont Street.

482
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,070
[SPEAKER_25]: I have emailed comments, but I'm going to do an abridged version tonight.

483
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,532
[SPEAKER_25]: My family has lived on Elmont Street for 47 years.

484
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:45,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Our neighborhood is a very diverse housing stock of 1, 2, 3, and sometimes 6 family homes.

485
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Because of this, we have an amazing community.

486
00:47:50,882 --> 00:47:55,626
[SPEAKER_25]: which is a lovely mix of young families, professionals, and strong senior population.

487
00:47:55,746 --> 00:48:04,613
[SPEAKER_25]: Each group contributes to making living, working, and raising a family a strong attribute in Medford.

488
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:09,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Therefore, we are asking you to not move forward with Urban 1 or Urban 2 zoning.

489
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,642
[SPEAKER_25]: for the following reasons.

490
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:21,026
[SPEAKER_25]: One, builders will be more incentivized to purchase more than one property and build larger apartments, condo buildings that can't be supported.

491
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:30,071
[SPEAKER_25]: Two, the loss of being able to replace a single family home after two years is the most ridiculous thing we've ever heard of.

492
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:35,033
[SPEAKER_25]: People should be able to purchase a home, demolish it, do whatever they want to it and keep it one family.

493
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:38,115
[SPEAKER_25]: We are not Cambridge who recently adopted this type of zoning.

494
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:43,846
[SPEAKER_25]: Three, young families will not be able to move into our neighborhood due to lack of housing stock.

495
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:53,892
[SPEAKER_25]: The majority of individuals moving in will be transit individuals who are living in Medford for a few years and then will move to other communities with a one family homes and a yard.

496
00:48:55,433 --> 00:49:05,940
[SPEAKER_25]: Three, the city has not followed its own capital plan that recommended completing traffic shadow parking and infrastructure studies.

497
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:12,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Four, the city has made it clear that they are going to change parking regulations.

498
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,878
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are these individuals going to park?

499
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Contrary to many people speaking at the last community meeting, not everyone has a driveway.

500
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:35,332
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you change the zoning for two, three family or six unit buildings, where will they park, especially during a snowstorm when all of the cars on the Fellsway come down and park on the side streets?

501
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:54,995
[SPEAKER_25]: And then five, the concept of more density bring more housing that people can't can't can't afford isn't true under this type of zoning contractors will put condos and get top dollar for them and apartments will be if their apartments will be an exorbitant amount of money at this

502
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,963
[SPEAKER_25]: This will price out our seniors, stop young families from moving in and living on Salem Street and change our neighborhood character.

503
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:04,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Last week- Marlene, you're at 30 seconds over.

504
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:06,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you mind finishing your last thought?

505
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:07,706
[SPEAKER_25]: My last statement is this.

506
00:50:08,026 --> 00:50:08,286
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

507
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:16,010
[SPEAKER_25]: Since this process has begun, it's been clear that the officials in Medford are listening to the residents who will directly be affected by these changes.

508
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:24,655
[SPEAKER_25]: We're hoping that tonight, you will be our voice and not allow zoning proposals of urban one or two in the Salem Street neighborhoods.

509
00:50:25,435 --> 00:50:25,835
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

510
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:28,077
[SPEAKER_25]: And thank you for letting me go a little older.

511
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:30,499
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it, Carlene.

512
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for your public comment.

513
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:37,185
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Fiona.

514
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:39,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Fiona, you're going to get a request to unmute.

515
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:41,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

516
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

517
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:43,928
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Fiona.

518
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:45,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Mommy 24 Bower Street, Medford.

519
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Um as a resident of West Medford neighborhood, I support the zoning initiative and I think everyone who has been working on it.

520
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:59,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to urgently increase our housing potential in Medford, and I'm in support of

521
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this proposal is a step in the right direction, but I would encourage going even further to add additional height and density by right, especially in residential areas and around T stops.

522
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:23,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this will help keep Medford residents in Medford and welcome new neighbors.

523
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:24,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

524
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:28,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Fiona.

525
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:34,117
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Jeremy Martin.

526
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeremy, you're going to get a request to unmute.

527
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:39,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

528
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to see you again.

529
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:45,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I can't hear you.

530
00:51:52,155 --> 00:51:52,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?

531
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:54,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you now.

532
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:54,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

533
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:59,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's nice to be in front of you all for hopefully a less contentious conversation.

534
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

535
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:02,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

536
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:10,535
[SPEAKER_00]: thank Emily and Paola and the city staff who have been championing this.

537
00:52:11,636 --> 00:52:18,101
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really difficult and often thankless process, and it's very important for our city, so really appreciate it.

538
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:27,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm generally supportive of the increased density in the current proposal, but I think it does fall short in a couple of areas that I just want to touch on.

539
00:52:27,088 --> 00:52:29,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mentioned tonight that

540
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:44,284
[SPEAKER_00]: single family use, single family by right would be removed in the UR1 and UR2 zones, but that many of the non-conforming homes in these neighborhoods would have a variance or a waiver.

541
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:47,046
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some kind of process to be able to replace your home.

542
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:50,770
[SPEAKER_00]: In the four meetings around this that I've been to,

543
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:57,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still not heard a clear, concise list of what those criteria are or how that process would work.

544
00:52:57,562 --> 00:53:03,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'd be really beneficial for the community and this board to have more clarity on that.

545
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:10,906
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not get in a situation where down the line somebody who thought they were going to have some kind of capability is then limited.

546
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:26,137
[SPEAKER_00]: To that point, I think that this neighborhood is unique, at least to us, in that it's a lot of small lots, a lot of small houses, and it's really hard to see, for us now, a sixplex in the neighborhood.

547
00:53:26,317 --> 00:53:27,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's a potential for it.

548
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:47,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, though, at the same time we can acknowledge the scale and the existing character, which is one of the founding goals and principles of this process, to recognize that there are single-family homes and that those people should be allowed to have some clear process to do that.

549
00:53:47,526 --> 00:53:51,047
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I'll say is that as the map is drawn now in the Hillside neighborhood,

550
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,429
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses George Street and Winthrop Street as a dividing line.

551
00:53:54,809 --> 00:54:00,592
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor right on the other side of George Street being able to have more buy right options than me on this side is silly.

552
00:54:00,992 --> 00:54:15,500
[SPEAKER_00]: People walk from far farther than the quarter mile radius to get to the T, and so that line really needs to be re-evaluated so that there's equity and really a balanced approach in these neighborhoods.

553
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:16,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.

554
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:17,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jeremy.

555
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,666
[SPEAKER_21]: And then just quick for the record, your name and address.

556
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:21,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

557
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:23,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Martin, 65 Burgadette.

558
00:54:24,008 --> 00:54:24,428
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

559
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:25,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Emily.

560
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,430
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I have is Navare.

561
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,211
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

562
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:35,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

563
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:42,278
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi there, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

564
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:53,146
[SPEAKER_33]: Basically, I support this, I think it's reasonable and good, but please, I would suggest you do in fact increase some of the heights, perhaps up to six stories or something like that, and you are one and you are two.

565
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,747
[SPEAKER_33]: We talked about you are one.

566
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:59,212
[SPEAKER_33]: That's a GLX, Magoon Square, Ball Square type of situation.

567
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:00,173
[SPEAKER_33]: That's where I live.

568
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,558
[SPEAKER_33]: Why should our neighborhood be held back in terms of height?

569
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:09,483
[SPEAKER_33]: Because of something to do with the MX1, MX2, or MX1 that Emily mentioned.

570
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:13,367
[SPEAKER_33]: As of now, MX1, MX2, those are sort of Salem Street things.

571
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:15,268
[SPEAKER_33]: That's not near here.

572
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:27,794
[SPEAKER_33]: If the community wants height in GLX, Magoon Square, type areas like where I live, then maybe the heights in our corridors need to be a little taller than what was done on Salem Street.

573
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,596
[SPEAKER_33]: The existing MX2, etc, etc.

574
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:32,217
[SPEAKER_33]: All these numbers and letters.

575
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:37,216
[SPEAKER_33]: NR1 and NR2 areas, those are really low density as proposed.

576
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:45,361
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that especially in the northwestern part of Medford, we can get rid of those and upscale them.

577
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:49,444
[SPEAKER_33]: NR1, NR2, NR2 becomes NR3, whatever makes sense.

578
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:55,207
[SPEAKER_33]: But we don't need so much NR1 and NR2, I think, and I think it's good if we have more housing across the city.

579
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:05,317
[SPEAKER_33]: I would also suggest that you consider, you know, create some kind of middle ground between NR3 and UR1, some NR4.

580
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:07,258
[SPEAKER_33]: I think I heard that mentioned at the Q&A.

581
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:08,158
[SPEAKER_33]: I like that idea.

582
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:14,882
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe move all of the NR3 that's south of the river into this new NR4, so it's not quite as big of a jump from 6 to 3.

583
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:17,263
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe a few other areas like around West Bedford Square.

584
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:18,284
[SPEAKER_33]: I see I've run out of time.

585
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:21,465
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you very much for indulging the- We still have 20 more seconds.

586
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:22,926
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, it's still going down.

587
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:23,987
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, thank you very much.

588
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:25,908
[SPEAKER_33]: So I was going to say the NR4,

589
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:27,262
[SPEAKER_33]: that I propose.

590
00:56:27,322 --> 00:56:32,546
[SPEAKER_33]: I could go like south of the river at R3 and maybe a little bit around West Bedford Square or something like that.

591
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:32,946
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

592
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:37,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, William.

593
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:38,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your comments.

594
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:48,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, just quick note, we do have the two minute limit, but we typically encourage or I typically encourage people to kind of finish their thought.

595
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:54,574
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, unless you hear the beep noise, just keep going.

596
00:56:54,634 --> 00:56:59,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you start to go over, I'll do a polite little check in.

597
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:05,298
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it gets less polite, the longer it goes on, but we try to avoid that.

598
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:11,040
[SPEAKER_21]: And the two minute is to help kind of with equity for people's comments.

599
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:17,509
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, if you exceed the two minutes, you can always email comments because we do see those.

600
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,871
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Zachary.

601
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:23,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

602
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,864
[SPEAKER_32]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almont Street.

603
00:57:27,204 --> 00:57:32,167
[SPEAKER_32]: And Madam Chair, I apologize, my camera driver is not responding, otherwise I would be on camera.

604
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:33,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you're good.

605
00:57:33,628 --> 00:57:43,093
[SPEAKER_32]: I also want to say that I appreciate the plug for the qualifications for the CD board and also, you know, stating what the typical qualifications are and encouraging people to give back that way.

606
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:50,615
[SPEAKER_32]: I have some continued engineering concerns around what's gone into this, but I will send those over in writing to the CD board.

607
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:52,976
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's a better, more equitable way to discuss those.

608
00:57:53,716 --> 00:58:12,401
[SPEAKER_32]: What I wanted to ask Emily, Innes, and Paola about is that with regard to the planned residential density changes, I still have some real reservations around the density imbalances that are continuing to pull density away from existing non-vehicular alternative transit modes, some of what some of the other speakers have noted tonight.

609
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:25,052
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's starting to pull density, particularly in those you are one and two zones away from the closest distance to be considered under past regulations, including the MBTA Communities Act.

610
00:58:25,913 --> 00:58:29,656
[SPEAKER_32]: That's been brought up in previous proposals, even going back to Salem Street.

611
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,938
[SPEAKER_32]: And no, I am not looking to reopen that at this time.

612
00:58:34,379 --> 00:59:02,246
[SPEAKER_32]: As a caveat, I want to restate that I've been consistent in my own participation that I'm not against increased density, but that the nature of the current proposal with some continued reservations about incomplete assessments continues to show up in things like that density being pulled away from the transit nodes and some of the density imbalances that are showing between some of the single unit residential zones and where the multi-unit is being sort of squeezed and wedged in.

613
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,687
[SPEAKER_32]: Again, any further light on that would be great.

614
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,349
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's all I wanted to discuss in this meeting.

615
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:08,769
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

616
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,830
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Zachary.

617
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your thoughtful comments, as always.

618
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:21,254
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that we have is Cheryl R. You're going to get a request to unmute.

619
00:59:22,555 --> 00:59:28,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And then just Cheryl, real quick before you start, Alicia or Danielle, are either of you managing the timer?

620
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:29,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that something you would like me to do?

621
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:32,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm doing it.

622
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:33,265
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

623
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:35,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not showing up in your little.

624
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:37,527
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not showing up today.

625
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:43,049
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was in the past, but I did not see it for Zachary's comment.

626
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:45,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it make a difference if my camera is off?

627
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,870
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

628
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me try it.

629
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to start it now, and then I'll restart it.

630
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:51,792
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

631
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:53,313
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not seeing it.

632
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:54,313
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see it.

633
00:59:55,165 --> 00:59:57,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I turn my camera on, you are- I do see it.

634
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

635
00:59:58,067 --> 00:59:59,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's the issue.

636
00:59:59,068 --> 00:59:59,528
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

637
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:00,269
[SPEAKER_28]: Alicia, I saw it.

638
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:05,052
[SPEAKER_28]: It comes up in the top corner of my screen, but not in your little square.

639
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, when I turned my camera off.

640
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:12,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, when your camera's off, it showed up in the top right corner, but just not in your square.

641
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:13,659
[SPEAKER_16]: On your screen, okay.

642
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:13,839
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

643
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry for the troubleshooting.

644
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:17,402
[SPEAKER_28]: No problem.

645
01:00:17,582 --> 01:00:21,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Putting a heat pack on, and I just thought it would be more appropriate to turn my camera off.

646
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,847
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, we're all humans, I think, at this point.

647
01:00:27,242 --> 01:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_21]: We all still have human needs.

648
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:32,005
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much for understanding as we work through that.

649
01:00:32,906 --> 01:00:34,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

650
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,107
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you hear me?

651
01:00:36,147 --> 01:00:37,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I didn't get a request on mute.

652
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:38,309
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, great.

653
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:39,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you.

654
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:39,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

655
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,651
[SPEAKER_26]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

656
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:52,737
[SPEAKER_26]: So I was distressed to see that the Glenwood Sand Street area again finds itself being zoned for the highest residential density despite our lack of transit and small lots.

657
01:00:53,525 --> 01:01:02,692
[SPEAKER_26]: We were told all areas were being made more dense, but the reality is that many neighborhoods within the transit circles are being zoned less densely than we are.

658
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Our neighborhood is one of the only ones that doesn't have multiple zones.

659
01:01:07,616 --> 01:01:16,143
[SPEAKER_26]: While the South side of Salem Street is currently SF2 and is less dense than the North side, both are set to be the highest neighborhood density.

660
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:19,345
[SPEAKER_26]: The South side would more appropriately be zoned as NR2.

661
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:27,663
[SPEAKER_26]: More distressing is that NR3 has the smallest minimum lot size with the largest allowance for housing.

662
01:01:28,304 --> 01:01:35,050
[SPEAKER_26]: As the lot sizes increase in the zones, the amount of housing allowed actually decreases.

663
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:43,397
[SPEAKER_26]: The decrease is so sharp that NR1 in some cases has literally no change beyond the state required ADU.

664
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:50,877
[SPEAKER_26]: If density is a good, then why are the areas with the largest lot sizes going to add the least density?

665
01:01:51,518 --> 01:01:57,580
[SPEAKER_26]: The changes to those areas would happen much more slowly, even if they were made more dense in the zoning.

666
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,622
[SPEAKER_26]: The Glenwood area will change more rapidly given the sharp increase in what is allowed here on very small lots.

667
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:07,103
[SPEAKER_26]: We already have a very active flipper.

668
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:20,470
[SPEAKER_26]: who is currently using the zoning to add two million plus each townhouses per lot, and the idea of him being allowed three plus a possible two ADUs will be far more enticing and profitable.

669
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:30,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Please consider changing at least some sections of our NR3 to NR2, especially as there are many single family homes on the south side of Salem Street.

670
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:39,758
[SPEAKER_26]: Please do not zone us at or greater density than our neighbors who live in transit rich areas and those with much larger lots.

671
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:41,059
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

672
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Cheryl.

673
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate the thoughtful comments as always.

674
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:53,564
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Charles Fenton.

675
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:55,184
[SPEAKER_21]: You're gonna get a request to unmute.

676
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:57,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

677
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:02,613
[SPEAKER_23]: Looks like I'm already unmuted.

678
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:05,135
[SPEAKER_21]: You are, and I hear some music in the background.

679
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:07,537
[SPEAKER_23]: That's channel 43, sorry.

680
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,659
[SPEAKER_23]: You're good.

681
01:03:09,979 --> 01:03:14,083
[SPEAKER_23]: I sent an email, but I figured I'd back it up with some comments.

682
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:17,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you please state your name and address for the record?

683
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:23,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Charles Benson, 26 Kearney Street, in the densest neighborhood in Medford.

684
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:25,932
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to state,

685
01:03:27,023 --> 01:03:32,246
[SPEAKER_23]: that I am against zoning West Medford and Lawrence Estates to only NR1.

686
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:45,975
[SPEAKER_23]: I feel that if other areas of Medford are being packed and denser zoning, then the other areas of Medford should use the packed zoning standards that are being pushed to the Salem Street corridor.

687
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:52,900
[SPEAKER_23]: I am for setting West Medford and Lawrence Estates at a minimum of NR2.

688
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:58,386
[SPEAKER_23]: And I sent an email with this information and I'm done.

689
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:04,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

690
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:08,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I appreciate you following up your written comments with the public hearing.

691
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:14,575
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's helpful for other people to hear what comments come through if they haven't read the comments themselves.

692
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:16,596
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you, Charles.

693
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:17,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate that.

694
01:04:17,757 --> 01:04:18,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

695
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:22,424
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Caitlin.

696
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:24,185
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

697
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

698
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Caitlin Robinson.

699
01:04:32,972 --> 01:04:34,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at 31 Everett Street.

700
01:04:35,574 --> 01:04:45,202
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to say thank you to the Community Development Board for your time and dedication, as well as to city staff and Enos Associates for all the work that's going into this plan.

701
01:04:46,043 --> 01:04:47,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm generally in support of the plan.

702
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:49,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a step in the right direction.

703
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:59,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some concerns about not going far enough with increases in density.

704
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:05,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I am in the Glenwood area is currently zoned for NR3.

705
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:11,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that NR3 should be a minimum citywide.

706
01:05:11,305 --> 01:05:18,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like NR1 and NR2 are just too low for planning for future zoning.

707
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:40,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to reiterate my concern about parking minimums, which I know are not being addressed at this time, but I am still deeply concerned about how those minimums, if they stay as they are, are going to prevent the intentions behind the zoning, how they might prevent that kind of development from happening.

708
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:45,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And another comment that I heard someone say earlier

709
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:54,188
[SPEAKER_01]: um, was in regard to like the circles around transit and the distance from transit and how we should be thinking about that.

710
01:05:54,228 --> 01:06:04,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that we do need to be think when we think about major transit centers, um, a quarter mile or half mile, I think is just not enough.

711
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:11,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I live in Glenwood, but I regularly walk to both the Malden center orange line and Medford tough screen line.

712
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also many options for micro micro mobility.

713
01:06:16,374 --> 01:06:20,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so expensive to live next to a major transit center.

714
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:28,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it makes sense to, you know, a lot of people are just are not able to live very close to a major transit center.

715
01:06:28,377 --> 01:06:34,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would still be helpful to have density in our neighborhoods and not need parking minimums too.

716
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:35,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

717
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:37,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Caitlin.

718
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Really appreciate the comments.

719
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:48,648
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Michael von Korff.

720
01:06:48,868 --> 01:06:50,429
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

721
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

722
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:54,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Michael von Korff.

723
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:59,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 44 Pitcher Ave in West Medford.

724
01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:04,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad to see how the current rezoning is going to make it easier to build more homes in Medford.

725
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But like a lot of other folks tonight, I wish it went further.

726
01:07:08,939 --> 01:07:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want Medford to be a place where my kids can afford to live.

727
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:14,663
[SPEAKER_02]: when they grow up.

728
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:18,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my kid's teacher to be able to afford a home here.

729
01:07:18,345 --> 01:07:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: If that means a fourplex in my neighborhood, of course I want that.

730
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:32,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If that means four stories in homes in my neighborhood, which is currently neighborhood residential three, of course I want that.

731
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:41,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And more density is a change, and we should change thoughtfully, but I don't think we can afford to change slowly.

732
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree there was an earlier speaker who suggested that maybe a single family could continue to be allowed by right in some of the places in Medford where this new zoning would disallow that.

733
01:07:52,777 --> 01:08:01,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for allowing people to build what they want to build, as long as we can get more places where there's permission to build more.

734
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

735
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:04,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Michael.

736
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:05,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your comments.

737
01:08:08,577 --> 01:08:12,158
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that we have is Gaston Fiore.

738
01:08:12,178 --> 01:08:14,519
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

739
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

740
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,702
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

741
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:23,703
[SPEAKER_29]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Signet Road.

742
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:26,724
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanted to comment that

743
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:35,324
[SPEAKER_29]: So when people say that for NR1, then we're not going beyond the state law of an ADU, that's incorrect.

744
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:56,176
[SPEAKER_29]: So the way that the zoning is being discussed right now, we will have, in addition to the protected ADU, which is by the way, 900 square feet, which is a two bedroom apartment allowed, we also have a local ADU, which requires special permit, but it's still allowed, which is 1,200 square feet, which is a three bedroom apartment, which means that combining two of them

745
01:08:57,406 --> 01:09:03,388
[SPEAKER_29]: we could have a 2,100 square foot additional structure per lot in NR1.

746
01:09:04,048 --> 01:09:14,630
[SPEAKER_29]: That, to me, if you go to areas of West Medford versus States and North Medford, that's gonna, if everyone did that, or most people did that, would completely change the character of the neighborhood.

747
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:17,971
[SPEAKER_29]: So it is not true that we're not going beyond the state law.

748
01:09:19,182 --> 01:09:25,167
[SPEAKER_29]: And second, I think that we should differentiate between West Medford and let's say like North Metro Lawrence State.

749
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:36,135
[SPEAKER_29]: So where I live, I'm two miles from every transit, either from Malden T Station, the orange line, from the Medford, Tufts Green Line Station, or the commuter rail, actually.

750
01:09:36,915 --> 01:09:39,437
[SPEAKER_29]: Same car park I actually just mapped it.

751
01:09:39,477 --> 01:09:45,802
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you were to walk to Malden T Station, it's 1.6 miles, 1.6 miles shortest path by walking.

752
01:09:47,702 --> 01:09:54,265
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, we, the only means of efficient means of transportation we have is either biking or driving a car.

753
01:09:54,745 --> 01:09:58,206
[SPEAKER_29]: And some people cannot bike or they don't want to bike, particularly in the winter.

754
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:09,431
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, if we increase density too much around these areas that we're too much from public transportation, how we're going to get to work, how we're going to go to places, there's going to be a lot of cars.

755
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:11,612
[SPEAKER_29]: We have private waste as well.

756
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:17,519
[SPEAKER_29]: So how are we going to handle that, too, compared to public waste, right?

757
01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:19,160
[SPEAKER_29]: So how much can we actually change that?

758
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,742
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, I can't even get the city to repave my private way.

759
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:28,106
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's most of my input, and I will send more comments through email.

760
01:10:28,126 --> 01:10:29,968
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for letting us speak up.

761
01:10:30,048 --> 01:10:30,528
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks so much.

762
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:32,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Gaston.

763
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,451
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the comments.

764
01:10:37,078 --> 01:10:39,239
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have is Kate.

765
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:41,400
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

766
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

767
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:46,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Kate Ryan.

768
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:47,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

769
01:10:47,363 --> 01:10:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: 34 Warren Street.

770
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:53,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to be outright here and say what people haven't.

771
01:10:53,706 --> 01:10:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm speaking purely from self-interest here.

772
01:10:56,588 --> 01:10:59,469
[SPEAKER_07]: As a wheelchair user, I can't visit any of my friends' homes.

773
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:04,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you zone to four stories or higher, they will build things that are

774
01:11:05,092 --> 01:11:10,995
[SPEAKER_07]: have elevators, which they do not do if it's three stories or lower, and I will be able to visit more places.

775
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:19,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of those who are arguing that it is too much change, so was the internet, so was penicillin, so was an awful lot of stuff like indoor plumbing.

776
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:23,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if you want to not do the zoning changes, that's fine.

777
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:26,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to all go back to like the single-family houses, that's fine.

778
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:30,246
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe consider just giving up your indoor plumbing at the same time.

779
01:11:30,326 --> 01:11:30,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

780
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:34,728
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, the accessibility, people are getting older.

781
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:39,531
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are very lucky, you will live long enough to be disabled.

782
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:50,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I cannot emphasize enough how very few places I can access in Medford in my wheelchair, including the vast majority of houses.

783
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:54,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So I urge you to go bigger, to go denser, to go taller.

784
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:57,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want more elevators.

785
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:00,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Kate.

786
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:05,608
[SPEAKER_21]: That's really helpful perspective and maybe something that people don't consider on a day-to-day basis.

787
01:12:05,648 --> 01:12:09,569
[SPEAKER_21]: So really appreciate you sharing those public comments.

788
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,090
[SPEAKER_21]: The next public commenter that I see, it's all one word.

789
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:22,551
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm gonna assume where the first name and last name breaks is Kyle Eaton.

790
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:24,931
[SPEAKER_21]: You're gonna get a request to unmute.

791
01:12:25,952 --> 01:12:27,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

792
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:33,261
[SPEAKER_31]: It is Kyle Eaton, and I live at 168 Sheridan Avenue.

793
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:36,063
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm really, really happy that this is happening.

794
01:12:36,243 --> 01:12:37,324
[SPEAKER_31]: This is really great.

795
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:39,846
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate all the work that you guys are doing on this.

796
01:12:40,806 --> 01:12:42,828
[SPEAKER_31]: I've lived in an apartment in Medford for eight years.

797
01:12:43,628 --> 01:12:47,270
[SPEAKER_31]: Our neighborhood definitely needs more housing stock, for sure.

798
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:53,214
[SPEAKER_31]: I strongly support increasing the density here in my neighborhood and everywhere in the city.

799
01:12:55,196 --> 01:12:58,978
[SPEAKER_31]: I echo the previous commenters that higher high limits are a great idea.

800
01:12:59,778 --> 01:13:06,162
[SPEAKER_31]: Limiting it now for the foreseeable future seems not very future oriented.

801
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:13,326
[SPEAKER_31]: I also think that keeping large swaths of the city as single family housing only is

802
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:16,869
[SPEAKER_31]: is not the right idea as well.

803
01:13:17,469 --> 01:13:24,438
[SPEAKER_31]: We, like I said, we definitely need more density and limiting it artificially there, I think is a bad idea.

804
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:33,188
[SPEAKER_31]: Also echo the concerns about parking minimums continuing to block development, although that's as the previous commenter said not something handling now.

805
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:39,311
[SPEAKER_31]: On the short distance from major transit hubs, I regularly walk to Malden Center.

806
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:46,453
[SPEAKER_31]: We also have buses in many areas of the city that I used to get around without me and my wife only have one car.

807
01:13:46,473 --> 01:13:55,757
[SPEAKER_31]: So I don't think it's a requirement that we have assumed that every person that moves here needs a car, even if they aren't within a half mile of the major hubs.

808
01:13:56,457 --> 01:13:57,237
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

809
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:58,318
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate it.

810
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:00,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Kyle.

811
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:01,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your comments.

812
01:14:03,712 --> 01:14:06,274
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Eunice Brown.

813
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,315
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

814
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

815
01:14:11,818 --> 01:14:12,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thanks.

816
01:14:12,558 --> 01:14:13,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

817
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:23,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to be speaking mainly on my area, which is kind of known as the lower hillside.

818
01:14:24,466 --> 01:14:25,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have three points.

819
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:40,182
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, regarding narrow roads and access, at the Q&A last week, I think the consultant mentioned that one of the reasons that the NR1 areas are remaining as such

820
01:14:40,761 --> 01:14:42,843
[SPEAKER_10]: is due to the narrow roads and access.

821
01:14:44,024 --> 01:14:52,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That included areas like the Heights, the Lawrence Estates, West Medford, utterly all the more affluent areas where there's the highest voter turnout.

822
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:57,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, the Lower Hellside is proposed for the increased density of UR1.

823
01:14:58,156 --> 01:15:02,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have extremely narrow roads with access issues too.

824
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:12,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been told by members of the Medford Fire Department that Greenleaf Avenue and the surrounding area is one of the worst streets and areas for the MFD to travel.

825
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:23,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen that myself, having had the fire department here at my home on a few occasions, and it was definitely borne out during a massive house fire on Greenleaf in December of 2023.

826
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:33,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Listening to the scanner that morning, Dispatch was faced with access issues from the firefighters trying to get to the scene.

827
01:15:33,177 --> 01:15:42,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anyone bothered to consult with the MFD to see how the increased density and more cars might impact their ability to get through the area?

828
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Four to six unit multiplexes.

829
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:50,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, there's been a mention of protecting the culture of the neighborhoods.

830
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:59,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding four to six unit multiplexes do not fit in this area, either with the character of the neighborhood or the current density.

831
01:15:59,628 --> 01:16:04,310
[SPEAKER_10]: It also poses parking problems because there's more cars than driveways currently.

832
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And the third thing is tufts.

833
01:16:08,285 --> 01:16:10,106
[SPEAKER_10]: We know Tufts is not a good neighbor.

834
01:16:10,586 --> 01:16:13,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We just went through that a couple of months ago with the dorm proposal.

835
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:22,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Community development could have been better, and they certainly did not do a good job of that.

836
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:23,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Matter of fact, Ms.

837
01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:31,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Hederman, you said yourself that after the dorm vote was taken, I hope to never see a proposal like that before this board ever again.

838
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:36,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Any zoning proposal made for the hillside area has got to be Tufts proof.

839
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:44,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to be bulletproof to protect the neighborhood and not have a single loophole that Tufts can exploit to build as they wish.

840
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,812
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have the Dover amendment hanging over us this time.

841
01:16:47,972 --> 01:16:49,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford has that control.

842
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:54,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Exercise it and protect the Medford, the hillside neighborhood.

843
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:56,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I still have time?

844
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,681
[SPEAKER_21]: You're about 45 seconds over.

845
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll email the rest.

846
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:02,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks very much.

847
01:17:03,504 --> 01:17:04,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

848
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:08,286
[SPEAKER_21]: I like your sentiment about being Tufts-proof.

849
01:17:08,827 --> 01:17:16,531
[SPEAKER_21]: My hope is that they will be a better neighbor in the future, but, you know, we, yeah, I see you, Lori.

850
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:19,732
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you can't plan on a hope.

851
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:26,038
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I see is Laurel Ruma.

852
01:17:26,278 --> 01:17:27,999
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

853
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

854
01:17:31,202 --> 01:17:32,183
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Laurel Ruma.

855
01:17:32,243 --> 01:17:38,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 149 Burgett Avenue in the same neighborhood as both Lori and Eunice.

856
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:41,790
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you very much for taking our notes today.

857
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:47,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Mike and I wrote a letter that gets into more of the detail of the things that we want to address.

858
01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:49,996
[SPEAKER_17]: So please have a read at that.

859
01:17:51,377 --> 01:17:52,518
[SPEAKER_17]: And before

860
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,844
[SPEAKER_17]: We know you for most recent things.

861
01:17:55,605 --> 01:18:02,331
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually spent 12 years working on the Green Line extension as a representative of the city to bring the Green Line to Medford, and it's great.

862
01:18:02,592 --> 01:18:04,613
[SPEAKER_17]: It's here, it's literally in my backyard.

863
01:18:05,154 --> 01:18:08,117
[SPEAKER_17]: They took part of my backyard to do it like I'm all for it.

864
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:17,585
[SPEAKER_17]: So now I know it's here, all the chickens have come home to roost and everybody wants more dense housing around the Green Line station at Tufts and Ball Square.

865
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:18,867
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

866
01:18:18,947 --> 01:18:33,543
[SPEAKER_17]: We're totally for it, but we would also like the flexibility of keeping the option of single family homes here in the neighborhood just because then it gives us the opportunity to go from six floors to one floor to whatever needs to be in the in between.

867
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:40,090
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that I would like to say is that the MBTA does

868
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:45,639
[SPEAKER_17]: declare the accessibility of train stations to be half a mile.

869
01:18:46,259 --> 01:18:53,402
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you look at the current zoning maps, I call it the lower hillside bullseye because it is a quarter mile circle that's been drawn.

870
01:18:53,922 --> 01:19:00,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's, as Jeremy said, from George Street to Winthrop Street, all the interior neighborhoods, streets.

871
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:05,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And the issue with that is this is the densest part of the lower hillside.

872
01:19:05,426 --> 01:19:06,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Our streets are very narrow.

873
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:08,988
[SPEAKER_17]: We call it the Warren for a reason.

874
01:19:09,468 --> 01:19:11,148
[SPEAKER_17]: because fire trucks can't make it down.

875
01:19:11,508 --> 01:19:14,049
[SPEAKER_17]: If two cars are parked on the same side, like forget it.

876
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is another issue of this neighborhood.

877
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:29,432
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we expand the you are one designation past that the half mile designation that the MBTA gives it broadens the opportunities for everyone to take, you know, have a part of this density story.

878
01:19:29,453 --> 01:19:31,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, as does

879
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,017
[SPEAKER_17]: getting rid of NR1s.

880
01:19:34,497 --> 01:19:36,259
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is an opportunity for everyone.

881
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:46,908
[SPEAKER_17]: So NR1 should be struck from the record and everyone should have an opportunity to participate in making Medford more dense with more housing opportunities for everyone.

882
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:48,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

883
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:49,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Laurel.

884
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,793
[SPEAKER_21]: And thanks for your work on the Green Line Extension.

885
01:19:53,553 --> 01:19:57,657
[SPEAKER_21]: I worked for the city of Somerville when we were trying to get some of that off the

886
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:01,634
[SPEAKER_21]: out of contracts and into execution.

887
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:05,657
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really appreciate your work on that and very insightful comments.

888
01:20:05,778 --> 01:20:06,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

889
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,541
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Tara.

890
01:20:11,122 --> 01:20:13,043
[SPEAKER_21]: You're gonna get a request to unmute.

891
01:20:13,263 --> 01:20:15,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

892
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:19,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, thank you, Madam Chairman.

893
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:24,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Address is 397 High Street in West Bedford.

894
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:27,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I am within the half a mile of the commuter rail.

895
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:34,460
[SPEAKER_06]: like to speak to specifically the historic conversion aspect.

896
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in a historic house.

897
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:46,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do not believe, well, first of all, let me characterize in West Medford alone, historic houses can be quite small.

898
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:51,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can also be bigger than many houses I've ever seen.

899
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:53,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is an enormous,

900
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:58,611
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity of housing stock in the historic conversion.

901
01:20:59,672 --> 01:21:10,687
[SPEAKER_06]: In order to incentivize owners to preserve those historic houses, I think it needs to be more aggressive in terms of the units.

902
01:21:11,919 --> 01:21:27,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, specifically, because some of the houses have large properties, whether they are large residences or small residences, they have large properties, as many speakers have already represented.

903
01:21:30,255 --> 01:21:36,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a multiplex or an ADU by right within the historic conversion

904
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:42,312
[SPEAKER_06]: would help incentivize the maintenance of the historic building itself.

905
01:21:43,653 --> 01:21:50,158
[SPEAKER_06]: The two to four units, I don't believe at this point, is financially viable.

906
01:21:51,862 --> 01:21:56,283
[SPEAKER_06]: and the three-unit townhouse would compete.

907
01:21:57,103 --> 01:22:02,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Like knocking the historic building down and just building townhouses is probably lucrative.

908
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:17,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So think about that because our historic neighborhoods are gorgeous and all of the houses, small and large, are important for maintaining the character of our neighborhood.

909
01:22:18,468 --> 01:22:20,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And thinking creatively,

910
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:24,833
[SPEAKER_06]: actually should be one of the things that is done within this zoning.

911
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:25,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

912
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:28,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Tara.

913
01:22:31,918 --> 01:22:34,019
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Ken.

914
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:35,900
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

915
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

916
01:22:41,224 --> 01:22:41,824
[SPEAKER_30]: Ken Garrow.

917
01:22:42,345 --> 01:22:46,107
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry, I'm doing this on my phone.

918
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:47,468
[SPEAKER_30]: Great, brilliant.

919
01:22:48,648 --> 01:22:49,989
[SPEAKER_30]: Kim Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

920
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,372
[SPEAKER_30]: In general, I'm supportive of our thing here.

921
01:22:54,392 --> 01:22:58,334
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I'm going to echo quite a few number of people.

922
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:03,877
[SPEAKER_30]: NR1, I actually think, is hot garbage, frankly.

923
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:05,378
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think it should exist.

924
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:09,100
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the previous commenter was correct.

925
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:13,763
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't go far enough for the density we need in the city.

926
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:24,625
[SPEAKER_30]: truly think if we're going to try to expand along these ways, that is, we should really get rid of that.

927
01:23:26,207 --> 01:23:31,531
[SPEAKER_30]: While I live over on Lambert Street now, when I first moved to Medford, I was over on Playstead, over in West Medford.

928
01:23:31,551 --> 01:23:37,256
[SPEAKER_30]: I used the commuter rail to get to my teaching position that I had in the middle of the city.

929
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:43,041
[SPEAKER_30]: And I was a little disappointed in the proposal that

930
01:23:44,438 --> 01:23:50,463
[SPEAKER_30]: Basically, everything within that circle of the West Medford Station was not NR3.

931
01:23:52,464 --> 01:23:58,950
[SPEAKER_30]: I really think we have an opportunity to go forth and do that, and I would really push us to do that.

932
01:24:01,212 --> 01:24:07,057
[SPEAKER_30]: Even the sections that are labeled NR2 currently on the proposal, I think those should also be NR3.

933
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:10,920
[SPEAKER_30]: Another commenter made the statement that

934
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:16,272
[SPEAKER_30]: And R3 should kind of be the basis for basically almost anything above north of the river.

935
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:23,675
[SPEAKER_30]: And I kind of agree with that, but can kind of understand some density things, especially coming to things with much smaller lanes.

936
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:25,256
[SPEAKER_30]: And even then, eh.

937
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:32,419
[SPEAKER_30]: But I really would like the...

938
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:35,440
[SPEAKER_30]: Density to increase.

939
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,146
[SPEAKER_30]: I walk from the Haines Square all the time to Malden Center.

940
01:24:41,226 --> 01:24:43,268
[SPEAKER_30]: I walked this morning to the library.

941
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:48,114
[SPEAKER_30]: I would like some of the things I normally participate in.

942
01:24:49,844 --> 01:24:53,165
[SPEAKER_30]: Medford Square to be closer, denser, have some more friends.

943
01:24:53,966 --> 01:24:57,147
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's also worth noting it's a little apples to oranges.

944
01:24:58,547 --> 01:25:03,769
[SPEAKER_30]: Prices for single family houses right now, you have Mary Heine Way where you're looking at $2 million single family homes.

945
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:11,772
[SPEAKER_30]: And the new condos that were developed in West Medford Square, yes, they're smaller, but they're also what

946
01:25:12,598 --> 01:25:17,864
[SPEAKER_30]: people probably in my generation look at as a reasonable house given the market that we've had over the last several years.

947
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Ken, would you mind wrapping up your last thought?

948
01:25:20,727 --> 01:25:21,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope.

949
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:23,029
[SPEAKER_30]: That was about it.

950
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:24,470
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for the time.

951
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:25,391
[SPEAKER_30]: Good work, everyone.

952
01:25:26,513 --> 01:25:27,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ken.

953
01:25:27,273 --> 01:25:29,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your candid feedback.

954
01:25:30,176 --> 01:25:33,640
[SPEAKER_21]: And we encourage that from everybody on what's being presented.

955
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,441
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

956
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,537
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I have is Marion.

957
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:41,899
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

958
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:44,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

959
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Marion, I'm sending through a request to unmute.

960
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:58,991
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try again.

961
01:26:10,936 --> 01:26:12,297
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we're gonna come back to Marion.

962
01:26:14,678 --> 01:26:16,098
[SPEAKER_21]: We wanna make sure everybody's heard.

963
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:25,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Marion, if you're having technical difficulties, please reach out to Danielle or Alicia, but we'll come back to you and continue to come back to you until we figure it out.

964
01:26:26,942 --> 01:26:30,824
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is J.R.

965
01:26:31,004 --> 01:26:31,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Elliott.

966
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:33,985
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

967
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:38,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your, oh, you keep muting yourself.

968
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:40,608
[SPEAKER_21]: Or I, I don't know what's happening.

969
01:26:42,147 --> 01:26:43,367
[SPEAKER_21]: JR Elliott, are you there?

970
01:26:43,387 --> 01:26:44,268
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm here.

971
01:26:44,628 --> 01:26:44,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

972
01:26:45,008 --> 01:26:46,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

973
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:51,210
[SPEAKER_34]: John Elliott, 34 Emery Street in the hillside.

974
01:26:51,230 --> 01:27:04,454
[SPEAKER_34]: I have spent way too much time staring at maps and aerial photographs trying to make some sense of this in preparation for this meeting.

975
01:27:06,535 --> 01:27:11,917
[SPEAKER_34]: There jumped out two or three things that I want to mention here.

976
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:35,495
[SPEAKER_34]: First of all, what Laurel Ruma calls the bullseye, I saw that and tried to make some sense of it because I don't think any of us has a personal transporter that will get us from our places of where we live to the track side.

977
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,858
[SPEAKER_34]: And then go away and come back.

978
01:27:40,019 --> 01:27:45,766
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's what the bullseye shows is as the crows fly distance.

979
01:27:47,108 --> 01:27:54,918
[SPEAKER_34]: I proceeded to measure from this point on the platform at the Medford Tufts station.

980
01:27:56,171 --> 01:28:17,264
[SPEAKER_34]: across the platform, up one flight of stairs, turn left, up another flight of stairs, up to the sidewalk at Boston Ave, over the bridge, over the right-of-way, past the Cummings building, up the access road or service road that services

981
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,060
[SPEAKER_21]: John, just real quick, you have about 30 seconds left.

982
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:21,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, really?

983
01:28:21,481 --> 01:28:22,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

984
01:28:22,482 --> 01:28:25,103
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, up to the end of Burgett Avenue.

985
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:26,584
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's a quarter of a mile.

986
01:28:27,805 --> 01:28:31,567
[SPEAKER_34]: From there, you can start measuring a quarter of a mile or a half mile.

987
01:28:33,548 --> 01:28:43,594
[SPEAKER_34]: The other thing that I saw on the maps was how much green space there was that is occupied by Tufts athletic fields.

988
01:28:44,431 --> 01:28:56,034
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a 20-acre plot up there that has 19-acre plot with five athletic fields, two acres unused right by the tracks.

989
01:28:56,214 --> 01:29:00,296
[SPEAKER_34]: That would be a great place to put some high-density residential.

990
01:29:02,396 --> 01:29:09,378
[SPEAKER_34]: If you wanted it to be close to the station, that is a quarter of a mile, the farthest in that two-acre plot.

991
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,639
[SPEAKER_34]: OK, I'll quit.

992
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:14,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, John.

993
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:18,432
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the comment and appreciate the process that you went through to measure those distances.

994
01:29:19,513 --> 01:29:25,916
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it provides some real kind of first-hand experience and helps to personify some of the data that we're seeing.

995
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:33,079
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go back to Marion, see if I can do a request to unmute.

996
01:29:41,503 --> 01:29:42,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Where did they go?

997
01:29:44,307 --> 01:29:45,127
[SPEAKER_21]: The hand just dropped.

998
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:49,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

999
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:55,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Marian, if you raised, if you dropped your hand intentionally, no worries.

1000
01:29:55,774 --> 01:29:57,515
[SPEAKER_21]: If you didn't, please raise your hand again.

1001
01:29:57,535 --> 01:29:59,376
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to make sure to hear your comment.

1002
01:30:00,857 --> 01:30:05,319
[SPEAKER_21]: But for now, we're going to move on, excuse me, to our next member of the public.

1003
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Jean, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1004
01:30:09,702 --> 01:30:11,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1005
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,532
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, can you hear me now, Madam Chairperson?

1006
01:30:15,292 --> 01:30:17,454
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a little low, but I'm not sure if that's just me.

1007
01:30:17,474 --> 01:30:20,335
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, let me get closer to my computer, is this better?

1008
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:21,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you so much.

1009
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:24,038
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll just hang close to my computer, thank you.

1010
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:25,259
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

1011
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:26,860
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm at Parr Street in Medford.

1012
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,262
[SPEAKER_24]: I do have a letter prepared, but I have a few comments that I'd like to make.

1013
01:30:31,283 --> 01:30:34,965
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's important as we speak as a community to just be thoughtful.

1014
01:30:36,326 --> 01:30:41,570
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would like to share for people's consideration, it's great to kind of be wishful about what we want to do.

1015
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:52,036
[SPEAKER_24]: But the sad fact here in Medford is that the city of Medford, whether we like it or not, does not attract transformative developers in any way.

1016
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:54,217
[SPEAKER_24]: We simply attract flippers.

1017
01:30:54,677 --> 01:31:00,641
[SPEAKER_24]: And our most recent example of that was the four-acre, approximate four-acre RFP in Medford Square.

1018
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:07,905
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a room full of developers that were promised friendly PDUs and autonomy in what they were going to build there.

1019
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:18,173
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the end of the day, we had a response from two, and they weren't even really the true transformative developers you see respond in other cities.

1020
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:25,360
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can talk about acres of land and what we'd like to do and what we'd like to see and what we think is going to happen.

1021
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:33,507
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm telling you as someone who is in the industry, and I have many a conversation with a variety of people in the industry,

1022
01:31:34,027 --> 01:31:38,290
[SPEAKER_24]: there is a very low interest in Medford for anybody but a flipper.

1023
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:45,875
[SPEAKER_24]: And so what we are developing here in this programmatical exercise in rezoning is nothing but

1024
01:31:46,923 --> 01:32:02,380
[SPEAKER_24]: what is friendly to flippers and speculative developers who are going to harass the residents as they do their monetary build-outs for their speculative projects and force long-time residents out.

1025
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,145
[SPEAKER_24]: I just would like to, if you'll give me the little bit of latitude, I have a handful of other thoughts.

1026
01:32:07,942 --> 01:32:18,725
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to displace people of this idea that if you build a four or a six-story building, that it's going to get an elevator and you're going to be able to travel where you are.

1027
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:27,947
[SPEAKER_24]: ADA compliance isn't driven by height, it's driven by statutory requirements, and it is a percentage of build-outs.

1028
01:32:28,347 --> 01:32:30,407
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a percentage of what is done.

1029
01:32:30,767 --> 01:32:33,708
[SPEAKER_24]: So each project will net a different type

1030
01:32:34,228 --> 01:32:35,450
[SPEAKER_24]: of ADA compliance.

1031
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:42,701
[SPEAKER_24]: You might not be able to visit your friends because there might not be an elevator or your friends might be on the ground floor in a back area.

1032
01:32:43,022 --> 01:32:46,467
[SPEAKER_24]: So this idea that every new building that's coming in is going to be 100% ADA is not accurate.

1033
01:32:48,921 --> 01:32:56,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Also new construction does not, and higher units does not necessarily equate to affordability.

1034
01:32:56,404 --> 01:33:00,046
[SPEAKER_24]: If you don't hit the 10 unit threshold, you get no affordability.

1035
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:08,909
[SPEAKER_24]: We saw that on Winthrop Street in West Medford, where they blasted away the land and were creative about how they subdivided it.

1036
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:16,152
[SPEAKER_24]: And the city got zero affordable units in an environment where the units are selling at almost $2 million each.

1037
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Jean, you're about 50 seconds over.

1038
01:33:20,015 --> 01:33:22,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to ask you to finish your last thought.

1039
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:24,579
[SPEAKER_24]: One final thought.

1040
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:36,508
[SPEAKER_24]: It is really troubling to me that we continue to talk about these things without studies and without using our best practices because we are going to be holding the bag for a lot of it.

1041
01:33:36,808 --> 01:33:38,950
[SPEAKER_24]: But the example I will leave you with is our plumbing.

1042
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:44,872
[SPEAKER_24]: In most instances, the plumbing and the utilities that run in our street are over 100 years old.

1043
01:33:45,312 --> 01:33:47,572
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not an incremental proposition.

1044
01:33:47,952 --> 01:33:51,053
[SPEAKER_24]: It is an overarching proposition when we're looking at the zoning.

1045
01:33:51,353 --> 01:33:54,374
[SPEAKER_24]: I will submit the rest in writing, and I appreciate the latitude.

1046
01:33:54,454 --> 01:33:54,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1047
01:33:55,315 --> 01:33:55,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jean.

1048
01:33:57,395 --> 01:33:59,776
[SPEAKER_21]: The next public commenter that we have is Jennifer.

1049
01:34:00,036 --> 01:34:01,896
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1050
01:34:02,076 --> 01:34:03,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1051
01:34:05,632 --> 01:34:19,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Jennifer O'Callaghan, 19 Paris Street, and I wanted to express my opposition to what is currently proposed for the Salem Street Glenwood area in my neighborhood.

1052
01:34:19,977 --> 01:34:26,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important to point out that what we're talking about is what's going to be allowed by right.

1053
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:33,982
[SPEAKER_09]: This ignores the fact that you are going to have greedy developer after greedy developer coming along

1054
01:34:34,936 --> 01:35:02,263
[SPEAKER_09]: In going for additional variances and potentially succeeding because medford wants to give it away The problem is not Your neighbor your longtime neighbor who wants to add an adu or needs to expand a little bit on their house It is the developers that we are seeing coming faster and stronger each time to our neighborhood to build things that are not

1055
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:10,624
[SPEAKER_09]: high quality, nor attractive, nor what the neighbors would appreciate.

1056
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:14,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, therefore, I don't want to see it.

1057
01:35:14,707 --> 01:35:28,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I also would like to, before I complete my statement, point out that anyone who believes that the bus transit around here is equivalent or as good as rapid transit is delusional.

1058
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:33,372
[SPEAKER_09]: despite whatever proposals are coming related to the 101.

1059
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:38,877
[SPEAKER_09]: As a person who takes the T from time to time, I can assure you it's not better.

1060
01:35:39,277 --> 01:35:39,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1061
01:35:40,058 --> 01:35:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1062
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1063
01:35:44,862 --> 01:35:46,884
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Lori.

1064
01:35:47,145 --> 01:35:48,806
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1065
01:35:49,146 --> 01:35:50,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1066
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:56,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Lori Krieger, 124 Brookings Street.

1067
01:35:57,004 --> 01:35:58,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have PTSD.

1068
01:35:58,465 --> 01:35:59,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working through it.

1069
01:36:00,767 --> 01:36:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So my biggest concerns, I was at the meeting the other night.

1070
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:06,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been in front of the board.

1071
01:36:07,813 --> 01:36:12,897
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest concerns, we all, it's like the same thing with Tufts, right?

1072
01:36:12,917 --> 01:36:21,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want density and all of that, but we don't want to, I think the most important things that you can do are Mike and Laurel wrote a letter.

1073
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:29,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And the letter talks about putting institutional zoning first or Tufts first before we do the rest of the stuff for the city.

1074
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's super important because we need to know what's going on with them.

1075
01:36:33,722 --> 01:36:40,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to make plans in regards to them or hopefully in conjunction with them.

1076
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's super important.

1077
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: They own tons of property around here.

1078
01:36:45,111 --> 01:36:48,931
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of a sudden it could be six family or six units, right?

1079
01:36:49,391 --> 01:36:54,752
[SPEAKER_04]: They can buy a couple of lots and all of a sudden I'll be in the middle of Tufts property instead of on the edge.

1080
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a little bit, that's concerning.

1081
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:06,874
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that I think that I want to reflect what Jean and Jennifer said is that we're very idealistic here in this neighborhood.

1082
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:07,735
[SPEAKER_04]: We really are.

1083
01:37:07,795 --> 01:37:09,095
[SPEAKER_04]: We care about our community.

1084
01:37:09,195 --> 01:37:09,935
[SPEAKER_04]: We care about

1085
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:13,531
[SPEAKER_04]: affordable housing, we care about all kinds of things.

1086
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:25,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But these zoning laws are not laws that control what developers do, just the framework within which they can operate.

1087
01:37:25,696 --> 01:37:30,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now we live in a really the land of unregulated capitalism to the nth degree.

1088
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And if our concerns as families, as neighborhoods aren't met, then

1089
01:37:37,540 --> 01:38:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be like what Jennifer said or Jean said that like we have to find a way whatever y'all do take as much effort as you can to look at it from different angles and different vantage points so that the undone unintended consequences don't destroy everything that we have that is good and the final thing about like with the whole Tufts thing

1090
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:10,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at planting, and I mentioned this before, we're looking at planting trees and stuff to kind of obscure if we can live long enough to obscure the Tufts buildings.

1091
01:38:10,835 --> 01:38:15,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you get somebody that wants to develop a lot and they take out all the trees.

1092
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:23,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Like let's not, let's create rules that avoid an urban desert because that could happen too.

1093
01:38:23,877 --> 01:38:29,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There's buildings in Somerville and Cambridge that are just been built, and they're empty.

1094
01:38:29,722 --> 01:38:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: They're empty like 10 years later.

1095
01:38:31,243 --> 01:38:35,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the laws were around that, but let's be as smart as we can.

1096
01:38:36,187 --> 01:38:36,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1097
01:38:37,288 --> 01:38:37,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Laurie.

1098
01:38:38,009 --> 01:38:38,989
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that.

1099
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:39,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to see you again.

1100
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:40,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

1101
01:38:45,275 --> 01:38:48,397
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Marion.

1102
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:51,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Going to put a request to unmute.

1103
01:38:53,723 --> 01:38:55,364
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we had trouble last time, Marion.

1104
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:09,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle or Alicia, are you also requesting Marion unmute?

1105
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:11,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Just want to make sure we're not conflicting.

1106
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:11,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1107
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Marian, I don't seem to have any luck with getting you to unmute.

1108
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:30,542
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to move on to our next commenter, but we will come back to you.

1109
01:39:31,602 --> 01:39:33,923
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Judith.

1110
01:39:34,203 --> 01:39:35,904
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1111
01:39:36,264 --> 01:39:38,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1112
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

1113
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:40,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1114
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:41,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1115
01:39:41,686 --> 01:39:43,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Judith Weinstock, 144 Breguet.

1116
01:39:43,706 --> 01:39:44,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everybody.

1117
01:39:44,506 --> 01:39:45,847
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I've just seen y'all.

1118
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:47,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I did.

1119
01:39:49,737 --> 01:40:09,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to echo a couple of things, and I was pretty vocal at the last meeting, and so folks who were there or on the Zoom may have heard a little bit about sort of the unintended consequences of UR1 in what is already also potentially in Ball Square, but certainly here of a community that is

1120
01:40:10,477 --> 01:40:11,398
[SPEAKER_12]: very tight.

1121
01:40:11,978 --> 01:40:18,523
[SPEAKER_12]: And what other folks have said, I actually now have been hearing a number of times about the limited access on our streets.

1122
01:40:19,664 --> 01:40:23,446
[SPEAKER_12]: And first of all, they're in pretty bad condition, but that's a separate issue maybe.

1123
01:40:23,867 --> 01:40:25,868
[SPEAKER_12]: But they are incredibly narrow.

1124
01:40:25,948 --> 01:40:28,330
[SPEAKER_12]: The neighborhood is incredibly dense already.

1125
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:29,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it is of concern

1126
01:40:30,845 --> 01:40:41,832
[SPEAKER_12]: to see a UR1 where what I think the only option will be is to have developers come in, scoop up a couple of the lots because I have a 4,000 square foot lot.

1127
01:40:41,912 --> 01:40:48,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that a six unit building can be built and still meet setbacks and frontage and all that jazz.

1128
01:40:48,676 --> 01:40:55,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really concerned about incentivizing developers who will purchase multiple connected lots

1129
01:40:55,660 --> 01:41:10,007
[SPEAKER_12]: raise the houses and put up multiplexes and so I've already gone on the record to say that I'm not a fan of five and six unit multiplexes at three stories high in this very tight small area already.

1130
01:41:10,847 --> 01:41:18,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing I sort of agree with Laurel around you know if one is going to do this then you have to expand beyond just the central

1131
01:41:19,471 --> 01:41:25,613
[SPEAKER_12]: location of Burgett, Sunset, Brookings, and go out the half a mile.

1132
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:35,917
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just don't want the unintended consequence of actually driving up pricing because developers will be the only ones who can put up multiplexes.

1133
01:41:35,977 --> 01:41:42,780
[SPEAKER_12]: The normal person who wants to put up an ADU or convert their house to a two-family, that's not the person I'm concerned about.

1134
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,401
[SPEAKER_12]: And with that, I will stop.

1135
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:51,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I had a poorly timed cracker.

1136
01:41:52,111 --> 01:41:53,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Emily, didn't mean to put you on the spot there.

1137
01:41:54,271 --> 01:41:54,831
[SPEAKER_21]: No, you're good.

1138
01:41:54,851 --> 01:41:55,211
[SPEAKER_21]: You're good.

1139
01:41:55,412 --> 01:41:57,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate your insight, Judith.

1140
01:41:58,352 --> 01:42:04,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think this is the first time that you and I have interacted, so I really appreciate you coming to this meeting.

1141
01:42:04,434 --> 01:42:06,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1142
01:42:09,555 --> 01:42:14,376
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Sharon W. You're going to get a request to unmute.

1143
01:42:14,396 --> 01:42:17,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1144
01:42:18,937 --> 01:42:19,578
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that?

1145
01:42:20,578 --> 01:42:21,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Sharon, we can hear you.

1146
01:42:21,639 --> 01:42:25,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, can you hear me?

1147
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:28,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, can you please state your name and address for the record?

1148
01:42:30,627 --> 01:42:31,467
[SPEAKER_14]: 694 Winthrop Street.

1149
01:42:33,029 --> 01:42:34,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just had a few questions.

1150
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:41,796
[SPEAKER_14]: One is, I'm hearing a lot of changes to the NR1 and NR2.

1151
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:46,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Would there be another meeting if there are changes that are going to happen?

1152
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:53,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to keep asking or do you want us to pause your timer?

1153
01:42:56,906 --> 01:43:00,969
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing is, will there be setbacks?

1154
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:06,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Have the setbacks changed and what are they?

1155
01:43:07,953 --> 01:43:13,496
[SPEAKER_14]: And will this affect taxes and benefit depending on the area?

1156
01:43:16,695 --> 01:43:19,678
[SPEAKER_21]: You still have over a minute if you have additional questions.

1157
01:43:20,859 --> 01:43:22,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are my main questions.

1158
01:43:23,562 --> 01:43:23,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1159
01:43:25,724 --> 01:43:30,569
[SPEAKER_21]: So, the questions I heard are, will this affect taxes around setbacks?

1160
01:43:31,329 --> 01:43:32,671
[SPEAKER_21]: What are they and are they changing?

1161
01:43:32,691 --> 01:43:38,636
[SPEAKER_21]: And then if changes are made to NR1 and NR2, will there be an additional meeting around those?

1162
01:43:39,237 --> 01:43:39,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1163
01:43:40,018 --> 01:43:40,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1164
01:43:45,623 --> 01:43:49,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to have the consultant respond to kind of questions in bulk.

1165
01:43:49,584 --> 01:43:55,665
[SPEAKER_21]: I know there's been a lot that have come before us already, and I'll make sure that those three are addressed.

1166
01:43:57,406 --> 01:43:57,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1167
01:43:58,386 --> 01:43:59,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Sharon.

1168
01:43:59,586 --> 01:43:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1169
01:44:05,548 --> 01:44:07,468
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Marion, I'm going to come back to you.

1170
01:44:07,488 --> 01:44:09,829
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to send through a request to unmute.

1171
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:29,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily, she did message me between saying that her screen says she's unmuted, but we couldn't hear her.

1172
01:44:30,525 --> 01:44:34,848
[SPEAKER_16]: But I, you know, I told her she looked like she never unmuted.

1173
01:44:34,928 --> 01:44:38,690
[SPEAKER_16]: So she just messaged, sent me a direct message with her brief comment.

1174
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:39,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1175
01:44:39,991 --> 01:44:45,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Marion says, I just wanted to go on record that I'm against NR1 in West and Lawrence.

1176
01:44:45,435 --> 01:44:46,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I live in Glenwood.

1177
01:44:47,436 --> 01:44:47,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1178
01:44:47,816 --> 01:44:50,978
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was going to send a second message if I understand the one slash two.

1179
01:44:53,822 --> 01:44:56,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, didn't see that at the beginning.

1180
01:45:00,564 --> 01:45:01,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there another?

1181
01:45:01,144 --> 01:45:02,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Recording stopped.

1182
01:45:02,565 --> 01:45:03,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Recording in progress.

1183
01:45:03,805 --> 01:45:07,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, is there another comment that came through from Marion?

1184
01:45:07,726 --> 01:45:09,427
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you said there might be two.

1185
01:45:09,447 --> 01:45:09,827
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1186
01:45:10,047 --> 01:45:11,827
[SPEAKER_16]: If it does, I'll let you know.

1187
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:13,608
[SPEAKER_16]: There are no other speakers, are there?

1188
01:45:14,068 --> 01:45:15,809
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any hands raised right now, no.

1189
01:45:15,829 --> 01:45:16,169
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1190
01:45:18,172 --> 01:45:26,200
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want, I have an answer from the assessor on the tax question, and I could read that and then share it if Marian says another message.

1191
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that would be great, and we'd address one of Sharon's questions, which would be awesome.

1192
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:36,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I, let me see, I was just going to grade up my, have my notes there.

1193
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:41,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Marian says, I live one and a half miles from the T. That was the end of her message.

1194
01:45:42,624 --> 01:45:43,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Marion.

1195
01:45:43,404 --> 01:45:48,727
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry we're having technical difficulties, but I appreciate your persistence and your comments this evening.

1196
01:45:50,548 --> 01:45:59,512
[SPEAKER_16]: So I actually spoke with the assessor about taxes today, and I apologize if I look like I'm not looking at everybody as I say this, but I'm referring to my notes that are on the side here.

1197
01:46:00,012 --> 01:46:00,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1198
01:46:00,712 --> 01:46:05,194
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we discussed it a little bit, and what he said is that

1199
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:13,980
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many things that go into the assessment, and what the zoning is is one of those things, but it's one of several things.

1200
01:46:14,861 --> 01:46:28,372
[SPEAKER_16]: And Medford, as other communities of our size, we wouldn't go through, we do our assessments based on comparables, and that is based on what is selling in your neighborhood.

1201
01:46:29,152 --> 01:46:36,538
[SPEAKER_16]: And that seems people generally understand that, but what I didn't understand is that that information lags quite a bit.

1202
01:46:37,187 --> 01:46:41,610
[SPEAKER_16]: So I said, so it's more based on the house that sold last month than on the zoning.

1203
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:49,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said, actually it's the house that sells this month isn't going to be reflected in the assessments until fiscal year 27.

1204
01:46:50,134 --> 01:46:54,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's like a year and a half later that the sales start to affect assessments.

1205
01:46:55,717 --> 01:47:02,721
[SPEAKER_16]: And that the city will not go through and reassess everybody based on new zoning across the board.

1206
01:47:03,022 --> 01:47:04,002
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the bandwidth.

1207
01:47:04,062 --> 01:47:05,543
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not how we do things.

1208
01:47:06,074 --> 01:47:08,219
[SPEAKER_16]: And the changes are much more subtle than that.

1209
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:13,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So that if new zoning means that the values in your neighborhood go up.

1210
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:22,868
[SPEAKER_16]: then eventually, yes, the taxes would go up, but if the new zoning doesn't impact the zone, but we don't actually have a direct way to know.

1211
01:47:22,988 --> 01:47:28,249
[SPEAKER_16]: So we could never say it was the zoning versus just that the market went up in our neighborhood.

1212
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:31,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's sort of the big picture.

1213
01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:39,453
[SPEAKER_16]: They are not gonna go through and they're not gonna reassess everybody and say, now you can build a two family, now your property is twice as valuable.

1214
01:47:40,273 --> 01:47:43,094
[SPEAKER_16]: That is not how they do assessments in the city of Medford.

1215
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:51,985
[SPEAKER_21]: What I'm hearing is zoning is one of many factors that could influence the assessed value of property.

1216
01:47:52,005 --> 01:48:06,578
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not going to see the immediate impacts of a rezone potentially in your next annual tax bill, but there may be consequences, good and bad, in the longer term.

1217
01:48:07,318 --> 01:48:07,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1218
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:08,620
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's

1219
01:48:10,023 --> 01:48:11,584
[SPEAKER_16]: summarizes it pretty well.

1220
01:48:11,604 --> 01:48:17,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think it was a question for people whether the assessor would go through and just raise everybody's taxes.

1221
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:18,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Not happening.

1222
01:48:19,271 --> 01:48:19,431
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1223
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:25,336
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to do one more call for public comments.

1224
01:48:26,597 --> 01:48:27,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any hands.

1225
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:33,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to give it a second.

1226
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:45,231
[SPEAKER_21]: So right now, I'm going to close the public comment period just for this meeting.

1227
01:48:46,593 --> 01:48:52,399
[SPEAKER_21]: We may reopen it at a future meeting, depending on kind of the changes and the scope.

1228
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:56,563
[SPEAKER_21]: But for the purposes of this meeting, the public comment is closed.

1229
01:48:58,445 --> 01:49:02,409
[SPEAKER_21]: What I would like to do now is open up to the board, actually.

1230
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:03,609
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1231
01:49:04,429 --> 01:49:08,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's have Emily and Paola do any responses.

1232
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:13,692
[SPEAKER_21]: And we got some specific questions from Sharon at the end.

1233
01:49:13,712 --> 01:49:18,833
[SPEAKER_21]: There were some comments about ADUs that need a little bit of clarity.

1234
01:49:20,294 --> 01:49:32,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paola, if you want to kind of kick things off, and I'll go through with my notes and see if we missed any that we can get back to either tonight or at later dates.

1235
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:34,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1236
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:40,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I also was taking notes so great to work my way backwards and if I forget anything, please let me know.

1237
01:49:41,337 --> 01:49:50,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that, just to reiterate, we do plan to work with city staff to come back to the city board with changes.

1238
01:49:51,606 --> 01:49:57,531
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know exactly what there will be but there were certainly some common elements to what we heard last week.

1239
01:49:58,031 --> 01:50:01,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we heard tonight, we are absolutely taking those into consideration.

1240
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:04,356
[SPEAKER_08]: We also heard a few new things that we will discuss.

1241
01:50:04,396 --> 01:50:18,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should expect for whichever meeting, and one of Sharon's questions was, will there be a next meeting that will be your continued meeting at which we present the changes so that everybody can hear them through this public forum.

1242
01:50:18,986 --> 01:50:21,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have setback recommendations.

1243
01:50:21,308 --> 01:50:24,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not have in front of me what they are.

1244
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:30,334
[SPEAKER_08]: are in the current zoning versus what they will be, but I can tell you what they will be.

1245
01:50:30,414 --> 01:50:32,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't have the comparison in front of me right now.

1246
01:50:32,976 --> 01:50:36,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So the setbacks for NR1 and 2, the front setback is 15.

1247
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:38,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And for NR3, UR1 and UR2, the front setback is 10.

1248
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:40,002
[SPEAKER_08]: These are minimum setbacks.

1249
01:50:48,288 --> 01:50:51,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Side setback is 7.5 for NR1 and NR2 with the sum of both sides being 15, again minimum.

1250
01:50:52,009 --> 01:50:54,470
[SPEAKER_08]: For NR3, UR1 and UR2, they are 5 with the sum being 10, again minimum.

1251
01:51:05,555 --> 01:51:09,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for the rear, for all of the NRs, it's 15.

1252
01:51:10,157 --> 01:51:13,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And for both of the URs, it's 10.

1253
01:51:15,018 --> 01:51:17,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see Alicia, you've got your hand raised.

1254
01:51:17,499 --> 01:51:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have the others in front of you?

1255
01:51:18,899 --> 01:51:20,380
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1256
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:21,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia?

1257
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:23,341
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want me to provide the currents.

1258
01:51:24,781 --> 01:51:27,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it'd be helpful to have that as kind of a basis.

1259
01:51:27,422 --> 01:51:27,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1260
01:51:27,962 --> 01:51:33,824
[SPEAKER_16]: So currently, our dimensions are done by the use.

1261
01:51:34,555 --> 01:51:42,459
[SPEAKER_16]: And to be clear, we currently allow detached single-family dwellings and detached two-family dwellings.

1262
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:49,143
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of those, what I'm going to tell you, it's the same for all of those.

1263
01:51:49,263 --> 01:51:52,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And we don't currently allow three-family units.

1264
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:54,266
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a recognized type.

1265
01:51:54,886 --> 01:52:01,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And anything larger than that is considered a multifamily, which has significantly different dimensional requirements.

1266
01:52:03,893 --> 01:52:05,293
[SPEAKER_16]: single and two families.

1267
01:52:05,553 --> 01:52:08,654
[SPEAKER_16]: The front is 15 foot setback everywhere.

1268
01:52:10,555 --> 01:52:14,296
[SPEAKER_16]: The side is seven and a half setback everywhere.

1269
01:52:14,316 --> 01:52:17,157
[SPEAKER_16]: And the rear is 15 everywhere.

1270
01:52:17,757 --> 01:52:18,957
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are largely the same.

1271
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:20,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, very similar.

1272
01:52:21,178 --> 01:52:28,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that in two in the NR three, the front setback went from 15 to 10.

1273
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1274
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:32,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And I

1275
01:52:33,294 --> 01:53:00,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Couldn't possibly tell you our, I will just tell you that the multi-family set is so confusing that it's one of the things we've asked to please change, but it is height plus length divided by six, but at least 15 for all of those dimensions, which basically says the taller the building is, the further from the boundaries of the property it should be.

1276
01:53:01,026 --> 01:53:08,322
[SPEAKER_16]: which is why we have tall buildings and seas of parking in the city of Medford, because that is what is required by our current zoning.

1277
01:53:11,309 --> 01:53:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will just add to that that part of what we've been doing is trying to rationalize the setbacks and the other dimensions.

1278
01:53:20,932 --> 01:53:32,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So rather than being by use or by district to for the most part, and that is so that you're when you're within a district, there is a consistency there to what you're seeing or what you will get.

1279
01:53:32,436 --> 01:53:34,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I also see Paola, you have your hand up.

1280
01:53:34,737 --> 01:53:36,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to add more?

1281
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:37,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Paola?

1282
01:53:38,742 --> 01:53:39,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

1283
01:53:40,283 --> 01:53:43,744
[SPEAKER_11]: We are also reviewing now the ADUs, the accessory dwelling units.

1284
01:53:44,744 --> 01:53:48,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that, we also need to look into the requirements.

1285
01:53:49,386 --> 01:53:55,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be studying a little bit further as well the setbacks for principal dwelling units.

1286
01:53:56,268 --> 01:54:02,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So for all these districts to see if they need to be a little bit tweaked for the ADUs.

1287
01:54:02,831 --> 01:54:05,972
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so people know that.

1288
01:54:07,573 --> 01:54:20,639
[SPEAKER_08]: And with your permission, Madam Chair, Paola, while you're there, you've been working on the difference between the protected ADU under the state law and the local option ADU.

1289
01:54:20,679 --> 01:54:23,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to just touch on the fact that there are those two differences?

1290
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we had one of the speakers asked about that.

1291
01:54:29,687 --> 01:54:30,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, if I may.

1292
01:54:32,368 --> 01:54:37,529
[SPEAKER_11]: So under the new law, there is two uses for the ADUs.

1293
01:54:37,689 --> 01:54:40,949
[SPEAKER_11]: One is the protected use, and the other one is the local.

1294
01:54:41,209 --> 01:54:51,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So the local would be anything that Medford would like to allow for an ADU that is outside the scope of the protected ADUs, that will be the local.

1295
01:54:51,792 --> 01:54:57,473
[SPEAKER_11]: For the protected ADUs, it has several things, but the main one is

1296
01:54:57,930 --> 01:55:01,372
[SPEAKER_11]: than in any single family residential district.

1297
01:55:02,053 --> 01:55:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: That means any district that allows single family buildings by right or also by a special permit, then you have the protected ADUs.

1298
01:55:15,101 --> 01:55:26,909
[SPEAKER_11]: This means that if, for example, we take the UR1 and we include the ADU, the single family, that means that they will also have the protected

1299
01:55:27,592 --> 01:55:36,474
[SPEAKER_11]: ADUs, and that will mean that for any principal building, they could add another dwelling, accessory dwelling.

1300
01:55:36,674 --> 01:55:43,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so everybody has that information, right now, the UR1 does not have that.

1301
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:56,019
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that we could allow, and as we are considering now, we allow that local ADUs, but we are not, we don't have to allow the protected use because we don't have that single family.

1302
01:55:57,494 --> 01:56:04,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the local ADUs, we only allow it in single two units and three units.

1303
01:56:05,657 --> 01:56:22,224
[SPEAKER_11]: If that is not the case and we have a UR1 with a single family, that means that multiplex of six units could by right as a protected ADUs allow another and then another by a special permit if we allow it.

1304
01:56:22,904 --> 01:56:25,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So it could potentially go up to eight units.

1305
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,297
[SPEAKER_11]: if we allow that.

1306
01:56:27,317 --> 01:56:30,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that explained.

1307
01:56:30,619 --> 01:56:31,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1308
01:56:31,099 --> 01:56:34,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a lot of, a little bit levering, so I'm so sorry.

1309
01:56:34,661 --> 01:56:39,084
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a table would help kind of explain the ADU breakdown.

1310
01:56:39,104 --> 01:56:44,067
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember commenter Gaston talked about combining multiple ADUs.

1311
01:56:45,068 --> 01:56:46,809
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think you start to touch on that, Paola.

1312
01:56:47,421 --> 01:56:56,591
[SPEAKER_21]: With one is allowed and the second would be special permit, so we're not going to have everybody kind of putting up, I think the number is 2200 square feet of two ADUs by right.

1313
01:57:02,507 --> 01:57:07,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason we haven't yet presented you with that table is because it's not been solidified.

1314
01:57:07,548 --> 01:57:11,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So we agree that that needs to be further broken down.

1315
01:57:12,489 --> 01:57:16,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also need to know what the final proposal is.

1316
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:19,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're still working that out with the planning and permitting committee.

1317
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:26,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it is quite complex, taking what the state law allows, and then

1318
01:57:26,812 --> 01:57:31,377
[SPEAKER_08]: deciding how to modify that to allow for the local preference.

1319
01:57:31,737 --> 01:57:41,346
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to acknowledge in our presentation today that ADUs will be allowed under certain circumstances, but not to go through the details.

1320
01:57:41,426 --> 01:57:42,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia, I see your hand up.

1321
01:57:43,788 --> 01:57:44,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia.

1322
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:51,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Chair, as we've raised this up, I realized that

1323
01:57:52,198 --> 01:58:03,841
[SPEAKER_16]: the staff and the consultants and the city Councilors who have been at these meetings and considering this residential have also had the opportunity to hear about this ADU discussion.

1324
01:58:04,481 --> 01:58:15,244
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm thinking that maybe we wanna consider having some more information on the ADUs for the CD board or the next meeting, because it is directly relevant.

1325
01:58:15,624 --> 01:58:19,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the example that is sort of the most glaring

1326
01:58:19,558 --> 01:58:35,783
[SPEAKER_16]: is that where we are saying that there should, and we may want to go into, and I think Danielle or I might be the best to explain why we still are recommending some single family one districts or the neighborhood one.

1327
01:58:36,203 --> 01:58:38,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I think we should explain what the rationale is behind that.

1328
01:58:39,564 --> 01:58:48,107
[SPEAKER_16]: But as we're doing that, because of this state law, ADUs are allowed in every building in an NR1 district.

1329
01:58:49,247 --> 01:59:12,255
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not something we can change, which would mean that every single building, single family or not, or multifamily in that district could also have an ADU, which means you could have two units legally at every property, even though the district is a single family only district.

1330
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:16,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you could, and if it's a historic, that could be two units.

1331
01:59:17,031 --> 01:59:18,872
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we could combine that with an ADU.

1332
01:59:18,892 --> 01:59:19,732
[SPEAKER_21]: So it could be really up to 30.

1333
01:59:20,813 --> 01:59:21,033
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1334
01:59:21,733 --> 01:59:24,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's, we keep losing sight of that.

1335
01:59:24,634 --> 01:59:34,658
[SPEAKER_16]: But not to say in the SF2, or sorry, NR2, you could have one family, two family, every two family could have an ADU.

1336
01:59:34,718 --> 01:59:36,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not saying that everybody will.

1337
01:59:36,619 --> 01:59:36,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1338
01:59:36,979 --> 01:59:39,880
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do not have the ability to say no to those.

1339
01:59:41,001 --> 01:59:41,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1340
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:57,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the idea of a table for the next meeting that explains exactly what is allowed as a principal use and what is allowed as that accessory dwelling use, whether it's the state, the protected unit,

1341
01:59:58,204 --> 02:00:10,674
[SPEAKER_08]: or the local option unit, we would be happy to present that, and I think we'll be a lot closer on the details before that meeting, so that would make it a valuable addition to you, but because somebody brought it up, I wanted to make sure that we answered that.

1342
02:00:11,395 --> 02:00:20,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It is also something that falls under that historic conversion that we just mentioned, and I know we had

1343
02:00:20,822 --> 02:00:31,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody speak about two to four units might not be enough and it might not be viable and also the variation in both the building size and the lot sizes for historic buildings.

1344
02:00:31,648 --> 02:00:39,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did consider, we did talk about the idea of maybe the number of units are dependent on the size of the house.

1345
02:00:40,252 --> 02:00:43,453
[SPEAKER_08]: or the size of the lot, that is something that we could certainly revisit.

1346
02:00:43,513 --> 02:00:52,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we wanted to indicate this idea that the historic house conversion had the ability to go above the existing density.

1347
02:00:52,994 --> 02:01:06,256
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some concern about how much above it could go and how the layout would happen interior, which is not something that zoning normally talks about.

1348
02:01:06,436 --> 02:01:09,137
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought, okay, let's just go one unit above,

1349
02:01:09,737 --> 02:01:18,882
[SPEAKER_08]: test that idea of the historic conversion, test that idea of creating an incentive to keep these buildings that are so important to the community.

1350
02:01:19,502 --> 02:01:24,125
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we've heard somebody tonight saying, well, why don't you think about it differently?

1351
02:01:24,165 --> 02:01:27,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we could definitely go back to those discussions.

1352
02:01:27,567 --> 02:01:30,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to touch on that.

1353
02:01:33,328 --> 02:01:34,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking through the rest of my notes.

1354
02:01:35,069 --> 02:01:43,912
[SPEAKER_08]: We obviously heard the idea of sort of the back and forth of, do you continue to allow single family as a right in certain districts?

1355
02:01:43,992 --> 02:01:48,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you up zone in R1 or up zone in R1 or 2?

1356
02:01:48,693 --> 02:01:52,394
[SPEAKER_08]: We will continue to look at that and see what that would mean.

1357
02:01:52,434 --> 02:01:59,997
[SPEAKER_08]: We also looked at this idea of expanding out beyond or heard the idea of expanding out beyond the quarter mile, half mile.

1358
02:02:00,557 --> 02:02:01,197
[SPEAKER_08]: or beyond.

1359
02:02:02,117 --> 02:02:06,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, typography comes into play as we heard from a couple of the people.

1360
02:02:06,818 --> 02:02:10,859
[SPEAKER_08]: So just note that we're still thinking about those.

1361
02:02:11,839 --> 02:02:13,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Two other things I wanted to call out.

1362
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:21,301
[SPEAKER_08]: One is one of the speakers asked about the list of criteria and the process for non-conforming single family.

1363
02:02:21,702 --> 02:02:23,722
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually in your current zoning.

1364
02:02:24,714 --> 02:02:33,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's section 94-5.5, non-conforming single and two-family residential structures.

1365
02:02:33,936 --> 02:02:40,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage anybody who's wondering about non-conforming uses to have a look at what's already in the current zoning.

1366
02:02:41,338 --> 02:02:49,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We're reviewing it to see if there need to be any additional tweaks, but as I mentioned earlier, it's good as it stands.

1367
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:50,200
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to

1368
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:56,563
[SPEAKER_08]: obviously keep as many possibilities in mind as we can.

1369
02:02:56,583 --> 02:03:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, just, I do want to reiterate that we didn't talk about every piece of land in our conversations, there are still the areas to be rezoned, the squares, some of the additional corridors.

1370
02:03:12,431 --> 02:03:16,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look at that residential map, you will see that there are white spaces,

1371
02:03:16,933 --> 02:03:35,723
[SPEAKER_08]: where we are adding mixes of uses, we are adding commercial only, but the mixed-use districts that we've already talked about, Mix 1, Mix 2, Mix 3 in the Mystic Avenue corridor, in Mix 1 and Mix 2 in the Salem Street neighborhood area,

1372
02:03:37,184 --> 02:03:48,274
[SPEAKER_08]: or corridor, those mixed-use districts are being added to the squares, to West Medford Square, to Medford Square, and will be added to the other corridors.

1373
02:03:48,434 --> 02:03:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they like the difference between Mystic Avenue and the Salem Street neighborhood corridor.

1374
02:03:55,740 --> 02:04:01,986
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be modified for the other areas and the other corridors, but that mix of uses, those heights are being

1375
02:04:02,666 --> 02:04:05,347
[SPEAKER_08]: discussed and added for your review now.

1376
02:04:05,607 --> 02:04:15,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to let people know, you know, that there are other strategies for housing in these areas, including mixed use and including just multifamily.

1377
02:04:15,569 --> 02:04:16,669
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be known.

1378
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:19,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think those are the highest level things.

1379
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:31,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And just once again, just that I took for discussion today or answering today, but just note that we took extensive notes on what we heard today, and we'll be taking that back to our internal team.

1380
02:04:31,593 --> 02:04:39,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And also to city planning staff and planning and well not the planning and permitting committee now because they've sent it to you but to you.

1381
02:04:39,216 --> 02:04:42,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, and a couple notes that I took.

1382
02:04:42,537 --> 02:04:53,241
[SPEAKER_21]: You know Tufts is right, it's a five letter word but it's you know kind of a four letter word within this board, hopefully, you know, that's.

1383
02:04:54,262 --> 02:05:02,246
[SPEAKER_21]: in the past, but there were some questions around Tufts, their land use, how this interacts with kind of their plans moving forward.

1384
02:05:02,386 --> 02:05:05,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you speak a little bit about how that's been considered as part of the process?

1385
02:05:06,529 --> 02:05:13,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it gets to one of the difficult questions we have in zoning, which is zoning doesn't address ownership, right?

1386
02:05:13,772 --> 02:05:16,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoning does not control who owns what.

1387
02:05:17,054 --> 02:05:22,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we can do is we can control the uses, we can control the dimensional standards.

1388
02:05:22,637 --> 02:05:30,401
[SPEAKER_08]: We can add development and design standards to that, but we can't control through zoning who is going to own a property.

1389
02:05:30,921 --> 02:05:36,303
[SPEAKER_08]: As I'm sure almost everybody listening in on this call also knows about the Dover Amendment.

1390
02:05:37,424 --> 02:05:43,566
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been working with legal counsel on this as well.

1391
02:05:44,067 --> 02:05:51,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have some questions as to when, for example, you could restrict a dormitory.

1392
02:05:52,250 --> 02:06:01,333
[SPEAKER_08]: In a residential neighborhood, but as a dormitory, the same thing as a 6 unit building that is rented to individual apartments.

1393
02:06:02,114 --> 02:06:04,975
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that would be a question that we could talk with legal counsel out.

1394
02:06:05,395 --> 02:06:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I should also note that, you know, there is the, we have to be mindful of the housing act.

1395
02:06:11,557 --> 02:06:19,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, whether or not you know any individual practice is seen as discriminatory So that's something else to keep in mind.

1396
02:06:19,299 --> 02:06:21,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's it's not an easy answer.

1397
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:27,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate Because we were on earlier calls with you where we heard part of that process.

1398
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:33,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the frustration that community has had around this and we'll certainly look at what I

1399
02:06:34,764 --> 02:06:46,022
[SPEAKER_08]: what the zoning can legally do to address that frustration and address what can go forward, but just know that there are some things that zoning just cannot do by itself.

1400
02:06:46,562 --> 02:06:47,663
[SPEAKER_21]: And we wouldn't want it to do.

1401
02:06:48,103 --> 02:06:50,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

1402
02:06:50,906 --> 02:06:52,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1403
02:06:53,668 --> 02:06:59,873
[SPEAKER_21]: I also heard some negative connotations around kind of short term developers or flippers.

1404
02:07:00,794 --> 02:07:04,077
[SPEAKER_21]: How could zoning potentially attack this?

1405
02:07:04,377 --> 02:07:14,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is that something that has to be done kind of on a local policy level to incentivize developing and kind of living in the house that that you've renovated?

1406
02:07:15,238 --> 02:07:17,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, again, it gets to the ownership.

1407
02:07:18,561 --> 02:07:23,024
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's also what building code allows and doesn't allow.

1408
02:07:24,065 --> 02:07:36,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of the development standards that we've talked about, the green score that Paola presented to you a couple of meetings, certainly on the larger developments that may have a possibility.

1409
02:07:37,195 --> 02:07:40,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Paola and I were talking internally about whether or not we

1410
02:07:41,478 --> 02:07:48,721
[SPEAKER_08]: should recommend applying the green score maybe at the UR1, UR2 level, possibly even NR3.

1411
02:07:48,781 --> 02:07:56,124
[SPEAKER_08]: We heard some discussion today and also last week about whether or not we add an NR4 or something like that.

1412
02:07:56,644 --> 02:08:01,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we can take it back and look at the development standards and the design guidelines and see

1413
02:08:01,926 --> 02:08:03,487
[SPEAKER_08]: if there is a way that can help.

1414
02:08:03,728 --> 02:08:12,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, with ownership, with building code, with health codes, there are other things beyond zoning that control development.

1415
02:08:12,814 --> 02:08:15,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll yield to Alicia.

1416
02:08:15,396 --> 02:08:15,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia.

1417
02:08:16,637 --> 02:08:18,739
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to add in on that.

1418
02:08:18,819 --> 02:08:21,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to state there are two things.

1419
02:08:22,141 --> 02:08:24,483
[SPEAKER_16]: People referred to a particular flipper.

1420
02:08:24,503 --> 02:08:26,484
[SPEAKER_16]: There is one who's very active in Medford.

1421
02:08:26,885 --> 02:08:29,327
[SPEAKER_16]: He's doing a lot of projects.

1422
02:08:29,527 --> 02:08:31,088
[SPEAKER_16]: There are two things that

1423
02:08:31,982 --> 02:08:47,831
[SPEAKER_16]: We know it is that they tend to be large, and we cannot zone with the largest size of a house is unfortunately right we can say no more than this much lot coverage, but we can't say you can't build a 4000 square foot house like that's not allowed.

1424
02:08:48,551 --> 02:08:51,793
[SPEAKER_16]: But one of the things that we haven't dug into too deeply is the.

1425
02:08:52,793 --> 02:08:56,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Often there's a look to the styles that are very modernistic.

1426
02:08:57,435 --> 02:09:04,519
[SPEAKER_16]: And Medford residents speak very loudly about their desire for the style of housing that we see throughout.

1427
02:09:05,379 --> 02:09:10,562
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't object to flat roofs if they're in a triple-decker style, right?

1428
02:09:10,682 --> 02:09:14,384
[SPEAKER_16]: And we like the look and feel of what we see around Medford.

1429
02:09:15,202 --> 02:09:22,827
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that we really need to be considering design standards and whether those are in zoning, whether those come out of the CD board.

1430
02:09:23,308 --> 02:09:32,134
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not clear that we're able to get those through in this piece of the zoning, but I am asking for some money to continue this process.

1431
02:09:32,554 --> 02:09:44,042
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's something that we need to do in phase three is to talk about design standards so that we continue to have Medford that looks like Medford and doesn't look like

1432
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,831
[SPEAKER_16]: the shore, right?

1433
02:09:46,171 --> 02:09:50,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Big rectangles, wide windows that look out over the ocean.

1434
02:09:50,995 --> 02:09:52,456
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, they're beautiful.

1435
02:09:52,616 --> 02:09:55,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I love staying in them, but they're not Medford.

1436
02:09:55,798 --> 02:10:03,924
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyhow, I just wanted to raise that as one of the concerns that people didn't, when they talk about the character, I think that's one of the things that they mean.

1437
02:10:03,944 --> 02:10:11,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I think we need to be careful in terms of regulating design because aesthetics are subjective.

1438
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:12,611
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to change over time.

1439
02:10:15,224 --> 02:10:23,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, there are ways that modern design can be thoughtfully incorporated into more historic neighborhoods.

1440
02:10:23,546 --> 02:10:29,908
[SPEAKER_21]: I also do think we need to be just careful with the word character, because sometimes that can be an exclusionary term.

1441
02:10:30,929 --> 02:10:38,031
[SPEAKER_21]: So we just want to be mindful that, you know, we respect what's here in Medford, but we're also aware that, you know, Medford is constantly changing.

1442
02:10:38,051 --> 02:10:41,812
[SPEAKER_21]: And thanks to all of you, it seems like we're changing for the better.

1443
02:10:43,556 --> 02:10:48,201
[SPEAKER_16]: So shout out when residents today we're using the word character.

1444
02:10:48,221 --> 02:10:54,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's the kind of thing they're talking about is design standards and I didn't want people to think that they meant something else.

1445
02:10:55,367 --> 02:10:57,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, that's what I was kind of flagging there.

1446
02:10:59,587 --> 02:11:12,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we, just to add very quickly onto that, you know, we've been looking at development standards which are mandatory under zoning and are really tied to the site plan review process, so tied to those.

1447
02:11:12,776 --> 02:11:27,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We have certainly worked on ourselves and seen other firms who have worked on this idea of advisory design guidelines that give, in the site plan review process or in the special permit process, or in one case even for by right,

1448
02:11:28,487 --> 02:11:55,562
[SPEAKER_08]: that can be handed out to people that give more of an idea of exactly what Director Hunt was talking about, this idea of we prefer pitched roofs, we already have these historic styles, and even if you're doing a contemporary building, we'd like you to be sympathetic to these historic styles that can act as a conversational element during the permitting process.

1449
02:11:56,682 --> 02:12:23,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's certainly something where if the city goes forward with this, we can provide examples for consideration of how that is done in a way that, to your point, allows for flexibility over time, but does recognize historic patterns of development and historic building types and how those can be translated into more contemporary designs by the choice of the person doing the building.

1450
02:12:27,533 --> 02:12:32,339
[SPEAKER_21]: I also did want to bring up some comments about ADA compliance.

1451
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:40,789
[SPEAKER_21]: So I live in a giant new building with, I think we have at least four elevators which feels insane, but we have

1452
02:12:41,662 --> 02:12:43,403
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, hundreds and hundreds of units.

1453
02:12:44,803 --> 02:12:53,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I agree with the sentiment that, you know, larger development in the right place, I'm right by Wellington, you know, increases accessibility.

1454
02:12:53,606 --> 02:12:57,367
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also one of the places where, you know, three plus

1455
02:12:59,067 --> 02:13:10,330
[SPEAKER_21]: unit dwellings can be added very easily to the housing stock and provides more flexibility for people that may not have the means or even just the desire to own real estate.

1456
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:16,512
[SPEAKER_21]: But whether it's this meeting or next meeting, I'd love just a little clarification on that.

1457
02:13:18,472 --> 02:13:20,173
[SPEAKER_08]: We can look further into that for you.

1458
02:13:20,453 --> 02:13:21,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, cool.

1459
02:13:23,798 --> 02:13:25,039
[SPEAKER_21]: What else did I have?

1460
02:13:25,059 --> 02:13:27,841
[SPEAKER_21]: I do love the idea of NR4.

1461
02:13:27,861 --> 02:13:37,228
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how far we want to push these NRs or even the URs, but it could be interesting to see kind of like what a next step would look like for those.

1462
02:13:38,309 --> 02:13:47,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there were some comments about, you know, the quarter mile radius potentially being extended to a half mile radius, also the treatment of the commuter rail.

1463
02:13:47,856 --> 02:13:50,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any insight you could offer on that?

1464
02:13:51,220 --> 02:14:05,366
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing to say is that we were we talked about that as well as just to see we are showing the quarter mile radius and the half mile radius on the map, but we plan to take another look at what's within each of them.

1465
02:14:05,466 --> 02:14:13,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that knowing, by the way, that what's within the quarter mile radius in addition to the residential we showed for tonight for some of those.

1466
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:19,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That is also some of our squares and corridors are within that and we didn't talk about those today.

1467
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:22,392
[SPEAKER_08]: But we would like to have another look at it.

1468
02:14:22,432 --> 02:14:29,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We also heard some interesting testimony from people who are beyond that half mile radius and you know what their access is.

1469
02:14:29,673 --> 02:14:36,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're going to be doing a little zooming in to see what's going on there and does that make a difference to where we're drawing the districts.

1470
02:14:37,715 --> 02:14:41,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and the last thing I wanted to call out was Jeremy in Hillside.

1471
02:14:41,938 --> 02:14:45,962
[SPEAKER_21]: He mentioned, and this kind of brings me back to Salem Street.

1472
02:14:46,562 --> 02:14:50,445
[SPEAKER_21]: He had mentioned a specific division.

1473
02:14:50,465 --> 02:14:53,928
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was George and Hillside.

1474
02:14:54,569 --> 02:14:56,290
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if I got those streets correct.

1475
02:14:58,091 --> 02:15:04,276
[SPEAKER_21]: But if people have specific questions about specific lots or lines, what should their process be?

1476
02:15:06,767 --> 02:15:15,032
[SPEAKER_08]: goes straight to the city staff and I think they're collecting all of the comments.

1477
02:15:15,613 --> 02:15:24,759
[SPEAKER_08]: To my knowledge, everything they've collected, they've been sending straight to us and we would love to hear if people have questions about dividing lines or particular parcels.

1478
02:15:24,839 --> 02:15:25,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I here?

1479
02:15:25,819 --> 02:15:27,260
[SPEAKER_08]: My next door neighbor is that.

1480
02:15:27,941 --> 02:15:29,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please, please send those on.

1481
02:15:29,322 --> 02:15:30,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

1482
02:15:30,823 --> 02:15:31,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1483
02:15:32,522 --> 02:15:35,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I think those are all the questions that I wanted to elevate from the public.

1484
02:15:37,667 --> 02:15:38,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go through these.

1485
02:15:38,789 --> 02:15:42,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I have I think only eight pages this time.

1486
02:15:42,552 --> 02:15:48,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go through these again and make sure that we're considering everything.

1487
02:15:48,979 --> 02:15:51,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I do want to open it up to the rest of the board for discussion.

1488
02:15:52,723 --> 02:15:53,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, I see your hand.

1489
02:15:54,997 --> 02:15:58,141
[SPEAKER_21]: but also want to engage Adam, Annie.

1490
02:15:59,583 --> 02:16:00,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam, are you able to unmute yourself?

1491
02:16:00,944 --> 02:16:02,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Have we made you a host?

1492
02:16:03,327 --> 02:16:03,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I can.

1493
02:16:04,068 --> 02:16:04,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1494
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:08,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, I saw your hand first if you want to speak up.

1495
02:16:10,038 --> 02:16:17,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I just wanted to elevate some of the things I was hearing in the comments.

1496
02:16:19,323 --> 02:16:25,986
[SPEAKER_28]: I heard the desire for this in the comments, but not the particular sentiment until you said it.

1497
02:16:26,026 --> 02:16:29,828
[SPEAKER_28]: Something along the lines of an NR4, a more dense neighborhood residential for areas

1498
02:16:33,850 --> 02:16:46,711
[SPEAKER_28]: where that could potentially sustain that density, particularly thinking of something that people brought up around West Medford Square, kind of further around from that, that there were people who, there were comments that said they thought that

1499
02:16:47,983 --> 02:16:52,445
[SPEAKER_28]: kind of that proximity to West Medford's where it could sustain more density.

1500
02:16:52,625 --> 02:17:14,753
[SPEAKER_28]: And then also, I think interestingly, an interesting concept that was brought up kind of in both directions with regards to the transit radiuses is the concept of distance versus access, and was brought up both by people in the neighborhoods that are coming to mind, both by people in the kind of Glenwood and West Medford areas who were saying that we'll

1501
02:17:16,096 --> 02:17:26,006
[SPEAKER_28]: I live further out from this radius, and I think it is easier than it would illustrate to get to transit around me.

1502
02:17:26,666 --> 02:17:33,313
[SPEAKER_28]: And also by people in Medford Hillside who said, well, on the map, this looks very close, but there are only so many places you can cross the tracks.

1503
02:17:33,833 --> 02:17:38,998
[SPEAKER_28]: So in terms of access, it's not as close as the distance on a map makes it seem.

1504
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:54,363
[SPEAKER_28]: My biggest takeaway is to look into, as it comes to those transit radii and the concept of distance versus access, because I think they can play that both ways, where things are both closer and further away than they appear on the map.

1505
02:17:57,643 --> 02:18:03,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the topography, but also the issue of straight line versus numbers of turns.

1506
02:18:03,685 --> 02:18:08,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can take a closer look at that and see what else we have been

1507
02:18:11,032 --> 02:18:17,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking quite a bit at the topography, but I think, you know, hearing some of the comments today, it's worth taking another look.

1508
02:18:17,237 --> 02:18:19,359
[SPEAKER_08]: So appreciate for you raising that again.

1509
02:18:19,379 --> 02:18:34,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think John had kind of a really detailed example in terms of, like, you know, even before I get to, like, leaving the station, you know, there's this long process of stairs and walkways.

1510
02:18:34,132 --> 02:18:36,995
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, good, good elevation of that, Peter.

1511
02:18:38,665 --> 02:18:42,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam, did you have your hand up or were you just waving at us earlier?

1512
02:18:42,949 --> 02:18:44,110
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I had my hand up.

1513
02:18:44,370 --> 02:18:44,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1514
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:45,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1515
02:18:46,131 --> 02:18:47,773
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to drop some thoughts on us?

1516
02:18:49,394 --> 02:18:51,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, maybe thoughts and then a question.

1517
02:18:51,616 --> 02:19:06,007
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel like every time on the committee, I just want to make sure that we're holding our responsibility as the Community Development Board and what type of recommendations we should be doing.

1518
02:19:06,067 --> 02:19:06,988
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'll first start with

1519
02:19:08,052 --> 02:19:10,615
[SPEAKER_27]: my general thoughts.

1520
02:19:13,357 --> 02:19:15,880
[SPEAKER_27]: And then for context, I live in South Medford.

1521
02:19:16,941 --> 02:19:27,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I think that the surprising thing for me is just that the South Medford area more generally isn't higher zoned.

1522
02:19:29,916 --> 02:19:34,317
[SPEAKER_27]: from the neighborhood residential up to the urban residential.

1523
02:19:34,337 --> 02:19:43,640
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I kind of, I think I had similar reactions to folks about kind of the West Medford ability to support density.

1524
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:52,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Similarly with like the South Medford, especially what is planned for the Mystic Avenue corridor.

1525
02:19:52,682 --> 02:19:54,202
[SPEAKER_27]: And then

1526
02:19:57,764 --> 02:20:08,022
[SPEAKER_27]: I think my other reaction is like to the, you know, to the extent that things that you build physically have such a lasting timeline and time horizon.

1527
02:20:09,019 --> 02:20:22,548
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, it would be really nice to not have to, uh, revisit this in 10 years, um, and have it be kind of like immediately out of date or very like quickly out of date.

1528
02:20:23,249 --> 02:20:35,897
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, and then it would be also nice that, you know, if people were making decisions now about what to build and where the direction should go, um, that they could, you know, you know, plan for sort of like the 20 and 30 year time horizon.

1529
02:20:37,602 --> 02:20:45,008
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I think maybe mentioned on the last calls with zoning, also recognizing that zoning is a

1530
02:20:46,237 --> 02:20:50,239
[SPEAKER_27]: is not a mandate that everything is gonna change overnight.

1531
02:20:50,259 --> 02:20:53,900
[SPEAKER_27]: And so things kind of get incrementally filled out.

1532
02:20:55,121 --> 02:21:09,187
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I was just, yeah, and then maybe that leads to my question, which is just, what type of sort of feedback and at what level should this board be kind of giving the feedback just to recalibrate too.

1533
02:21:09,247 --> 02:21:12,449
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think it might be helpful for the community to also hear

1534
02:21:13,729 --> 02:21:20,331
[SPEAKER_27]: just so that they feel like we're listening and responding and engaging at the level of their concerns.

1535
02:21:21,332 --> 02:21:22,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, set some expectations.

1536
02:21:23,432 --> 02:21:23,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1537
02:21:24,072 --> 02:21:26,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia or Danielle, do you have insight there?

1538
02:21:26,273 --> 02:21:30,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Or would this be a question for Emily and Paola?

1539
02:21:32,235 --> 02:21:34,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that I might share that

1540
02:21:38,016 --> 02:21:44,280
[SPEAKER_16]: in this stage, if you think things are like off, this is a good time to say something, right?

1541
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:50,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, oh, we really think you should be doing it in our FAR or the UR is too much or we should be allowing this.

1542
02:21:51,263 --> 02:21:55,826
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a good time to say it because- This meaning this meeting or this process?

1543
02:21:55,886 --> 02:22:05,151
[SPEAKER_16]: If you are thinking that and you're just not sure if you want to say it because the consultants will come back with another proposal or not a proposal, but like,

1544
02:22:06,884 --> 02:22:13,890
[SPEAKER_16]: written down clear recommendations for you to make that you can accept or not accept.

1545
02:22:15,671 --> 02:22:28,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And we may even wanna sort of lay them out in some clear manner, like we wanna accept one, two, three, and four, but not six, so to speak, and then make those recommendations to the city council.

1546
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:39,925
[SPEAKER_16]: and that if at the next meeting, you're like, you know what, we'd really like to see some major changes, then you won't be able to vote it out at the next meeting.

1547
02:22:40,466 --> 02:22:51,732
[SPEAKER_16]: You would really need the consultants to go back, take a look at those, because some of what they do is they do analyze it and they do look at existing conditions and how does this affect surrounding stuff.

1548
02:22:53,332 --> 02:22:56,294
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they would bring it back again for like a third meeting on it.

1549
02:22:56,354 --> 02:22:59,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm just saying if people are thinking,

1550
02:23:00,343 --> 02:23:08,748
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna, we would rather hear what your, even if it's an internal conflict, I'd like to see this, but I'm concerned about that.

1551
02:23:09,428 --> 02:23:12,730
[SPEAKER_16]: That's actually super helpful for us to hear.

1552
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:20,154
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we can dwell on that and come back with a, we've thought of a way to address your concern and your conflict.

1553
02:23:20,214 --> 02:23:21,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Like that's the best of both worlds.

1554
02:23:23,636 --> 02:23:27,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, we would love to adopt zoning and it be done.

1555
02:23:27,638 --> 02:23:28,919
[SPEAKER_16]: But the reality is,

1556
02:23:29,355 --> 02:23:30,536
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're going to adopt zoning.

1557
02:23:31,216 --> 02:23:33,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we're going to adopt the square stuff.

1558
02:23:33,117 --> 02:23:34,658
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do different stages.

1559
02:23:35,499 --> 02:23:38,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are going to need to come back and do some cleanup.

1560
02:23:38,981 --> 02:23:41,843
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to need to come back and do some phase three stuff.

1561
02:23:42,924 --> 02:23:44,525
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd love to put it all to bed.

1562
02:23:45,410 --> 02:23:47,391
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's really big and complex.

1563
02:23:48,231 --> 02:23:50,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And it really does take a long time and a lot of thought.

1564
02:23:50,812 --> 02:23:52,813
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were trying to put this in.

1565
02:23:52,833 --> 02:24:08,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just sort of thinking about the fact that we're trying to put this forward for the boards, the city council and public in digestible portions that you can process, but they interact with each other.

1566
02:24:09,338 --> 02:24:11,699
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is some chicken in the egg going on.

1567
02:24:12,279 --> 02:24:14,680
[SPEAKER_16]: And we absolutely understand and respect that.

1568
02:24:15,265 --> 02:24:24,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And which is why I'm suggesting actually that we should bring forward some of the ADU work, even if it's not a final proposal, so you see how they interact with each other.

1569
02:24:26,452 --> 02:24:35,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Because of this chicken and egg, we may then adopt stuff and then we may come back and go, oh, oh yeah, we need to fix this.

1570
02:24:37,018 --> 02:24:52,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want people to understand that and recognize that because the alternative would be for us to work behind the scenes for a year, come forward with a massive proposal and everybody go, Oh my God, you've changed everything in the city all at once.

1571
02:24:53,524 --> 02:24:55,744
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would be so overwhelming.

1572
02:24:55,784 --> 02:24:57,665
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't even imagine doing it that way.

1573
02:24:58,472 --> 02:25:07,382
[SPEAKER_16]: But so I just wanted to acknowledge that this is kind of, it feels piecemeal, but we thought that the alternative was overwhelming.

1574
02:25:09,604 --> 02:25:10,525
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's really helpful.

1575
02:25:10,605 --> 02:25:11,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks, Alicia.

1576
02:25:12,242 --> 02:25:14,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so today's the meeting to kind of really beat it up.

1577
02:25:14,504 --> 02:25:27,636
[SPEAKER_21]: But that being said, like, we're not, we're not going to push this through on like a two meeting timeline, if that's not appropriate for, you know, the recommendations that come back and you know, how we feel as a board and you know, any additional public comments.

1578
02:25:27,857 --> 02:25:32,901
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but yeah, let's let's get everything out tonight, everything that we know of.

1579
02:25:34,723 --> 02:25:35,724
[SPEAKER_21]: And then go from there.

1580
02:25:44,221 --> 02:25:46,663
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to echo what some other folks said.

1581
02:25:46,683 --> 02:25:49,164
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is a great start.

1582
02:25:49,464 --> 02:25:55,888
[SPEAKER_19]: I also think that there are certainly some areas that can do with quite a bit more upzoning.

1583
02:25:56,368 --> 02:26:08,515
[SPEAKER_19]: It feels like some of the areas are pretty descriptive to where we are now and that doesn't allow for the growth that we've explicitly all said we want and need and creating that room.

1584
02:26:09,335 --> 02:26:12,616
[SPEAKER_19]: now and intentionally, I think, would serve us better.

1585
02:26:14,777 --> 02:26:29,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I've heard a lot of discussion about six-unit multiplexes specifically, and for what it's worth, I spent a couple of years in JP, and kind of the six-unit three-story triple-decker is a beloved fixture

1586
02:26:30,392 --> 02:26:47,450
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great housing for kind of units of all sizes from single people to small families and works really well in kind of built environments that are not dissimilar historically from some parts of Medford.

1587
02:26:48,211 --> 02:26:51,274
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that there are many areas that we're looking at.

1588
02:26:52,195 --> 02:26:56,920
[SPEAKER_19]: including the NR1, 2, 3, where that can fit in pretty easily.

1589
02:26:56,940 --> 02:27:00,363
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's one of the examples of the upzoning.

1590
02:27:06,168 --> 02:27:07,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, I see your hand.

1591
02:27:08,931 --> 02:27:15,157
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, something Ari was saying that made me think of one of the other things when we were talking about

1592
02:27:16,830 --> 02:27:28,943
[SPEAKER_28]: We were talking about an NR4 kind of along a similar line of that, plus Ari's thought about kind of some places that could use more zoning.

1593
02:27:28,983 --> 02:27:38,133
[SPEAKER_28]: I was thinking along the lines of, and I feel like this, this may be remembering a number wrong, but I feel like when we were talking about Salem Street, we were talking about a UR3.

1594
02:27:40,741 --> 02:27:45,784
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't remember if that ever existed, or I just made that up.

1595
02:27:45,844 --> 02:27:52,607
[SPEAKER_28]: But I would be interested to see, along similar veins to NR4, what a UR3 would look like.

1596
02:27:52,707 --> 02:28:06,014
[SPEAKER_28]: And obviously, not trying to create more work for people, but once again, along the lines of creating more density, which is something we've all stated we think we do need.

1597
02:28:07,495 --> 02:28:14,578
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, yeah, I think more density in the right areas is kind of the balance that I'm hearing.

1598
02:28:14,598 --> 02:28:25,222
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, UR3, yeah, I would love to kind of learn more about what an NR4 and UR3 could look like and where they might be.

1599
02:28:25,242 --> 02:28:31,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

1600
02:28:31,345 --> 02:28:34,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, for specific feedback,

1601
02:28:36,733 --> 02:28:46,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely looking into increasing the boundary of nodes for public transit, and I'm thinking specifically of the MBTA and the commuter rail.

1602
02:28:47,236 --> 02:28:59,660
[SPEAKER_21]: I recognize that bus is public transit, but I agree with previous commenters that it's probably not reasonable to think of buses the same way we think of commuter rail and the T.

1603
02:29:02,334 --> 02:29:05,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, thank you for everyone for putting up with my coughing and sniffling tonight.

1604
02:29:06,899 --> 02:29:12,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I got whatever was going around on the orange line and hopefully didn't pass it on to anybody.

1605
02:29:12,405 --> 02:29:18,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Trying to think of other specific things to really beat this up.

1606
02:29:22,431 --> 02:29:25,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, could I just yeah, I think that might be useful.

1607
02:29:25,575 --> 02:29:38,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just the progression, and our one is of course the lowest density than in our two than in our three residential one is denser than in our three.

1608
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:42,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Urban Residential 2, obviously denser than Urban Residential 1.

1609
02:29:42,693 --> 02:29:47,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I think last week we heard the idea of NR4.

1610
02:29:47,796 --> 02:30:03,466
[SPEAKER_08]: We were also considering that since there's NR123 and a mixed use 123, that we might consider UR123 with maybe the Urban Residential 1 dropping down to be closer, you know, that might replace NR4.

1611
02:30:05,588 --> 02:30:09,949
[SPEAKER_08]: going up so that the current urban residential 2 would become the urban residential 3.

1612
02:30:10,389 --> 02:30:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not formalized this because we wanted to hear what people said tonight, but just note that I think we can go, do we keep it always as like 3 districts for each category?

1613
02:30:21,392 --> 02:30:34,315
[SPEAKER_08]: That might just be a planner's desire to have things in nice, neat little orderly boxes, or do we in fact do the NR all the way up to 4 and the UR stays as just 1 and 2 districts.

1614
02:30:35,736 --> 02:30:48,605
[SPEAKER_08]: open for further discussion, but I think we are very much hearing that there's another district that type that needs to happen somewhere between the current NR3 and the current UR1.

1615
02:30:49,205 --> 02:30:50,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be exploring that.

1616
02:30:51,166 --> 02:30:56,010
[SPEAKER_08]: What we call it is a whole different matter, but we are, that middle piece seems to be missing.

1617
02:30:56,813 --> 02:31:09,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I would also be interested in seeing, you know, I mentioned tables for the ADUs, but I think they're a great way to kind of compare across the different proposed categories.

1618
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:14,483
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd love to see kind of in a table, and I agree with you, you know, it could be a

1619
02:31:15,003 --> 02:31:17,024
[SPEAKER_21]: an AB7 or whatever.

1620
02:31:17,044 --> 02:31:28,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care what the name is, but I think what we're all passionate about and what we're hearing from the public is, you know, we need more places for people to live in logical areas.

1621
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:30,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, I see your hand.

1622
02:31:30,971 --> 02:31:33,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1623
02:31:33,772 --> 02:31:41,556
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to clarify something because people have been tossing out NR4 and UR3, and I wanted to make sure that

1624
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,582
[SPEAKER_16]: We meant what we think we all mean the same thing.

1625
02:31:48,182 --> 02:32:05,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that what your people mean when they say that is that it would be a zone that allows single family, two, three, and four families, or does it mean single family, two, three, and four to six unit multi dwelling?

1626
02:32:05,635 --> 02:32:11,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I'm not actually clear, but I think the NR means single families are allowed in this district.

1627
02:32:12,942 --> 02:32:22,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that people mean when they say you are, that single families are not allowed in this district, that we're talking denser than that and going up higher and taller.

1628
02:32:23,564 --> 02:32:40,207
[SPEAKER_16]: And just wanted to sort of say something that was implied in what Emily said, but is that there's also the mixed use districts and the reminder that these districts at this time don't have commercial in them.

1629
02:32:40,786 --> 02:33:06,628
[SPEAKER_16]: we're talking about adding in commercial nodes, little neighborhoods that allow, and we're talking about how do we add in corner stores and somewhere in my world today, I think it was email, there was a conversation about like accessory dwelling or accessory commercial units, meaning tiny little stores that you can allow into neighborhoods.

1630
02:33:08,508 --> 02:33:21,243
[SPEAKER_16]: And those are some things that we're starting, we need to make sure we're including, but maybe we don't mean you are three, maybe we mean mixed-use three, that at that point, at that density, we also need commercial there.

1631
02:33:21,744 --> 02:33:23,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know what to say to that.

1632
02:33:23,906 --> 02:33:25,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's a helpful clarification.

1633
02:33:29,946 --> 02:33:31,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that is, that is a good clarification.

1634
02:33:31,891 --> 02:33:36,784
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, I will be the first to say that when I was thinking about an NR4, a UR3, I was not.

1635
02:33:40,465 --> 02:34:00,356
[SPEAKER_28]: being quite that specific, I was just thinking of the next step up from the existing NR3 and or UR2, and I was leaving that to kind of Emily and Paola to determine what and where that made the most sense, because I will admit I have not... I can say for sure I haven't spent as much time looking at the maps of Medford as they have.

1636
02:34:03,604 --> 02:34:19,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and I'll chime in that I love the reminder of mixed use, and I think that many of these areas, there is a lot of interest in kind of reasonably scaled mixed use and kind of looking at the neighborhood where I live on this.

1637
02:34:20,355 --> 02:34:31,163
[SPEAKER_19]: We are residential, but very close to a square, and there is mixed use within a 30 second walk, and that's a great aspect.

1638
02:34:34,129 --> 02:34:35,089
[SPEAKER_19]: that we want to encourage.

1639
02:34:35,109 --> 02:34:43,212
[SPEAKER_21]: So one of the things we're talking about is unit count.

1640
02:34:44,413 --> 02:34:54,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I know another thing that has come up in the meeting and is present in a lot of the community comments is allowable height in the stories.

1641
02:34:57,258 --> 02:35:00,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily, could you remind us the allowable heights

1642
02:35:02,691 --> 02:35:06,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, just one moment.

1643
02:35:07,875 --> 02:35:14,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So in R1 and R2, it's 2.5 stories.

1644
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:17,643
[SPEAKER_08]: In R3, UR1 and UR2, it is three stories.

1645
02:35:18,804 --> 02:35:24,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And then remembering that the idea is that they're going to butt up against those mixed districts, which go higher.

1646
02:35:24,228 --> 02:35:24,268
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1647
02:35:28,155 --> 02:35:35,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to add, while I have the opportunity to speak, that we have not forgotten about what we had originally called neighborhood nodes.

1648
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:44,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We have recommended those accessory commercial units for another community and have indicated we'd be delighted to talk about them for this one.

1649
02:35:45,407 --> 02:35:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: When I very first started being in the planning world, I was told about the five minute to ice cream rule, which I'm not sure is a real rule, but I could get behind a five minute walk to ice cream.

1650
02:35:55,855 --> 02:35:55,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1651
02:36:00,903 --> 02:36:03,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I would love to be able to walk five minutes to ice cream.

1652
02:36:03,844 --> 02:36:04,565
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I could.

1653
02:36:05,885 --> 02:36:11,988
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyways, so what I read in a lot of comments is, are you kidding me?

1654
02:36:12,368 --> 02:36:13,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Three stories is nothing.

1655
02:36:13,709 --> 02:36:16,290
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is me kind of paraphrasing.

1656
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:18,571
[SPEAKER_21]: We need more.

1657
02:36:20,071 --> 02:36:24,694
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm looking through the map right now, and

1658
02:36:31,113 --> 02:36:44,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't say I disagree, especially with some of these NR3s, UR1s that are around transit.

1659
02:36:44,556 --> 02:36:53,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, why would we only do three stories, you know, up to six units, literally right on top of a T-station?

1660
02:36:53,877 --> 02:36:56,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that, is the lot size limited?

1661
02:36:58,811 --> 02:37:02,995
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like that's where we should go up and up and up.

1662
02:37:03,175 --> 02:37:12,805
[SPEAKER_08]: With your permission, I think it's important to realize that the way the building looks is not just governed by height, it's also governed by the massing.

1663
02:37:12,945 --> 02:37:14,266
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, depending on

1664
02:37:15,507 --> 02:37:18,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned units, but let's put those to the side.

1665
02:37:18,069 --> 02:37:25,135
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had an unlimited number of units, you could have quite a large building at 3 stories, right?

1666
02:37:25,195 --> 02:37:35,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what we're trying to do is, again, have that discussion of what is appropriate for the neighborhood and what's the appropriate controls for it.

1667
02:37:36,343 --> 02:37:40,466
[SPEAKER_08]: height is one control, the number of units is another control.

1668
02:37:42,987 --> 02:37:53,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting more into design guidelines, we could be talking about roof lines and massing and how you break that up as well, which is another form of control.

1669
02:37:53,053 --> 02:37:54,554
[SPEAKER_08]: A three-story building with

1670
02:37:58,976 --> 02:38:04,439
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 units in it would look and feel very different from a three-story building with six units in it.

1671
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:13,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying to not go higher, I'm just giving an idea of how we were thinking of height as being one of several different controls on that.

1672
02:38:13,665 --> 02:38:23,510
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were going to go higher, we would then rethink some of the controls to ensure that the overall bulk of the building works well with the neighborhoods.

1673
02:38:26,172 --> 02:38:26,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I would second.

1674
02:38:28,492 --> 02:38:36,477
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair's comment, though, especially within that very immediate distance around the T's.

1675
02:38:36,577 --> 02:38:50,366
[SPEAKER_19]: The bulk might be different than there is now, but I think bulking up in those areas is very much the intentional plan and that these design guidelines should allow for that better than they do now.

1676
02:38:51,987 --> 02:38:54,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm zooming in closer and I'm looking at

1677
02:38:59,269 --> 02:38:59,850
[SPEAKER_21]: What is this?

1678
02:39:01,535 --> 02:39:06,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, looks like we have a lot of existing single family is being

1679
02:39:08,435 --> 02:39:10,236
[SPEAKER_21]: three, which I think makes sense.

1680
02:39:10,777 --> 02:39:14,939
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's some white spaces around the T, which I think are mixed use.

1681
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:20,643
[SPEAKER_21]: But looking at those are probably also smaller units.

1682
02:39:22,604 --> 02:39:26,847
[SPEAKER_21]: But on Boston Ave, our recent project.

1683
02:39:28,808 --> 02:39:30,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so those are all I think existing

1684
02:39:32,765 --> 02:39:34,767
[SPEAKER_20]: single family or smaller.

1685
02:39:35,027 --> 02:39:47,636
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, so maybe that does make sense.

1686
02:39:47,876 --> 02:40:00,205
[SPEAKER_21]: So for example, around Wellington, which is where I am, my building is just gray and around white, or white around gray.

1687
02:40:02,908 --> 02:40:08,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So that Wellington is a separate district that will be later anything that's that gray and white.

1688
02:40:09,431 --> 02:40:09,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1689
02:40:10,472 --> 02:40:13,614
[SPEAKER_21]: And then anything else beyond that is like mixed use or commercial.

1690
02:40:14,754 --> 02:40:15,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1691
02:40:16,955 --> 02:40:17,576
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so.

1692
02:40:21,558 --> 02:40:21,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1693
02:40:24,459 --> 02:40:29,622
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying to balance the need for more housing.

1694
02:40:31,629 --> 02:40:34,752
[SPEAKER_21]: which we know Medford desperately needs, the region desperately needs.

1695
02:40:35,373 --> 02:40:44,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Not that we're going to, you know, sacrifice Medford for the region, but we need to be aware of kind of our place in the larger housing ecosystem.

1696
02:40:44,982 --> 02:40:46,223
[SPEAKER_21]: If we were to go up to

1697
02:40:51,686 --> 02:40:55,631
[SPEAKER_21]: Or could there be, can we play with like affordability here?

1698
02:40:55,751 --> 02:41:01,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we say like, if more affordable units, then variants for more floors?

1699
02:41:01,938 --> 02:41:03,961
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1700
02:41:06,327 --> 02:41:30,122
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the incentive zoning, just as we have the green score, we could consider applying that to larger building sizes and you could create, for example, you could leave it, just to throw it out there, you could leave it at three stories with a fourth story as part of that incentive bonus in exchange for affordability or in exchange for something else.

1701
02:41:31,228 --> 02:41:49,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I feel like I'd be more in favor of doing that than saying, you know, like, anybody can build four stories, because I do want to incentivize affordable development, especially close to the T. But yeah, curious if other board members have any thoughts on that.

1702
02:41:53,383 --> 02:41:54,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Or Danielle, I see your hand.

1703
02:41:54,764 --> 02:41:57,366
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to bring us back down to reality.

1704
02:41:59,838 --> 02:42:01,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.

1705
02:42:01,239 --> 02:42:26,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just wanted to kind of like reiterate that the boundaries of these neighborhood residential and urban residential is because we considered those like the neighborhoods apart from, you know, these mixed use like denser areas, which are, you know, closer to like the main roads and the transit, and that this is, you know, kind of,

1706
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:39,589
[SPEAKER_13]: gradual, you know, going, you know, reducing in density in certain areas where there isn't the transit or the lot sizes are very small.

1707
02:42:40,831 --> 02:42:43,433
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not trying to do anything too drastic.

1708
02:42:43,513 --> 02:42:46,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the idea was to up zone, you know,

1709
02:42:48,683 --> 02:42:58,689
[SPEAKER_13]: A bit so that everyone can absorb a bit more units, but not change it so drastically, except for the areas where transit has been.

1710
02:43:01,611 --> 02:43:05,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Added like, more drastically, like the green line extension, like, we can't ignore that.

1711
02:43:06,653 --> 02:43:13,717
[SPEAKER_13]: The green line extension has come and then we need to change zoning to reflect that, but other places that you haven't seen.

1712
02:43:15,711 --> 02:43:19,613
[SPEAKER_13]: any real transformation in bus service or rail service.

1713
02:43:20,414 --> 02:43:35,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And also the fact that there are private ways that are very windy and steep and don't have sidewalks and blind corners and aren't maintained by the city are probably not the best places to put a lot of density.

1714
02:43:36,023 --> 02:43:38,585
[SPEAKER_13]: So kind of trying to balance all those factors.

1715
02:43:42,167 --> 02:43:43,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I appreciate kind of the

1716
02:43:45,641 --> 02:43:47,053
[SPEAKER_21]: the dance that you all have to do.

1717
02:43:50,207 --> 02:44:02,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And with your permission, Madam Chair and other members of the board, I think, you know, we've heard between the meeting last week, tonight's meeting from both the public and yourselves, we've heard loud and clear.

1718
02:44:02,915 --> 02:44:16,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you'd like to like us to just take a look at the density levels, maybe at the borders of each of the districts, you know, take into additional consideration.

1719
02:44:16,983 --> 02:44:23,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things that we talked about around transit, about maybe adding somewhere in the middle, there's a fourth change.

1720
02:44:25,323 --> 02:44:43,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've got quite a lot to work on from there and, you know, certainly happy to hear more thoughts tonight, anything else, but I think there's a lot that we can come back to you with in terms of both the organization, the materials, so you can see the side-by-side.

1721
02:44:44,322 --> 02:44:49,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also thinking it might be helpful for us to overlay our mixed-use district map.

1722
02:44:49,947 --> 02:44:57,931
[SPEAKER_08]: on to the residential that you can see kind of what what's filling in those areas that are kind of Tara incognito at the moment.

1723
02:44:58,631 --> 02:45:05,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And that might help some of the conversation as well I could put them back up and flip back and forth, but it's not going to be gonna lose our minds.

1724
02:45:05,814 --> 02:45:06,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you really will.

1725
02:45:07,355 --> 02:45:07,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1726
02:45:09,096 --> 02:45:10,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.

1727
02:45:10,337 --> 02:45:10,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1728
02:45:19,655 --> 02:45:32,941
[SPEAKER_19]: And for what it's worth, I will kind of express interest as well in the idea of kind of fourth story or additional kind of mass and type and unit sizes as incentive zoning for affordability.

1729
02:45:33,001 --> 02:45:39,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that that is an option we should consider, and I'd love to see what proposals you can bring us next time.

1730
02:45:40,164 --> 02:45:40,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1731
02:45:41,845 --> 02:45:47,189
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess, what's the minimum unit count where affordability comes into factor?

1732
02:45:47,249 --> 02:45:48,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that six?

1733
02:45:49,350 --> 02:45:49,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything?

1734
02:45:49,791 --> 02:45:51,372
[SPEAKER_21]: It's 10.

1735
02:45:52,112 --> 02:45:51,372
10.

1736
02:45:52,353 --> 02:45:52,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1737
02:45:53,173 --> 02:45:56,055
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our current inclusionary zone income.

1738
02:45:56,296 --> 02:45:56,656
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1739
02:45:56,676 --> 02:46:02,140
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great, but it would be really nice to have affordable units at a smaller scale embedded within a neighborhood.

1740
02:46:04,662 --> 02:46:10,406
[SPEAKER_21]: The financial viability of it, I'm not quite sure, but maybe it will

1741
02:46:12,923 --> 02:46:21,798
[SPEAKER_21]: You incentivize people to invest in their neighborhood, rather than, you know, short term renovations, but.

1742
02:46:23,155 --> 02:46:36,762
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like I think Adam said at a previous meeting, we just have to think about, like, what bad ideas or what bad decisions are we going to make today that, you know, our future selves or our kids' kids are going to say, I can't believe they thought that.

1743
02:46:37,963 --> 02:46:44,166
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'd appreciate any insight, Emily, Paola, Danielle, Alicia, you have on unintended consequences, as well as the public.

1744
02:46:45,506 --> 02:46:47,748
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we have some really great minds on this call.

1745
02:46:48,588 --> 02:46:52,190
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, we'd appreciate any gut checks there.

1746
02:46:54,483 --> 02:47:10,430
[SPEAKER_21]: And then in terms of other specific feedback, I am interested in this Mike and Laurel's comment about institutional

1747
02:47:12,448 --> 02:47:16,332
[SPEAKER_21]: zoning, you know, I know we can't, we obviously can't be discriminatory.

1748
02:47:16,652 --> 02:47:21,277
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, we want to look towards the future where Tufts University is a great neighbor.

1749
02:47:23,239 --> 02:47:32,868
[SPEAKER_21]: So we don't want to be too reactive, but just interested in seeing kind of the viability or if it's even realistic.

1750
02:47:35,212 --> 02:47:41,898
[SPEAKER_21]: to have kind of this institutional district and happy to kind of highlight their letter, where they speak more about it.

1751
02:47:44,081 --> 02:47:53,850
[SPEAKER_08]: We are we are with your permission, Madam Chair, we are looking into institutions, I think it's coming after the squares and remaining corridors, but we are looking at that.

1752
02:47:54,431 --> 02:47:56,172
[SPEAKER_08]: We've we've heard that desire.

1753
02:47:57,213 --> 02:47:59,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll see to Director Hunt.

1754
02:47:59,796 --> 02:47:59,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1755
02:48:01,761 --> 02:48:02,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1756
02:48:02,541 --> 02:48:05,303
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something that actually makes complete sense.

1757
02:48:06,483 --> 02:48:15,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And the piece, and I actually, I did actually exchange a small email with Laurel today to sort of better understand her thought, because I feel like it's a chicken and an egg.

1758
02:48:16,428 --> 02:48:16,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1759
02:48:16,568 --> 02:48:24,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Tufts completely agrees there should be a zone that they operate in that is not an apartment two zone.

1760
02:48:24,732 --> 02:48:26,653
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a neighborhood residential zone.

1761
02:48:26,713 --> 02:48:27,694
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a commercial zone.

1762
02:48:28,134 --> 02:48:30,375
[SPEAKER_16]: It should be designed for a campus

1763
02:48:30,963 --> 02:48:34,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And it should say what they can do in the outer parts and what they can do in the inner parts.

1764
02:48:35,425 --> 02:48:36,946
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what they have in Somerville.

1765
02:48:37,446 --> 02:48:44,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And it actually, some people feel it constrains them more, but it makes things very clear for everybody.

1766
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:53,894
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are certain things that they actually have to come to you for Dover stuff with that in Somerville they can just do because it's just fine.

1767
02:48:54,334 --> 02:48:59,877
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are other things that like they're regulated and there's more controls around it and it's more thoughtful.

1768
02:49:00,317 --> 02:49:10,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what's happened here is that somebody once upon a time decided to apply an apartment zone on a campus and it just doesn't make sense.

1769
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:20,663
[SPEAKER_16]: So the thing that I want to caution people though is that we can create an institutional zone and we have every intention of proposing one

1770
02:49:21,116 --> 02:49:27,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's been recommended that we tell Tufts that we're going to look at the Somerville one and that we actually go look at the Somerville one.

1771
02:49:28,243 --> 02:49:31,366
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is part of the plan is to better understand that.

1772
02:49:32,928 --> 02:49:39,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think neighbors feel it constrains them more and Tufts feels that it allows them to operate with more autonomy.

1773
02:49:40,215 --> 02:49:43,359
[SPEAKER_16]: So frankly, I see that as a win-win if everybody's happy.

1774
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:46,881
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to understand that better.

1775
02:49:46,941 --> 02:49:56,803
[SPEAKER_16]: But what it does not do is it does not prevent them from buying things in the commercial district, in the mixed-use district, in the residential district.

1776
02:49:57,164 --> 02:50:06,046
[SPEAKER_16]: It does not prevent them from building a six-unit building in a zone that allows a six-unit residential building.

1777
02:50:06,366 --> 02:50:12,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And it doesn't prevent them from buying a mixed-use or building something in the commercial zone.

1778
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:18,383
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I just need to make sure that we're all on the same page with that.

1779
02:50:18,904 --> 02:50:22,206
[SPEAKER_16]: It helps everybody, but it doesn't change.

1780
02:50:22,686 --> 02:50:28,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm having a hard time seeing how it changes what they would do in our other zones.

1781
02:50:28,730 --> 02:50:31,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So that said, absolutely.

1782
02:50:31,812 --> 02:50:41,879
[SPEAKER_21]: If they're operating within the same rules as everybody else, just like you said, if they can build a six-unit apartment building and so can, I don't know,

1783
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:47,353
[SPEAKER_21]: James Smith developer, whatever, then that's fine.

1784
02:50:47,693 --> 02:50:51,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, you know, they are following the exact same rules.

1785
02:50:52,336 --> 02:50:53,737
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no issue with that.

1786
02:50:53,998 --> 02:50:56,539
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's fine.

1787
02:50:56,559 --> 02:50:58,021
[SPEAKER_21]: I just I think we should, you know,

1788
02:50:58,801 --> 02:51:01,122
[SPEAKER_21]: kind of chase down this question a little bit.

1789
02:51:01,142 --> 02:51:11,604
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just flipping through the rest of the public comments, make sure that we captured anybody that wasn't here tonight.

1790
02:51:11,764 --> 02:51:18,025
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have a note from David McKenna that's kind of stimulated some thought in me about the setbacks.

1791
02:51:19,526 --> 02:51:24,927
[SPEAKER_21]: We're keeping the setbacks the same for NR, where was it?

1792
02:51:28,384 --> 02:51:29,685
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to step back to the same.

1793
02:51:29,705 --> 02:51:31,928
[SPEAKER_08]: NR1 and NR2.

1794
02:51:32,508 --> 02:51:32,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1795
02:51:33,870 --> 02:51:43,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we are, I think, clarifying them for the multifamily.

1796
02:51:43,299 --> 02:51:46,603
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's not going to be a zone anyway.

1797
02:51:49,888 --> 02:52:02,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're changing them from setbacks by use to setbacks by district, and in the process, some of them are remaining exactly the same, and some are modifying slightly, and I'll defer to Danielle.

1798
02:52:04,132 --> 02:52:06,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'd love to learn a little bit more about that process.

1799
02:52:08,458 --> 02:52:24,039
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I think, you know, hearkening back to the Salem Street conversation about sidewalks, you know, 12 feet felt like a lot when we were looking at it in, or when I was thinking about it, you know, my dad's 6'4", so I was like, that's two of my dad laying down.

1800
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:29,261
[SPEAKER_21]: But then when we looked at it in section, I think that provided a lot of clarity and scale there.

1801
02:52:29,681 --> 02:52:38,244
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm thinking about the setbacks for NR1 and 2, 15 feet in the front, 15 feet in the back.

1802
02:52:41,325 --> 02:52:45,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is your current single and two-family setback.

1803
02:52:45,366 --> 02:52:47,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is not, in fact, changing.

1804
02:52:48,007 --> 02:52:51,027
[SPEAKER_21]: But was there any thought on changing it

1805
02:52:55,764 --> 02:53:04,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I get the 15-foot backyard, but I'm thinking about the 15-foot front.

1806
02:53:04,912 --> 02:53:07,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Is 15-foot best practice?

1807
02:53:07,134 --> 02:53:09,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it industry standard?

1808
02:53:09,516 --> 02:53:12,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it what most of the houses have here?

1809
02:53:12,239 --> 02:53:14,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I have a letter from Mr. McKenna.

1810
02:53:15,702 --> 02:53:28,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like he has a historic home and he has a seven foot front setback and a five foot rear setback, which may not be ideal for everybody, but it does recognize that there is some precedent for less setback.

1811
02:53:30,290 --> 02:53:31,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, kind of talk me through that, I guess.

1812
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:48,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's no, there's no best practice around setback in that if you have this type of use you must have this setback typically in, you know, a suburb, you would have much deeper set front setbacks.

1813
02:53:49,617 --> 02:53:56,963
[SPEAKER_08]: more green lawn in the front, once you are in the combination of these smaller, tighter neighborhoods.

1814
02:53:57,063 --> 02:54:01,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm not surprised to hear a five-foot setback for historic house, that makes perfect sense.

1815
02:54:02,466 --> 02:54:09,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So in our one and our two where we're keeping that density lower, the number of units per lot lower, we've kept the 15-foot setback.

1816
02:54:10,552 --> 02:54:13,355
[SPEAKER_08]: In our three and above, we have the 10 foot setback.

1817
02:54:13,815 --> 02:54:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, when you get to the mixed use areas, it's even lower than that.

1818
02:54:17,078 --> 02:54:26,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so, you know, Danielle had mentioned that transition from the mixed use districts to the neighborhoods and it's not just the height that we're transitioning.

1819
02:54:27,027 --> 02:54:27,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1820
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:38,202
[SPEAKER_08]: These proposals, it's also some of the other characteristics from the perspective of the experience of walking down a street or being in a neighborhood.

1821
02:54:38,842 --> 02:54:44,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Height and the front yard setback are really huge determinants of how that feels, right?

1822
02:54:44,884 --> 02:54:51,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from where you're standing on the sidewalk or on the street, how far back it is, how tall it is.

1823
02:54:51,525 --> 02:54:55,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the sorts of things that we considered when looking at this.

1824
02:54:56,375 --> 02:54:58,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, can you high five somebody in their living room?

1825
02:55:00,797 --> 02:55:02,518
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I would want to do that either way.

1826
02:55:03,218 --> 02:55:11,862
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's some charming places that have those zero setbacks, but, you know, to Director Hunt's point earlier about

1827
02:55:12,662 --> 02:55:17,023
[SPEAKER_08]: the great contemporary buildings, they still may not be Medford.

1828
02:55:17,083 --> 02:55:25,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's kind of where we're trying to parse these details, is what makes sense, given what you have now, but also given where you're going.

1829
02:55:25,224 --> 02:55:27,184
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a transition.

1830
02:55:27,825 --> 02:55:30,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I have a friend who lives in Marblehead.

1831
02:55:30,645 --> 02:55:33,646
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the last that we have.

1832
02:55:34,146 --> 02:55:35,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah.

1833
02:55:35,766 --> 02:55:40,667
[SPEAKER_21]: That I could high five, I think, both neighbors across the street in their living room at the same time.

1834
02:55:43,193 --> 02:55:47,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a great experiment, who are walking in Marblehead, right?

1835
02:55:48,338 --> 02:55:49,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not the same place.

1836
02:55:50,099 --> 02:55:56,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And so thinking of the characteristics of the places, what we're trying to do, but also make it workable.

1837
02:55:57,639 --> 02:56:12,648
[SPEAKER_21]: But curious if any other board members, you know, have any other feedback about the setback, you know, 15 feet feels really big, especially as a minimum, and I'm kind of thinking about, you know, how we've talked about parking minimums in the past.

1838
02:56:14,949 --> 02:56:16,510
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, sometimes we're

1839
02:56:19,053 --> 02:56:43,709
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, sometimes I think we don't realize that it's a minimum when we set it, that it has to be 15 feet, whereas maybe the developer or the homeowner or the renovator or whoever thinks, I'd be happy being a little bit closer to the street, but they have to be 15 feet back.

1840
02:56:44,630 --> 02:56:47,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any thoughts about maybe making it 10 feet?

1841
02:56:49,273 --> 02:56:50,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm in Texas.

1842
02:56:50,916 --> 02:56:53,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but we have done this before.

1843
02:56:54,341 --> 02:56:56,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So, minimum and maximum from the street.

1844
02:56:57,566 --> 02:56:58,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, sorry.

1845
02:56:59,528 --> 02:57:11,859
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I was going to say, I am strongly in favor of hearing a broader option and I live in what would be described in these terms as a historic conversion that was done over 50 years ago.

1846
02:57:12,599 --> 02:57:17,884
[SPEAKER_19]: And all the units are, I can't be more than 5 to 10 feet.

1847
02:57:18,525 --> 02:57:20,706
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's very in keeping with the character.

1848
02:57:20,767 --> 02:57:22,508
[SPEAKER_19]: It's lovely place to live and.

1849
02:57:24,910 --> 02:57:30,272
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's certainly an option that we should leave on the table much more explicitly.

1850
02:57:30,292 --> 02:57:33,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm thinking of all the small-scale houses I've lived in.

1851
02:57:34,574 --> 02:57:37,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think all that separated us from the street was the staircase.

1852
02:57:38,156 --> 02:57:46,760
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was maybe, I don't know, five feet above street level, so rise over run, six-ish feet back.

1853
02:57:48,220 --> 02:57:54,822
[SPEAKER_21]: We could have had a little bit more room, but it also meant, you know, our front yard was a big bush and we didn't have to worry about mowing the lawn.

1854
02:57:55,962 --> 02:57:58,303
[SPEAKER_21]: And also trick-or-treating was a lot easier.

1855
02:57:58,323 --> 02:58:07,766
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know these are kind of like silly examples, but I think they go to kind of like the community that is built within a neighborhood too.

1856
02:58:09,026 --> 02:58:11,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, I see your hand, so I want to recognize that.

1857
02:58:12,358 --> 02:58:18,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to bring this up because I think one of the things people have talked about is the green space and the feel.

1858
02:58:18,563 --> 02:58:22,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like we heard that more last Thursday than we heard it today.

1859
02:58:23,046 --> 02:58:30,051
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to understand, and I cannot stand here right now and tell you how big of a yard you need to have a decent tree in it.

1860
02:58:30,712 --> 02:58:38,958
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that's something we should consider because a lot of our streets, particularly in denser neighborhoods, are too narrow to have street trees.

1861
02:58:39,850 --> 02:58:42,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm thinking about accessibility too.

1862
02:58:42,451 --> 02:58:46,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Like if the sidewalks are already very narrow, it's unlikely we can add street.

1863
02:58:46,913 --> 02:58:48,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I didn't think about that.

1864
02:58:48,634 --> 02:58:59,918
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have a back of sidewalk program where if there's no room for a street tree and you want a tree in your front yard, the city will plant a public tree in your front yard.

1865
02:59:00,298 --> 02:59:03,660
[SPEAKER_16]: The city owns it for two years, and after that, it becomes your tree.

1866
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:05,721
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I saw those ads on Facebook.

1867
02:59:06,241 --> 02:59:08,462
[SPEAKER_16]: But we want to leave room for those where we can.

1868
02:59:10,212 --> 02:59:10,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Ari?

1869
02:59:12,613 --> 02:59:28,599
[SPEAKER_19]: As a person who spent a perhaps unreasonable amount of time figuring out how many fruit trees I could have in my, as just mentioned, rather small yard, you can very comfortably have a tree in a 10 by 10 space.

1870
02:59:30,360 --> 02:59:33,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, very comfortably choose the right species.

1871
02:59:33,981 --> 02:59:35,302
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't even have to be a dwarf.

1872
02:59:36,462 --> 02:59:38,783
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have plenty of room to play with.

1873
02:59:40,057 --> 02:59:47,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think it's a good thing that Alicia highlighted, but I appreciate the kind of professional or the personal anecdote that you can share.

1874
02:59:48,143 --> 02:59:48,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam?

1875
02:59:50,084 --> 03:00:06,637
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'd also like, I think my general sort of like posture on zoning and sort of this kind of stuff is the more flexibility that we can offer to the people that are, you know, the property owners, I think the better.

1876
03:00:07,935 --> 03:00:23,105
[SPEAKER_27]: And then my only other anecdote that I'm just like, I always kind of find it funny, how like triple-deckers have like kind of become this like romantic housing structure in the Boston area.

1877
03:00:23,125 --> 03:00:35,654
[SPEAKER_27]: When like, you know, their original purpose was to solve an acute housing problem for working class people to be able to afford to live in the Boston area.

1878
03:00:37,515 --> 03:00:57,535
[SPEAKER_27]: And so a lot of like what I'm just trying to also think in the back of my head is I would love for us to have zoning that allows for new types of things and new types of standards or new types of solutions to evolve without having the hubris to think that I

1879
03:00:59,392 --> 03:01:04,274
[SPEAKER_27]: I, as a resident, know what that answer is ahead of time.

1880
03:01:04,754 --> 03:01:06,855
[SPEAKER_27]: So just wanted to reiterate that.

1881
03:01:07,475 --> 03:01:08,015
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that.

1882
03:01:08,355 --> 03:01:11,776
[SPEAKER_21]: And your first point was about flexibility.

1883
03:01:13,737 --> 03:01:18,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any specific ideas on where you think more flexibility could be embedded?

1884
03:01:18,299 --> 03:01:24,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we've talked about building heights, setbacks, unit counts.

1885
03:01:25,941 --> 03:01:26,321
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1886
03:01:30,825 --> 03:01:33,287
[SPEAKER_27]: I need to digest it a little bit more.

1887
03:01:33,887 --> 03:01:47,717
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think, you know, it's just, and here in the community has been very helpful too of, you know, there's sort of the old footprint of Medford and how it developed.

1888
03:01:49,138 --> 03:01:52,961
[SPEAKER_27]: So West Medford being historically a single family and the rest of Medford not.

1889
03:01:54,842 --> 03:01:58,005
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think the thing I'm trying to think about is just,

1890
03:02:01,047 --> 03:02:07,929
[SPEAKER_27]: more broadly, should, should we actually be a bit more aggressive in allowing more stories and up zoning?

1891
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:12,571
[SPEAKER_27]: That's just in my head.

1892
03:02:12,631 --> 03:02:16,172
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have a concrete proposal on that, though.

1893
03:02:16,672 --> 03:02:16,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1894
03:02:19,161 --> 03:02:28,646
[SPEAKER_21]: I think for board members and members of the public, we can continue to share thoughts with Danielle, Alicia, Emily, and Paola.

1895
03:02:29,826 --> 03:02:35,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Our deliberations as a board do need to happen in these official meetings to abide by open meeting law.

1896
03:02:35,729 --> 03:02:40,352
[SPEAKER_21]: But by all means, continue to kind of think through these things.

1897
03:02:41,872 --> 03:02:43,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, and then maybe just the other point.

1898
03:02:43,613 --> 03:02:45,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry to if you keep going.

1899
03:02:45,734 --> 03:02:45,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1900
03:02:47,235 --> 03:03:04,848
[SPEAKER_27]: Just having lived, and I know, Annie's mentioned before that, you know, my person on New York City, but having lived in different areas across the country, three stories really isn't that tall.

1901
03:03:05,668 --> 03:03:10,872
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can have very community, cozy feeling neighborhoods.

1902
03:03:12,898 --> 03:03:23,263
[SPEAKER_27]: that you kind of take a step back, you know, I've lived in London at a certain point and like, you know, I went back and I realized like, oh, wow, that was six stories tall, you know, those white row houses in London.

1903
03:03:26,804 --> 03:03:37,529
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, that's the other thing kind of in my head around like the height is the three stories is maybe like an anchoring that we have right now that really,

1904
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:51,640
[SPEAKER_27]: In other cities, I haven't really felt when I've been in them and they're taller up to six, like I just haven't felt that, you know, the quaintness, the vibrancy to be diminished.

1905
03:03:52,670 --> 03:03:55,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think it also has to do with street section, too.

1906
03:03:55,211 --> 03:04:04,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Because thinking about some of the really tight streets that the public has mentioned, where if two cars are parked, a fire truck can't get through.

1907
03:04:04,814 --> 03:04:07,295
[SPEAKER_21]: That's probably not the right place for a six story.

1908
03:04:07,855 --> 03:04:19,179
[SPEAKER_21]: But if there's a little bit more air in between both sides of the street, then that could lend itself to a higher

1909
03:04:26,237 --> 03:04:26,977
[SPEAKER_21]: to a higher building.

1910
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:41,687
[SPEAKER_21]: It maybe would be interesting to see some visual examples of, it could be Medford, it could be Somerville or Cambridge.

1911
03:04:42,027 --> 03:04:51,833
[SPEAKER_21]: I prefer it as local as possible, just because I think we get into dangerous territory when we start pretending to be the city that we're not.

1912
03:04:51,853 --> 03:04:55,496
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, some examples of,

1913
03:04:57,864 --> 03:05:11,647
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, three stories, maybe within a neighborhood district or, you know, some increased density that maybe we didn't realize was as dense to kind of pick on what Adam's saying.

1914
03:05:12,308 --> 03:05:23,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, how can we, how could we, like, qualify our lived experience in comparison to these proposed zones?

1915
03:05:36,317 --> 03:05:41,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie, I want to maybe pull you into this conversation, just see if you have any feedback or any thoughts.

1916
03:05:45,683 --> 03:05:49,365
[SPEAKER_21]: No pressure, but I just want to make sure that it was a good discussion.

1917
03:05:49,485 --> 03:05:58,971
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said last time, I have carefully listened to what everybody is saying, but I don't think my opinion on it has changed.

1918
03:05:59,719 --> 03:06:03,220
[SPEAKER_05]: In our previous discussions, I think we need to go taller.

1919
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:08,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need more mixed use with retail.

1920
03:06:08,822 --> 03:06:19,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We need little neighborhood grocery stores and fruit stores, which I think, sadly, we have very few of.

1921
03:06:22,907 --> 03:06:26,829
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to be able to walk to an ice cream store within five minutes.

1922
03:06:27,794 --> 03:06:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd much prefer to go to a place that has fruit and vegetables that's five minutes.

1923
03:06:34,839 --> 03:06:38,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I like wide streets.

1924
03:06:39,082 --> 03:06:40,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I like green space.

1925
03:06:40,924 --> 03:06:55,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see 15, 20 feet of trees and not necessarily watering grass, but shrubbery and places where it's appropriate

1926
03:06:55,986 --> 03:07:23,562
[SPEAKER_05]: for restaurants to have tables and chairs outside and benches where people can sit, again, depending on the neighborhood, because we have some pretty darn narrow streets where people don't have driveways to park in or any place but the street to put cars on, so changing

1927
03:07:24,146 --> 03:07:29,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not going to help people at all by saying you can only park on one side of the street.

1928
03:07:30,591 --> 03:07:36,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw how that affected friends of mine who lived in Cambridge, and that doesn't really work well.

1929
03:07:36,735 --> 03:07:49,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think you're going to be really interested in the kind of mixed-use zoning conversations that are coming up and the overlay of that onto these residential districts.

1930
03:07:50,025 --> 03:07:53,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And Emily, I saw you had your hand up earlier, so I want to recognize that as well.

1931
03:07:55,098 --> 03:07:59,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say the message is next use.

1932
03:08:00,246 --> 03:08:05,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that we've got to wrap our arms around that.

1933
03:08:06,876 --> 03:08:07,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Well said.

1934
03:08:09,472 --> 03:08:26,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to add that we'd be happy to add some more illustrations, both of street sections, which we have started to do for Medford Square, so we can look at whether or not or how they could be appropriate for this, but also some illustrations of.

1935
03:08:26,847 --> 03:08:35,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Buildings at different heights and massing because I agree with the other members of the board who brought this up that that can help a conversation.

1936
03:08:35,630 --> 03:08:42,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we had, we had shown some of the diagrams already just so people would know what we're thinking about.

1937
03:08:42,653 --> 03:08:45,896
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think pictures of existing buildings can also be useful.

1938
03:08:46,336 --> 03:08:48,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and like a larger neighborhood context, too.

1939
03:08:49,058 --> 03:08:49,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1940
03:08:50,199 --> 03:08:50,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1941
03:08:51,780 --> 03:08:57,264
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also popping through some letters and seeing some specific feedback about specific addresses.

1942
03:08:58,105 --> 03:08:59,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that something you'd like us to call out now?

1943
03:09:02,139 --> 03:09:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that those are shared with the planning department that would be much easier for us to work with them on.

1944
03:09:08,346 --> 03:09:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the same course of action you mentioned that any deliberations obviously have to be in this meeting.

1945
03:09:15,895 --> 03:09:21,061
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there are emails that go through planning staff to us that are individual, that's just fine.

1946
03:09:21,682 --> 03:09:21,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1947
03:09:22,503 --> 03:09:22,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1948
03:09:35,792 --> 03:09:36,132
[SPEAKER_22]: public comment.

1949
03:09:47,756 --> 03:09:55,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Does that feel like we have to say should we should we look for a motion to continue to date certain.

1950
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:06,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1951
03:10:08,681 --> 03:10:13,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, unless there's other comments from the board or city staff.

1952
03:10:18,305 --> 03:10:22,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we can make a motion to continue to a date certain.

1953
03:10:22,967 --> 03:10:23,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1954
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:33,207
[SPEAKER_21]: So hold on, I just want to I want to check the date because our next board meeting is, I think, believe scheduled for the 16th.

1955
03:10:34,068 --> 03:10:42,855
[SPEAKER_21]: But I want to check with Emily, Paola, Alicia, Danielle, if you think that's enough time to address what's been talked about here tonight.

1956
03:10:43,896 --> 03:10:50,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Understanding that, you know, Ari, did you have something to say?

1957
03:10:50,201 --> 03:10:51,021
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

1958
03:10:54,379 --> 03:11:00,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam chair, well, we could continue it to that to the next meeting and if it's not ready, then we could just.

1959
03:11:00,887 --> 03:11:03,410
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, continue it again, but.

1960
03:11:05,913 --> 03:11:09,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I would just hold on.

1961
03:11:09,678 --> 03:11:11,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, I'm going to send you a quick message.

1962
03:11:44,282 --> 03:11:47,865
[SPEAKER_08]: While you're sending the message, I would say I think we can agree with that.

1963
03:11:48,245 --> 03:11:53,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And the idea would be we could at least give you a progress report, even if we're not fully complete.

1964
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:57,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of these will take a lot of conversation.

1965
03:11:57,493 --> 03:12:03,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of this, I think, we can sort of behind the scenes work in terms of pulling images and doing diagrams.

1966
03:12:03,998 --> 03:12:08,441
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we could certainly give you a progress report on that date if needed.

1967
03:12:08,801 --> 03:12:12,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as Danielle suggested, if we needed to,

1968
03:12:14,666 --> 03:12:17,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll ask you to move that to date.

1969
03:12:17,167 --> 03:12:17,828
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be fine.

1970
03:12:18,408 --> 03:12:19,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, as well.

1971
03:12:23,250 --> 03:12:25,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we'll propose the 16th.

1972
03:12:29,213 --> 03:12:30,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Does somebody want to make a motion?

1973
03:12:30,754 --> 03:12:31,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter has already started.

1974
03:12:33,015 --> 03:12:33,855
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, so moved.

1975
03:12:34,715 --> 03:12:35,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I get a second?

1976
03:12:37,177 --> 03:12:38,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

1977
03:12:38,837 --> 03:12:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you beat me to it.

1978
03:12:40,138 --> 03:12:42,079
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna do a roll call vote.

1979
03:12:43,675 --> 03:12:44,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter cows.

1980
03:12:45,277 --> 03:12:47,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Ari Goffman Fishman.

1981
03:12:48,420 --> 03:12:51,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Adam Barons.

1982
03:12:51,484 --> 03:12:53,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Annie string.

1983
03:12:54,447 --> 03:12:56,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I myself Emily had him in MMI.

1984
03:13:04,587 --> 03:13:06,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you everybody so much, members of the public.

1985
03:13:07,929 --> 03:13:11,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Meeting is not over, so if you want to hear us approve minutes, please stay on.

1986
03:13:12,172 --> 03:13:18,276
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to make one last plug for applying to board positions.

1987
03:13:18,296 --> 03:13:22,459
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to drop the links one last time in the chat for everybody.

1988
03:13:22,479 --> 03:13:23,480
[SPEAKER_21]: You too can

1989
03:13:27,222 --> 03:13:32,486
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, deliberate these items, you too can listen to your fellow residents.

1990
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:37,129
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, it's honestly like a huge honor to do this work.

1991
03:13:37,349 --> 03:13:47,017
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd encourage everybody that's interested to kind of submit, submit some interest to either this board or other boards or commissions.

1992
03:13:48,598 --> 03:13:50,159
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to move on to our next agenda item.

1993
03:13:51,810 --> 03:13:54,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Quick check with board members.

1994
03:13:54,070 --> 03:13:56,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we need a bio break or we want to keep going?

1995
03:13:56,451 --> 03:13:59,291
[SPEAKER_28]: You just have the minutes left, right?

1996
03:13:59,331 --> 03:14:00,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we just have the minutes.

1997
03:14:00,692 --> 03:14:01,812
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's just get through them.

1998
03:14:02,172 --> 03:14:02,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, great.

1999
03:14:04,893 --> 03:14:05,053
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks.

2000
03:14:05,073 --> 03:14:05,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2001
03:14:22,167 --> 03:14:26,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we have minutes for March 5th and March 19th.

2002
03:14:28,231 --> 03:14:34,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have any corrections needed for the draft minutes?

2003
03:14:35,355 --> 03:14:45,021
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we don't have an active clerk, but relying on all members of the board for their thoughtful and thorough review.

2004
03:14:53,082 --> 03:15:02,731
[SPEAKER_21]: If we don't have any corrections, then I'd be looking for a motion to approve the minutes for March 5th and March 19th.

2005
03:15:09,477 --> 03:15:16,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I would make a motion to approve the minutes for those two dates as you described.

2006
03:15:17,524 --> 03:15:18,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Annie.

2007
03:15:18,064 --> 03:15:18,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for a second.

2008

[SPEAKER_22]: I second.

2009
03:15:23,443 --> 03:15:24,143
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam can have it.

2010
03:15:26,925 --> 03:15:28,366
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

2020
03:15:43,476 --> 03:15:46,217
[SPEAKER_21]: The next item we have on the agenda is zoning updates.

2021
03:15:47,238 --> 03:15:50,260
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we got a good dose of zoning this evening.

2022
03:15:53,098 --> 03:15:57,341
[SPEAKER_21]: So unless there's anything urgent, I think we can move past this item.

2023
03:15:57,701 --> 03:15:59,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that okay, Alicia and Danielle?

2024
03:16:01,123 --> 03:16:01,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

2025
03:16:02,104 --> 03:16:05,646
[SPEAKER_21]: So the next thing we're going to be looking to is a motion to adjourn.

2026
03:16:05,666 --> 03:16:10,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't all fight for it.

2027
03:16:11,230 --> 03:16:12,911
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll move to adjourn.

2028
03:16:15,012 --> 03:16:16,613
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Peter had that one.

2029
03:16:17,133 --> 03:16:18,214
[SPEAKER_28]: Adam can take it.

2030
03:16:18,714 --> 03:16:20,816
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Adam, who wants the second?

2031
03:16:22,922 --> 03:16:23,783
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll just second it then.

2032
03:16:24,424 --> 03:16:24,785

[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's still April fools.

2048
03:17:04,618 --> 03:17:07,741
[SPEAKER_16]: My phone just told me heavy snow is expected in Medford.

2049
03:17:08,562 --> 03:17:10,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh no.

2050
03:17:11,205 --> 03:17:11,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta go home.
