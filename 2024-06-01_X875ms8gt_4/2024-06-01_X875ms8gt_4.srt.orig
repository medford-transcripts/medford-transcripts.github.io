00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:56,706
[SPEAKER_44]: Aye.

27
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:57,586
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

28
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,127
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

29
00:00:59,167 --> 00:00:59,907
[SPEAKER_46]: This is 24-062 be it resolved.

30
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:16,555
[SPEAKER_46]: by the Medford City Council that we honor and commemorate the dedicated service of former Medford Mayor and State Representative John J. Jack McGlynn and the United States Army and the 3132 Signal Service Company, part of the World War II Ghost Army, upon posthumous receipt of the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21st.

31
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:24,599
[SPEAKER_46]: Be it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in honor of all of those who served in the Ghost Army to defend democracy, the people of the United States, and all humankind.

32
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:25,839
[SPEAKER_46]: And we have 24070.

33
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:41,769
[SPEAKER_46]: by Councillor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and thank former Mayor Jack McGlynn for his service to our great country, and finally being recognized for his heroism in being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service as a member of the Secret Ghost Army during World War II.

34
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:50,431
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll be brief and I'll turn it over to Councillor Scarpelli, but my favorite anecdote in the news stories that have come out about this was

35
00:01:51,511 --> 00:02:10,003
[SPEAKER_46]: former Mayor Mike McGlynn talking about how he got a phone call when he was mayor from a news source in the 90s, and it was about, they were saying, oh, well, we've learned about the Ghost Army, we learned your father, former Mayor Jack McGlynn, was in the Ghost Army, and he called his dad, and his dad's response was, who told you that?

36
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:19,669
[SPEAKER_46]: I need to track that down, because it was that much of a secret, and even 50 years later, he wanted to know how that information had gotten out there, and I think that just shows the dedication and service that

37
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,206
[SPEAKER_46]: he gave to the city and the country.

38
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:24,207
[SPEAKER_46]: And with that, I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.

39
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,629
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, President Beasley.

40
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,152
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, a great man, a great family.

41
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:37,699
[SPEAKER_38]: And these are the things when you know someone's a true hero, when you realize when no one's watching.

42
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:43,584
[SPEAKER_38]: And Jack McGlynn did this for 100 years.

43
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:45,866
[SPEAKER_38]: He tried to stay under the radar.

44
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,188
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's about time that

45
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:49,904
[SPEAKER_38]: He could be recognized.

46
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:53,225
[SPEAKER_38]: Unfortunately, he wasn't here, but his family was.

47
00:02:53,245 --> 00:03:00,069
[SPEAKER_38]: I know that his children went out to Washington to receive the honor.

48
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:15,997
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that we as a city should really praise and honor people like Jack McGlynn, not for just the service here in the city, in the state, but for also what he did when nobody was watching.

49
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:17,918
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's a true sign of a true hero.

50
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:32,293
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is where, hopefully, there are history books written where Medford students can learn about how important Jack McGlynn was to our community and to our country.

51
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,894
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think that I'd like to dedicate this meeting to Mr. Jack McGlynn.

52
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:47,276
[SPEAKER_38]: And hopefully, I would recommend that this city finds it within themselves to erect a statue in my eyes

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,822
[SPEAKER_38]: for that person who did so much for this country.

54
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,683
[SPEAKER_38]: So he's what Medford's all about.

55
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:55,664
[SPEAKER_38]: So thank you.

56
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

57
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:58,025
[SPEAKER_29]: Any further comments?

58
00:03:59,085 --> 00:03:59,666
[SPEAKER_29]: Councillor Seng.

59
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:00,646
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

60
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:10,231
[SPEAKER_29]: I grew up in Medford where Mr. McGlynn was mayor and his father was around and a very active member of our community.

61
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,933
[SPEAKER_29]: And it was always a joy to talk to them and hang with them.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,542
[SPEAKER_29]: and hear their stories.

63
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:29,624
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think, I can't say more, that would be more eloquent than what my fellow councillors said, but they're, you know, I'm glad that we're recognizing Jack McGlynn's service to our city and to our country.

64
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,371
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councillor Sang.

65
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,152
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comment?

66
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,693
[SPEAKER_46]: And if you don't know about the Ghost Army, I really recommend taking a look.

67
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,534
[SPEAKER_46]: There's been some really great articles, NPR, a few other ones that are free, no paywall.

68
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:50,518
[SPEAKER_46]: There's about 2,000 people who, with signals intelligence and inflatable tanks, tricked the Nazis into thinking they were 50,000 people and saved a lot of lives while doing it.

69
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:52,219
[SPEAKER_46]: Any public comment?

70
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,419
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Castanetti?

71
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,860
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

72
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:01,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

73
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry I'm late, talking about Mr. McGlynn, Sr.? ?

74
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:05,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

75
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:10,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to say the man was, he's a great man and a great neighbor across the street from me on Cushman Street.

76
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:22,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I first moved there, I knocked on the door in 1980, introduced myself, because my sister worked for the Attorney General, Francis X. Bilotti, and I know he knew of the people.

77
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:27,720
[SPEAKER_11]: So he started speaking in Italian, I mean, fluent.

78
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, I thought you were an Irishman.

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,201
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, I grew up speaking Italian just like I did in the house.

80
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:41,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't understand half of what he said, because he spoke Southern Italian, but he was very fluent in his Italian.

81
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:50,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And he spoke Latin also, and he told me that whenever his grandkids got an A in Latin, he would give them a hundred dollar bill back then.

82
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It was wonderful.

83
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:56,949
[SPEAKER_11]: He's one of the last of the greatest generation.

84
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:02,877
[SPEAKER_11]: obviously, and he is a consummate gentleman and a consummate politician.

85
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss him a lot.

86
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:05,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

87
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:06,898
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

88
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:13,440
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion by myself and Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang, all those in favour?

89
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,620
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

90
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:18,202
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

91
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:25,284
[SPEAKER_46]: 24063, offered by Vice President Collins and Councillor Sang, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the holy month of Ramadan

92
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:28,315
[SPEAKER_46]: and wish a happy Ramadan and an easy fast to all who observe.

93
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,276
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

94
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:31,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

95
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to Councillor Seng for co-sponsoring this with me.

96
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:46,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanted to take a quick moment during this special time of the year for many people in Medford to acknowledge our Muslim community and wish all celebrants a happy Ramadan during this special time for their faiths.

97
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:46,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

98
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,257
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

99
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:53,078
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, for putting this on the agenda with me.

100
00:06:53,798 --> 00:07:13,724
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a growing Muslim community here in Medford that we're very happy to welcome, and we know that this has been a difficult year, but we want to make sure that everyone's fast is easy this month, that we recognize this really important month for so many of our residents, a month of spiritualism, a month of

101
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,886
[SPEAKER_29]: purity and of love and embrace.

102
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:22,328
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I'm very happy to move approval on this question.

103
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:28,211
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of Councillor Saing and Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Callaghan, any further discussion?

104
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,233
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favour?

105
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,093
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

106
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:31,974
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

107
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:32,854

00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:36,416
[SPEAKER_46]: The records of the meeting of March 19th, 2024 were passed to Councillor Scarpelli.

109
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,017
[SPEAKER_46]: Councillor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

110
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:43,154
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Scarpelli found the records in order and moves approval, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

111
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:44,015
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

112
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,035
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

113
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:45,976
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

114
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:48,258

00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:52,801
[SPEAKER_46]: 24045, committee of the whole report, March 19th, 2024.

116
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:56,244
[SPEAKER_46]: This was our final meeting on budget recommendations, which were submitted to the mayor.

117
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:01,008
[SPEAKER_46]: We have received an informal acknowledgement of receipt and expect a formal response.

118
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:04,511
[SPEAKER_46]: We also expect budget meetings to begin in the middle of this month.

119
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:08,172
[SPEAKER_46]: I think April 17th will be our first meeting.

120
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,192
[SPEAKER_46]: So that is an improvement.

121
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:19,774
[SPEAKER_46]: We should have by then, not only warrant articles, but also quarter one, two, and three budget to actuals and revenue projections for fiscal year 25.

122
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:27,416
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

127
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:46,144
[SPEAKER_46]: We had another confusing meeting on food trucks on March 20th 2024.

128
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:55,707
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we managed to land at the end with a decent understanding of what legal authority applies to food trucks on what properties, but there's going to be further discussion on this matter.

129
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,576
[SPEAKER_46]: Is there a motion to approve or any further discussion on the report?

130
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:03,097

136
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,015
[SPEAKER_46]: to initiate the zoning amendment process.

137
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,757

145
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:48,206
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

146
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:57,309
[SPEAKER_29]: For this governance committee meeting, we invited the elections commission and chief of staff Nazarian, who has been helping the elections department in the last few months.

147
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,370
[SPEAKER_29]: We asked them questions.

148
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,491
[SPEAKER_29]: They gave us an update as to how the department's running.

149
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:05,612
[SPEAKER_29]: They told us about a post-election audit that will be happening.

150
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,194
[SPEAKER_46]: And this is more of a post-election internal report

151
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:11,651
[SPEAKER_46]: All right.

152
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:15,873
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of Councilor Sang to approve the committee report, any further discussion?

153
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,195
[SPEAKER_46]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

154
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:18,895
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

155
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:19,996
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

156
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,697
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

157
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:27,160
[SPEAKER_46]: 23-427 and 24-008, Planning and Permitting Committee Report, March 27th, 2024.

158
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,621
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Collins.

159
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:29,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

160
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:38,586
[SPEAKER_18]: At this meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, we discussed two resolutions, one from the previous term about amending the short-term rental ordinance.

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:58,148
[SPEAKER_18]: to include a monthly report from the short-term rental platforms such as Vrbo or Airbnb so that we can better reconcile the post-reported and platform-reported number of short-term rentals in the community and make sure that we're in compliance with the short-term rental ordinance.

162
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:07,333
[SPEAKER_18]: We also discussed a resolution from this term to review the fee schedule for like across city departments and boards to make sure that

163
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:20,596
[SPEAKER_18]: we go through the process of asking city departments for feedback on which of those fees are updated or out of step with our neighboring communities so that we can make sure those fees are covering the relevant administrative costs and brought into the modern age.

164
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:21,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for approval.

165
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:25,741
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

166
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,681
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion?

167
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:28,983
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

168
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:30,364
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

169
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,165
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

170
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,167
[SPEAKER_46]: 23-319, Raisin Cane hearings.

171
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:34,268
[SPEAKER_46]: 23-319, Raisin Cane, 760 Fellsway.

172
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,116
[SPEAKER_46]: that we have a special permit for on additional on premises signage.

173
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:45,380
[SPEAKER_46]: We had a public hearing at our meeting on March 19th, which was continued to today, April 2nd.

174
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,023
[SPEAKER_46]: And that is on signage for raising canes.

175
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:56,108
[SPEAKER_46]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, chair of the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting and Signs, and then we will hear from the petitioner, Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:11:56,168 --> 00:12:03,854
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Council President, and I thank Raising Canes and their representatives

177
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:05,983
[SPEAKER_38]: I think that.

178
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:24,957
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going through the due diligence of making sure that our neighborhood is, um, is involved in all of the signage concerns, and I think that we had a subcommittee that that broke it down, and I think that we made some concessions and.

179
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,279
[SPEAKER_38]: I think that

180
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:43,918
[SPEAKER_38]: We're pretty happy with decisions we made and removing a few signs and then keeping signs that are vital to their operations.

181
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:53,667
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think the biggest ones were the signs that had the menus on it that were hidden by bushes.

182
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:59,832
[SPEAKER_38]: So that was a big piece that would question, but the landscaping that's set up

183
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,145
[SPEAKER_38]: it's really going to assist with that.

184
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:08,667
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think all the lighting that you'll see on the building is really reflecting on the building.

185
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:11,188
[SPEAKER_38]: It's really nothing that's illuminating the neighborhood.

186
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:15,630
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think we can listen to the petitioner and then we can move on.

187
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,331
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

188
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,651
[SPEAKER_46]: Kathy, name and address for the record, please.

189
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:20,312
[SPEAKER_58]: Good evening.

190
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:31,332
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor be at present Council bears and board members, Kathleen a Desmond of five of 580 Main Street units for reading is where my office is located.

191
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:36,777
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm here today with Sarah homes, senior property development manager for raising canes.

192
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:46,190
[SPEAKER_58]: Um, as Miss as council member Scarpelli indicated, we did make some concessions with respect to the signage that we were originally requesting.

193
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:55,016
[SPEAKER_58]: We withdrew the painted arrow sign, which is marked exhibit C of your materials that were provided with the petition.

194
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,078
[SPEAKER_58]: The one love canopy sign.

195
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:13,592
[SPEAKER_58]: marked as Exhibit E has been withdrawn and the monument sign marked as Exhibit B. What remains in terms of signage are the two additional wall signs that aid with vehicular queuing as

196
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:19,138
[SPEAKER_58]: The site is very large, it's over 670,000 square feet, the Felsway Plaza.

197
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:29,568
[SPEAKER_58]: The two additional signs will provide direction to customers which are within the parking area, coming from where the Dunkin Donuts is, and around that area where the Stop and Shop is.

198
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:32,310
[SPEAKER_58]: So that's why those two additional signs were requested.

199
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,472
[SPEAKER_58]: They are small in nature.

200
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,735
[SPEAKER_58]: The permitted size for a primary wall sign is 100 square feet.

201
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:45,145
[SPEAKER_58]: The four combined is only 120 square feet so the signage is not out of character with the neighborhood.

202
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:57,021
[SPEAKER_58]: In addition to the wall signs, there are two to mural signs, a one love heart design that's not lighted, it's, it's lighted by virtue of the lighting on the building itself.

203
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:01,942
[SPEAKER_58]: It helps provide some design to the building so you're not just looking at a brick square building.

204
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:06,763
[SPEAKER_58]: That is also the case with the proposed digital sign, which is the dog sign.

205
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:11,004
[SPEAKER_58]: Again, that's not a lighted sign, but it's naturally lighted by what's on the building.

206
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:22,087
[SPEAKER_58]: And then the menu and the pre-sale boards, which as Councilman Scarpelli indicated, is screened from the landscaping and is also integral to the business of a takeout restaurant.

207
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,707
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Cathy.

208
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,668
[SPEAKER_46]: Any questions or comments by members of the Council?

209
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:36,031
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none, I'm going to reopen the public hearing to anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise has a comment on this matter.

210
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,274
[SPEAKER_46]: The public hearing is reopened.

211
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,235
[SPEAKER_46]: Would you like to speak in favor?

212
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:42,696
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

213
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:51,502
[SPEAKER_58]: Again, in terms of what we're looking for, I can let the petitioner speak in favor of Sarah Holmes.

214
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:51,562
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

215
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,943
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Sarah Holmes.

216
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:57,366
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm with HT Group on behalf of Raising Canes as their senior

217
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:25,173
[SPEAKER_25]: property development manager, and just speaking in favor of raising canes, these signs are crucial to the operations, and I really believe that they lend to allowing safe vehicular access from the shopping center, as well as with the many boards providing a crucial function for having a drive-through business.

218
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:27,493
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

219
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:37,241
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comment by members of the public on the special permit for additional on-premises signage for raising canes, you can come to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom.

220
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:45,508
[SPEAKER_46]: Let me give it just another minute here.

221
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,931
[SPEAKER_46]: name and address for the record please.

222
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:03,456
[SPEAKER_56]: Good evening President bears and members of the council, Sharon DSL Mass Avenue circuit road.

223
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:10,041
[SPEAKER_56]: I think it's wonderful to have some larger size commerce, coming to the community.

224
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:16,546
[SPEAKER_56]: It's sad in a way that stop and shop is has, you know, started the anchor, but

225
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:27,117
[SPEAKER_56]: I like the whole idea what I don't like that entrance, I did not know about any public hearings in the beginning of this placement.

226
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,921
[SPEAKER_56]: And I've looked into the, the, the company very fine.

227
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:40,711
[SPEAKER_56]: I was wondering if it's there's any way on that side street that comes behind ocean job lot in the freight tools company.

228
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:49,859
[SPEAKER_56]: the Raising Cane Company would be willing to put a smaller sign on that street next to Dunkin' Donuts.

229
00:17:50,359 --> 00:18:05,492
[SPEAKER_56]: That entrance, as you know, goes to Eastern Bank, it goes to Panera's, it goes to Smashburger's, and it goes to that small, I'm sorry, Chinese spot on the corner.

230
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,453
[SPEAKER_56]: And now Raising Cane's.

231
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:11,675
[SPEAKER_56]: I have to wait five and 10 minutes to get in and out of there all the time.

232
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:19,879
[SPEAKER_56]: So I'm wondering if they might want to also promote more people going in if they get a little bit discouraged.

233
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:30,423
[SPEAKER_56]: If on that street right by Dunkin Donuts, I forget the name of that street, that there could also be additional small signage entrance to Raising Cane's here also.

234
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,745
[SPEAKER_56]: I don't know how that works with zoning or anything like that.

235
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:44,667
[SPEAKER_56]: is a suggestion because I think especially in the beginning with the fine product like that, especially with families and inflation on higher restaurants right now, it's going to be busy.

236
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:45,848
[SPEAKER_56]: I wish them success.

237
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:47,828
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm just wondering about that.

238
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,128
[SPEAKER_56]: I think it's a really good idea.

239
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:50,089
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

240
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:57,551
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, this is just about the signs and we did the special permit on other items already, but I do believe Raising Cane's is making improvements at the lot area.

241
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,631
[SPEAKER_46]: Kathy, if you want to speak on it.

242
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:03,252
[SPEAKER_58]: I can address that briefly as part of the

243
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:15,032
[SPEAKER_58]: that we put some kind of signage so that when you get to the end of Riverside have where the light is that they don't block the box, and that's going to be somehow tied.

244
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:26,461
[SPEAKER_58]: To a light right before the block the box so that cars and coming going down Riverside have to the fouls way will be aware that they can't block the box and that there's going to be a change in light.

245
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:30,405
[SPEAKER_58]: In addition to that, I believe we also discussed the.

246
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,730
[SPEAKER_58]: putting some kind of signage.

247
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:47,882
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't recall who is specifically responsible for it, but that other entrance was addressed as something that should be made known to Raisin Cane customers that they can also exit out of that way.

248
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:48,663
[SPEAKER_58]: So those were discussed.

249
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:50,544
[SPEAKER_46]: I believe there were new paint marks as well were?

250
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:51,285
[SPEAKER_58]: Right.

251
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:52,846
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

252
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:57,811
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comment on the special permit for signage for Raisin Canes?

253
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:05,382
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none in the chamber and none on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

254
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:06,945
[SPEAKER_46]: Are there any motions?

255
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,495
[SPEAKER_38]: I would, if I can.

256
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,532
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Scarpa.

257
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:15,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll defer to that.

258
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,033
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I'm just gonna move forward.

259
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second your motion.

260
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:35,018
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so I think that with the concessions for the neighbors and for the business that's moving in, I think that we've been pretty thorough with our meetings and informing the neighbors, so I would move forward with the changes as instructed and approve.

261
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:44,538
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli on the motion to approve the special permit for additional on premises signage for Raising Cane seconded by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

262
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,879
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

263
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:47,999
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

264
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,339
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

265
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:48,659
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

266
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,360
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative.

267
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,802
[SPEAKER_46]: The motion is approved.

268
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,223
[SPEAKER_46]: 24-056 offered by Councillor Lemming.

269
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:08,287
[SPEAKER_46]: Resolution to bring linkage pre-ordinance in compliance with the State Act establishing the ordinance.

270
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,710
[SPEAKER_46]: Is there a motion to waive the reading in favour of a summary by the chair?

271
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:17,630
[SPEAKER_46]: motion the motion by Council I mean to waive the reading in favor of summary by the chair seconded by Councillor Callahan all those in favor.

272
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,911
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed motion passes.

273
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:28,054
[SPEAKER_46]: So we did discuss this in our administration and Finance Committee meeting last week, and essentially what was referred out of committee.

274
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:30,697
[SPEAKER_46]: is a number of technical amendments.

275
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:45,012
[SPEAKER_46]: There are some errors in the linkage fee ordinance referring to different trust funds and sending money to all of the money right now, technically, by ordinance is going to the parks fund, even if it's money for the water sewer system or schools or whatever else it may be.

276
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:50,318
[SPEAKER_46]: And then also adding a bucket for affordable housing, which is authorized by the

277
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,982
[SPEAKER_46]: a special act of 1989, but was never passed into ordinance in 1990.

278
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,485
[SPEAKER_46]: So the process from here on out is there will be a referral to the Community Development Board.

279
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,567
[SPEAKER_46]: The Community Development Board will hold a public hearing.

280
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:04,629
[SPEAKER_46]: They will issue comments and recommendations to the council.

281
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:08,633
[SPEAKER_46]: The council will then hold a public hearing considering those recommendations.

282
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:14,337
[SPEAKER_46]: And then there would be a final vote on the amended linkage fee zoning ordinance at that point.

283
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:18,881
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion by members of the council or any motions on the floor?

284
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,200
[SPEAKER_46]: Council Vice President Collins.

285
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:25,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

286
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:29,762
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said last week in committee, I appreciate Councilor Lemming for bringing this forward.

287
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:40,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that even if all we were doing was updating the technical aspects of this ordinance that are out of step with how it's actually utilized, that would be a productive thing to do.

288
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:45,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's in keeping with where we're at as a community and this modern moment.

289
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:57,815
[SPEAKER_18]: to be adding, as we discussed at length last week, the point of the linkage fees is to associate certain costs from developers for the things that they affect in our community when they come in and build here.

290
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:00,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Things like parks, things like roads, sewer.

291
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:05,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's appropriate to be adding an affordable housing bucket at this time.

292
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,804
[SPEAKER_18]: And I look forward to reviewing the recommendations that the city board comes back to us with.

293
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,666
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd motion to refer to the community development board

294
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,382
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

295
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:19,883
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion?

296
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,165
[SPEAKER_46]: Any discussion by members of the public?

297
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:27,907
[SPEAKER_46]: If you're on Zoom, you can raise your hand.

298
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,014
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none, on the motion of Council Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

299
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:39,454
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Kellyanne.

300
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,015
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

301
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:42,856
[SPEAKER_40]: Vice President Collins.

302
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:43,457
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

303
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:45,613
[SPEAKER_40]: That's a little bizarre.

304
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:46,053
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

305
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:47,375
[SPEAKER_40]: Absolutely.

306
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:47,855
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

307
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:49,196
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll just go Kelly.

308
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,559
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, I'll just say yes.

309
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:52,780
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, 70 affirmative.

310
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,381
[SPEAKER_46]: None the negative.

311
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,963
[SPEAKER_46]: The motion passes and the item is referred to the Community Development Board.

312
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,065
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins can ask you to take the chair.

313
00:23:59,046 --> 00:23:59,307
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

314
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Council.

315
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:31,063
[SPEAKER_18]: 24059 offered by Councilor Callahan resolution to create a rental registry.

316
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:48,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the city of Medford has climate sustainability, affordable housing and other goals that would be easier to accomplish if we could reach either renters or landlords or both in our city, and whereas a lack of a registry of rental properties means that we currently miss opportunities to reach either our renters or our landlords or both.

317
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:49,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it so

318
00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,822
[SPEAKER_18]: with energy efficiency standards as described in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, Section 2.2.D.

319
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:06,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that this ordinance be referred to committee for further discussion in the Planning and Permitting Committee.

320
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:15,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that members of the Planning and Permitting Committee submit questions to the chair, clerk, and city staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for the subject.

321
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:28,564
[SPEAKER_18]: and be it further resolved that the council work with the building department and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on the drafting of this ordinance to ensure that it best serves the city of Medford and our climate and affordable housing goals.

322
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:29,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

323
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

324
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:43,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have.

325
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:55,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level.

326
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:03,125
[SPEAKER_15]: And tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are.

327
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,067
[SPEAKER_15]: There are also.

328
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:17,233
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit.

329
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:26,378
[SPEAKER_15]: That would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were.

330
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,361
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us.

331
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:34,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I know in the climate adaptation and action plan,

332
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,005
[SPEAKER_15]: it has.

333
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:51,176
[SPEAKER_15]: There are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections.

334
00:26:51,216 --> 00:27:02,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be

335
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:20,442
[SPEAKER_15]: know, junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently.

336
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:26,065
[SPEAKER_15]: being able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great.

337
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:43,037
[SPEAKER_15]: And really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord.

338
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what this is about.

339
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:45,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

340
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:47,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

341
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:50,491
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

342
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:53,694
[SPEAKER_29]: I would really like to thank Councilor Callahan for introducing this.

343
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:59,179
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is an idea that most residents assume we already do as a city, but we don't.

344
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:06,024
[SPEAKER_29]: And it is something that, you know, it's information that the city should really have in order to communicate its message better.

345
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:14,571
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that kind of touches at two of the arcs that we're trying to work on this term in the city of Medford with the city government communication modernization.

346
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:29,591
[SPEAKER_29]: we're ambitious as a city council and as a city when it comes to our climate goals, housing goals, but also the very basis of just having our existing laws be carried out and enforced.

347
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,333
[SPEAKER_29]: And this registry would allow us to do that.

348
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:39,677
[SPEAKER_29]: It would allow us to be more responsive to a lot of constituent concerns and a lot of resident concerns like what you mentioned about absentee landlords.

349
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:45,879
[SPEAKER_29]: and it would help us restructure some of the ideas that we have.

350
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:54,361
[SPEAKER_29]: For example, with the good landlord tax credit, which I know a lot of people are really excited about, this idea allows us to reach out to them.

351
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:55,441
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you.

352
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:08,939
[SPEAKER_14]: This sounds really interesting I'm curious about if this is common practice and other cities in the area I'm not I'm not familiar with this as a concept.

353
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:18,062
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be curious to hear if other cities practices commonly and another thought I have and I don't think this necessarily is a deal breaker but if it would be.

354
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:19,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what that would mean for.

355
00:29:20,006 --> 00:29:35,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Prohibitive administratively for City Hall staff and what that would mean for requirements for maybe additional hiring or restructuring, or if that's just something to discuss in committee because I know the resolution says, you know, talk about it and planning and permitting.

356
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:42,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously that would be the time to talk to City Hall staff, but that those are just things that come up and also things being

357
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan?

358
00:29:51,271 --> 00:30:02,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult.

359
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:12,603
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult.

360
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:15,145
[SPEAKER_15]: They just don't have access to who those people are.

361
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:24,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.

362
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,061
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna go to President Behrs, Councilor Lemming, and then Councilor Seng.

363
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,202
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam President.

364
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:39,865
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, having spoken with not just the planning department, but also code enforcement, building inspectors, et cetera,

365
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:47,171
[SPEAKER_46]: And also, this is a policy that's in effect in Boston, Worcester, other communities around the city, around the state.

366
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:56,941
[SPEAKER_46]: There's a huge issue with being able to identify what's an owner-occupied home, what is a rental unit, what's an illegal rental unit, and this would go a long way.

367
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:01,105
[SPEAKER_46]: I think I was listening to Councilor Sang talk a bit about this.

368
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:10,930
[SPEAKER_46]: Building code, health and safety, you know, there's a lot of difficulty with reaching out.

369
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:18,176
[SPEAKER_46]: We send it out in the tax bill, absentee landlord, absentee property owner, maybe they never open the envelope and maybe they never see it, right?

370
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:34,660
[SPEAKER_46]: So there's a number of things when it comes to quality of life here in a community where this would be a huge benefit for the city to be able to identify this and I think the good and important thing to recognize is that most of the people who are renting property owners or renting properties in the city are

371
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:44,883
[SPEAKER_46]: the right thing, following the rules, you know, and this is a way for the city to provide access to the different programs and benefits available and be in contact.

372
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:57,846
[SPEAKER_46]: And then for the folks who are problem properties, and we know of them, and we know many of them are in the hillside neighborhood and over-renting to tough students, and we have overgrowth, and we've had petitions coming in here before, this is a way for the city to actually keep track of that.

373
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:02,788
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's been a huge note from code enforcement and building, is that

374
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,515
[SPEAKER_46]: It's just hard to say, here's the file on this property.

375
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,696
[SPEAKER_46]: And this property may be violating snow and ice removal.

376
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:10,217
[SPEAKER_46]: They may have overgrowth under the street.

377
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:11,738
[SPEAKER_46]: They may have trash on the property.

378
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:13,680
[SPEAKER_46]: They may have noise nuisance complaints.

379
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,381
[SPEAKER_46]: They may have a whole plethora list of things.

380
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:19,644
[SPEAKER_46]: But because there's no registry, there's nothing to attach any of that to.

381
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,165
[SPEAKER_46]: And they get away with it.

382
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:31,752
[SPEAKER_46]: So this really is a way for us to have that list, know what's going on in the city, and make sure that while most folks are doing the right thing,

383
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,456
[SPEAKER_46]: address the issues with those who are not.

384
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:39,806
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that's something that all of us can acknowledge is an issue that we all experience here in Medford.

385
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:40,488
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

386
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

387
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:43,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lemming.

388
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,342
[SPEAKER_31]: just a question for Councilor Callahan.

389
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:51,685
[SPEAKER_31]: So it says here the building department, the office and the PBS.

390
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:58,530
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you have a good idea of where this project once it is implemented would primarily be maintained?

391
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Would it be the building department or PBS?

392
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,912
[SPEAKER_31]: And what's do you have?

393
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:07,216
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you just, like, give us an idea of the amount of staff time that it would take to get this off the ground and maintain a longer term?

394
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:07,937
[SPEAKER_31]: If

395
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan, if you have a direct response.

396
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:15,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

397
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:21,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation.

398
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:31,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented.

399
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:35,289
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation.

400
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:37,130
[SPEAKER_15]: But as far as

401
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,150
[SPEAKER_15]: who will implement it.

402
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:53,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.

403
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:54,829
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

404
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:57,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Sang and then Councilor Scarpelli.

405
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:57,935
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

406
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:09,860
[SPEAKER_29]: I can also speak to some of Councilor Lozano and Councilor Lemming's questions, because I happened to hold a meeting on this a few weeks ago with some city staff.

407
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:14,322
[SPEAKER_29]: It seems like most of the work would fall within the purview of the building department.

408
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:23,467
[SPEAKER_29]: Actually, the new building commissioner that we have here in Medford set up the rental registry system for their last municipality, and so they're very well-versed.

409
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:25,849
[SPEAKER_29]: how to create the system.

410
00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:30,315
[SPEAKER_29]: They've created an online system that really maintains itself.

411
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:35,461
[SPEAKER_29]: And so it wouldn't, you know, the setup would take time for the staff to manage.

412
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:40,107
[SPEAKER_29]: But once the system is in place, they expect the system to be quite self-containing.

413
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:43,283
[SPEAKER_18]: you.

414
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:43,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

415
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:43,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

416
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:43,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

417
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:44,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

418
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:44,703
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

419
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:44,963
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

420
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:45,163
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

421
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,064
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

422
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,264
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

423
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:46,324
[SPEAKER_38]: Um.

424
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:52,145
[SPEAKER_38]: If I can't do the chair to Council Kalyan or any other councils that can what documents were we asking for?

425
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:53,025
[SPEAKER_38]: What?

426
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:53,326
[SPEAKER_38]: What?

427
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:54,906
[SPEAKER_38]: This is an intrusive.

428
00:34:55,946 --> 00:35:00,267
[SPEAKER_38]: Um process and what we're asking for for renters information.

429
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:01,408
[SPEAKER_38]: Landlords information.

430
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:02,968
[SPEAKER_38]: Can anybody share what we

431
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this is the beginning of the conversation.

432
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:21,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me, we're not going to interrupt people.

433
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:23,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.

434
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:31,196
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the beginning of a many months long process.

435
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:45,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have.

436
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:46,281
[SPEAKER_15]: And

437
00:35:49,238 --> 00:36:01,140
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.

438
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:11,082
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be a chance for everybody to participate on this item.

439
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:12,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Please do not interrupt speakers.

440
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:13,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan, are you finished?

441
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

442
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:16,835
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

443
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:19,640
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that's what the big concern is.

444
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,747
[SPEAKER_38]: I think that we're doing something that sounds like it doesn't need to be done.

445
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,109
[SPEAKER_38]: We've been we've been

446
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:35,779
[SPEAKER_38]: Based on interrupt speakers, I'm gonna ask the room to be silent, thank you.

447
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:46,221
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm hearing dialogue back and forth from fellow councils that we're here to do people's business and we should do some things later on that we'll talk about that we need to do business.

448
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:54,403
[SPEAKER_38]: We keep doing business and keep throwing more work onto people that we already know don't have the capability to do what you're asking for.

449
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:56,383
[SPEAKER_38]: You're asking for something that's already done

450
00:36:56,983 --> 00:37:01,185
[SPEAKER_38]: through the city in every way possible.

451
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:06,448
[SPEAKER_38]: If the biggest thing is just to get the information out to people, there's other ways to do this.

452
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:14,573
[SPEAKER_38]: But to be intrusive and then really take all these unnecessary documents, it makes people very uneasy.

453
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:20,777
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'll be honest with you, for a council that's very, very astute in understanding about people that

454
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,881
[SPEAKER_38]: I probably most difficult people that are going through a very difficult time.

455
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,763
[SPEAKER_38]: I was getting phone calls from landlords saying, George, what do we do hypothetically?

456
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:31,383
[SPEAKER_38]: Hypothetically?

457
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:33,544
[SPEAKER_38]: What do you do?

458
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:46,108
[SPEAKER_38]: Because the conversation scares our residents, that our landlords allow to give them a place to live, but are afraid to give documentation, because maybe they're undocumented.

459
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:47,869
[SPEAKER_38]: And they're petrified.

460
00:37:48,854 --> 00:38:00,262
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a fear that you should wait when we get to this point, but also understand we're trying to do something over and over again with different issues on this council lately that's redundant.

461
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:11,971
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's putting more work to departments that need to do their work, not to do this additional stuff that we want to get people to know that there is some sort of rebate.

462
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:14,467
[SPEAKER_38]: There are so many other ways we can do that.

463
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:19,859
[SPEAKER_38]: There are so many other ways we can do that.

464
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:23,126
[SPEAKER_38]: But to keep bringing resolutions through.

465
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:32,669
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it's hurting this community and it's driving more wedges through this community.

466
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:43,333
[SPEAKER_38]: So I would request that we deny this process and not put more work on more departments that don't need it right now.

467
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:47,735
[SPEAKER_46]: I would just note that the departments themselves have requested it and it's part of the city's comprehensive plan.

468
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:51,419
[SPEAKER_46]: It is true.

469
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:51,879
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

470
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,601
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not going to engage.

471
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:59,282
[SPEAKER_46]: Seriously, my role is to just state facts.

472
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:01,182
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, please stop.

473
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:02,563
[SPEAKER_46]: Please stop.

474
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:02,943
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

475
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:03,823
[SPEAKER_46]: You have to be silent.

476
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:07,284
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

477
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:09,805
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comments by members of the council?

478
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:15,747
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none, name and address for the record, please, for public participation.

479
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:17,328
[SPEAKER_33]: Robert Jones, 5 St.

480
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:17,888
[SPEAKER_33]: Mary Street.

481
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:22,588
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, I really don't know where this is coming from.

482
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:26,591
[SPEAKER_33]: The people that own the houses pay their tax bills.

483
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:30,775
[SPEAKER_33]: We know how to contact them when we're looking for their money, correct?

484
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:32,696
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

485
00:39:33,277 --> 00:39:35,078
[SPEAKER_46]: If they don't pay, then they are contacted.

486
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,740
[SPEAKER_33]: If they don't pay, then they are contacted.

487
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,244
[SPEAKER_33]: So you have a mechanism to contact every homeowner in the city of Method.

488
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:43,965
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a current system.

489
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:48,009
[SPEAKER_33]: Who is going to be processing and administering all this registry?

490
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:57,964
[SPEAKER_33]: rental registry, we're going to have a rental registry department here, because we barely have enough staff to provide the basic city services that we have right now.

491
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:02,886
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, as was as was noted, and please do not if you're going to shout, I'm going to ask you to leave.

492
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:04,786
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you people.

493
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:11,489
[SPEAKER_46]: I just want to if you I can answer your question, which is that the people who are responsible for enforcing the building code have said that this would make their jobs easier.

494
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:12,733
[SPEAKER_33]: Can you name them?

495
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,495
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, the people who work in the building department, the building commissioners.

496
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:15,815
[SPEAKER_46]: Are they here?

497
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:16,616
[SPEAKER_46]: It was just mentioned.

498
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:19,397
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, we're not, we haven't had them, we're just referring to the committee.

499
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:31,705
[SPEAKER_46]: So we're going to have the discussion as members of the public have noted, we're going to have a long discussion just on this topic so that everyone can have their points concerned, so that points like Councillor Scarpelli's can be raised and so that we can craft an ordinance that works for the community.

500
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:31,905
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

501
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:36,948
[SPEAKER_33]: It would be nice if the people that you talked to would be here to verify that you had talked to them.

502
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:40,174
[SPEAKER_46]: We're going, okay, I don't think we need to be verifying anything.

503
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,474
[SPEAKER_46]: We're gonna have a discussion.

504
00:40:41,494 --> 00:40:41,574
[SPEAKER_33]: I do.

505
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,194
[SPEAKER_33]: Read the room, counselor.

506
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,335
[SPEAKER_46]: I have, and I'm disappointed.

507
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:45,835
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

508
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:49,395
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that you guys are way overstepping your boundaries here.

509
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:51,396
[SPEAKER_33]: I think you're beyond the city charter.

510
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,796
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm gonna let you go.

511
00:40:54,856 --> 00:40:56,657
[SPEAKER_33]: You got three minutes, 30 seconds.

512
00:40:58,857 --> 00:40:59,777
[SPEAKER_33]: That's my opinion.

513
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:00,597
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not a lawyer.

514
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:03,918
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd love to ask a city solicitor, but obviously we don't have one.

515
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:16,376
[SPEAKER_33]: Another point that I'd like to make with all the, what I consider drastic and radical changes that you're trying to push through in the city, I think they should be put on a ballot.

516
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:18,178
[SPEAKER_33]: And if they're truly...

517
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,038
[SPEAKER_46]: Just a reminder that the disruption does take away from the speaker's time.

518
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:24,958
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, that's fine.

519
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:29,360
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, the police are here so they can drag me from the podium if you so desire.

520
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,120
[SPEAKER_33]: If needed.

521
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,481
[SPEAKER_33]: If needed, okay.

522
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:33,721
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll stay here all night.

523
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:40,224
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing was, through the chair to the city clerk, what is our next municipal election?

524
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:40,224
2025.

525
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:42,304
[SPEAKER_33]: How about September 3rd?

526
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:44,085
[SPEAKER_33]: There's no election on September 3rd?

527
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:46,874
[SPEAKER_46]: That's not a municipal election, that's a state primary.

528
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:47,934
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, sorry, I misspoke.

529
00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:51,237
[SPEAKER_33]: The next election in the city of Methodwood will be September 3rd.

530
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:57,502
[SPEAKER_33]: So why don't we craft all the ordinances and the registries, whatever that may be, and put it on the ballot.

531
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,344
[SPEAKER_33]: And if it's truly the will of the people, we'll see that.

532
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:08,690
[SPEAKER_33]: And people will be able to vote at the ballot box, not down here with a two minute limitation.

533
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:13,464
[SPEAKER_33]: Every week, it's something new.

534
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,485
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's overstepping the chart.

535
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:19,506
[SPEAKER_33]: You're doing charter review here on Tuesday nights.

536
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:23,047
[SPEAKER_33]: And if we had a city solicitor, maybe they could weigh in on this.

537
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,509
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess that's all I have.

538
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,949
[SPEAKER_33]: What is the impetus of this registry?

539
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:31,430
[SPEAKER_33]: Because it doesn't sound like

540
00:42:32,418 --> 00:42:34,678
[SPEAKER_33]: The problem landlords are not going to register.

541
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,399
[SPEAKER_33]: You understand that, right?

542
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:40,240
[SPEAKER_33]: The people that you're talking about enforcing are not going to register.

543
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,600
[SPEAKER_33]: And we know who they are.

544
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,120
[SPEAKER_33]: You know how to get in touch with them.

545
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,701
[SPEAKER_33]: So I question why this registry is even being put forth.

546
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:50,402
[SPEAKER_33]: Is it to mimic the one that they have in Lynn?

547
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,762
[SPEAKER_33]: Lynn has a rental registry.

548
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,043
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that where you got the information from, Mr. Chair?

549
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:06,193
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not going to engage in the back and forth, but as I noted, this is in the city's comprehensive plan and was requested by several departments in the city as a way to... Okay, well, I'd like to know who they are.

550
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:09,074
[SPEAKER_46]: I just told you it's the building department and the planning department.

551
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:11,115
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't believe you, to be honest with you.

552
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,376
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, well, I'm sorry that you don't believe it.

553
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:15,777
[SPEAKER_46]: You can continue your comment, but I'm not going to engage in the back and forth.

554
00:43:15,817 --> 00:43:20,179
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, well, I thought we were here to ask questions and you would answer them.

555
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,680
[SPEAKER_46]: No, you're here to make comments and we will hear them.

556
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,461
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm asking questions.

557
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:29,338
[SPEAKER_33]: You have 55 seconds.

558
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,040
[SPEAKER_33]: OK, we have somebody else ask the question.

559
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,826
[SPEAKER_33]: So my question is, what is the impetus, the end game for this rental registry?

560
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:37,347
[SPEAKER_33]: Number one.

561
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:41,751
[SPEAKER_33]: Number two, who in the building department asked for this registry?

562
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:43,960
[SPEAKER_33]: And I have plenty of them.

563
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:56,768
[SPEAKER_33]: And if this registry and some of the other things that we have rise above the charter of the city, and if they're legal, I'd like to have that legal opinion by a city solicitor or KP Law, whoever it may be.

564
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:57,789
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

565
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:58,529
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

566
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,955
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Zoom with Kayla Zaro.

567
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:08,656
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

568
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:09,496
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

569
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:10,457
[SPEAKER_48]: Donna Silva?

570
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:10,717
[SPEAKER_46]: No, sorry.

571
00:44:10,757 --> 00:44:11,417
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to Zoom.

572
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:11,778
[SPEAKER_46]: Sorry.

573
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,671
[SPEAKER_48]: Oh, sorry.

574
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:15,354
[SPEAKER_48]: Hi, it's Kathleen Lazaro.

575
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:21,604
[SPEAKER_48]: I have a couple thoughts or questions about this rental registry.

576
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:24,789
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't own a two family home, so I don't really have

577
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:30,474
[SPEAKER_48]: I can't comment, but I do have some thoughts.

578
00:44:31,194 --> 00:44:46,267
[SPEAKER_48]: One is that all this information, like Mr. Jones said earlier, all this information should be somewhere in some sort of city database that we have with our names and addresses, that we pay taxes.

579
00:44:48,632 --> 00:45:06,028
[SPEAKER_48]: You know, so either someone's not doing their job correctly, or someone is not using the technology that we have to do their job, or we're missing some piece of technology to gather that information to be able to utilize it.

580
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:14,336
[SPEAKER_48]: Because if we have some sort of computer system, we have some sort of database that has all this information in it.

581
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:33,942
[SPEAKER_48]: And then my other thought was about how do you get around people who rent illegally or like, I mean, I can only assume, because I have seen college students before, you know, you have an apartment in Hillside that's supposed to rent to four people, but there's eight people living there.

582
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:35,103
[SPEAKER_48]: How do you get around that?

583
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:38,926
[SPEAKER_48]: Like, how do you, I just, I think that there's,

584
00:45:40,185 --> 00:45:47,947
[SPEAKER_48]: I think it's a nice idea, but I think we have that information and we should utilize what we have before we start creating something new.

585
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:51,368
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

586
00:45:54,828 --> 00:45:56,049
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

587
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Donna Silva, 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway.

588
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:04,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Our country is built on a democracy.

589
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:06,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I right?

590
00:46:06,074 --> 00:46:07,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we all in agreement?

591
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:10,836
[SPEAKER_13]: This is anti-Democrat, okay?

592
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:16,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do own a multifamily, okay?

593
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,580
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have pride of ownership.

594
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,261
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am a good person and a good landlord.

595
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:26,263
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have a code enforcement officer in Medford.

596
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:27,983
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our problem.

597
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:31,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're targeting multi-families.

598
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:41,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not hear one person here say about the single-family homes that have code violations, debris strewn across their properties.

599
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:48,357
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're going to start targeting and you want to go against these people,

600
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,112
[SPEAKER_13]: hit the whole city, get a code enforcement officer.

601
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Other states and cities have them.

602
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:56,856
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's your problem, go for it.

603
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Landlords aren't bad.

604
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:04,602
[SPEAKER_13]: But every time you talk, all I hear is that people like me are bad people.

605
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,723
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an elderly person.

606
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:08,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I own a two-family home.

607
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've lived in Medford just about my entire life.

608
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:14,429
[SPEAKER_13]: My parents didn't buy their first home until I was 19.

609
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:16,690
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was my grandfather's.

610
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:18,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Where were you people coming from?

611
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:27,779
[SPEAKER_13]: share on each and every one of you.

612
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:31,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I sit here and I feel like I've done something wrong.

613
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:33,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

614
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:38,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Two of my former tenants, separate, both own homes because of me.

615
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:40,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

616
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:45,029
[SPEAKER_13]: My family, my parents were able to live in my first floor.

617
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,530
[SPEAKER_13]: My mother had Alzheimer's.

618
00:47:47,671 --> 00:47:48,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Shame on all of you.

619
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a good person.

620
00:47:50,552 --> 00:47:54,234
[SPEAKER_13]: And most of these homeowners are, too.

621
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:55,354
[SPEAKER_13]: And you wouldn't have rich properties.

622
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,575
[SPEAKER_46]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

623
00:47:56,655 --> 00:47:56,975
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

624
00:47:57,095 --> 00:47:57,595
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

625
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:58,936
[SPEAKER_46]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

626
00:47:59,716 --> 00:48:00,016
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

627
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:08,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the most part, I do understand there are some slum landlords, OK?

628
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,540
[SPEAKER_13]: There are.

629
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:14,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are some homeowners, and there are some really bad tenants, too.

630
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:17,322
[SPEAKER_13]: some really bad tenants.

631
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,445
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know people that have had difficulty with them.

632
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a friend that had she couldn't get them out.

633
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,190
[SPEAKER_13]: She had to take them to court, she lost a lot of money.

634
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,711
[SPEAKER_13]: So where does that happen?

635
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,533
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you talk about rent control.

636
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know how much it costs to run a home?

637
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:38,103
[SPEAKER_13]: If a roof goes, it's $18,000.

638
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:40,624
[SPEAKER_13]: A heating system, a heating system.

639
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:42,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I put two new heating systems in my house.

640
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:45,986
[SPEAKER_13]: $50,000 each, that's a hundred grand.

641
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:55,170
[SPEAKER_13]: And that woman who sat here the two weeks ago, three weeks ago, who stated that her house is now worth $800,000 and she only bought it for 60,000.

642
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good for you because I have pride of ownership.

643
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:08,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have brand new kitchens, brand new bathrooms, brand new heating systems, new electrical, new plumbing, because I'm a good person, okay?

644
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:10,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And I pay my taxes.

645
00:49:10,939 --> 00:49:25,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And the person who made this comment that their rent goes to taxes, add up everything and the percentage of your rent, the pennies that go to the taxes, because there's repairs when your stove goes,

646
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:27,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Who pays for that?

647
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:30,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I just put a new stove in my house, cost me $3,000.

648
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,718
[SPEAKER_13]: My friend said to me, well, it's not the stove, it's the installation.

649
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:41,199
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have to look at all of this when it comes to paying for things.

650
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to actually do a spreadsheet for all of you and hand it out and say, look at what it costs to run a home.

651
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,261
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of money.

652
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:52,243
[SPEAKER_13]: And even affordable housing for these poor people.

653
00:49:52,483 --> 00:49:53,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Poor people can't afford homes.

654
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:57,524
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter how little you give it to them for, they can't afford it.

655
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,805
[SPEAKER_13]: So the really poor will never afford a home.

656
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:00,585
[SPEAKER_46]: You have one minute.

657
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:07,011
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the people that maybe the young millennial generation that wants to buy homes and they want to live in Medford.

658
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,352
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't afford those.

659
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:09,673
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can understand it.

660
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:11,355
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel for you.

661
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,217
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, I feel for all of them.

662
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,682
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to take it and look into the consideration, maybe move a little further out.

663
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:20,383
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I have to say.

664
00:50:20,423 --> 00:50:20,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

665
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:28,174
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, we're gonna go to Melanie Tringale on Zoom.

666
00:50:28,214 --> 00:50:29,776
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

667
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:30,677
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

668
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:35,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Melanie Tringale, 116 Forest Street in Medford.

669
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:41,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to comment similar to what the previous woman has also said.

670
00:50:41,286 --> 00:50:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a landlord.

671
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:44,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I own two multi-families.

672
00:50:44,729 --> 00:50:46,070
[SPEAKER_04]: My first home was a multi-family.

673
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a landlord in Medford for over 25 years.

674
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I take pride in ownership of my properties.

675
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I upkeep them.

676
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I have good tenants.

677
00:50:54,658 --> 00:50:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good landlord.

678
00:50:55,659 --> 00:50:58,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of my tenants have lived in my properties for five, six, seven years.

679
00:51:00,503 --> 00:51:10,951
[SPEAKER_04]: This registry is a slippery slope and it's a policing policy of landlords and the people that end up getting punished for this are the good landlords, not the bad landlords.

680
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You said in your comments, President, that you know who the bad landlords are.

681
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a code enforcement issue.

682
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:24,311
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know who they are, then you can enforce the laws.

683
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:27,795
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is you talk about that.

684
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:28,777
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

685
00:51:29,157 --> 00:51:29,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

686
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:30,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you already know.

687
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:37,168
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't quite say that.

688
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:50,185
[SPEAKER_46]: I said we know that there's a small percentage of people who are problem landlords, but code enforcement has said because there's no registry, it can be difficult to track them down and we are well aware that there are a lot of corporate owners using shell corporations and they're almost impossible for the city to get in touch with.

689
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:50,725
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

690
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:54,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right, so I didn't hear anything about single families.

691
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of single family homes that don't enforce their codes.

692
00:51:57,994 --> 00:51:59,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I walk the streets of Medford all the time.

693
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:02,797
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no code enforcement for businesses.

694
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:07,699
[SPEAKER_04]: There's trash thrown in front of their businesses, overgrowth, things are not taken care of.

695
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing about that?

696
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they registered?

697
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you reach out to them?

698
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:12,842
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you gonna reach out?

699
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:15,683
[SPEAKER_04]: You talk about tax programs that you wanna reach out to us for tax programs.

700
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:17,084
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ways to reach out to us.

701
00:52:18,084 --> 00:52:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: do you what about the tax incentives for single family homebuyers how are you going to reach out to them are you going to have them register there's ways to reach out to these people without having to and again the people that end up getting burned with these types of things are the small property owners who actually the majority of them are pretty good landlords and they're the ones who end up bearing the brunt of these these laws that's all i have to say thank you

702
00:52:44,517 --> 00:52:47,278
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, and I will note we do have a business license program.

703
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:55,359
[SPEAKER_46]: All businesses are licensed, and this council on multiple budgets has requested additional funding for code enforcement, including in the most recent budget.

704
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,600
[SPEAKER_46]: We currently only have two code enforcement officers.

705
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then maybe we should start there first.

706
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:01,601
[SPEAKER_46]: We're doing that.

707
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:04,982
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

708
00:53:05,022 --> 00:53:05,622
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

709
00:53:06,122 --> 00:53:11,503
[SPEAKER_55]: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused.

710
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:17,977
[SPEAKER_55]: It's been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December.

711
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,880
[SPEAKER_55]: And I feel like there's something wrong with this council.

712
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:31,413
[SPEAKER_55]: You're going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay?

713
00:53:36,053 --> 00:53:42,168
[SPEAKER_55]: Also, my concern with this is, is the City of Memphis City Council going to go into a public service agency?

714
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:54,080
[SPEAKER_55]: by going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee.

715
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:59,164
[SPEAKER_55]: And it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong.

716
00:53:59,805 --> 00:54:07,971
[SPEAKER_55]: And in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize.

717
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:14,217
[SPEAKER_55]: you indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals.

718
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:30,109
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved.

719
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:37,756
[SPEAKER_55]: Because if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out.

720
00:54:38,436 --> 00:54:39,377
[SPEAKER_55]: not renting in.

721
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:47,542
[SPEAKER_55]: So what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to?

722
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:55,407
[SPEAKER_55]: These are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory.

723
00:54:55,467 --> 00:55:03,632
[SPEAKER_55]: In fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.

724
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:06,594
[SPEAKER_46]: There's nothing in the ordinance that would suggest that whatsoever.

725
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:16,777
[SPEAKER_55]: city of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources.

726
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:23,662
[SPEAKER_55]: And if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you.

727
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:29,887
[SPEAKER_55]: Now, if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to

728
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:37,476
[SPEAKER_55]: MCAD in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here.

729
00:55:37,496 --> 00:55:40,179
[SPEAKER_55]: And you can also go to the public health department.

730
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,347
[SPEAKER_55]: Right now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon.

731
00:55:47,088 --> 00:56:02,872
[SPEAKER_55]: But every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background.

732
00:56:02,932 --> 00:56:05,692
[SPEAKER_55]: Because that unfortunately, is where this is going to go.

733
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:10,233
[SPEAKER_55]: Because once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from?

734
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:11,894
[SPEAKER_55]: Let me see your references.

735
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:13,554
[SPEAKER_55]: And where were you renting last?

736
00:56:13,694 --> 00:56:16,255
[SPEAKER_55]: That's not what this council's job is all about.

737
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:17,539
[SPEAKER_55]: What an answer!

738
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:25,879
[SPEAKER_46]: I would just note again that this doesn't say anything like that.

739
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:26,439
[SPEAKER_55]: Pardon me?

740
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,600
[SPEAKER_46]: This doesn't say anything.

741
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,802
[SPEAKER_55]: You don't know you haven't gotten there yet.

742
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:37,468
[SPEAKER_55]: You just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.

743
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,310
[SPEAKER_46]: I have said point counselor Scarpelli.

744
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,971
[SPEAKER_46]: I have the authority to respond with facts.

745
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,473
[SPEAKER_46]: These are not factual facts.

746
00:56:43,774 --> 00:56:48,377
[SPEAKER_46]: You would please tell me where this says that we're going to discriminate ethnically against.

747
00:56:48,457 --> 00:56:50,579
[SPEAKER_55]: I didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.

748
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:50,799
[SPEAKER_46]: What's

749
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,183
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. President, what's the registry going to include?

750
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:56,724
[SPEAKER_55]: Ask the maker of the motion.

751
00:56:56,924 --> 00:57:02,108
[SPEAKER_55]: You cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for.

752
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:03,389
[SPEAKER_55]: Then you don't belong here.

753
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:04,490
[SPEAKER_55]: Go someplace else.

754
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:05,170
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

755
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:18,524
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, 54 seconds.

756
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:19,004
[SPEAKER_40]: 50 seconds.

757
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,205
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm just frustrated.

758
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:22,586
[SPEAKER_55]: And probably taking it out on all of you.

759
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,729
[SPEAKER_55]: But I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose.

760
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:26,769
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm going to repeat myself.

761
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:28,490
[SPEAKER_55]: I have a bad habit of repeating myself.

762
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:32,293
[SPEAKER_55]: Please just do what you were elected to do.

763
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:36,976
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you.

764
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:40,639
[SPEAKER_55]: Did you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there?

765
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:40,959
[SPEAKER_55]: No.

766
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:41,239
[SPEAKER_55]: No.

767
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:51,103
[SPEAKER_46]: So let me just... All right, if we're gonna shout again, I'm gonna ask you to leave.

768
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:53,784
[SPEAKER_55]: Let me just conclude by saying the following.

769
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,064
[SPEAKER_46]: You have 30 seconds, you have 15 seconds actually.

770
00:57:56,204 --> 00:57:58,305
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, you know something, just relax.

771
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:00,865
[SPEAKER_55]: You had a little do to do with their Councilor Scott Pelley.

772
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:01,966
[SPEAKER_55]: You took my time up.

773
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:06,267
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion.

774
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,264
[SPEAKER_55]: and think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers.

775
00:58:15,565 --> 00:58:18,767
[SPEAKER_55]: So you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it.

776
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:21,409
[SPEAKER_55]: Maybe there is something that can work its way out.

777
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,751
[SPEAKER_55]: Maybe if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense.

778
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:31,295
[SPEAKER_55]: And the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered.

779
00:58:31,495 --> 00:58:35,038
[SPEAKER_55]: And at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check

780
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:43,121
[SPEAKER_55]: that revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up.

781
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:44,102
[SPEAKER_55]: No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

782
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:44,762
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Penta.

783
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:46,063
[SPEAKER_55]: Wait a minute, I'm not through yet.

784
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:47,603
[SPEAKER_46]: I am not through yet.

785
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:48,464
[SPEAKER_46]: Your time is up.

786
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,964
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Penta, please step away from the podium.

787
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:51,125
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not going to call the police on you.

788
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:53,186
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, you should be respectful.

789
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:55,146
[SPEAKER_39]: We'll wait.

790
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,467
[SPEAKER_39]: We'll wait.

791
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,026
[SPEAKER_55]: You took time away from me to talk to Councilor Scott.

792
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:05,846
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll wait, thank you.

793
00:59:05,986 --> 00:59:07,467
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you very much for waiting.

794
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:09,748
[SPEAKER_46]: No, we're not gonna hear from you, but I'll wait for you to step away, thank you.

795
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:14,390
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, we're gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom.

796
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,171
[SPEAKER_46]: Jess, you have five minutes.

797
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,993
[SPEAKER_46]: Jess, you have five minutes.

798
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:23,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, Amy.

799
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:26,476
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Jess.

800
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:27,816
[SPEAKER_46]: You can go, you have five minutes.

801
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:29,197
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

802
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Really full awkward.

803
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:33,481
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

804
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:38,086
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't be down there tonight, but I just want to say take a look around the room.

805
00:59:38,126 --> 00:59:48,295
[SPEAKER_24]: You're in everyone on zoom We all know that there is like counselor callahan said a goal that you have and

806
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:58,316
[SPEAKER_24]: you're trying to figure out how to get these small little pieces through, hoping that we don't see that there's a final agenda that you guys are trying to push through.

807
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:02,619
[SPEAKER_24]: But just know, take a look at everyone in the audience on zoom.

808
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:07,302
[SPEAKER_24]: We all know that you're looking to do something down the line.

809
01:00:07,422 --> 01:00:08,883
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's why we're here tonight.

810
01:00:09,663 --> 01:00:11,545
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're going to watch each step you take.

811
01:00:12,405 --> 01:00:13,666
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're not going to let it happen.

812
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:17,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

813
01:00:18,374 --> 01:00:19,074
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Jess.

814
01:00:23,676 --> 01:00:24,757
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

815
01:00:24,777 --> 01:00:25,457
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

816
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Louise D'Antonio.

817
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:30,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you folks can hear me.

818
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:31,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you.

819
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm concerned about them also.

820
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:39,244
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous two speakers said a lot of what I wanted to say.

821
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my head is like a popcorn maker.

822
01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:43,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many

823
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:51,507
[SPEAKER_03]: bits and pieces that I would like to toss at you that I purposely have to limit myself.

824
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:59,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This information about fees and the registry, it sounds like a little bit too much government interference to me.

825
01:01:04,488 --> 01:01:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: You are calling into question every decent renter, every decent homeowner who's provided living accommodations.

826
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:16,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where you folks are going.

827
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:19,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where you folks have been.

828
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But you better start focusing on the city of Medford

829
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:25,807
[SPEAKER_03]: and representing Medford people.

830
01:01:26,588 --> 01:01:35,285
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my questions was, how come you got your salary increased, but your appearances in front of the community have been cut enough.

831
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,041
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't understand that.

832
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,742
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a rhetorical question.

833
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:42,422
[SPEAKER_46]: The city council salary has not increased since 2012.

834
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:43,863
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a rhetorical question.

835
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:44,743
[SPEAKER_46]: But it's incorrect.

836
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:46,884
[SPEAKER_46]: The city council salary has not increased since 2016.

837
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:50,105
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not supposed to be a full-time job for you folks.

838
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:53,306
[SPEAKER_46]: Our salary has not increased, and we are meeting more than ever.

839
01:01:53,386 --> 01:02:03,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying, I mean, I've had some of you come to my doorstep, say one thing, and then a month or two later after the elections, it's like, wait a minute,

840
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:06,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this the same person I was talking to?

841
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:08,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen the little smirks.

842
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:13,637
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, older woman, probably lived in Medford all of her life.

843
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're doing is you're like punishing a whole class of people for one specific poor behavior.

844
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:31,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The state of Massachusetts has a very comprehensive relief program for homeowners and renters.

845
01:02:31,888 --> 01:02:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no discrimination there.

846
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want any one of you people to have my private information?

847
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:44,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the people that rent houses are students.

848
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:48,977
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't afford it on their own, so they get a guarantor, a parent.

849
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:53,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think those parents want their information in the Medford city?

850
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to supervise the list?

851
01:02:58,101 --> 01:02:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to do what?

852
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:06,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust the city of Medford right now, because you're not doing anything for us or any of us.

853
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,000
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

854
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,121
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

855
01:03:12,161 --> 01:03:12,941
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

856
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:16,262
[SPEAKER_46]: There's no one on Zoom right now, but.

857
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:22,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Longway Su, 250 Spring Street.

858
01:03:24,363 --> 01:03:24,823
[SPEAKER_47]: You may speak.

859
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:25,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

860
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:31,745
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I want to thank you for the city council for opportunity to express my thought.

861
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:40,823
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I want to thank the Council for giving us the chance to express our thoughts and comments.

862
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,747
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I basically have three things I want to bring up.

863
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:51,113
[SPEAKER_08]: First is privacy, second is fairness, and third is efficiency.

864
01:03:52,453 --> 01:04:04,336
[SPEAKER_08]: and actually said I have to come today to express those points because I think a lot of good folks already expressed those comments, but probably I need to rehash them again.

865
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:06,296
[SPEAKER_08]: First is the privacy.

866
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:19,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is unfair to put in this kind of burden for the landlord to collect, validate, and reporting those private informations to the city of Medford.

867
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:30,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You may think that would be helpful, you may think it would be helpful, like a government body, but for us regular folks, it's just not a big brother.

868
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to pay our tax and move on.

869
01:04:33,413 --> 01:04:36,095
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a job to do.

870
01:04:36,115 --> 01:04:42,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And collecting those private information really violates the right of the landlord and also the tenant.

871
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:45,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how can write it?

872
01:04:45,432 --> 01:04:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a whole of a body of work involving for the registration, both on the city and on the citizen.

873
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:55,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is privacy.

874
01:04:56,035 --> 01:04:57,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Second is fairness.

875
01:04:58,356 --> 01:04:59,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, I'm not evil.

876
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:02,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I live my property for 10 years.

877
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I work my bone to earn that property.

878
01:05:05,898 --> 01:05:09,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally got a machine all myself because it cost 500 to get plumber.

879
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:14,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally, like I work so hard for their property.

880
01:05:15,393 --> 01:05:17,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I just share the same responsibility.

881
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:26,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid exactly what I own in terms of tax for like other single resident in this community.

882
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:35,287
[SPEAKER_08]: It is unfair to discriminate small owner like me just because I have a property, I rent it out.

883
01:05:36,128 --> 01:05:37,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I already did my fair part.

884
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:39,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I pay my tax, just leave me alone.

885
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:51,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Third is efficiency.

886
01:05:52,750 --> 01:06:00,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I just couldn't notice that one of the reason that the objective is to be affordable housing.

887
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:05,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a scientist or economic scientist.

888
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:10,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I just couldn't make the connection of affordable housing versus more fit.

889
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:15,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, how that will even help in terms of affordable housing.

890
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:27,706
[SPEAKER_08]: it will make metaphor even more expensive for renter, because every penny you extract from landlord will eventually triple down to all resident here.

891
01:06:29,181 --> 01:06:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: So my suggestion to the city council is actually try to more efficiently use the tax money you already have towards the goal.

892
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:39,555
[SPEAKER_08]: They are other people's money.

893
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:42,919
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the money from, like, pulling from the citizens.

894
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Those should be, you already have those money.

895
01:06:46,604 --> 01:06:56,687
[SPEAKER_08]: that we probably should have more proposal, we should working on using that existing tax money more efficiently, rather try to expand the tax base.

896
01:06:57,068 --> 01:07:03,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it does, please do it properly, just raise the tax rate, do it properly.

897
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all my comments, thank you.

898
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:06,211
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

899
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:15,914
[SPEAKER_46]: No hands on Zoom, go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

900
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:34,963
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to say that I strongly oppose this rental licensing ordinance, and I just want to make a general appreciation of why I only own my house, I don't have rental property, and some other people have made great points about the specifics.

901
01:07:36,283 --> 01:07:42,229
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think that the rental licensing ordinance is a clear example, in fact, of government overreach.

902
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:49,195
[SPEAKER_22]: When the government imposes such licenses, it typically aims to regulate for the sake of regulation and nothing else.

903
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:53,899
[SPEAKER_22]: In this case, under the guise of climate sustainability and affordable housing goals.

904
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,325
[SPEAKER_22]: However, what actually occurs is a limitation on the freedom of property owners to engage freely in the market.

905
01:08:01,805 --> 01:08:11,551
[SPEAKER_22]: This not only introduces unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, but also inflates costs for both landlords and tenants, for both of them.

906
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:16,156
[SPEAKER_22]: reflecting a misguided approach to solving housing issues.

907
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:23,844
[SPEAKER_22]: A much more effective method would be to encourage free market competition and innovation, which naturally elevates housing standards, i.e.

908
01:08:23,884 --> 01:08:24,985
[SPEAKER_22]: sustainability goals,

909
01:08:26,454 --> 01:08:28,775
[SPEAKER_22]: and affordability without imposing burdensome regulations.

910
01:08:29,135 --> 01:08:37,920
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would just like to add, based on the comment on the previous person, which I applaud, is that, yes, I would try to focus on efficiency.

911
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:44,162
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand that by definition, the government is inefficient because the government uses somebody else's money on someone else.

912
01:08:44,723 --> 01:08:49,085
[SPEAKER_22]: And as such, the government thinks that resources are unlimited, but they're not unlimited.

913
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:52,927
[SPEAKER_22]: We work as hard as we can to basically pay our taxes.

914
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:55,328
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we're not getting anything out of it.

915
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:57,377
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't even drive.

916
01:08:57,837 --> 01:09:03,459
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to change two bearings in my car already because you basically drive like it's a landmine.

917
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,960
[SPEAKER_22]: You're trying to avoid potholes everywhere you go.

918
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:13,923
[SPEAKER_22]: So I please request that the city council, please use the resources that you already have efficiently.

919
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:17,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Property prices go up every year, okay?

920
01:09:17,384 --> 01:09:19,585
[SPEAKER_22]: I keep paying more taxes, so please,

921
01:09:20,345 --> 01:09:27,767
[SPEAKER_22]: Please use as efficiently as you can with the limitation that I have stated that it's always going to be more inefficient than the free market.

922
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:33,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Please use what you have as efficiently as you can and leave us alone.

923
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:38,631
[SPEAKER_22]: We already do our part, we work as hard as we can, and we don't want to contribute anymore.

924
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:39,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

925
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:40,492
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

926
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:47,114
[SPEAKER_40]: David, the rest of the record, you have five minutes.

927
01:09:48,494 --> 01:09:50,134
[SPEAKER_43]: Bill Carr, 47 Blakely Road.

928
01:09:52,035 --> 01:10:00,837
[SPEAKER_43]: This whole thing the last couple of months with the real estate and all these different things you're trying to do here as a council, you weren't elected to do these things.

929
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:01,877
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, you ran on that.

930
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:04,098
[SPEAKER_43]: You came to my house, man, remember we talked?

931
01:10:04,758 --> 01:10:06,078
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, you ran on some of these things.

932
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:07,419
[SPEAKER_43]: You had a slate.

933
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:09,599
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, you have an agenda.

934
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:11,039
[SPEAKER_43]: You're gonna vote the way you're gonna vote.

935
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,040
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not gonna change that.

936
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:17,081
[SPEAKER_43]: When you have 300 people behind me that said they don't want it, and nobody says they do,

937
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,392
[SPEAKER_43]: Respect these people.

938
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,094
[SPEAKER_43]: These people work hard.

939
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:23,534
[SPEAKER_43]: I was a renter.

940
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:26,416
[SPEAKER_43]: Johnny Martinetti was a renter.

941
01:10:27,037 --> 01:10:28,217
[SPEAKER_43]: The Galandos are renters.

942
01:10:28,317 --> 01:10:30,299
[SPEAKER_43]: Bob Petty, I could go for a year in this room.

943
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:32,160
[SPEAKER_43]: They were all probably rented when they started.

944
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,841
[SPEAKER_43]: It's like you people do.

945
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:36,883
[SPEAKER_43]: Then they bought their first house, okay?

946
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:41,005
[SPEAKER_43]: Now our houses are part of our retirement, okay?

947
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:43,147
[SPEAKER_43]: You're not taking one penny from our retirement.

948
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:49,254
[SPEAKER_43]: The government's already got my money, they've been tracking me forever, okay?

949
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:53,700
[SPEAKER_43]: My father sat in that council seat 20 years ago, right here.

950
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:57,998
[SPEAKER_43]: When he ran for office, you know what he did?

951
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:06,505
[SPEAKER_43]: He offered up $10,000 of his salary, which was 20 at the time, to pay for help the kids get sports teams and give it back to the fight apart.

952
01:11:07,025 --> 01:11:07,706
[SPEAKER_43]: That's record.

953
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:11,649
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, so what I'm telling you is he was on his third Memphis Square plan.

954
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:14,711
[SPEAKER_43]: My father was, and then the fourth and the fifth and the sixth.

955
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:19,015
[SPEAKER_43]: This council should focus on what the hell's going on out there.

956
01:11:19,035 --> 01:11:20,316
[SPEAKER_43]: We're not taking money from the people.

957
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:21,617
[SPEAKER_43]: Get out of the real estate business.

958
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:22,197
[SPEAKER_43]: You're not in it.

959
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:23,779
[SPEAKER_43]: You're not in it.

960
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:25,380
[SPEAKER_43]: That's not your deal.

961
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,557
[SPEAKER_43]: And Matt, I came- Please direct your comments to the chair.

962
01:11:30,717 --> 01:11:31,678
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, can I speak to him?

963
01:11:31,898 --> 01:11:32,559
[SPEAKER_46]: No, you can speak to me.

964
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:39,288
[SPEAKER_43]: All right, he came to my house and I said, you people, your group has created a huge divide in Medford.

965
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:40,650
[SPEAKER_43]: And you know what you said to me?

966
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,390
[SPEAKER_43]: You said, you're right.

967
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:42,792
[SPEAKER_43]: And I want to fix that.

968
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,094
[SPEAKER_43]: You've created a bigger divide than you're ever going to fix.

969
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:47,475
[SPEAKER_43]: It's going to get worse.

970
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,577
[SPEAKER_43]: You don't want to do this as this community.

971
01:11:49,997 --> 01:11:51,619
[SPEAKER_43]: People don't want to volunteer for stuff.

972
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:53,920
[SPEAKER_43]: This community needs to focus on what's going on.

973
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,882
[SPEAKER_43]: We are so far behind on our tax base.

974
01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:57,884
[SPEAKER_43]: We are so far, we don't have development going on.

975
01:11:58,164 --> 01:11:59,365
[SPEAKER_43]: The streets are a mess.

976
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,866
[SPEAKER_43]: The fire department's unhappy.

977
01:12:01,306 --> 01:12:04,249
[SPEAKER_43]: My cousin's a teacher, 2% contract, 2%.

978
01:12:04,889 --> 01:12:05,550
[SPEAKER_43]: That's pennies.

979
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:11,215
[SPEAKER_43]: There's so many other issues that we need to focus on in this community, not taking people's money for real estate.

980
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:17,242
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, affordable housing, you know what they call affordable housing, because you can't afford it, you can't have it.

981
01:12:17,662 --> 01:12:20,605
[SPEAKER_43]: You work hard, you save your money, you buy a house.

982
01:12:20,925 --> 01:12:23,047
[SPEAKER_43]: That's the way, that's the American dream.

983
01:12:23,867 --> 01:12:26,570
[SPEAKER_43]: That's how it goes.

984
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,212
[SPEAKER_43]: There's not an affordable housing problem in this country.

985
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:30,794
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a management problem.

986
01:12:31,534 --> 01:12:33,396
[SPEAKER_43]: We send money everywhere else around the world.

987
01:12:33,736 --> 01:12:37,780
[SPEAKER_43]: We don't keep it here to help the veterans, the homeless, we send it all over the place.

988
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:46,724
[SPEAKER_43]: So focus on what's going on, the streets, the fire department, the schools, build a fire department, get that one going.

989
01:12:47,385 --> 01:12:48,666
[SPEAKER_43]: Start developing Meffitt Square.

990
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:52,768
[SPEAKER_43]: Then you'll see the tax money come in like Somerville and Arlington and all these other towns around us.

991
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,009
[SPEAKER_43]: We are so far behind.

992
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:56,750
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not your fault, but you can change it.

993
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:57,671
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

994
01:12:58,751 --> 01:12:59,332
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

995
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:05,175
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address for the record, please.

996
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,136
[SPEAKER_40]: You have five minutes.

997
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:13,263
[SPEAKER_56]: Hello again, thank you, President Beas, Chairman Diaso, Mass Avenue Circuit Road.

998
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,205
[SPEAKER_56]: I just want to make a couple of points.

999
01:13:15,385 --> 01:13:19,929
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm not going to shout, because I'm not really looking for applause or accolades or anything like that.

1000
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:29,678
[SPEAKER_56]: But I usually try to come up here to actually educate people who might be listening, because some of the points that were brought up tonight, I had to figure it out a little bit myself too.

1001
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:33,380
[SPEAKER_56]: Some people were saying, but you have ways of finding people.

1002
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,180
[SPEAKER_56]: You have ways of getting registration.

1003
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,761
[SPEAKER_56]: You have ways of getting names, et cetera, et cetera.

1004
01:13:38,322 --> 01:13:47,305
[SPEAKER_56]: Number one, for people who are listening, too, and some of my friends who I hope would support this, we have a census.

1005
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:50,346
[SPEAKER_56]: Don't we have a huge mailing every year that we have a census?

1006
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:54,812
[SPEAKER_56]: Okay, but I'll tell you something that could be wrong in that too as an example.

1007
01:13:55,412 --> 01:14:05,776
[SPEAKER_56]: We know that maybe some of this you're looking for the fall points as they call it, you know, maybe somebody's there who's destructive of property or maybe a landowner is having a problem.

1008
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:07,997
[SPEAKER_56]: You have a better way of contacting them.

1009
01:14:08,137 --> 01:14:13,399
[SPEAKER_56]: I know sometimes it's very hard to contact someone even if you go by their tax

1010
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:15,921
[SPEAKER_56]: bill if they live out of state or something.

1011
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:17,163
[SPEAKER_56]: I've gone through that.

1012
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:17,963
[SPEAKER_56]: I helped a friend.

1013
01:14:18,264 --> 01:14:20,406
[SPEAKER_56]: I still do with his business besides teaching.

1014
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:23,229
[SPEAKER_56]: He owns a small real estate brokerage firm.

1015
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,494
[SPEAKER_56]: Sometimes we get the envelope back three times in four months.

1016
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:28,695
[SPEAKER_56]: We say we give up.

1017
01:14:29,015 --> 01:14:30,197
[SPEAKER_56]: So that can happen.

1018
01:14:30,537 --> 01:14:31,338
[SPEAKER_56]: I understand that.

1019
01:14:31,698 --> 01:14:34,479
[SPEAKER_56]: But we pay a lot of money for printing census forms.

1020
01:14:34,919 --> 01:14:36,959
[SPEAKER_56]: We have the postage, probably free.

1021
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,701
[SPEAKER_56]: But we have people who are very responsible, I'm hoping, who process all those forms.

1022
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:43,941
[SPEAKER_56]: And that's a good base.

1023
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:47,922
[SPEAKER_56]: We also have the registration of voters in the city.

1024
01:14:50,303 --> 01:14:54,026
[SPEAKER_56]: ways during, excuse me, during the year.

1025
01:14:54,446 --> 01:15:02,551
[SPEAKER_56]: But if you're an example, my niece, who was going through different internships, had to come and live with me after I lost my brother suddenly a few years ago.

1026
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,632
[SPEAKER_56]: She was in and out of my house.

1027
01:15:05,953 --> 01:15:07,674
[SPEAKER_56]: Fine, I welcome her anytime.

1028
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,895
[SPEAKER_56]: She just left, as a matter of fact, again this afternoon.

1029
01:15:10,936 --> 01:15:15,979
[SPEAKER_56]: Every time I filled out the census, I didn't know whether to put her name down because I didn't know if she was going to leave in two weeks.

1030
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:19,540
[SPEAKER_56]: Now, it could have been she maybe took a parking space.

1031
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,181
[SPEAKER_56]: I don't know.

1032
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:21,801
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm just making these as examples.

1033
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:26,504
[SPEAKER_56]: If someone had to bring her up and she wasn't living there anymore, what would something like this do?

1034
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,225
[SPEAKER_56]: Accuse me, the homeowner, of fraud?

1035
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:32,767
[SPEAKER_56]: You know, if she was going off someplace else to live for a few months?

1036
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_56]: To me, I want you to take this that you didn't put

1037
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:43,452
[SPEAKER_56]: some other intention and besides, I think it's going to come to something bigger too, and not better but worse.

1038
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:51,995
[SPEAKER_56]: People don't watch these meetings anymore and I know it's a motion tonight President Pierce, that you're going to look into speaking time.

1039
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:53,616
[SPEAKER_56]: Well there's a lot of people who

1040
01:15:54,036 --> 01:15:56,657
[SPEAKER_56]: Come to me and say we're not watching it anymore.

1041
01:15:56,697 --> 01:15:58,198
[SPEAKER_56]: We're sick of issues coming up.

1042
01:15:58,598 --> 01:16:01,359
[SPEAKER_56]: We're bored We have no idea where they're going with some of them.

1043
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:16,325
[SPEAKER_56]: They're meaningless to us We don't want to watch anymore and you know what happens in a year or two They don't vote because they just don't want to be bothered anymore and they feel like they don't have a voice So I hope I helped in some way to um, just direct

1044
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:26,410
[SPEAKER_56]: I wouldn't say meaningless, but some motions that really can cause a lot of meaningless commotion for yourselves and that your time can be better spent.

1045
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:31,633
[SPEAKER_56]: And another example of this is some people, including myself, I had company watching a meeting one night.

1046
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:39,059
[SPEAKER_56]: And some people on the council were directing questions to the people who put these ordinances together.

1047
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:42,622
[SPEAKER_56]: You're supposed to know all that information when you come here.

1048
01:16:42,642 --> 01:16:47,166
[SPEAKER_56]: If we have a question, you should be able to answer it.

1049
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:50,929
[SPEAKER_56]: You shouldn't be asking each other questions behind your own motions.

1050
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:54,112
[SPEAKER_56]: That should be in a discussion, including in your salary.

1051
01:16:54,132 --> 01:16:55,453
[SPEAKER_56]: And thank you for your time.

1052
01:16:56,214 --> 01:16:56,574
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Ms.

1053
01:16:56,594 --> 01:16:56,814
[SPEAKER_46]: Diaz.

1054
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:59,176
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Jennifer Fiore on Zoom.

1055
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:03,746
[SPEAKER_46]: Give me one second here.

1056
01:17:06,628 --> 01:17:07,609
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record.

1057
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:08,469
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1058
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:12,212
[SPEAKER_57]: Hi, Jennifer Fiore, 61 Stickney Road in Medford.

1059
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:16,055
[SPEAKER_57]: I just had one quick comment or clarification.

1060
01:17:16,596 --> 01:17:20,959
[SPEAKER_57]: My understanding is that it would be the landlords and the renters who would be on this registry.

1061
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:29,305
[SPEAKER_57]: And I think it's actually also pretty concerning for the renters to have their privacy invaded like this.

1062
01:17:30,627 --> 01:17:33,629
[SPEAKER_57]: You know, renters might be of all different income levels.

1063
01:17:34,871 --> 01:17:38,194
[SPEAKER_57]: They may potentially be receiving other government services.

1064
01:17:38,975 --> 01:17:53,628
[SPEAKER_57]: And, you know, depending on where administrations head, you know, privacy and governments being aware of their whereabouts might be concerning for people and might disincentivize them from moving to Medford.

1065
01:17:55,782 --> 01:18:08,211
[SPEAKER_57]: My second point is that just in observing these last few meetings, I just see such an immense amount of pain that is being caused in this community by the way the city council is conducting affairs.

1066
01:18:08,912 --> 01:18:20,380
[SPEAKER_57]: And I just think you all really should go home and reflect on what you're doing, what your goals are.

1067
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:30,895
[SPEAKER_57]: and what your role really is as leadership for a city because you're causing pain and it's going to come back and haunt you.

1068
01:18:31,776 --> 01:18:44,407
[SPEAKER_57]: And so I think collectively it's an opportunity to just think about where you want to see this community head and how the most productive way would be to go about that.

1069
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:45,188
[SPEAKER_57]: Thanks.

1070
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:47,230
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1071
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,133
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

1072
01:18:54,153 --> 01:18:54,894
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1073
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:58,558
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is amazing.

1074
01:18:58,638 --> 01:18:59,720
[SPEAKER_46]: One second point of information.

1075
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan just to a point of information.

1076
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Renters are not on the registry.

1077
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:09,250
[SPEAKER_15]: There's rental properties that are on the right, so just be property owners and renters themselves are not on registry.

1078
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:09,851
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1079
01:19:10,171 --> 01:19:11,373
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

1080
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:12,194
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1081
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:17,368
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, I think... Please respect the meeting, respect this person's time.

1082
01:19:17,608 --> 01:19:17,848
[SPEAKER_45]: Okay.

1083
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:23,211
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah, I read the thing, I see that it's a landlord and also renter need to register.

1084
01:19:23,611 --> 01:19:24,732
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah, I remember this one.

1085
01:19:25,212 --> 01:19:30,475
[SPEAKER_45]: But anyway, just now the... Sorry, could you provide your name and address for the record, please?

1086
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:30,655
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.

1087
01:19:31,315 --> 01:19:32,416
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is Li Junhui.

1088
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:34,037
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm 27 Hancock Street.

1089
01:19:34,097 --> 01:19:34,438
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1090
01:19:34,558 --> 01:19:34,878
[SPEAKER_45]: Okay.

1091
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:35,879
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.

1092
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,921
[SPEAKER_45]: The first one, I think I watched the metaphor.

1093
01:19:38,981 --> 01:19:39,681
[SPEAKER_45]: I like metaphor.

1094
01:19:40,202 --> 01:19:41,883
[SPEAKER_45]: Now it's beautiful and beautiful.

1095
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:43,624
[SPEAKER_45]: I think I bought a house here.

1096
01:19:44,285 --> 01:19:45,526
[SPEAKER_45]: Beginning my tax is 5,000.

1097
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,287
[SPEAKER_45]: I did a very good job.

1098
01:19:47,327 --> 01:19:48,768
[SPEAKER_45]: So make my house beautiful.

1099
01:19:48,848 --> 01:19:50,609
[SPEAKER_45]: So now increase the tax to the 12,000.

1100
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:59,014
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm OK, because I like to contribute to the metaphor, make the metaphor beautiful.

1101
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:00,755
[SPEAKER_45]: And also, it's a work of art.

1102
01:20:01,575 --> 01:20:08,478
[SPEAKER_45]: But another thing, for this one, I think it definitely will be hurting the privacy of the landlord and also the renter.

1103
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:13,320
[SPEAKER_45]: I know the purpose, our goal, is to make the metaphor beautiful and also

1104
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:16,881
[SPEAKER_45]: is a good business.

1105
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:20,362
[SPEAKER_45]: So I think this is our all the resident resident ago.

1106
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:38,886
[SPEAKER_45]: So my point, I just like concern about this, this, this new policy will be heard our, our economics of the Medford will be not only heard a lot of privacy part and also for the renter to will be hesitated to run here if they have so many burden.

1107
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,547
[SPEAKER_45]: And also, this is like a

1108
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:45,675
[SPEAKER_45]: their privacy, this is only my thing.

1109
01:20:45,755 --> 01:20:49,657
[SPEAKER_45]: I think I want Medford to have a good business and also good future.

1110
01:20:50,197 --> 01:20:54,640
[SPEAKER_45]: So I definitely ask you guys can reconsider this one.

1111
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,160
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.

1112
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,020
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you so much.

1113
01:20:56,041 --> 01:21:02,104
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Mr. Castanedi.

1114
01:21:02,124 --> 01:21:03,325
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1115
01:21:03,465 --> 01:21:04,285
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

1116
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:06,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1117
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,728
[SPEAKER_11]: AP Castanedi, Cushing Street.

1118
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:10,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Three quick points under one minute.

1119
01:21:13,972 --> 01:21:18,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure what you counselors are aiming at.

1120
01:21:19,462 --> 01:21:22,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of you counselors are aiming at as far as this registry thing.

1121
01:21:23,991 --> 01:21:30,396
[SPEAKER_11]: However, right below you, Counselor Beers, is the Registrar, Real Estate Department, the Assessor's Office.

1122
01:21:30,777 --> 01:21:35,861
[SPEAKER_11]: They have all the addresses of all buildings, including commercial, right below you.

1123
01:21:36,261 --> 01:21:47,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's your address list, and hopefully there's no penalty if we homeowners don't wanna answer the question, or a renter, to add insult to injury, by the way.

1124
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:51,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanna say, I'm really tired

1125
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:56,811
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of bills to pay, and it hurts sometimes.

1126
01:21:58,232 --> 01:22:03,554
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just would wish that Big Brother and you all would just keep the nose out of our business for a change.

1127
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:04,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1128
01:22:06,575 --> 01:22:07,375
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mr. Chessy.

1129
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:08,495
[SPEAKER_39]: That was under a minute.

1130
01:22:10,456 --> 01:22:10,996
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

1131
01:22:11,256 --> 01:22:12,157
[SPEAKER_32]: Name and address for the record, please.

1132
01:22:12,237 --> 01:22:13,477
[SPEAKER_32]: You have five minutes.

1133
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:14,517
[SPEAKER_32]: Ricky Colombo, 150 Middlesex Ave.

1134
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:24,884
[SPEAKER_32]: You say that it doesn't involve the renters, and you say it's not going to involve different ethnicities, but you also said it's just the beginning of the conversation.

1135
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:26,965
[SPEAKER_32]: This is just the beginning, right?

1136
01:22:27,826 --> 01:22:28,547
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't trust you.

1137
01:22:28,747 --> 01:22:29,868
[SPEAKER_32]: This is just the beginning now.

1138
01:22:29,888 --> 01:22:31,749
[SPEAKER_32]: You're going to add in all these things as you go on.

1139
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,651
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what you do every single week.

1140
01:22:33,891 --> 01:22:35,872
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys keep creating problems that don't exist.

1141
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,381
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what you did.

1142
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:42,526
[SPEAKER_32]: You did that with the school committee, gave them a raise, and now teachers are going to get fired.

1143
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:57,342
[SPEAKER_32]: Because you guys added $70,000 to their budget, now at least one or two teachers are going to be fired directly because you guys added to their budget without their request, without anybody's request, because you want to be the first in the country to have the city council and school committee be the same level.

1144
01:22:58,423 --> 01:22:58,864
[SPEAKER_32]: Ridiculous.

1145
01:23:05,196 --> 01:23:06,837
[SPEAKER_32]: There's no need for this registry.

1146
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:09,718
[SPEAKER_32]: If somebody files complaints against somebody, that's logged.

1147
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:10,939
[SPEAKER_32]: It's definitely logged somewhere.

1148
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:15,681
[SPEAKER_32]: Certainly on CClickFix, you can see through and read all the complaints that people have.

1149
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:16,422
[SPEAKER_32]: They're there every day.

1150
01:23:16,462 --> 01:23:16,962
[SPEAKER_32]: You can read them.

1151
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:17,602
[SPEAKER_32]: I get the emails.

1152
01:23:19,023 --> 01:23:19,884
[SPEAKER_32]: Registry is not needed.

1153
01:23:20,184 --> 01:23:21,444
[SPEAKER_32]: People know how to complain about people.

1154
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:23,525
[SPEAKER_32]: And just enough.

1155
01:23:23,826 --> 01:23:24,966
[SPEAKER_32]: Stay out of our businesses.

1156
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:26,567
[SPEAKER_32]: It's our houses.

1157
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:27,287
[SPEAKER_32]: We can handle it.

1158
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:28,188
[SPEAKER_32]: We pay our taxes.

1159
01:23:28,528 --> 01:23:32,050
[SPEAKER_32]: And you guys can try to fix the city and stop making everybody angry.

1160
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,810
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1161
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,071
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for your time.

1162
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:36,840
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to go to Tony Tanks.

1163
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,382
[SPEAKER_46]: Tony Tanks on Zoom.

1164
01:23:41,442 --> 01:23:42,783
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

1165
01:23:43,723 --> 01:23:44,584
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1166
01:23:50,947 --> 01:23:52,628
[SPEAKER_46]: Tony, I requested to unmute you.

1167
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:53,829
[SPEAKER_46]: You have to accept my request.

1168
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:55,838
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1169
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,960
[SPEAKER_46]: Can you hear me?

1170
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,841
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1171
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:05,244
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm glad I still have that opportunity because I have a feeling that will be gone shortly, too.

1172
01:24:05,544 --> 01:24:08,666
[SPEAKER_37]: So yeah, I will name an address for the record, please.

1173
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:11,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, 12 local street.

1174
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:13,169
[SPEAKER_37]: I will not comply.

1175
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:14,029
[SPEAKER_37]: Your name.

1176
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:14,330
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry.

1177
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,370
[SPEAKER_37]: Tony.

1178
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:17,231
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

1179
01:24:18,112 --> 01:24:19,413
[SPEAKER_37]: And I will not comply.

1180
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:20,834
[SPEAKER_37]: You pass your little registries.

1181
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:21,894
[SPEAKER_37]: We will not comply.

1182
01:24:21,934 --> 01:24:24,376
[SPEAKER_37]: I won't be the only one because it's all bull and you know it is.

1183
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:35,430
[SPEAKER_37]: No one has any right to any information between me and my tenants by no landlord has that should have to have any shared agreement share any of the agreements.

1184
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:38,732
[SPEAKER_37]: It starts off as just a little information gathering.

1185
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:46,918
[SPEAKER_37]: And then it moves on to blowing up and out of control, the more intrusiveness into private affairs of people and it's just unnecessary.

1186
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:48,879
[SPEAKER_37]: And the key here is we don't need it.

1187
01:24:49,477 --> 01:24:56,439
[SPEAKER_37]: So please, as councillors, understand you are not elected to decide what you think is best for all of us.

1188
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,361
[SPEAKER_37]: You are elected to represent the will of the residents.

1189
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:13,325
[SPEAKER_37]: Lastly, Mr. President, since it's your position to state the facts, please do so and state all of the facts, not just the ones that you see fit and that fit your condescending and authoritarian agenda.

1190
01:25:13,686 --> 01:25:14,526
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much.

1191
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:22,647
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1192
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,348
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, sometimes the facts are the facts.

1193
01:25:24,408 --> 01:25:25,609
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

1194
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:29,191
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, City Council.

1195
01:25:29,231 --> 01:25:31,652
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Jan and 128 Lawrence Street.

1196
01:25:34,274 --> 01:25:34,974
[SPEAKER_30]: You have five minutes.

1197
01:25:35,615 --> 01:25:35,975
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1198
01:25:36,155 --> 01:25:38,516
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm going to start basically two points.

1199
01:25:38,877 --> 01:25:42,779
[SPEAKER_30]: And the first point is how to reach out to landlord.

1200
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,382
[SPEAKER_30]: A second point is the human rights and listen to people in the city.

1201
01:25:50,003 --> 01:26:03,951
[SPEAKER_30]: At the beginning, before I get into my first point, I want to say I'm probably not the last one, but I'm new to Medford and I became an owner and landlord last year from Medford.

1202
01:26:04,752 --> 01:26:07,873
[SPEAKER_30]: And I don't think the city council wants me to see all this.

1203
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:09,995
[SPEAKER_30]: I think this is shocking to me.

1204
01:26:10,595 --> 01:26:10,935
[SPEAKER_30]: Wow.

1205
01:26:12,136 --> 01:26:16,178
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's terrifying.

1206
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:17,219
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think

1207
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:28,209
[SPEAKER_30]: What I'm going to talk about the first point is like, we impose this rental license to help to reach out to the landlord.

1208
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:30,710
[SPEAKER_30]: But you know what happened to me?

1209
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:36,732
[SPEAKER_30]: I bought a house and I have very good renters in my house.

1210
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:38,893
[SPEAKER_30]: And as the first time,

1211
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:43,354
[SPEAKER_30]: landlord that I don't know what to set up and what to do.

1212
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:46,497
[SPEAKER_30]: And two months later, the water bill show up in my house.

1213
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:49,660
[SPEAKER_30]: And you guys really know how to find us.

1214
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:56,206
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you want to send those information along with the water bill, I'm okay to accept it.

1215
01:26:56,226 --> 01:26:59,749
[SPEAKER_30]: Like if you have a rebate, send it with the water bill and I can get it.

1216
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:01,311
[SPEAKER_30]: There's no problem.

1217
01:27:04,781 --> 01:27:13,564
[SPEAKER_30]: I think there's like a really advanced technologies, a lot of things happening around the world, machine learning and different kind of tech, right?

1218
01:27:13,624 --> 01:27:15,544
[SPEAKER_30]: And some of them is even open source is free.

1219
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,765
[SPEAKER_30]: So do leverage that.

1220
01:27:18,545 --> 01:27:22,346
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm pretty sure that you have a way to find the landlord.

1221
01:27:22,486 --> 01:27:26,487
[SPEAKER_30]: And even if it's not in Massachusetts, it's in other states, it's in other countries, I'm pretty sure you have a way.

1222
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:28,288
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's my first point.

1223
01:27:29,188 --> 01:27:31,949
[SPEAKER_30]: And second point, it's the human rights.

1224
01:27:33,337 --> 01:27:35,259
[SPEAKER_30]: and listening to people.

1225
01:27:35,499 --> 01:27:42,224
[SPEAKER_30]: So I live in another city in Massachusetts and I've never seen like this.

1226
01:27:42,684 --> 01:27:48,349
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is the first time I have been in city council that like the audience is this kind of reaction.

1227
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:56,155
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think what we should do is we should really listen to people and we should really focus on people.

1228
01:27:56,215 --> 01:27:58,477
[SPEAKER_30]: That's what the city council should do.

1229
01:27:59,297 --> 01:27:59,918
[SPEAKER_30]: And I feel

1230
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:22,533
[SPEAKER_30]: And a lot of gentlemen and ladies, they have already talked a lot about the efficiency, the rights, and then what the city council should focus on now, all reaching to this area, that I think all the landlords, they have their own rights, and then they have their own power to manage this property without a rental registry.

1231
01:28:22,553 --> 01:28:26,576
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think, at last, I really want to suggest the city council,

1232
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:35,871
[SPEAKER_30]: listen to people, and follow with people, and what you just hear, not just me, everyone else, it's just what people want to express and what to say.

1233
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:40,173
[SPEAKER_30]: And if this is the beginning of the conversation, let's end it here.

1234
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:41,713
[SPEAKER_30]: That's everything.

1235
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:41,973
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1236
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:42,293
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1237
01:28:44,554 --> 01:28:47,515
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Dr. Leong, please.

1238
01:28:47,915 --> 01:28:52,137
[SPEAKER_44]: You have five minutes.

1239
01:28:53,655 --> 01:28:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street, Medford.

1240
01:28:57,279 --> 01:28:59,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I am in the real estate business.

1241
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:01,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to tell you something.

1242
01:29:02,124 --> 01:29:06,288
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as Anna, through the chair, Anna, I know that you mean well.

1243
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a 72 year old woman that emailed me.

1244
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:14,299
[SPEAKER_06]: My mother was asked to be put on a registry and that was in World War II in Germany.

1245
01:29:14,379 --> 01:29:17,803
[SPEAKER_06]: People do not want their names on a registry.

1246
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not want their name, their address and their phone number listed on a registry.

1247
01:29:28,342 --> 01:29:32,445
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Medford has a registry of all the property owners.

1248
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:38,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I can stand here as somebody that's in the real estate business and tell you, you have approximately 5,002 families.

1249
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:41,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of those 5,000, approximately 2,400 of them are not owner occupied.

1250
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:51,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of your single families, there's approximately 500 of them that are not owner occupied.

1251
01:29:52,101 --> 01:29:55,383
[SPEAKER_06]: There are registries out there where you can go get that information.

1252
01:29:55,743 --> 01:30:06,790
[SPEAKER_06]: The FCC passed a law in December that nobody can contact anybody come July on their phone or their email without their written consent.

1253
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't matter what they give you.

1254
01:30:09,492 --> 01:30:12,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten phone calls in the last week from tenants

1255
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:14,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you dare give out my lease.

1256
01:30:14,893 --> 01:30:15,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not give out my name.

1257
01:30:15,954 --> 01:30:17,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not give out my phone number.

1258
01:30:17,655 --> 01:30:20,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten the same information from landlords.

1259
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:21,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not give it out.

1260
01:30:21,759 --> 01:30:25,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a company that does over 275 leases a year.

1261
01:30:25,663 --> 01:30:27,885
[SPEAKER_06]: We will not be giving you their information.

1262
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:29,987
[SPEAKER_06]: They will not be giving you their information.

1263
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:33,531
[SPEAKER_06]: The only information I've been given permission to give you is their attorney.

1264
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:36,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten attorney phone calls, do not give it.

1265
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:40,493
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanna have a rental registry like Lynn, which is what I heard today?

1266
01:30:40,973 --> 01:30:44,894
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanna tack on $175 a year to the cost of housing?

1267
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:51,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't sit here one week and say you wanna lower the cost of housing, and then the next week put another tax on top of it.

1268
01:30:51,595 --> 01:30:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: These are good people.

1269
01:30:53,596 --> 01:30:58,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you how other cities deal with problem properties.

1270
01:30:59,357 --> 01:31:02,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Malden has had a problem property unit for at least,

1271
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:04,059
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 years.

1272
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,543
[SPEAKER_06]: They meet every single month.

1273
01:31:06,683 --> 01:31:08,685
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the head of every department.

1274
01:31:09,246 --> 01:31:18,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Landlords and tenants know if there is somebody putting out more trash than they're supposed to, or there's more cars, you can report it as something to be investigated.

1275
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:21,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't matter if you create this other registry.

1276
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:25,224
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Medford does not have the people to enforce it.

1277
01:31:25,624 --> 01:31:27,645
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two code enforcers down there.

1278
01:31:27,685 --> 01:31:29,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Try filing for a permit.

1279
01:31:29,186 --> 01:31:32,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I have people that are waiting months just to renovate their bathroom.

1280
01:31:32,589 --> 01:31:36,051
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have enough people in the city to do the work that's here.

1281
01:31:36,452 --> 01:31:37,933
[SPEAKER_06]: You shouldn't be adding to it.

1282
01:31:38,353 --> 01:31:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're good intentioned.

1283
01:31:40,355 --> 01:31:42,356
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other ways of doing it.

1284
01:31:42,476 --> 01:31:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ask you to implore those, and please,

1285
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: can we just get away from housing for a few weeks?

1286
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:55,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Medford has been incited week after week after week for a city that wants affordable housing.

1287
01:31:56,005 --> 01:31:57,666
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the best way to go about it.

1288
01:31:57,886 --> 01:31:58,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1289
01:31:58,286 --> 01:31:59,287
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1290
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:08,718
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, name and address for the record, please.

1291
01:32:08,759 --> 01:32:09,839
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

1292
01:32:09,879 --> 01:32:11,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Kelly Allen, 67th Century Street.

1293
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:13,320
[SPEAKER_16]: When I bought my home, I had a renter.

1294
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:14,941
[SPEAKER_16]: They destroyed it.

1295
01:32:15,801 --> 01:32:19,903
[SPEAKER_16]: They ripped out all the walls, the bathroom, down through the hallway.

1296
01:32:20,463 --> 01:32:22,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Where was the city to put it back together?

1297
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:24,486
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't help me.

1298
01:32:24,746 --> 01:32:25,747
[SPEAKER_16]: The government didn't help me.

1299
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know what I received from that tenant?

1300
01:32:27,587 --> 01:32:30,548
[SPEAKER_16]: They owed us $7,000 because we could not get them out.

1301
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:37,330
[SPEAKER_16]: We received $200, and we settled on that because we were never going to get the money for it.

1302
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:38,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Never.

1303
01:32:39,451 --> 01:32:41,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is the justice in that?

1304
01:32:43,092 --> 01:32:44,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you want us to go to electric.

1305
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:47,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We go to electric, you ruin the grid, power's down.

1306
01:32:48,113 --> 01:32:49,354
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to be bad landlords?

1307
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:51,710
[SPEAKER_16]: because we have no heat for them.

1308
01:32:52,371 --> 01:32:54,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're going to be putting people in hotels?

1309
01:32:55,212 --> 01:32:55,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

1310
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:56,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough.

1311
01:32:57,532 --> 01:32:58,793
[SPEAKER_16]: This good landlord thing.

1312
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:00,773
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had seven renters.

1313
01:33:02,394 --> 01:33:04,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Two have asked to come back.

1314
01:33:04,995 --> 01:33:07,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Please get rid of your tenant and let us back in.

1315
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:11,397
[SPEAKER_16]: The other five have bought a house.

1316
01:33:13,237 --> 01:33:14,818
[SPEAKER_16]: There are good landlords out there.

1317
01:33:15,538 --> 01:33:16,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Let this go.

1318
01:33:16,278 --> 01:33:18,139
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1319
01:33:22,947 --> 01:33:26,091
[SPEAKER_40]: Any further discussion by members of the public in person or on Zoom?

1320
01:33:30,617 --> 01:33:31,418
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion?

1321
01:33:31,438 --> 01:33:32,900
[SPEAKER_46]: Anyone want to go?

1322
01:33:33,962 --> 01:33:34,242
[SPEAKER_46]: Go ahead.

1323
01:33:34,462 --> 01:33:35,263
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address the record, please.

1324
01:33:35,283 --> 01:33:35,904
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1325
01:33:36,846 --> 01:33:38,728
[SPEAKER_35]: John Karofalos, 15 Cook Circle.

1326
01:33:41,091 --> 01:33:56,964
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the real estate woman who spoke earlier, I'd like to ask her, how's it gonna feel when she goes to sell a house in Medford and say, Oh, just so you know, you're gonna have to register and you're gonna have to register your tenants.

1327
01:33:57,004 --> 01:33:57,785
[SPEAKER_35]: How's that gonna go?

1328
01:33:58,005 --> 01:33:58,906
[SPEAKER_35]: How many apartments?

1329
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,280
[SPEAKER_35]: How many apartments?

1330
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,041
[SPEAKER_35]: How many houses?

1331
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:06,943
[SPEAKER_35]: You're going to put her and every other real estate agency out of business in Medford?

1332
01:34:07,263 --> 01:34:08,683
[SPEAKER_35]: How are they going to work?

1333
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:18,087
[SPEAKER_35]: How am I as a as a landlord is Oh, by the way, you're going to have to register this and your rent is going to go up because I have to pay for this now.

1334
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:27,058
[SPEAKER_35]: Give us more, more, more bills, give us more bills, and watch the rent go up, watch the rent go up.

1335
01:34:27,998 --> 01:34:29,179
[SPEAKER_35]: How are we gonna afford this?

1336
01:34:29,799 --> 01:34:30,879
[SPEAKER_35]: We kill ourselves.

1337
01:34:31,559 --> 01:34:35,900
[SPEAKER_35]: Everyone, walk down the street, everyone's working on their house, there's contractors everywhere.

1338
01:34:36,661 --> 01:34:39,261
[SPEAKER_35]: Cost $700 to put a new toilet in your house.

1339
01:34:40,622 --> 01:34:45,863
[SPEAKER_35]: It's $240, go down to Murray's, but have a contractor come in, it's 700 bucks.

1340
01:34:46,663 --> 01:34:48,044
[SPEAKER_35]: The landlord pays for that.

1341
01:34:49,366 --> 01:34:50,567
[SPEAKER_35]: and the tenant ruins it.

1342
01:34:52,889 --> 01:34:55,471
[SPEAKER_35]: They're breaking us, and you're gonna help.

1343
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,913
[SPEAKER_35]: You're gonna help break us.

1344
01:34:58,854 --> 01:34:59,835
[SPEAKER_35]: That's what's happening.

1345
01:35:00,876 --> 01:35:02,097
[SPEAKER_35]: Don't pass these things.

1346
01:35:02,858 --> 01:35:03,718
[SPEAKER_35]: He just heard us.

1347
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,141
[SPEAKER_35]: We need to fix the streets.

1348
01:35:06,721 --> 01:35:14,688
[SPEAKER_35]: You have enough asphalt to build speed tables everywhere, but you can't put it in the pothole.

1349
01:35:21,046 --> 01:35:24,987
[SPEAKER_35]: There's cones everywhere, cones everywhere for the guys on the bike.

1350
01:35:25,947 --> 01:35:27,068
[SPEAKER_35]: It's raining tonight.

1351
01:35:27,828 --> 01:35:28,848
[SPEAKER_35]: It's raining tonight.

1352
01:35:28,968 --> 01:35:32,430
[SPEAKER_35]: Get in your car and see the reflection off those cones.

1353
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,971
[SPEAKER_35]: I can't drive with my glasses.

1354
01:35:34,991 --> 01:35:36,431
[SPEAKER_35]: I can't drive without them.

1355
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:39,832
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna end up killing someone because of those reflective cones.

1356
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,733
[SPEAKER_35]: You spend your money foolishly.

1357
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:43,253
[SPEAKER_35]: Fix the streets.

1358
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:46,235
[SPEAKER_35]: There's a huge rat problem in the city now.

1359
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,936
[SPEAKER_35]: Everyone, everyone.

1360
01:35:49,817 --> 01:35:55,521
[SPEAKER_35]: Today, this afternoon, I was at my house in the hillside that I rent with Yankee pest control.

1361
01:35:56,482 --> 01:35:59,824
[SPEAKER_35]: There's holes everywhere, all over the place, okay?

1362
01:36:00,064 --> 01:36:03,346
[SPEAKER_35]: You guys let the MBTA come in, build their new tracks, everything.

1363
01:36:03,587 --> 01:36:05,428
[SPEAKER_35]: You didn't do anything about the rats.

1364
01:36:05,848 --> 01:36:09,490
[SPEAKER_35]: Tufts is building everywhere, everything, digging up the streets, everything.

1365
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,611
[SPEAKER_35]: There's rats everywhere.

1366
01:36:11,011 --> 01:36:12,072
[SPEAKER_35]: We're paying for that.

1367
01:36:12,452 --> 01:36:19,437
[SPEAKER_35]: I can't tell my tenants how to live, but you guys can tell us how we can live and how we're gonna do everything.

1368
01:36:20,477 --> 01:36:24,160
[SPEAKER_35]: Buy a rental, buy a rental, and then pass this.

1369
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:27,940
[SPEAKER_35]: Get into our shoes.

1370
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,120
[SPEAKER_35]: Get into our shoes.

1371
01:36:31,181 --> 01:36:34,602
[SPEAKER_35]: And then you pass this and you tell me the benefit afterwards.

1372
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:37,083
[SPEAKER_35]: Tell me the benefit.

1373
01:36:37,283 --> 01:36:38,203
[SPEAKER_35]: Where's the benefit?

1374
01:36:38,924 --> 01:36:42,085
[SPEAKER_35]: All of us should be home relaxing with our families.

1375
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,966
[SPEAKER_35]: We all have to get up early for work tomorrow.

1376
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:45,606
[SPEAKER_35]: We're wasting our time here.

1377
01:36:45,646 --> 01:36:46,747
[SPEAKER_35]: You're wasting your time.

1378
01:36:47,287 --> 01:36:48,447
[SPEAKER_35]: Come up with something better.

1379
01:36:49,028 --> 01:36:49,828
[SPEAKER_35]: Fix the streets.

1380
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:51,529
[SPEAKER_35]: Fix the streets.

1381
01:36:51,589 --> 01:36:53,889
[SPEAKER_35]: Every year we have to buy new tires for our cars.

1382
01:36:53,909 --> 01:36:54,810
[SPEAKER_35]: They're getting killed.

1383
01:36:56,573 --> 01:36:59,035
[SPEAKER_35]: Do something right, don't attack us.

1384
01:37:00,776 --> 01:37:02,997
[SPEAKER_35]: All you slumlords, get it together.

1385
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,722
[SPEAKER_35]: All of us, all of us, we have calluses on our hands for fixing our houses.

1386
01:37:11,223 --> 01:37:12,244
[SPEAKER_35]: And the woman's right.

1387
01:37:13,364 --> 01:37:15,105
[SPEAKER_35]: Tenants are terrible, they don't care.

1388
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:19,088
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not gonna stay here forever, this isn't my house, I don't care.

1389
01:37:19,108 --> 01:37:21,790
[SPEAKER_35]: It's your house, you fix it.

1390
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,331
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's what happens.

1391
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:26,113
[SPEAKER_35]: And we're paying all the time, all the time.

1392
01:37:28,157 --> 01:37:30,158
[SPEAKER_35]: You don't help us, not like this.

1393
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:32,040
[SPEAKER_35]: This isn't how you help people.

1394
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,121
[SPEAKER_35]: I've lived in the city my whole life.

1395
01:37:34,722 --> 01:37:36,063
[SPEAKER_35]: Most of the people have here.

1396
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,624
[SPEAKER_35]: We're all good people.

1397
01:37:37,864 --> 01:37:39,425
[SPEAKER_35]: And in good faith, we vote for you.

1398
01:37:39,445 --> 01:37:40,866
[SPEAKER_35]: You have one minute remaining.

1399
01:37:40,906 --> 01:37:42,047
[SPEAKER_35]: You know what?

1400
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:43,448
[SPEAKER_35]: The minute's yours.

1401
01:37:43,648 --> 01:37:43,988
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1402
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:44,649
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you very much.

1403
01:37:44,669 --> 01:37:45,889
[SPEAKER_35]: I appreciate it.

1404
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:49,712
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1405
01:37:50,973 --> 01:37:53,995
[SPEAKER_47]: You've already had a chance to speak, so I'm going to go to anyone else who'd like to speak.

1406
01:37:55,596 --> 01:37:56,177
[SPEAKER_47]: John, you want to talk?

1407
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:04,693
[SPEAKER_41]: John Sousa, 359 Winthrop Street.

1408
01:38:04,993 --> 01:38:05,253
[SPEAKER_41]: Great.

1409
01:38:07,836 --> 01:38:10,699
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to give a little bit of foreshadowing, I think, here.

1410
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:20,649
[SPEAKER_41]: You know, I had a conversation with you, Mr. President, maybe two or three meetings back, and we talked a little bit about

1411
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,423
[SPEAKER_41]: where the other side of this issue sort of presents itself.

1412
01:38:26,503 --> 01:38:27,904
[SPEAKER_41]: Where are they, right?

1413
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,086
[SPEAKER_41]: Where are these, as this gentleman said, right?

1414
01:38:30,546 --> 01:38:41,155
[SPEAKER_41]: We're all here opposing this, but there must be people who find this to be a positive thing to happen in the city of Medford.

1415
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:48,522
[SPEAKER_41]: Your response to me was, when you're in power, your people expect you to just get it done.

1416
01:38:54,682 --> 01:38:55,302
[SPEAKER_41]: And that's fine.

1417
01:38:56,383 --> 01:38:58,025
[SPEAKER_41]: Maybe I don't disagree with you, okay?

1418
01:38:58,625 --> 01:38:59,867
[SPEAKER_41]: But, but.

1419
01:39:02,182 --> 01:39:04,183
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't see them, we don't hear from them.

1420
01:39:04,883 --> 01:39:21,947
[SPEAKER_41]: But what you're going to do is when Kelly's done speaking and I'm done speaking, you're gonna vote this six to one, you're gonna move it into a committee, you're gonna wait till a summer night when you've got three people in here, and you're gonna slip every little thing you want through there.

1421
01:39:22,307 --> 01:39:24,628
[SPEAKER_41]: And that's fine, and that's perfectly fine.

1422
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:25,816
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not.

1423
01:39:25,897 --> 01:39:27,478
[SPEAKER_41]: You're all absolutely correct.

1424
01:39:27,538 --> 01:39:27,878
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not.

1425
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:30,201
[SPEAKER_41]: It's fine by their agenda.

1426
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:32,263
[SPEAKER_41]: It's fine by their agenda.

1427
01:39:33,203 --> 01:39:38,829
[SPEAKER_41]: So this needed to be aired out.

1428
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:47,277
[SPEAKER_41]: And Mr. Scarpelli, Councilman Scarpelli, this entire room appreciates everything you do and you represent us.

1429
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:57,743
[SPEAKER_41]: and I'm going to learn from a few people before me.

1430
01:39:57,763 --> 01:39:59,824
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not going to let you give me my five minutes.

1431
01:39:59,844 --> 01:40:00,884
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to slip on out of here.

1432
01:40:00,904 --> 01:40:01,604
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you very much.

1433
01:40:01,624 --> 01:40:03,365
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, John.

1434
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:09,628
[SPEAKER_46]: Would anyone else like to speak who hasn't spoken yet?

1435
01:40:12,329 --> 01:40:13,429
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

1436
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:14,290
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1437
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,630
[SPEAKER_36]: Peter Petrala, Stearns Ave.

1438
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:20,092
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, when I watch all these people come up,

1439
01:40:21,798 --> 01:40:24,139
[SPEAKER_36]: and speak and I've been to other meetings.

1440
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:27,620
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like you guys don't even care what they say.

1441
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,421
[SPEAKER_36]: These are the people who pay your salaries.

1442
01:40:31,061 --> 01:40:33,102
[SPEAKER_36]: Our taxes pay your salaries.

1443
01:40:33,482 --> 01:40:38,144
[SPEAKER_36]: You guys make faces, you smirk like some idiot.

1444
01:40:39,824 --> 01:40:41,245
[SPEAKER_36]: You shouldn't be doing that.

1445
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:44,286
[SPEAKER_36]: You're supposed to be in charge of the city council.

1446
01:40:45,046 --> 01:40:49,910
[SPEAKER_36]: No matter what anyone says, it's going in six years and out.

1447
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:55,114
[SPEAKER_36]: We only got one guy here working for the city council and that is Mr. Scott Powell.

1448
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:06,404
[SPEAKER_36]: This, as long as I've been in Method, this is the worst city council and mayor we have ever had in the city of Method.

1449
01:41:12,972 --> 01:41:16,356
[SPEAKER_36]: or worse, and you guys just don't care.

1450
01:41:17,517 --> 01:41:20,861
[SPEAKER_36]: You'll make faces, you'll smirk, oh, it's gonna go off.

1451
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:22,083
[SPEAKER_46]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1452
01:41:22,825 --> 01:41:24,926
[SPEAKER_36]: I am I didn't start directing to anyone else.

1453
01:41:24,946 --> 01:41:27,367
[SPEAKER_46]: People saying you this you that.

1454
01:41:27,747 --> 01:41:30,808
[SPEAKER_46]: Please direct your comments.

1455
01:41:31,588 --> 01:41:31,908
[SPEAKER_36]: All right.

1456
01:41:31,948 --> 01:41:32,549
[SPEAKER_36]: Is that better?

1457
01:41:33,329 --> 01:41:34,709
[SPEAKER_36]: It's your communist cult.

1458
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:38,331
[SPEAKER_36]: You guys are going to do what you want.

1459
01:41:38,371 --> 01:41:40,752
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that's what you shouldn't do as a president.

1460
01:41:40,772 --> 01:41:40,972
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah.

1461
01:41:41,372 --> 01:41:43,313
[SPEAKER_36]: It just shows how ignorant you are.

1462
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:55,932
[SPEAKER_36]: Believe me, if there was a way to get rid of you sick somehow, I would, in all my power, try to do it.

1463
01:41:56,173 --> 01:41:57,115
[SPEAKER_44]: It's called an election.

1464
01:41:58,291 --> 01:42:00,112
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:42:00,232 --> 01:42:07,496
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know how you bagged the election, how you did it, but you guys are all happy because you got your 15,000 from our revolution.

1466
01:42:07,536 --> 01:42:08,957
[SPEAKER_36]: That's all you care about.

1467
01:42:08,977 --> 01:42:12,499
[SPEAKER_36]: It's absolutely disgusting.

1468
01:42:12,519 --> 01:42:13,379
[SPEAKER_36]: That's not true.

1469
01:42:13,519 --> 01:42:17,822
[SPEAKER_36]: You got children now, children running the city council.

1470
01:42:18,262 --> 01:42:19,322
[SPEAKER_36]: That's our problem.

1471
01:42:19,943 --> 01:42:21,243
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, we were elected.

1472
01:42:21,283 --> 01:42:21,684
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1473
01:42:26,963 --> 01:42:29,404
[SPEAKER_47]: Kelly, if you'd like to go again.

1474
01:42:29,424 --> 01:42:36,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street.

1475
01:42:37,186 --> 01:42:37,687
[SPEAKER_46]: Five minutes.

1476
01:42:38,347 --> 01:42:40,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I speak to Anna for a minute through the chat?

1477
01:42:40,127 --> 01:42:42,468
[SPEAKER_46]: You can speak to me and if you have comments, she'll hear them.

1478
01:42:42,488 --> 01:42:43,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I will speak to you to Anna.

1479
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:50,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like you just want to reach the landlords and you just want to reach the tenants.

1480
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:54,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell you the majority of the leases renew

1481
01:42:54,818 --> 01:42:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: in June through September in the city of Medford.

1482
01:42:58,401 --> 01:43:18,056
[SPEAKER_06]: If the city of Medford budgeted for an every door mailing in the month of November, you could include anything you want on that mailing, it's one mailing a year, it could cover what you're looking for here, that if there's a problem you contact this department, it could cover

1483
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:24,152
[SPEAKER_06]: a letter in my email this weekend from somebody, a few of them.

1484
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It had something to do with the board of health thing.

1485
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:30,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything could be on this one mailing in November.

1486
01:43:30,695 --> 01:43:37,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you would be doing your outreach and you would be letting people know when you have a problem, this is what you do.

1487
01:43:38,518 --> 01:43:39,838
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need a registry.

1488
01:43:39,999 --> 01:43:41,719
[SPEAKER_06]: We have that in the registry of deeds.

1489
01:43:41,759 --> 01:43:43,420
[SPEAKER_06]: We have that in the assessor's office.

1490
01:43:44,020 --> 01:44:05,241
[SPEAKER_06]: tenants don't want you to have their information if they wanted to they all get told the city of Medford has a reverse 911 we recommend that you go ahead and register for that, so that you receive city notices, I've asked you before, whenever you as the council puts up a notice or agenda or something.

1491
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:12,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be wonderful if anybody that was on this reverse 911 from the city got the email.

1492
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:24,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you've put something up that you've put it on the website because you want the people to know, wouldn't it be great for you if it automatically came in our email, you have access to that system, we do not.

1493
01:44:25,728 --> 01:44:27,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think you should.

1494
01:44:27,369 --> 01:44:31,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that would solve a lot of these problems.

1495
01:44:32,473 --> 01:44:37,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like everyone in this room is here for the best intentions.

1496
01:44:37,317 --> 01:44:39,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I just really want to feel like that.

1497
01:44:39,858 --> 01:44:43,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like everybody wants their American rights protected.

1498
01:44:45,002 --> 01:44:47,624
[SPEAKER_06]: People are being tired of being told what to do.

1499
01:44:47,644 --> 01:44:50,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that there's some slumlords floating around.

1500
01:44:50,727 --> 01:44:52,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't do business with them.

1501
01:44:52,788 --> 01:45:00,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But those people there, the code enforcers know who they are because those tenants are calling the board of health, right?

1502
01:45:00,512 --> 01:45:04,394
[SPEAKER_06]: John Bavosa, he used to spend all his days at problem properties.

1503
01:45:04,995 --> 01:45:07,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we need somebody else in the building department.

1504
01:45:08,496 --> 01:45:15,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if we can start looking at solutions that really work within the means of the city, people wouldn't be so upset.

1505
01:45:16,721 --> 01:45:18,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you guys could do more business.

1506
01:45:19,244 --> 01:45:21,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope you take that into consideration.

1507
01:45:21,465 --> 01:45:21,926
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1508
01:45:21,946 --> 01:45:28,710
[SPEAKER_46]: Thanks.

1509
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,211
[SPEAKER_46]: Nick, name and address for the record, please.

1510
01:45:31,231 --> 01:45:32,232
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

1511
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:37,475
[SPEAKER_46]: Nick, I've requested to unmute you.

1512
01:45:37,515 --> 01:45:38,436
[SPEAKER_46]: You have to accept.

1513
01:45:41,658 --> 01:45:42,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, how's it going?

1514
01:45:44,119 --> 01:45:44,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Good.

1515
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

1516
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:46,741
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Nick.

1517
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:50,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Fifteen, Revere Beach Parkway.

1518
01:45:50,027 --> 01:45:53,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Just wanted to talk tonight.

1519
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:59,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me a sec, I'm having some difficulties over here.

1520
01:46:02,154 --> 01:46:04,816
[SPEAKER_20]: So I am a landlord myself.

1521
01:46:04,836 --> 01:46:17,704
[SPEAKER_20]: A couple concerns I have is some of my tenants, once again, they have not paid me on time.

1522
01:46:18,829 --> 01:46:36,652
[SPEAKER_20]: they have repeatedly called police actually because of rat infestation in my building and uh it's not it's not going how i'd like it to so i think i think these people are like you know they're trying to screw with me a little bit

1523
01:46:37,699 --> 01:46:43,084
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've tried on many bases to evict them and they, they won't leave, you know?

1524
01:46:43,224 --> 01:46:44,825
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't know.

1525
01:46:45,006 --> 01:46:54,014
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to voice my opinion here, but is there any way I could, uh, is there any suggestion from here that I could somehow get these people out of here?

1526
01:46:54,094 --> 01:46:57,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause they're not, they're no longer doing what I expect of them.

1527
01:47:00,401 --> 01:47:00,801
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1528
01:47:01,101 --> 01:47:08,305
[SPEAKER_46]: All I can offer you is that you can email me and I'll set up a conversation with you and we connect you with the city to see what resources the city can provide.

1529
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:21,733
[SPEAKER_46]: Gonna go to Mr Cassidy then Jessica Healy Mr Cassidy you have five minutes.

1530
01:47:24,793 --> 01:47:33,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been here in December when you set the tax rate, what the city assesses for at least 19 Decembers in a row.

1531
01:47:33,436 --> 01:47:36,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed once on purpose to see what you would do.

1532
01:47:36,757 --> 01:47:40,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Still the same results, seven to zero, they voted against it.

1533
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:52,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's about high noon time to adopt what they did in Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Chelsea, Cambridge,

1534
01:47:53,959 --> 01:47:58,021
[SPEAKER_11]: to adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

1535
01:47:59,782 --> 01:48:04,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is the real estate owner occupied exemption.

1536
01:48:04,684 --> 01:48:11,808
[SPEAKER_11]: If you live in the house, doesn't matter how many units, because it's only going to apply to your one unit, period.

1537
01:48:15,546 --> 01:48:24,815
[SPEAKER_11]: you would receive the owner occupied exemption, about 85% of owner occupied would receive a savings.

1538
01:48:25,355 --> 01:48:29,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of the usual, I'm getting $300, $400 every effing year.

1539
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:30,820
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

1540
01:48:31,221 --> 01:48:36,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So you, Councilor Beers, even said to the commissioner,

1541
01:48:38,055 --> 01:48:45,502
[SPEAKER_11]: of the real estate downstairs that we have to look at this in advance, like six months before, which is like May and June.

1542
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:51,667
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the time, as you said, we should investigate whether we should adopt this or not.

1543
01:48:52,227 --> 01:48:55,691
[SPEAKER_11]: At the full 35% exemption, or else don't even bother.

1544
01:48:56,391 --> 01:49:02,837
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people that are business people behind me, actually, that does not want this to happen.

1545
01:49:04,554 --> 01:49:15,301
[SPEAKER_11]: because they're absentee owners, maybe not slumlords, but they know on Christian Street, there's two or three, Winchester, Wellesley, et cetera.

1546
01:49:15,621 --> 01:49:21,004
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just collecting rents, two, three, $4,000 a month, depending on how many bedrooms there are.

1547
01:49:21,544 --> 01:49:30,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Every month it changes, and different cars come, no one knows where to park, not enough parking anyways.

1548
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,191
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know what color barrels to put out,

1549
01:49:33,777 --> 01:49:35,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, do I make sense?

1550
01:49:36,358 --> 01:49:37,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it you people with the problems?

1551
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:39,558
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1552
01:49:39,598 --> 01:49:41,899
[SPEAKER_46]: We definitely have had a lot of conversations about owner-occupied.

1553
01:49:42,339 --> 01:49:47,600
[SPEAKER_46]: I think you'd actually find that if we were to implement it, it would increase, it shifts the burden within the property tax levy.

1554
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:50,840
[SPEAKER_46]: It would actually increase the taxes on a lot of small multifamily homes.

1555
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:59,642
[SPEAKER_11]: What I just said was 85%, is my guesstimate, would save if they live in the house, period.

1556
01:50:00,622 --> 01:50:00,982
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1557
01:50:01,002 --> 01:50:03,283
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go to Jessica Healy on Zoom.

1558
01:50:05,168 --> 01:50:06,128
[SPEAKER_46]: name and address for the record.

1559
01:50:06,148 --> 01:50:09,729
[SPEAKER_24]: You have five minutes.

1560
01:50:10,689 --> 01:50:12,550
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to know.

1561
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,390
[SPEAKER_24]: I keep hearing that this is the beginning.

1562
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,650
[SPEAKER_24]: This is getting stages.

1563
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,751
[SPEAKER_24]: It's beginning phase.

1564
01:50:18,591 --> 01:50:22,732
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to know, and I'm sure everyone else would like to know what the end goal is.

1565
01:50:23,512 --> 01:50:25,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything that has beginning has an ending.

1566
01:50:26,192 --> 01:50:33,634
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's some reason that you're putting all these different motions into play because there's some

1567
01:50:34,392 --> 01:50:38,295
[SPEAKER_24]: and goal you have, and I'm not sure what that is.

1568
01:50:39,156 --> 01:50:41,057
[SPEAKER_24]: If anyone could explain that to me.

1569
01:50:42,658 --> 01:50:52,325
[SPEAKER_46]: Many of the policies we've been discussing are part of the city's comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing plan, which are available on the city website, and they include recommendations for council action.

1570
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:53,166
[SPEAKER_46]: This is one of them.

1571
01:50:54,286 --> 01:50:57,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so the housing and climate plan, okay.

1572
01:50:57,849 --> 01:51:00,651
[SPEAKER_46]: And comprehensive plan as well, the citywide comprehensive.

1573
01:51:01,052 --> 01:51:10,857
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, well, I'll have to look into those plans that you guys have set up, because apparently, from the different meetings I've been watching, not many people love these plans that you're putting forward.

1574
01:51:12,057 --> 01:51:26,445
[SPEAKER_24]: I also just have to state that, like another gentleman stated that was just up there, watching this meeting and the snickering and the remarks that are stated back to people and the laughing,

1575
01:51:27,435 --> 01:51:55,584
[SPEAKER_24]: It comes off very condescending and very arrogant And that is not what we elected you guys to be and to act And I don't know if you notice you're getting this negative feedback Due to the way that you behave in your mannerisms the way you speak to others The looks you give it's just No one wants to hear that when they're expressing

1576
01:51:57,324 --> 01:51:58,745
[SPEAKER_24]: issues that they're having.

1577
01:51:58,765 --> 01:52:09,012
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm understanding, because I know, like they said, the vote's gonna be 6-1, it's gonna go through, and you know that.

1578
01:52:10,072 --> 01:52:13,454
[SPEAKER_24]: You're just basically sitting here listening to us because you have to.

1579
01:52:13,815 --> 01:52:15,736
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to have public participation.

1580
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:24,121
[SPEAKER_24]: If you did not legally have to have it, you would be fine and you would pass everything through and you would not listen to us at all.

1581
01:52:25,222 --> 01:52:26,643
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to say that

1582
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,101
[SPEAKER_24]: you need to show respect to gain it.

1583
01:52:32,562 --> 01:52:35,004
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate your time, Mr. President.

1584
01:52:35,984 --> 01:52:36,405
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1585
01:52:36,545 --> 01:52:42,769
[SPEAKER_46]: And I would just, the clerk has noted to me that Massachusetts general does not require public body, step public participation.

1586
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:44,550
[SPEAKER_46]: It is something that we choose to do.

1587
01:52:49,993 --> 01:52:51,074
[SPEAKER_46]: All right.

1588
01:52:51,094 --> 01:52:52,034
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record.

1589
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:11,625
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I believe that you may have a you may feel that you have everyone's best interest, the city.

1590
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:17,946
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think your focus is maybe the other things are out of your control.

1591
01:53:18,246 --> 01:53:24,371
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why you're focusing on these little things like getting the homeowners names and addresses.

1592
01:53:24,391 --> 01:53:26,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because you already have that.

1593
01:53:27,374 --> 01:53:30,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, what would you try and do?

1594
01:53:30,277 --> 01:53:36,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Try and find out what we charge for rent because that's against the law and you can't do that, okay?

1595
01:53:37,223 --> 01:53:38,824
[SPEAKER_13]: That is between me and the IRS.

1596
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:40,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1597
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:42,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like asking me how much I make.

1598
01:53:42,613 --> 01:53:43,714
[SPEAKER_13]: That's none of your business.

1599
01:53:44,154 --> 01:53:47,097
[SPEAKER_13]: You can request that, but you can't demand it from me.

1600
01:53:47,637 --> 01:53:47,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1601
01:53:48,438 --> 01:53:51,040
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are things that maybe you can request from us.

1602
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:51,941
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's okay.

1603
01:53:52,381 --> 01:53:55,805
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to send something out and request it and volunteer,

1604
01:53:57,264 --> 01:53:57,785
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

1605
01:53:58,065 --> 01:54:01,209
[SPEAKER_13]: If people want to volunteer that information, that's all well and good.

1606
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:05,094
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is a democracy, and I stand by that.

1607
01:54:05,855 --> 01:54:07,557
[SPEAKER_13]: We live in a democracy.

1608
01:54:08,278 --> 01:54:12,283
[SPEAKER_13]: And with a democracy, you can't dictate these things to us.

1609
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:13,484
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not fair.

1610
01:54:14,686 --> 01:54:15,607
[SPEAKER_13]: And that becomes

1611
01:54:16,775 --> 01:54:19,677
[SPEAKER_13]: communist, which I'm not accusing you of.

1612
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:20,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1613
01:54:21,379 --> 01:54:21,719
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1614
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:23,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not accusing you of that.

1615
01:54:24,081 --> 01:54:25,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And it becomes a dictatorship.

1616
01:54:26,322 --> 01:54:28,784
[SPEAKER_13]: That's against our democracy.

1617
01:54:29,045 --> 01:54:31,647
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what the United States of America stands for.

1618
01:54:32,287 --> 01:54:34,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so now we get past that.

1619
01:54:34,969 --> 01:54:38,392
[SPEAKER_13]: There are other things in this city that you could really help us with.

1620
01:54:39,704 --> 01:54:40,564
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the high school?

1621
01:54:41,365 --> 01:54:42,305
[SPEAKER_13]: That's deplorable.

1622
01:54:43,106 --> 01:54:44,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Those students are there.

1623
01:54:44,327 --> 01:54:47,468
[SPEAKER_13]: My granddaughter goes to the high school at the daycare there.

1624
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:49,990
[SPEAKER_13]: That place is a mess.

1625
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:53,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Even the street getting up the hill is a mess.

1626
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:55,573
[SPEAKER_13]: These students deserve more.

1627
01:54:55,873 --> 01:55:01,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are you focusing on landlords and tenants when children are at stake?

1628
01:55:02,196 --> 01:55:02,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

1629
01:55:03,657 --> 01:55:04,718
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our focus.

1630
01:55:04,958 --> 01:55:05,858
[SPEAKER_13]: These young children.

1631
01:55:05,898 --> 01:55:06,719
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the elderly?

1632
01:55:07,677 --> 01:55:08,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we focusing on them?

1633
01:55:08,878 --> 01:55:09,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the helpless.

1634
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:11,319
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not helpless.

1635
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Tenants aren't helpless, okay?

1636
01:55:14,081 --> 01:55:15,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they have resources.

1637
01:55:16,462 --> 01:55:17,703
[SPEAKER_13]: They do have resources.

1638
01:55:18,163 --> 01:55:26,068
[SPEAKER_13]: In a mailing, as this other woman had suggested, send out a mailing, put it on, give the resources.

1639
01:55:26,588 --> 01:55:27,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just beside myself.

1640
01:55:27,929 --> 01:55:30,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just flabbergasted with what's happening here.

1641
01:55:31,531 --> 01:55:32,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do believe

1642
01:55:34,107 --> 01:55:39,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Council has in best interest trying to get some information.

1643
01:55:39,971 --> 01:55:43,173
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe the high school is out of your control.

1644
01:55:43,213 --> 01:55:47,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe everything is out of your, and it's above you, and you don't know how to handle it.

1645
01:55:47,656 --> 01:55:53,099
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're focusing on this minute stuff because that's exactly what it is.

1646
01:55:53,559 --> 01:55:54,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Focus on the important stuff.

1647
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:55,861
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you can do.

1648
01:55:56,901 --> 01:55:58,482
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you're in charge of here.

1649
01:55:59,003 --> 01:56:00,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Get our schools in order.

1650
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:06,503
[SPEAKER_13]: help our teachers, help our police department, help our firemen.

1651
01:56:07,824 --> 01:56:14,148
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you can do and you will be proud and you will have our support.

1652
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me tell you something, I will support you, okay?

1653
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:20,331
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've lived here my entire life.

1654
01:56:21,772 --> 01:56:22,633
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we need.

1655
01:56:22,713 --> 01:56:27,296
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a council that's gonna be here for the city.

1656
01:56:27,976 --> 01:56:28,917
[SPEAKER_13]: This rental stuff,

1657
01:56:30,253 --> 01:56:32,454
[SPEAKER_13]: It's minor, it's minor.

1658
01:56:32,954 --> 01:56:37,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Our children and our city and bring in revenue.

1659
01:56:37,477 --> 01:56:40,098
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so much revenue you can bring in.

1660
01:56:40,478 --> 01:56:41,419
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you can do.

1661
01:56:41,979 --> 01:56:46,061
[SPEAKER_13]: And you will go down in history in the city of Medford as being a great city council.

1662
01:56:46,341 --> 01:56:49,803
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, people are mocking you and laughing at you.

1663
01:56:50,363 --> 01:56:54,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people from other cities that are mocking us and making fun of us.

1664
01:56:55,342 --> 01:56:58,364
[SPEAKER_13]: saying, who was running your city council?

1665
01:56:59,005 --> 01:56:59,945
[SPEAKER_13]: It's embarrassing.

1666
01:57:00,466 --> 01:57:02,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you're all intelligent.

1667
01:57:02,287 --> 01:57:04,629
[SPEAKER_13]: You're very well-educated, every one of you.

1668
01:57:05,609 --> 01:57:07,771
[SPEAKER_13]: So I expect more from you.

1669
01:57:08,311 --> 01:57:13,755
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I, and I won't look at who I met, and we talked, very well-educated young man.

1670
01:57:14,216 --> 01:57:15,877
[SPEAKER_13]: And I expected more.

1671
01:57:15,957 --> 01:57:18,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do believe that he can give us more.

1672
01:57:19,639 --> 01:57:20,840
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I'm hoping for.

1673
01:57:22,081 --> 01:57:22,662
[SPEAKER_13]: So please,

1674
01:57:23,732 --> 01:57:34,240
[SPEAKER_13]: stand down on this minute rental crap and let's get together and let's make the city a strong community.

1675
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:40,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you really have the knowledge, first of all, you have the education to do it.

1676
01:57:40,945 --> 01:57:42,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's pull it together and try.

1677
01:57:42,666 --> 01:57:43,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1678
01:57:43,206 --> 01:57:43,587
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1679
01:57:48,075 --> 01:57:49,095
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1680
01:57:49,115 --> 01:57:50,096
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

1681
01:57:50,116 --> 01:57:55,378
[SPEAKER_21]: Patrick Kearse, 178 Woburn Street, resident of Medford for over 50 years.

1682
01:57:56,438 --> 01:58:07,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Just listening to all the people tonight, I understand you're going to vote this through to go to committee, but maybe you should come to the people and have more of a outline of what you want to do.

1683
01:58:07,703 --> 01:58:09,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Then you're not going to have 3000 people up here.

1684
01:58:11,064 --> 01:58:12,545
[SPEAKER_21]: that you're not really going to listen to.

1685
01:58:13,025 --> 01:58:14,746
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's what I'm going to say next.

1686
01:58:14,906 --> 01:58:18,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Lady two before us said, yes, you're listening to us.

1687
01:58:18,908 --> 01:58:21,789
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm afraid you guys are not hearing us.

1688
01:58:22,469 --> 01:58:25,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're happy to sit down and talk with any one of you.

1689
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:29,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we've been here so long.

1690
01:58:30,573 --> 01:58:31,954
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think that's the problem.

1691
01:58:32,714 --> 01:58:35,015
[SPEAKER_21]: You're listening, but you're not hearing us.

1692
01:58:36,036 --> 01:58:36,316
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1693
01:58:40,026 --> 01:58:41,768
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Maureen on Zoom.

1694
01:58:41,788 --> 01:58:43,289
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1695
01:58:43,329 --> 01:58:44,250
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

1696
01:58:46,732 --> 01:58:47,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1697
01:58:47,152 --> 01:58:47,593
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rose.

1698
01:58:47,633 --> 01:58:49,754
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to Maureen on Zoom for five minutes.

1699
01:58:50,135 --> 01:58:50,715
[SPEAKER_50]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1700
01:58:51,156 --> 01:58:51,536
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1701
01:58:52,177 --> 01:58:59,163
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you, President Beers and city council members for allowing me to participate in this important discussion.

1702
01:58:59,183 --> 01:59:02,566
[SPEAKER_50]: I want to reiterate without

1703
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:09,304
[SPEAKER_50]: going over old rope about everything that previous speakers have said.

1704
01:59:10,184 --> 01:59:13,985
[SPEAKER_50]: But focus on a couple of points that they made.

1705
01:59:14,585 --> 01:59:20,407
[SPEAKER_50]: Number one, a gentleman spoke about putting together a bill and putting on a ballot.

1706
01:59:21,047 --> 01:59:30,949
[SPEAKER_50]: And that's an excellent idea because there are six people representing the entire city of Medford, some of whom aren't homeowners,

1707
01:59:31,409 --> 01:59:38,371
[SPEAKER_50]: some of whom haven't been long time residents and haven't made a huge investment in the city.

1708
01:59:38,951 --> 01:59:46,733
[SPEAKER_50]: So I think that's a democratic way to go, is to go ahead and put together something to put on the ballot.

1709
01:59:48,413 --> 01:59:57,516
[SPEAKER_50]: Second of all, touching upon the issue of being able to contact homeowners, I was personally

1710
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:18,188
[SPEAKER_50]: As a resident and as an American citizen, Democrat, offended by a notification I received in the mail, I received two of them, the last one being a notification about changing water meters.

1711
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:34,447
[SPEAKER_50]: Okay, and in that it said final notice, and if you do not comply with this ordinance, then we have the right to shut off your water.

1712
02:00:35,387 --> 02:00:59,744
[SPEAKER_50]: Well, I don't know who navigated and orchestrated that letter, but if they were to look at state laws and take legal input, it is illegal in the state of Massachusetts for anyone to interrupt water services to a property.

1713
02:01:00,524 --> 02:01:05,613
[SPEAKER_50]: It's a health and safety law, and it's against health and safety.

1714
02:01:06,194 --> 02:01:13,907
[SPEAKER_50]: Every home in the state of Massachusetts is required to have water and sewer working.

1715
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:20,142
[SPEAKER_50]: So you cannot threaten residents that you will cut off their water.

1716
02:01:20,743 --> 02:01:35,330
[SPEAKER_50]: If they're multiple dwelling residents, then you're not only cutting off the water to the home of the owner, you're cutting it off to the renter's properties as well.

1717
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:37,931
[SPEAKER_50]: The owner has to pay for that water.

1718
02:01:38,832 --> 02:01:42,734
[SPEAKER_50]: If you can't reach the owner, which is apparent that you can,

1719
02:01:44,585 --> 02:01:50,470
[SPEAKER_50]: then it's against the law to threaten somebody you will cut off their water and sewage system.

1720
02:01:51,752 --> 02:02:02,922
[SPEAKER_50]: Again, I would love to support the current city council members, but again, I have to, you know, go back and support my fellow citizens and residents of Medford.

1721
02:02:03,723 --> 02:02:05,104
[SPEAKER_50]: I've lived here for over 34 years.

1722
02:02:07,426 --> 02:02:08,747
[SPEAKER_50]: I brought my son up here.

1723
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:11,549
[SPEAKER_50]: He went to Medford Public Schools.

1724
02:02:12,069 --> 02:02:14,770
[SPEAKER_50]: He participated in all the Medford sports.

1725
02:02:16,051 --> 02:02:18,513
[SPEAKER_50]: I worked on committees on these sports.

1726
02:02:19,053 --> 02:02:26,017
[SPEAKER_50]: I was a primary fundraiser for the Medford Pop Warner and Medford.

1727
02:02:29,565 --> 02:02:30,946
[SPEAKER_50]: North Medford Little League.

1728
02:02:31,807 --> 02:02:33,889
[SPEAKER_50]: And, you know, I love this city.

1729
02:02:33,909 --> 02:02:36,111
[SPEAKER_50]: There's a lot of people that love this city.

1730
02:02:36,131 --> 02:02:38,252
[SPEAKER_50]: And let's make it better.

1731
02:02:38,713 --> 02:02:41,475
[SPEAKER_50]: Let's talk about making America better.

1732
02:02:41,515 --> 02:02:42,956
[SPEAKER_50]: Let's make Medford better.

1733
02:02:43,977 --> 02:02:45,699
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you for allowing me to participate.

1734
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:47,720
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Maureen.

1735
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:50,703
[SPEAKER_46]: Maureen, can we get your name and address for the record?

1736
02:02:51,103 --> 02:02:51,824
[SPEAKER_50]: Say again, please.

1737
02:02:52,779 --> 02:02:54,360
[SPEAKER_46]: get your name and address for the record, please.

1738
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:55,982
[SPEAKER_50]: My name is Maureen Donovan.

1739
02:02:56,162 --> 02:03:03,328
[SPEAKER_50]: I live at 55 Ellsworth Street, North Medford, and I've been a homeowner here for 34 years.

1740
02:03:04,188 --> 02:03:05,229
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much, Maureen.

1741
02:03:12,035 --> 02:03:13,856
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comment on this agenda item?

1742
02:03:17,459 --> 02:03:18,700
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1743
02:03:23,057 --> 02:03:42,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to make a statement about how I think that some of our intentions are to bring ideas to the floor in a regular meeting with the intention of then discussing them further in committee, which committee meetings are also public meetings open to everyone.

1744
02:03:42,895 --> 02:03:46,598
[SPEAKER_14]: And the idea there is there's just one agenda item that we can talk about more fully.

1745
02:03:47,774 --> 02:03:56,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that what may be happening is that it's breeding uncertainty and confusion, which then makes people worried.

1746
02:03:57,842 --> 02:04:03,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And for that reason, I'm not comfortable moving forward with this agenda, with this item tonight.

1747
02:04:11,187 --> 02:04:18,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we're in an open meeting right now, I'm comfortable speaking with the whole committee about this because we're allowed to all meet together.

1748
02:04:18,831 --> 02:04:21,413
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not usually allowed to all speak together.

1749
02:04:21,533 --> 02:04:25,095
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really difficult for us to kind of have these strategizing meetings.

1750
02:04:25,195 --> 02:04:33,099
[SPEAKER_14]: But something that we have spoken about is like, let's introduce something that we know would be something that maybe we've spoken about in our

1751
02:04:33,649 --> 02:04:36,071
[SPEAKER_14]: campaigns or it's something that's a priority of ours.

1752
02:04:36,231 --> 02:04:39,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And we will start the conversation and then we'll move it to committee.

1753
02:04:39,414 --> 02:04:52,604
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we have committee meetings, it will be, we'll have more time to discuss things and we'll be able to hammer out the details without having private conversations that violate open meeting law, which is illegal.

1754
02:04:53,465 --> 02:04:54,246
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't wanna do that.

1755
02:04:54,446 --> 02:05:01,872
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I think is happening by accident is we're drumming up fear in our community.

1756
02:05:04,554 --> 02:05:18,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I think maybe what might be a better move for some things going forward would be to have a really clear objective that we can bring to regular meetings and then maybe amend on the floor or something like that.

1757
02:05:18,663 --> 02:05:19,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a thought.

1758
02:05:20,384 --> 02:05:22,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't feel comfortable moving this to committee personally.

1759
02:05:22,886 --> 02:05:28,009
[SPEAKER_39]: Not per se.

1760
02:05:28,029 --> 02:05:31,892
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

1761
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:33,440
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1762
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:50,307
[SPEAKER_29]: I respect my colleagues viewpoint, I think that I think what you're saying actually is in a bigger scheme, you know, we have, we should rethink how we, you know, when we have items introduced on the agenda, we send them to committee.

1763
02:05:50,747 --> 02:05:53,308
[SPEAKER_29]: This is how other municipalities in the state do it.

1764
02:05:53,969 --> 02:05:56,490
[SPEAKER_29]: If there are other avenues to just, you know, send it.

1765
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:03,196
[SPEAKER_29]: to committee have a developed proposal before we create, you know, before we introduce it bring us to the regular meeting.

1766
02:06:03,216 --> 02:06:11,505
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that would be appropriate but I think that's something for us to investigate down the line, I would disagree on the conclusion with my fellow counselor.

1767
02:06:11,865 --> 02:06:19,073
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, I have been listening and taking a lot of notes during this during the last few, the last

1768
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:20,534
[SPEAKER_29]: comments.

1769
02:06:21,135 --> 02:06:24,176
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think there are a few buckets of questions for us.

1770
02:06:24,236 --> 02:06:26,337
[SPEAKER_29]: And I, you know, I think we do have the answers for them.

1771
02:06:27,238 --> 02:06:40,425
[SPEAKER_29]: I think on the question of privacy, as Councillor Callahan has stated, as is done in municipalities around the state, we wouldn't ask for tenant information that's just not done in other states or in other cities.

1772
02:06:40,985 --> 02:06:41,125
[SPEAKER_29]: The

1773
02:06:42,526 --> 02:06:46,488
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's an example of what information is collected usually.

1774
02:06:47,228 --> 02:07:09,598
[SPEAKER_29]: Contact information for the property owner, property manager, number of units you're registering, and number of units at the property, dates of buying property, because there are certain laws that exempt properties because of age, and the city wouldn't want to overcharge landlords, and some fire code related items.

1775
02:07:10,805 --> 02:07:11,186
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all.

1776
02:07:11,507 --> 02:07:12,410
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1777
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:13,693
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what's usually collected.

1778
02:07:15,799 --> 02:07:17,645
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think, you know...

1779
02:07:19,045 --> 02:07:26,009
[SPEAKER_29]: There's there's some questions another bucket of questions is, why do we need to collect this information, why do we need to create this registry.

1780
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:32,694
[SPEAKER_29]: Right now, you know, given that we might have some information but I think that's the point is we only have some of this information.

1781
02:07:33,434 --> 02:07:45,482
[SPEAKER_29]: There are a lot of their landlords in the city who they might own property but that property is registered under their spouse's name right because their spouse about that property or their spouse was was a primary sign on that.

1782
02:07:46,002 --> 02:07:51,803
[SPEAKER_29]: And we wouldn't be able to tell if that's a primary residence or a secondary property.

1783
02:07:52,704 --> 02:07:53,904
[SPEAKER_29]: There are a lot of cases like that.

1784
02:07:53,924 --> 02:08:04,166
[SPEAKER_29]: There are also just more generally cases where we can't tell based on the tax bill whether it's owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, whether it's a primary or secondary residence.

1785
02:08:05,106 --> 02:08:07,467
[SPEAKER_29]: And this would help us identify a lot of that.

1786
02:08:09,327 --> 02:08:11,068
[SPEAKER_29]: I will say another...

1787
02:08:14,255 --> 02:08:27,781
[SPEAKER_29]: Another reason that I think we need to, another question about the functionality, about the feasibility of this that we should correct the record on is whether this is legal or not.

1788
02:08:27,841 --> 02:08:31,483
[SPEAKER_29]: This is very clearly legal, done in many municipalities around the state.

1789
02:08:32,103 --> 02:08:35,325
[SPEAKER_29]: And there are legal, we can create legal methods to have

1790
02:08:36,565 --> 02:08:37,926
[SPEAKER_29]: people register.

1791
02:08:37,946 --> 02:08:47,530
[SPEAKER_29]: Now that answers the question of, you know, when you have these already, you have these landlords that aren't responding yet, how can we expect them to participate, we can use legal methods.

1792
02:08:48,891 --> 02:08:55,754
[SPEAKER_29]: Now the last, I think the last bucket is less about the policy itself, and more about this idea of listening and sympathy.

1793
02:08:56,134 --> 02:08:57,995
[SPEAKER_29]: And I actually do have sympathy for landlords.

1794
02:08:58,035 --> 02:09:01,437
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I close family members who are small landlords,

1795
02:09:02,077 --> 02:09:06,878
[SPEAKER_29]: And when I put myself in their shoes, I want them to know about the rebates and the tax credits they can get.

1796
02:09:07,638 --> 02:09:14,339
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's something that, given how they're registered on the tax bill right now, the city doesn't know that they're landlords.

1797
02:09:14,459 --> 02:09:24,061
[SPEAKER_29]: And they don't have a problem with the city knowing that they're a landlord, but because the city doesn't know that they're a landlord, they can't get that information about rebates and tax credits and subsidies.

1798
02:09:24,701 --> 02:09:27,461
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I think for that reason, I would move the question.

1799
02:09:27,481 --> 02:09:30,402
[SPEAKER_29]: For all those reasons, I would move the question.

1800
02:09:30,882 --> 02:09:40,577
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of councilor second refers the committee on planning and permitting seconded by seconded by council vice president cons counselor lemming just counselor lemming

1801
02:09:41,308 --> 02:09:48,691
[SPEAKER_31]: Just on another one of the points that was sort of brought up and some of the public discussion I would like to point out.

1802
02:09:49,692 --> 02:09:53,913
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll just talk a little bit about the back end of some of this stuff I have.

1803
02:09:54,754 --> 02:10:00,996
[SPEAKER_31]: I know that people do tend to send a lot of emails to council members sometimes they're not.

1804
02:10:01,417 --> 02:10:04,658
[SPEAKER_31]: Sometimes I'm not able to reply to all of them, especially if they're on some of these

1805
02:10:05,018 --> 02:10:06,059
[SPEAKER_31]: hot button issues.

1806
02:10:06,739 --> 02:10:08,280
[SPEAKER_31]: Some of them slipped through the cracks.

1807
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,121
[SPEAKER_31]: I apologize.

1808
02:10:09,781 --> 02:10:24,231
[SPEAKER_31]: I've, excuse me, I've had, I had one experience recently in an email where a woman sent us an email about the transfer fee, and I asked if she wanted to talk on the phone about it.

1809
02:10:24,861 --> 02:10:26,622
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, just I've never met her before.

1810
02:10:26,642 --> 02:10:30,425
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't even know what she looked like, but I wanted to talk with her on the phone about it.

1811
02:10:30,845 --> 02:10:31,706
[SPEAKER_31]: And she refused.

1812
02:10:32,627 --> 02:10:37,270
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know how to build bridges in a community when people refuse to even talk to me.

1813
02:10:43,715 --> 02:10:44,756
[SPEAKER_47]: Please be silent.

1814
02:10:44,776 --> 02:10:45,096
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1815
02:10:53,873 --> 02:10:54,834
[SPEAKER_46]: I am the council president.

1816
02:10:54,854 --> 02:10:55,174
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1817
02:10:55,194 --> 02:10:57,614
[SPEAKER_46]: Do you have any more to say, Matt?

1818
02:10:58,995 --> 02:10:59,195
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

1819
02:10:59,775 --> 02:11:00,155
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1820
02:11:00,195 --> 02:11:00,996
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1821
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:14,620
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1822
02:11:14,941 --> 02:11:18,842
[SPEAKER_38]: What I'm thinking, some of the things my fellow councils aren't understanding is

1823
02:11:21,001 --> 02:11:28,783
[SPEAKER_38]: The dialogue that started in January and the presentations that we've been putting forward is dividing our community.

1824
02:11:30,663 --> 02:11:37,485
[SPEAKER_38]: And what you're not listening, what you're not understanding is you have to win the trust of people for them to talk to you.

1825
02:11:38,965 --> 02:11:42,706
[SPEAKER_38]: Let me give you some hints.

1826
02:11:43,626 --> 02:11:45,747
[SPEAKER_38]: When my fellow counselors mentioned that

1827
02:11:46,786 --> 02:11:48,908
[SPEAKER_38]: There's 7,500 people voted for them.

1828
02:11:49,368 --> 02:11:50,789
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's what they're gonna support.

1829
02:11:51,590 --> 02:11:52,491
[SPEAKER_38]: That's wrong message.

1830
02:11:52,951 --> 02:11:58,296
[SPEAKER_38]: The 7,500 people, they got you elected, but you have to work for 60,000 people.

1831
02:11:59,477 --> 02:12:11,467
[SPEAKER_38]: And so the dialogue that has been going on since we started here, and it's gonna continue with the next resolution, is that we're hurting our community.

1832
02:12:12,127 --> 02:12:13,528
[SPEAKER_38]: We're dividing our community.

1833
02:12:14,511 --> 02:12:15,712
[SPEAKER_38]: Our city isn't good.

1834
02:12:16,533 --> 02:12:17,654
[SPEAKER_38]: Our city is a mess.

1835
02:12:18,995 --> 02:12:21,657
[SPEAKER_38]: And the dialogue that we're spending is attacking who?

1836
02:12:22,578 --> 02:12:23,299
[SPEAKER_38]: Homeowners.

1837
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,863
[SPEAKER_38]: Everything we've done so far, nothing of substance.

1838
02:12:28,203 --> 02:12:30,045
[SPEAKER_38]: We could talk about having subcommittees.

1839
02:12:30,385 --> 02:12:32,187
[SPEAKER_38]: We could talk about all these meetings we're having.

1840
02:12:32,527 --> 02:12:33,408
[SPEAKER_38]: We've got nothing.

1841
02:12:33,448 --> 02:12:34,349
[SPEAKER_38]: We've had nothing done.

1842
02:12:35,683 --> 02:12:40,944
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think what we're not understanding is what people are saying, maybe because they can't talk to me, maybe because people are reaching.

1843
02:12:41,184 --> 02:12:47,145
[SPEAKER_38]: And here's the thing, it's now by the hundreds, and it's people that normally don't come to this podium, you see them tonight.

1844
02:12:49,926 --> 02:12:56,507
[SPEAKER_38]: Whatever you're trying to do, whatever agenda you're trying to pull out, you're hurting people, you're dividing the community.

1845
02:12:58,187 --> 02:13:01,648
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's gonna go on, with everything else that we have tonight, we're gonna see that.

1846
02:13:03,956 --> 02:13:11,900
[SPEAKER_38]: You're trying to justify, I respect you more than anything in the world, all of you, but you're trying to justify things, but you're not looking at the human factor here.

1847
02:13:13,201 --> 02:13:16,643
[SPEAKER_38]: People aren't talking to you, because people don't trust you, Councilor Lemmie.

1848
02:13:17,423 --> 02:13:18,424
[SPEAKER_38]: You haven't earned it yet.

1849
02:13:27,991 --> 02:13:33,441
[SPEAKER_38]: What I'm hearing is, what I'm hearing from a lot of people, I'm hearing a lot of hurt.

1850
02:13:33,881 --> 02:13:37,167
[SPEAKER_38]: People are hurting because you're attacking them.

1851
02:13:38,564 --> 02:13:40,905
[SPEAKER_38]: So what have we been talking about?

1852
02:13:41,686 --> 02:13:42,706
[SPEAKER_38]: What is it we've been working on?

1853
02:13:43,307 --> 02:13:44,407
[SPEAKER_38]: What is the lesson so far?

1854
02:13:44,747 --> 02:13:46,128
[SPEAKER_38]: We've talked about rent control.

1855
02:13:46,388 --> 02:13:47,609
[SPEAKER_38]: We've talked about a tax.

1856
02:13:47,929 --> 02:13:50,010
[SPEAKER_38]: We've talked about a registry.

1857
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:52,072
[SPEAKER_38]: We've talked about how the firefighters are hurting.

1858
02:13:52,852 --> 02:13:56,574
[SPEAKER_38]: We've done nothing yet for what the city needs, and the mayor's loving it.

1859
02:13:57,795 --> 02:13:59,636
[SPEAKER_38]: The mayor has done nothing for this community.

1860
02:14:00,296 --> 02:14:01,537
[SPEAKER_38]: We're five years into this.

1861
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:16,819
[SPEAKER_38]: And no matter what happens, this council, I've been around the council 18 years now, whether it's school committee, city council, we've made sure we've at least been the voice so people can, they can come and talk to us because no one's listening.

1862
02:14:18,219 --> 02:14:19,180
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what they're saying.

1863
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:21,380
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what everybody's saying.

1864
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,981
[SPEAKER_38]: The undertone here, is it really about a registry?

1865
02:14:25,462 --> 02:14:25,742
[SPEAKER_38]: No.

1866
02:14:27,406 --> 02:14:30,528
[SPEAKER_38]: Please, it gets out of control.

1867
02:14:30,548 --> 02:14:32,929
[SPEAKER_38]: Listen, I don't like the fact that people yell out.

1868
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:36,251
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it's just a poor way to get things through.

1869
02:14:36,272 --> 02:14:36,952
[SPEAKER_38]: But here's the thing.

1870
02:14:37,973 --> 02:14:39,213
[SPEAKER_38]: Right now, that's how they feel.

1871
02:14:39,253 --> 02:14:40,034
[SPEAKER_38]: They're angry.

1872
02:14:43,136 --> 02:14:45,617
[SPEAKER_38]: And maybe some of you don't know, because I don't want to bring this up.

1873
02:14:45,897 --> 02:14:48,559
[SPEAKER_38]: It doesn't matter if you lived here a day or 50 years.

1874
02:14:48,599 --> 02:14:49,440
[SPEAKER_38]: I hate to hear that.

1875
02:14:50,606 --> 02:14:52,807
[SPEAKER_38]: Because everybody, everybody's a method Mustang.

1876
02:14:52,847 --> 02:14:54,288
[SPEAKER_38]: Everybody's a family in this community.

1877
02:14:54,688 --> 02:14:58,510
[SPEAKER_38]: But right now we're doing nothing but dividing, trying to find a way to deceive and divide.

1878
02:15:01,311 --> 02:15:02,792
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't even see it, but it's happening.

1879
02:15:02,832 --> 02:15:04,353
[SPEAKER_38]: She's usually as a marionette.

1880
02:15:04,373 --> 02:15:05,694
[SPEAKER_38]: She's like with puppets.

1881
02:15:07,414 --> 02:15:10,176
[SPEAKER_38]: With everything's going on in the city, the city's a mess and people aren't happy.

1882
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,777
[SPEAKER_38]: And we're talking about registries.

1883
02:15:13,217 --> 02:15:15,098
[SPEAKER_38]: This is what we're saying, people are hurting.

1884
02:15:15,999 --> 02:15:17,399
[SPEAKER_38]: This Mia doesn't care.

1885
02:15:17,419 --> 02:15:19,621
[SPEAKER_38]: And she's using us as pawns.

1886
02:15:23,137 --> 02:15:28,380
[SPEAKER_38]: So believe me, publicly, I'm going to tell you this.

1887
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:33,482
[SPEAKER_38]: I despise the fact that it's George Scott Pelley against the rest of the world.

1888
02:15:33,903 --> 02:15:34,783
[SPEAKER_38]: I hate that.

1889
02:15:34,803 --> 02:15:36,184
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't want that.

1890
02:15:36,464 --> 02:15:38,725
[SPEAKER_38]: I want the seven of us to do great things together.

1891
02:15:39,426 --> 02:15:40,106
[SPEAKER_38]: I really do.

1892
02:15:41,066 --> 02:15:41,567
[SPEAKER_38]: And we have.

1893
02:15:42,631 --> 02:15:45,433
[SPEAKER_38]: No, people can talk negatively about you, Zach.

1894
02:15:45,473 --> 02:15:46,714
[SPEAKER_38]: We have done some great things.

1895
02:15:47,355 --> 02:15:48,756
[SPEAKER_38]: We have done some great things together.

1896
02:15:49,596 --> 02:15:55,301
[SPEAKER_38]: But it's all being overshadowed now by dividing, picking and choosing my group and your group.

1897
02:15:56,462 --> 02:16:00,004
[SPEAKER_38]: And things are going to come out tonight that's going to prove to that it's going to show to it.

1898
02:16:00,545 --> 02:16:02,066
[SPEAKER_38]: Look what she's done to the fighting department.

1899
02:16:02,647 --> 02:16:04,108
[SPEAKER_38]: Look what she's done to this council with that.

1900
02:16:05,472 --> 02:16:09,413
[SPEAKER_38]: So again, this is just another piece that's dividing this community.

1901
02:16:09,493 --> 02:16:19,254
[SPEAKER_38]: And Councilor Lemmon, you're an educated person, you're involved, appreciate that you ran, but you have to understand, people here are hurting.

1902
02:16:20,375 --> 02:16:21,275
[SPEAKER_38]: This city is hurting.

1903
02:16:21,295 --> 02:16:25,275
[SPEAKER_38]: This city, whether you wanna believe it or not, is divided more than I've ever seen in my life.

1904
02:16:26,035 --> 02:16:31,216
[SPEAKER_38]: And we could put a dog and pony show and put lipstick on a pig, and we could do little parades and think that's great.

1905
02:16:31,916 --> 02:16:33,197
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not hitting everybody.

1906
02:16:33,377 --> 02:16:34,637
[SPEAKER_38]: We represent everybody.

1907
02:16:36,001 --> 02:16:39,784
[SPEAKER_38]: whether you like me or not, I'm still gonna fight for people that don't like me.

1908
02:16:42,907 --> 02:16:43,427
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1909
02:16:47,331 --> 02:16:48,051
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

1910
02:16:54,857 --> 02:16:56,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear everybody here.

1911
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:03,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think what I'm struggling with is that

1912
02:17:04,702 --> 02:17:18,855
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding of how we work on policies is we bring a suggestion for something that we might pass in a year or two years or six months or whatever, we bring it here to get it a number.

1913
02:17:20,436 --> 02:17:28,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, any policy, whatever policy that is, it is by definition, it is not totally worked out.

1914
02:17:30,043 --> 02:17:35,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Not all of the answers are there, because this is how we create policy.

1915
02:17:35,264 --> 02:17:39,426
[SPEAKER_15]: We create policy by giving it a number, and then by sending it through a process.

1916
02:17:39,466 --> 02:17:43,487
[SPEAKER_15]: And that process, and tell me if I'm wrong, please.

1917
02:17:43,547 --> 02:17:47,868
[SPEAKER_15]: That process involves three public hearings, right?

1918
02:17:47,908 --> 02:17:52,069
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to go through first reading, second reading, third, something like that, after it's been written.

1919
02:17:53,633 --> 02:17:54,614
[SPEAKER_46]: after all the committee meetings.

1920
02:17:54,854 --> 02:17:59,676
[SPEAKER_15]: After all of the committee meetings, it involves three times that it has to appear before the city council.

1921
02:18:00,677 --> 02:18:14,424
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's when the answer, when all of the questions, when it's been worked through with the staff, with, you know, in committee with the public, with, you know, whatever sort of listening sessions and other things that we do.

1922
02:18:15,104 --> 02:18:17,346
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'm struggling with is,

1923
02:18:18,206 --> 02:18:23,068
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're bringing things here to give it a number.

1924
02:18:23,188 --> 02:18:32,473
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that does is it allows us to then begin the process of discussing it publicly where everyone is welcome for many months.

1925
02:18:32,993 --> 02:18:40,697
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think for the, like the leaf blower ordinance, we had eight or nine, was it nine public meetings about it?

1926
02:18:41,317 --> 02:18:43,378
[SPEAKER_46]: Leaf blower was five, budget was seven.

1927
02:18:44,844 --> 02:18:49,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that we had the eighth leaf blower like public swap but we had a lot of meetings.

1928
02:18:49,928 --> 02:18:50,128
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah.

1929
02:18:50,608 --> 02:18:57,513
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I think what I'm trying to say is, this is the second time since I've been a city council which is like three months.

1930
02:19:00,970 --> 02:19:14,040
[SPEAKER_15]: people come, dozens of people come to the meeting to prevent us from ever being able to discuss a policy and we're being accused of not knowing all of the details.

1931
02:19:14,381 --> 02:19:24,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the reason that we have this process is so that we can include the public in the entire discussion of every aspect of it and every detail.

1932
02:19:25,109 --> 02:19:28,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the discussion.

1933
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:32,921
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will say, I'm saddened.

1934
02:19:32,941 --> 02:19:52,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very saddened that I now seem to be on the receiving end of something where, specifically for in-town landlords, I have for years talked about how in-town landlords are the people that we want to support.

1935
02:19:53,071 --> 02:19:55,092
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's video of me from years ago

1936
02:19:57,890 --> 02:20:15,633
[SPEAKER_15]: So, like, this is, I just want to know we're coming up on the 15 minute limit for the previous question today, you have about a minute, then I want to go a minute but that's what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the conversation, so that we can talk about it for many months in open public committee meetings, and then we can have.

1937
02:20:16,795 --> 02:20:26,321
[SPEAKER_15]: the three public hearings in the city council, all of which are designed to answer those detailed questions and for you to have input on those answers, those questions and answers.

1938
02:20:26,781 --> 02:20:34,906
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what I'm struggling to get to is the point where we can actually discuss this rather than having it shut down before anyone is allowed to discuss it.

1939
02:20:35,947 --> 02:20:36,807
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1940
02:20:37,267 --> 02:20:38,988
[SPEAKER_46]: So we're at about two minutes left.

1941
02:20:39,068 --> 02:20:40,348
[SPEAKER_46]: It's by the City Council rules.

1942
02:20:40,368 --> 02:20:46,489
[SPEAKER_46]: There's 15 minutes to debate the call for the previous question of Councilor Sang, and the discussion remains to Councilors only.

1943
02:20:46,529 --> 02:20:47,649
[SPEAKER_46]: So we have one minute left on that.

1944
02:20:47,669 --> 02:20:49,130
[SPEAKER_46]: Are there any other Councilors who'd like to speak?

1945
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:50,970
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

1946
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:54,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

1947
02:20:57,231 --> 02:20:58,472
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins, thank you.

1948
02:20:58,512 --> 02:20:59,172
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

1949
02:20:59,512 --> 02:21:00,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for letting me know.

1950
02:21:02,873 --> 02:21:04,874
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow counselors.

1951
02:21:05,254 --> 02:21:07,734
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate everybody who's come to the podium to speak on this.

1952
02:21:07,754 --> 02:21:14,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I am aware that hearing people tonight, people feel like they're not being heard.

1953
02:21:14,316 --> 02:21:23,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also aware that there's probably not a lot that I can say that people believe, such as when I say that everything that people have spoken to, I'm listening to.

1954
02:21:24,199 --> 02:21:26,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't speak for my fellow counselors, but I know it's true for them as well.

1955
02:21:27,159 --> 02:21:27,740
[SPEAKER_18]: We're listening.

1956
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:29,180
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm taking notes.

1957
02:21:30,438 --> 02:21:30,898
[SPEAKER_18]: We hear you.

1958
02:21:31,698 --> 02:21:33,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll echo what Councilor Callahan said.

1959
02:21:33,419 --> 02:21:41,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that engaging in every part of this process is important, taking note of things that really concern people with this proposal.

1960
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:45,521
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, people are wondering, does this include compromising information?

1961
02:21:45,661 --> 02:21:49,561
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it does, but I think that's something for us to talk about in committee and make crystal clear.

1962
02:21:49,681 --> 02:21:54,822
[SPEAKER_18]: People are saying, why is this necessary when I know that you have info about property owners already?

1963
02:21:54,842 --> 02:21:56,663
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that's- I think Councilor Collins, you have about 30 seconds.

1964
02:21:56,823 --> 02:21:57,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1965
02:21:57,523 --> 02:21:57,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's...

1966
02:21:58,843 --> 02:22:09,550
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a great question and we should look at okay, what really needs to be added to augment already already have, I think the most salient thing for me, all the folks in this room that are property owners.

1967
02:22:10,410 --> 02:22:14,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Councilor Callahan made it really clear at the beginning, that's not who we're talking about.

1968
02:22:14,633 --> 02:22:20,515
[SPEAKER_18]: people said, we know that there are property owners in this community that are hurting neighbors as well as tenants.

1969
02:22:20,915 --> 02:22:24,176
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not the folks who are here talking about how much work they're putting into their properties.

1970
02:22:24,556 --> 02:22:26,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the folks that we can't reach.

1971
02:22:26,257 --> 02:22:33,099
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are the folks that we need to be able to reach that we make sure that they are contributing to the community the way that all of you are.

1972
02:22:33,679 --> 02:22:35,920
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is, I know we're coming up on my time limit.

1973
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:43,082
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I think this is worth considering further so that we can get into the concerns that were raised tonight.

1974
02:22:43,749 --> 02:22:53,536
[SPEAKER_18]: and elucidate them and get that clarity and have those discussions with everybody who we already know is interested in this conversation and all the people that we didn't hear from tonight, because those perspectives need to be- Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1975
02:22:53,796 --> 02:22:54,156
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1976
02:22:54,536 --> 02:23:01,481

1977

[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1978

[SPEAKER_46]: This is to end debate for previous question.

02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:09,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kelly.

1980
02:23:09,829 --> 02:23:10,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1981
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:10,810
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a thing.

1982
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:11,891

1987

[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1988
02:23:48,968 --> 02:23:50,389
[SPEAKER_46]: Actually, I don't have to call the roll.

1989
02:23:50,429 --> 02:23:51,169
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

1990
02:23:51,729 --> 02:23:51,849

[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

1992
02:23:52,409 --> 02:23:53,130
[SPEAKER_46]: All those opposed?

1993
02:23:53,610 --> 02:23:54,390
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

1994

[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, I believe Councilors are, Councilor Scarpelli said that they were opposed.

1995
02:24:04,336 --> 02:24:08,960
[SPEAKER_46]: 24-060 offered by Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, and Councilor Sang.

1996
02:24:09,701 --> 02:24:11,643
[SPEAKER_46]: Resolution to amend the City Council rules.

1997
02:24:11,723 --> 02:24:18,009
[SPEAKER_46]: Be it resolved that rule 16 of the rules of the Medford City Council be amended to state the following.

1998
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:23,113
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna read the existing rule, and then I'm going to read the proposed rule.

1999
02:24:23,774 --> 02:24:26,216
[SPEAKER_46]: The existing rule is public participation.

2000
02:24:26,356 --> 02:24:28,679
[SPEAKER_46]: Any resident, petitioner, or interested party

2001
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:32,675
[SPEAKER_46]: Please take your conversations outside.

2002
02:24:32,955 --> 02:24:33,397
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2003
02:24:35,121 --> 02:24:36,806
[SPEAKER_46]: Please take your conversations outside.

2004
02:24:43,339 --> 02:24:43,819
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2005
02:24:44,539 --> 02:25:05,884
[SPEAKER_46]: The existing rule 16 is any resident petitioner interested party shall be able to speak on any item included on the agenda once for no more than five minutes, all petitions filed by members of the public shall either be sponsored by a member or reviewed by the city clerk and Council President prior to prior to placement on the agenda, any resident participating in person may provide their residential address to the city messenger

2006
02:25:06,624 --> 02:25:13,106
[SPEAKER_46]: If any resident participating virtually may provide their residential address to the city clerk prior to speaking and the address shall not be included in the council records.

2007
02:25:13,526 --> 02:25:23,889
[SPEAKER_46]: A six calendar day public comment period shall commence upon the consideration of any petition as defined in rule 19 public comments shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk the council can waive this requirement by majority vote.

2008
02:25:24,489 --> 02:25:32,331
[SPEAKER_46]: And this would be replaced to state the following any resident or interested party shall be able to speak on any item included on the agenda once for no more than two minutes.

2009
02:25:32,771 --> 02:25:36,634
[SPEAKER_46]: public participation shall not exceed 90 minutes per agenda item during a single meeting.

2010
02:25:37,134 --> 02:25:44,800
[SPEAKER_46]: Interested parties may also contribute written public comment on agenda items via an online form on the Medford City Council website or a paper form in the office of the city clerk.

2011
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,163
[SPEAKER_46]: All petitions filed by members, that hasn't changed.

2012
02:25:48,883 --> 02:25:52,145
[SPEAKER_46]: the in-person residential address hasn't changed, and the public comment period hasn't changed.

2013
02:25:52,185 --> 02:25:54,847
[SPEAKER_46]: So it is just a change to the first paragraph of the proposal.

2014
02:25:55,528 --> 02:25:59,050
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Lazaro, I recognize you, and then Councilor Lemming, and then Councilor Sang.

2015
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:05,354
[SPEAKER_46]: And I please invite everyone to take their private conversations outside of the room and allow the body to conduct public business.

2016
02:26:06,395 --> 02:26:06,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2017
02:26:07,255 --> 02:26:11,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be possible to share the... Thank you.

2018
02:26:11,498 --> 02:26:16,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be possible to share on the screen the chart that's on the next page of the...

2019
02:26:17,466 --> 02:26:18,127
[SPEAKER_47]: Are you on Zoom?

2020
02:26:18,647 --> 02:26:19,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I am on Zoom.

2021
02:26:19,468 --> 02:26:19,988
[SPEAKER_47]: You can do that.

2022
02:26:20,168 --> 02:26:20,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I will do that.

2023
02:26:24,272 --> 02:26:25,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm not on Zoom anymore.

2024
02:26:26,414 --> 02:26:26,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

2025
02:26:28,616 --> 02:26:29,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I'm not.

2026
02:26:30,537 --> 02:26:30,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Nevermind.

2027
02:26:31,478 --> 02:26:32,699
[SPEAKER_46]: I think Councilor Lemming might have it.

2028
02:26:32,719 --> 02:26:34,801
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2029
02:26:35,021 --> 02:26:36,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, we'll share it in a second.

2030
02:26:37,543 --> 02:26:44,029
[SPEAKER_46]: There's an attachment to... Please take your conversations outside if you're gonna have private conversations in the chamber.

2031
02:26:44,462 --> 02:26:45,923
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an attachment to this rule change.

2032
02:26:45,963 --> 02:27:02,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate president bears reading the original rule because the thing that we changed is that we just changed the first sentence from five minutes to two minutes and added a sentence saying public participation shall not exceed.

2033
02:27:03,893 --> 02:27:09,416
[SPEAKER_46]: If folks could take their private conversations out into the, into the rotunda, please.

2034
02:27:15,575 --> 02:27:16,301
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councilor Zari.

2035
02:27:16,321 --> 02:27:16,946
[SPEAKER_46]: You may continue.

2036
02:27:18,066 --> 02:27:20,967
[SPEAKER_14]: public participation shall not exceed 90 minutes per agenda item.

2037
02:27:21,127 --> 02:27:39,931
[SPEAKER_14]: So during a single meeting, and we added additionally that interested parties can also contribute written comment on agenda items via an online form, which would mean that we would have to create that, that would imply that we would be adding that to our, the way that we, our methods of communication with the public.

2038
02:27:41,651 --> 02:27:44,632
[SPEAKER_14]: And a paper form in the office of the city clerk would also be,

2039
02:27:47,012 --> 02:27:47,792
[SPEAKER_14]: something that we would do.

2040
02:27:49,573 --> 02:27:53,854
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been a spill in the chambers, so I'm distracted.

2041
02:27:54,374 --> 02:27:57,635
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are a lot of ways that people can contact the City Council right now.

2042
02:27:58,495 --> 02:28:12,599
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a strategy to limit public participation so much as it's a way for us to carry on the business of the City Council, hear from people in a way that does not

2043
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:24,448
[SPEAKER_14]: That is more efficient, more democratic and allows more people to feel comfortable speaking with city counselors and making sure their voices are heard.

2044
02:28:25,389 --> 02:28:31,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Something I wanted to mention at the beginning of my remarks is that the, the way that we operate in Medford.

2045
02:28:32,034 --> 02:28:35,555
[SPEAKER_14]: as a city council is that we're representative democracy.

2046
02:28:35,616 --> 02:28:38,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we got voted in and we're supposed to be debating amongst ourselves.

2047
02:28:38,817 --> 02:28:44,759
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never meant to be debating with the public because we would never have time to debate with every resident in Medford.

2048
02:28:45,219 --> 02:28:46,720
[SPEAKER_14]: There just isn't time for it.

2049
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:48,561
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not supposed to go back and forth.

2050
02:28:48,621 --> 02:28:56,204
[SPEAKER_14]: We're supposed to hear a specific period of time of public comment, and then we are supposed to debate together.

2051
02:28:56,844 --> 02:29:01,727
[SPEAKER_14]: we're going to have to come to an agreement amongst ourselves and then land on a conclusion and take a vote.

2052
02:29:02,327 --> 02:29:06,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, this the goal of this resolution is to get us closer to that.

2053
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:15,776
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason I have this pulled up is because, uh, we did some research and we pulled up the cities surrounding our region

2054
02:29:25,293 --> 02:29:30,016
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the most permissive of the area for public comment.

2055
02:29:30,517 --> 02:29:36,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Many cities just have one section when I say public comment I mean that's one section of the agenda.

2056
02:29:37,242 --> 02:29:45,347
[SPEAKER_14]: We would have an opportunity for the public to speak after every agenda item which only one other city has, which is revere and.

2057
02:29:46,638 --> 02:29:49,079
[SPEAKER_14]: says a few minutes, it's like one to two minutes in the rules.

2058
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:57,123
[SPEAKER_14]: But other all the other cities have one city, you have to be sponsored, many, you have to sign up in advance.

2059
02:29:57,183 --> 02:30:10,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So if something triggers you that you're sitting in the chambers, and you say, Oh, that's interesting, I would want to speak on that you and you stand up and you say, No, you can't you have to sign up by like the Friday beforehand.

2060
02:30:11,407 --> 02:30:12,448
[SPEAKER_14]: and have prepared remarks.

2061
02:30:13,129 --> 02:30:17,373
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of that stuff is very different in Medford and that's something we don't want to stop.

2062
02:30:18,514 --> 02:30:19,815
[SPEAKER_14]: That's important to continue.

2063
02:30:20,055 --> 02:30:35,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing to keep in mind is that there are opportunities to communicate with city councilors and integrate opinions of the public prior to city council meetings.

2064
02:30:36,246 --> 02:30:44,188
[SPEAKER_14]: that I think are more effective at getting messages across that are not included in public comment.

2065
02:30:45,028 --> 02:30:53,691
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, I actually would like to make a motion to amend this resolution to be three minutes instead of two minutes based on feedback that I've received.

2066
02:30:54,191 --> 02:30:56,872
[SPEAKER_31]: Second.

2067
02:30:57,312 --> 02:31:03,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's all I have to say for now, but I appreciate the support of Councilor Lemming and Councilor Sang as well.

2068
02:31:03,453 --> 02:31:04,474
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

2069
02:31:04,534 --> 02:31:05,214
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Lemming.

2070
02:31:07,073 --> 02:31:07,453
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2071
02:31:07,774 --> 02:31:12,738
[SPEAKER_31]: So my reason for co sponsoring this is really just I mean, it's pretty simple.

2072
02:31:12,778 --> 02:31:18,803
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had a couple of meetings that have gone on till very late this term, it seems to be a pattern.

2073
02:31:19,803 --> 02:31:30,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Last time on March 12, a lot of people who came up for public comment were saying rightfully so that they didn't want to have to wait so long to offer their public comment.

2074
02:31:31,053 --> 02:31:31,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Even now, it's

2075
02:31:32,874 --> 02:31:40,441
[SPEAKER_31]: and a half hours into the meeting that we're that we're discussing this, and I would personally favor, um.

2076
02:31:41,201 --> 02:31:47,787
[SPEAKER_31]: More efficient meetings to accommodate these agendas.

2077
02:31:48,287 --> 02:31:48,507
[SPEAKER_31]: So.

2078
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:54,272
[SPEAKER_31]: And I look forward to continue to listen to continue

2079
02:32:02,073 --> 02:32:02,453
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2080
02:32:02,473 --> 02:32:07,597
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I really want to highlight again that there are three changes with this.

2081
02:32:08,098 --> 02:32:12,401
[SPEAKER_29]: The first one is the switch to a three minute speaking period per person.

2082
02:32:14,964 --> 02:32:20,769
[SPEAKER_29]: As you've amended on the floor, the resolution says two minutes.

2083
02:32:20,949 --> 02:32:22,310
[SPEAKER_29]: We've heard feedback from the public.

2084
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:26,634
[SPEAKER_29]: There's been extensive discussions about what is an appropriate time.

2085
02:32:26,694 --> 02:32:34,020
[SPEAKER_29]: And a lot of folks who have asked us, reached out to us and contacted us to ask us to consider lengthening it.

2086
02:32:34,201 --> 02:32:38,704
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I'm very happy that you've been open to changing it to three minutes.

2087
02:32:39,565 --> 02:32:44,469
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the second change is the 90 minute upper limit, which you mentioned.

2088
02:32:44,689 --> 02:32:52,335
[SPEAKER_29]: And the third change is creating a new channel for people to get their records entered into the public, the formal record.

2089
02:32:52,835 --> 02:33:07,166
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I think a lot of folks don't realize what they call us or email us before a meeting that's not entered into the official record on something, but unless they ask us to read that into record or enter that into the record, this would create an easier mechanism

2090
02:33:07,606 --> 02:33:14,392
[SPEAKER_29]: both in person and online to enter their comments into the formal record.

2091
02:33:14,472 --> 02:33:21,018
[SPEAKER_29]: And so we're creating an online form and an in-person form to be put into the clerk's office.

2092
02:33:22,279 --> 02:33:28,845
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this idea of new channels is really important because it goes to the idea of restructuring.

2093
02:33:29,025 --> 02:33:30,186
[SPEAKER_29]: There are some things that won't change.

2094
02:33:30,726 --> 02:33:33,028
[SPEAKER_29]: We will still have the general public participation.

2095
02:33:33,288 --> 02:33:45,918
[SPEAKER_29]: We would still have the general public participation section at the end of the meetings where folks are free to say whatever they want and free to speak for the times they desire.

2096
02:33:49,815 --> 02:33:55,198
[SPEAKER_29]: But we also recognize the need to restructure because of the need to democratize the process.

2097
02:33:55,758 --> 02:34:11,887
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, I've done quite a lot of work for a professor at the Kennedy School who's working on democratizing local government and state governments and working on ideas of how to restructure public participation processes.

2098
02:34:12,708 --> 02:34:16,350
[SPEAKER_29]: There's been a lot of formal critiques and research out there that shows that

2099
02:34:17,310 --> 02:34:41,427
[SPEAKER_29]: The way that public participation is done, especially in Massachusetts, there's a very lengthy thesis about this, a very lengthy published paper from Harvard Law and from the American Bar Association that shows that how public participation is often done in Massachusetts disadvantages those who support ideas, who support the ideas put on the agenda, disadvantages those who aren't able to make a meeting time,

2100
02:34:41,907 --> 02:34:50,832
[SPEAKER_29]: who aren't able to come to a 7pm meeting on a Tuesday because they might be working or they need to wake up early, they have children to take care of and they can't participate.

2101
02:34:53,053 --> 02:34:57,836
[SPEAKER_29]: The way that it's done right now also disadvantages folks who want to speak on an issue.

2102
02:34:58,496 --> 02:35:05,620
[SPEAKER_29]: but don't feel like they're empowered to because many folks in the room might oppose their viewpoint.

2103
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:11,663
[SPEAKER_29]: Leading actually, in fact, to a limitation of their First Amendment right to free speech because it

2104
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:21,726
[SPEAKER_29]: it limits their ability to speak up without feeling threatened by a member of the public.

2105
02:35:22,466 --> 02:35:26,569
[SPEAKER_29]: We're empowered by numerous federal court cases to do this.

2106
02:35:27,349 --> 02:35:31,552
[SPEAKER_29]: The Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges versus Knight.

2107
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:37,756
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a Chesterfield City Planning Commission court case as well, where the courts actually ask

2108
02:35:38,416 --> 02:35:39,983
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and I would urge, um, city

2109
02:35:43,926 --> 02:35:53,891
[SPEAKER_29]: to be wise in designing their public participation processes and empower the city to do that and ask us to create alternative channels, which we are doing.

2110
02:35:54,472 --> 02:35:59,574
[SPEAKER_29]: And I forgot to mention one really important alternative channel that we are creating.

2111
02:36:00,055 --> 02:36:10,280
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Callahan and Lazaro and I have been working on a resolution on this agenda to create listening sessions for the city council through the public engagement committee.

2112
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:15,163
[SPEAKER_29]: And so what we're saying is you can still speak up about these issues.

2113
02:36:15,203 --> 02:36:17,364
[SPEAKER_29]: You can still get your comment entered on the record.

2114
02:36:17,784 --> 02:36:26,150
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to restructure how that's done so that other folks who want to speak on an item can speak, and they don't have to wait till too too late in the night to speak.

2115
02:36:28,151 --> 02:36:30,873
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President Collins, and then Councillor Scarpelli.

2116
02:36:30,913 --> 02:36:31,833
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins.

2117
02:36:32,393 --> 02:36:33,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2118
02:36:37,077 --> 02:36:39,518
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate my fellow counselors for bringing this forward.

2119
02:36:39,538 --> 02:36:42,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I also appreciate the motion on the floor to amend it from two minutes to three minutes.

2120
02:36:42,959 --> 02:36:44,039
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's welcome change.

2121
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:48,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Two minutes feels a bit too much of a cut right off the bat.

2122
02:36:48,341 --> 02:36:49,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I think three minutes is more reasonable.

2123
02:36:50,562 --> 02:36:52,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that for myself is supportable.

2124
02:36:53,163 --> 02:36:55,063
[SPEAKER_18]: My reasons are the following.

2125
02:36:55,143 --> 02:36:57,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a tweak that will

2126
02:36:58,113 --> 02:37:00,675
[SPEAKER_18]: help more people to participate in our meetings.

2127
02:37:00,835 --> 02:37:11,084
[SPEAKER_18]: I can hear the response in my head and also slightly from the chambers of another way of looking at this, which is, you know, gosh, those jerks are really tired of long meetings.

2128
02:37:11,844 --> 02:37:13,165
[SPEAKER_18]: We know the job that we signed up for.

2129
02:37:13,185 --> 02:37:14,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I'll speak for myself.

2130
02:37:14,567 --> 02:37:15,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the job that I signed up for.

2131
02:37:16,188 --> 02:37:17,529
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a lot of long nights.

2132
02:37:17,989 --> 02:37:18,870
[SPEAKER_18]: I know how to prep for it.

2133
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:20,411
[SPEAKER_18]: I drink coffee in the afternoon.

2134
02:37:20,431 --> 02:37:21,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I eat before the meetings.

2135
02:37:21,732 --> 02:37:22,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm paid to listen to you.

2136
02:37:22,953 --> 02:37:24,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna do that if we have to be here till 1 a.m.

2137
02:37:25,035 --> 02:37:25,455
[SPEAKER_18]: every night.

2138
02:37:26,076 --> 02:37:27,477
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the job, committed to it.

2139
02:37:27,776 --> 02:37:41,885
[SPEAKER_18]: What I think is not okay is we're experiencing a tension between wanting to optimize for the number for people being able to speak at the length that they choose and wanting to make it possible for more people to speak at all.

2140
02:37:42,365 --> 02:37:51,130
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think for a lot of meetings in a row, we've experienced people not being able to say their piece, people showing up and tending to speak and having to leave early because they have to get up for work.

2141
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:52,551
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to go put their child to bed.

2142
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:56,382
[SPEAKER_18]: any other reason, they can't stay up until midnight with us all.

2143
02:37:56,762 --> 02:37:57,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I just saw it happen.

2144
02:37:57,582 --> 02:38:05,887
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there are some folks here to speak on a later resolution who said, I could speak if it comes up before 9.30, it's 9.40, they can't be heard.

2145
02:38:06,567 --> 02:38:10,509
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that that is, I think that that leaves people out of the process.

2146
02:38:10,549 --> 02:38:22,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a way that we can make a small tweak to finesse this one avenue for participation that could have the result of allowing more people to participate.

2147
02:38:22,679 --> 02:38:36,510
[SPEAKER_18]: concurrently, I think that we can always do a better job of publicizing the various ways, other ways that residents can let their feelings be known with counselors, which as Councilor Seng noted, we still have the public participation section at the end of every agenda.

2148
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:44,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Our information is public on the city website all the time, and I'm always really grateful to people who make use of that and always encourage more people to do so.

2149
02:38:45,597 --> 02:38:51,962
[SPEAKER_18]: People can submit comments to the president, to the city clerk to have them entered into the minutes or to be read aloud into the record.

2150
02:38:53,375 --> 02:39:07,365
[SPEAKER_18]: I also do want to note that like all of our other rules that are governing this body, this is enforced at the discretion of the chair, whoever that may be, which gives us the option to make exceptions where the need arises or where the space arises.

2151
02:39:07,825 --> 02:39:18,973
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, when we have a short agenda and aren't under time pressures, we can give everybody a little bit more breathing room in the event of, you know, I've heard from other communities, you know,

2152
02:39:19,497 --> 02:39:24,719
[SPEAKER_18]: using that discretion to allow more time for people with speech disabilities who do need more time to say their piece.

2153
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:39,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think this gives us a tool to allow more people to come to the podium, if that's the avenue that they want to share their feelings with the council, while still giving us the flexibility and doubling down on our other ways for having residents communicate with the council.

2154
02:39:39,805 --> 02:39:43,767
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll support the motion to move this forward tonight.

2155
02:39:43,927 --> 02:39:44,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2156
02:39:45,347 --> 02:39:47,688
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councillor Collins, Councillor Scarpelli, then Councillor Callahan.

2157
02:39:47,728 --> 02:39:48,449
[SPEAKER_46]: Councillor Scarpelli.

2158
02:39:49,687 --> 02:39:49,947
[SPEAKER_46]: Wow.

2159
02:39:50,167 --> 02:39:54,408
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, you can put a lipstick on a pig.

2160
02:39:54,428 --> 02:39:57,229
[SPEAKER_38]: It's still a pig.

2161
02:40:00,310 --> 02:40:06,872
[SPEAKER_38]: You just heard what this council, what people just were upset about and what we just spun.

2162
02:40:06,892 --> 02:40:10,093
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm embarrassed.

2163
02:40:11,234 --> 02:40:15,775
[SPEAKER_38]: What goes on in different studies, what goes on in different communities,

2164
02:40:18,493 --> 02:40:20,194
[SPEAKER_38]: This council, this is the people's forum.

2165
02:40:20,214 --> 02:40:21,695
[SPEAKER_38]: This is where people come and speak.

2166
02:40:23,035 --> 02:40:25,276
[SPEAKER_38]: The school community did this a few years back and what happened?

2167
02:40:26,677 --> 02:40:28,438
[SPEAKER_38]: You've eliminated people, they've walked away.

2168
02:40:29,038 --> 02:40:30,539
[SPEAKER_38]: Parents have left the school district.

2169
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:32,380
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no voice there.

2170
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:35,321
[SPEAKER_38]: You're saying this isn't limiting?

2171
02:40:35,341 --> 02:40:37,562
[SPEAKER_38]: The more people are gonna talk?

2172
02:40:38,803 --> 02:40:39,703
[SPEAKER_38]: You just saw what happened.

2173
02:40:40,723 --> 02:40:44,325
[SPEAKER_38]: Whether they liked it or not, they expressed themselves and people left.

2174
02:40:44,725 --> 02:40:47,867
[SPEAKER_38]: At least they left fulfilled that they had a place to speak.

2175
02:40:49,295 --> 02:40:54,658
[SPEAKER_38]: but now we're gonna implement the three minute time limit and the 90 minute hired stop.

2176
02:40:56,139 --> 02:40:58,900
[SPEAKER_38]: Come on, it's embarrassing.

2177
02:41:00,481 --> 02:41:02,002
[SPEAKER_38]: We were elected for them.

2178
02:41:02,642 --> 02:41:05,724
[SPEAKER_38]: We're like for the people of city of Medford, just cause it's inconvenient.

2179
02:41:05,924 --> 02:41:07,705
[SPEAKER_38]: You can make, you can say anything you want.

2180
02:41:07,945 --> 02:41:10,467
[SPEAKER_38]: A listening group, this is a listening group.

2181
02:41:10,887 --> 02:41:11,967
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't have to invent it.

2182
02:41:12,788 --> 02:41:13,949
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a listening group.

2183
02:41:14,869 --> 02:41:16,230
[SPEAKER_38]: So you wanna talk about different,

2184
02:41:18,527 --> 02:41:20,809
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to talk about different, we have so many other meetings.

2185
02:41:21,329 --> 02:41:22,610
[SPEAKER_38]: You've been to these subcommittees.

2186
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:24,371
[SPEAKER_38]: It's packed, right?

2187
02:41:24,891 --> 02:41:26,392
[SPEAKER_38]: People are really joining in.

2188
02:41:26,412 --> 02:41:28,033
[SPEAKER_38]: No one's coming.

2189
02:41:28,914 --> 02:41:29,254
[SPEAKER_38]: No one.

2190
02:41:29,274 --> 02:41:31,456
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's a farce.

2191
02:41:35,398 --> 02:41:37,040
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is disingenuine.

2192
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:40,202
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not about democracy, counselor.

2193
02:41:41,523 --> 02:41:47,587
[SPEAKER_38]: Someone accused me of not being democratic, not being good for the democracy and the newspaper and this election fight.

2194
02:41:49,102 --> 02:41:50,363
[SPEAKER_38]: This isn't democracy.

2195
02:41:52,505 --> 02:41:54,587
[SPEAKER_38]: You just listen to people tell you what they felt.

2196
02:41:55,427 --> 02:41:56,528
[SPEAKER_38]: They're telling you they're hurting.

2197
02:41:56,748 --> 02:41:59,671
[SPEAKER_38]: And the next resolution is, let's shut them up.

2198
02:42:00,271 --> 02:42:01,032
[SPEAKER_38]: But no, it's not.

2199
02:42:01,092 --> 02:42:02,033
[SPEAKER_38]: No, it's not about that.

2200
02:42:02,333 --> 02:42:02,993
[SPEAKER_38]: We want them.

2201
02:42:03,193 --> 02:42:04,034
[SPEAKER_38]: We want to hear them.

2202
02:42:04,555 --> 02:42:04,835
[SPEAKER_38]: What?

2203
02:42:06,216 --> 02:42:10,319
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't care if one person has to come up here and say things three times the same thing.

2204
02:42:10,359 --> 02:42:10,840
[SPEAKER_38]: But you know what?

2205
02:42:11,620 --> 02:42:12,141
[SPEAKER_38]: Let them.

2206
02:42:13,142 --> 02:42:14,242
[SPEAKER_38]: This is their forum.

2207
02:42:16,484 --> 02:42:18,246
[SPEAKER_38]: They didn't make the choice to only go once a week.

2208
02:42:19,719 --> 02:42:24,140
[SPEAKER_38]: once, twice a month, that was this council's choice, not mine.

2209
02:42:25,901 --> 02:42:30,842
[SPEAKER_38]: So when you put things up there, be honest, because those communities, they meet every week.

2210
02:42:32,063 --> 02:42:33,503
[SPEAKER_38]: They have a forum every week.

2211
02:42:35,504 --> 02:42:43,506
[SPEAKER_38]: All we did tonight, after you vote this in tonight, all you've done again is devalue what people want and what people are about in this community.

2212
02:42:46,527 --> 02:42:48,528
[SPEAKER_38]: So people reached out, told you three minutes,

2213
02:42:49,906 --> 02:42:53,909
[SPEAKER_38]: I get 1,000 phone calls, people are disgusted about this, and they're not coming in here.

2214
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:55,591
[SPEAKER_38]: You're forcing them not to come in.

2215
02:42:55,811 --> 02:42:56,651
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe that's what you want.

2216
02:42:56,831 --> 02:42:58,133
[SPEAKER_38]: You say that's not what you want.

2217
02:43:00,534 --> 02:43:02,096
[SPEAKER_38]: But that's exactly what's going to happen.

2218
02:43:05,338 --> 02:43:05,999
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm disgusted.

2219
02:43:06,039 --> 02:43:09,301
[SPEAKER_38]: It's the first time I feel ashamed of being part of this council.

2220
02:43:10,002 --> 02:43:11,163
[SPEAKER_38]: You're shutting people up.

2221
02:43:12,584 --> 02:43:13,505
[SPEAKER_38]: You're dismissing them.

2222
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:19,242
[SPEAKER_38]: You're going to keep coming back and forth with resolutions that you're putting forth.

2223
02:43:19,482 --> 02:43:20,503
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's not business.

2224
02:43:20,803 --> 02:43:21,703
[SPEAKER_38]: That's your business.

2225
02:43:21,743 --> 02:43:22,824
[SPEAKER_38]: That's your agenda business.

2226
02:43:24,005 --> 02:43:24,985
[SPEAKER_38]: Our city is a mess.

2227
02:43:25,025 --> 02:43:25,846
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'll say it again.

2228
02:43:26,466 --> 02:43:29,088
[SPEAKER_38]: We've done nothing to conquer anything in this community right now.

2229
02:43:30,749 --> 02:43:36,372
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going to go to budget season with the mayor that's dictated what's going on and what we're going to do with our money.

2230
02:43:36,552 --> 02:43:38,213
[SPEAKER_38]: And we don't even know what we're doing with our money.

2231
02:43:39,434 --> 02:43:42,195
[SPEAKER_38]: But I'm glad you put this working group together that was hidden.

2232
02:43:42,275 --> 02:43:42,936
[SPEAKER_38]: I didn't know about it.

2233
02:43:48,203 --> 02:43:49,323
[SPEAKER_38]: This is disgusting.

2234
02:43:50,744 --> 02:43:55,286
[SPEAKER_38]: Every single resolution's coming forward now is hurting people and dividing the city.

2235
02:43:57,647 --> 02:44:02,029
[SPEAKER_38]: I can only sit back and talk to people and say, hey, listen, these are good people, which you are.

2236
02:44:03,449 --> 02:44:04,250
[SPEAKER_38]: They're my colleagues.

2237
02:44:07,871 --> 02:44:11,753
[SPEAKER_38]: So don't tell me you all haven't talked about it because you have, not illegally, but you have.

2238
02:44:13,666 --> 02:44:15,106
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't talked to the mayor about any issue.

2239
02:44:15,126 --> 02:44:18,907
[SPEAKER_38]: It's the first time I've heard every resolution you people are putting forward.

2240
02:44:19,767 --> 02:44:21,848
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's doing nothing but dividing this community.

2241
02:44:23,088 --> 02:44:25,548
[SPEAKER_38]: So like I said, you can spin it any way you want.

2242
02:44:26,309 --> 02:44:29,489
[SPEAKER_38]: The bottom line is people are gonna speak less time.

2243
02:44:30,249 --> 02:44:35,991
[SPEAKER_38]: People can only talk for 90 minutes instead of when they feel like they're content and they can walk away and go to sleep at night.

2244
02:44:41,452 --> 02:44:42,552
[SPEAKER_38]: And for what, I don't know.

2245
02:44:44,457 --> 02:44:45,779
[SPEAKER_38]: All you're doing is hurting the city.

2246
02:44:47,321 --> 02:44:49,324
[SPEAKER_38]: Keep following the mayor, you're hurting the city.

2247
02:44:58,045 --> 02:45:07,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, so I was, I'm not actually in favor of reducing the amount of time that people, so I would have done this differently, let's put it that way.

2248
02:45:08,392 --> 02:45:20,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that having, and I've looked at some other cities, I have to say, I am so happy that we do something that I have not seen really anywhere else, I guess maybe Revere does it, but that we let people speak on every single agenda item.

2249
02:45:22,765 --> 02:45:27,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Most cities, there's one public comment period that applies to like anything that's on the agenda.

2250
02:45:29,748 --> 02:45:33,229
[SPEAKER_15]: You have your two minutes during that public comment period and that's it.

2251
02:45:33,829 --> 02:45:40,452
[SPEAKER_15]: And you don't get to be there when they're debating the whole rest of, while they're debating the body is debating that particular agenda item.

2252
02:45:40,812 --> 02:45:43,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So I love that we do that and I think that we should keep that.

2253
02:45:43,673 --> 02:45:45,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad this doesn't in any way get rid of that.

2254
02:45:47,515 --> 02:45:51,176
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that meetings that go to one, two, three o'clock in the morning,

2255
02:45:51,940 --> 02:46:02,609
[SPEAKER_15]: the poor people who have to speak on a topic that doesn't come up until after midnight, like that's also, that's just not good democracy, right?

2256
02:46:03,730 --> 02:46:16,120
[SPEAKER_15]: The way I would have done it, and I don't know how much people are open to changes on the floor, but I think that we should have a limit on the end time of the meetings.

2257
02:46:18,522 --> 02:46:20,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we limit the end time of the meetings,

2258
02:46:22,037 --> 02:46:27,082
[SPEAKER_15]: So that nobody has to stay up until you know one o'clock in the morning to be heard on their on their agenda item.

2259
02:46:29,713 --> 02:46:53,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, allowing the chair, which I think we already have as an option to before any public participation to declare hey like there's 100 people in the room for this item, we're going to leave it to and we and this is currently our policy anyway that we have done for this item, we're going to have two minutes per issue we did that you know a number of weeks ago for a different issue.

2260
02:46:54,153 --> 02:47:02,771
[SPEAKER_15]: And that the chair can do that in order to meet the deadline of the midnight 1231 o'clock whatever it is that we decide is the final hour that this.

2261
02:47:03,782 --> 02:47:05,683
[SPEAKER_15]: that the city council meetings end on.

2262
02:47:06,064 --> 02:47:13,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where I would go with it is have like a meeting end time so that nobody has to stay up till one o'clock in the morning just to speak on their issue.

2263
02:47:15,189 --> 02:47:21,132
[SPEAKER_15]: The other possibility is to let public comment happen at the beginning and then have it apply to all of the agenda items.

2264
02:47:21,172 --> 02:47:22,193
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very common.

2265
02:47:22,853 --> 02:47:31,598
[SPEAKER_15]: And then nobody, no members of the public have to stay until midnight, one o'clock in the morning in order to speak on their agenda item.

2266
02:47:32,261 --> 02:47:39,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think there are other ways to go that would let people speak.

2267
02:47:41,471 --> 02:47:46,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not sure that this is the one that I, I'm not sure that I love this one.

2268
02:47:47,859 --> 02:47:48,199
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2269
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,722
[SPEAKER_46]: Madam Vice President, if you would take the chair.

2270
02:48:05,538 --> 02:48:06,218
[SPEAKER_39]: Go ahead.

2271
02:48:07,038 --> 02:48:07,878
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam President.

2272
02:48:10,699 --> 02:48:11,619
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, it's been a fun one.

2273
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:33,143
[SPEAKER_46]: I think when we talk about what local government is about, when we talk about democracy, when we talk about what it means to listen to the people and do what the people are asking, I think there's an honest disagreement

2274
02:48:34,059 --> 02:48:39,382
[SPEAKER_46]: between many of us, many of us who everyone likes to think agree on that.

2275
02:48:39,542 --> 02:48:40,783
[SPEAKER_46]: There's an honest disagreement about it.

2276
02:48:40,883 --> 02:48:42,323
[SPEAKER_46]: There's an honest disagreement about this council.

2277
02:48:42,363 --> 02:48:47,946
[SPEAKER_46]: Sometimes it's six to one, sometimes it's four to three, sometimes it's five to two.

2278
02:48:49,367 --> 02:48:51,608
[SPEAKER_46]: And I've been on the losing end of a lot of those.

2279
02:48:52,449 --> 02:48:54,850
[SPEAKER_46]: I disagreed with this council before I was ever elected.

2280
02:48:55,410 --> 02:49:01,994
[SPEAKER_46]: I came up to that podium, Councillor Scarpelli and I have talked about it, but I didn't come up and,

2281
02:49:03,214 --> 02:49:07,456
[SPEAKER_46]: say the council is illegitimate, and I didn't come up and say, where did you people come from?

2282
02:49:07,997 --> 02:49:11,579
[SPEAKER_46]: And I didn't come up and say that certain people should be allowed to make decisions and other people shouldn't.

2283
02:49:12,179 --> 02:49:26,087
[SPEAKER_46]: And I certainly didn't say that when people are elected to public office, that they should be forced and required and demanded to have the legitimacy of our government disrespected on a regular basis.

2284
02:49:27,347 --> 02:49:31,610
[SPEAKER_46]: Now, when we talk about what this council has been doing for three months now,

2285
02:49:32,810 --> 02:49:35,391
[SPEAKER_46]: We put forth a governing agenda in a public way.

2286
02:49:35,631 --> 02:49:37,232
[SPEAKER_46]: No council has ever done that before in this city.

2287
02:49:38,052 --> 02:49:41,754
[SPEAKER_46]: We put every item we wanted to work on for the next two years in that document and made it public.

2288
02:49:41,794 --> 02:49:43,295
[SPEAKER_46]: We talked about it at multiple meetings.

2289
02:49:43,975 --> 02:49:44,615
[SPEAKER_46]: We announced it.

2290
02:49:45,536 --> 02:49:46,456
[SPEAKER_46]: We said, here's everything.

2291
02:49:46,516 --> 02:49:47,016
[SPEAKER_46]: What was in that?

2292
02:49:47,056 --> 02:49:48,157
[SPEAKER_46]: A rental registry was in that.

2293
02:49:49,215 --> 02:50:02,800
[SPEAKER_46]: rent stabilization was in that transfer fee was in that prop two and a half was in that a new Medford High School was in that fixing the roads and sidewalks was in that everything that everyone has talked about tonight that we want to do was in that document and it passed this body unanimously.

2294
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:06,381
[SPEAKER_46]: And it was put out publicly I will speak Thank you and you can wait.

2295
02:50:08,394 --> 02:50:09,855
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not being rude, you're being rude.

2296
02:50:09,895 --> 02:50:13,759
[SPEAKER_46]: You need to have basic respect and decency for your government.

2297
02:50:14,379 --> 02:50:17,362
[SPEAKER_46]: These people were elected, me and these six people.

2298
02:50:17,422 --> 02:50:21,765
[SPEAKER_46]: You don't see me sitting here and saying, George, shut up, and allowing people to yell.

2299
02:50:21,825 --> 02:50:24,348
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, please wait, thank you, please wait, thank you.

2300
02:50:25,028 --> 02:50:27,230
[SPEAKER_46]: Now, we did that, never been done before.

2301
02:50:27,951 --> 02:50:33,095
[SPEAKER_46]: We said what we wanted to do, and that's after we've campaigned and we've talked to residents.

2302
02:50:34,176 --> 02:50:35,016
[SPEAKER_46]: We disagree.

2303
02:50:36,363 --> 02:50:40,344
[SPEAKER_46]: We could sit here for three days and never take a break.

2304
02:50:41,264 --> 02:50:44,065
[SPEAKER_46]: And at the end of that, we could hear from everybody 50 times.

2305
02:50:44,705 --> 02:50:47,346
[SPEAKER_46]: There are things we are going to disagree on.

2306
02:50:48,106 --> 02:50:51,127
[SPEAKER_46]: That is what living in a society means.

2307
02:50:51,767 --> 02:50:55,608
[SPEAKER_46]: And the way that we work through those disagreements is the democratic process.

2308
02:50:56,229 --> 02:50:58,349
[SPEAKER_46]: We have a democratic process in this community.

2309
02:50:58,669 --> 02:51:00,170
[SPEAKER_46]: It's called an election.

2310
02:51:00,530 --> 02:51:04,431
[SPEAKER_46]: People won an election and those people are doing what they believe.

2311
02:51:05,271 --> 02:51:05,911
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm one of them.

2312
02:51:06,472 --> 02:51:09,853
[SPEAKER_46]: I know there are people who won an election in this room who disagree with me.

2313
02:51:10,374 --> 02:51:13,155
[SPEAKER_46]: And they say on some things, I don't know, maybe not all the time.

2314
02:51:14,896 --> 02:51:16,997
[SPEAKER_46]: We've disagreed at the podium before, I'll at least say.

2315
02:51:17,337 --> 02:51:19,418
[SPEAKER_46]: And George and I have had many a disagreement in committee.

2316
02:51:20,278 --> 02:51:20,799
[SPEAKER_46]: I hear him.

2317
02:51:22,279 --> 02:51:22,820
[SPEAKER_46]: I listen.

2318
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,960
[SPEAKER_46]: I try to take it seriously.

2319
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:25,381
[SPEAKER_46]: Sometimes I change what I think.

2320
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:27,342
[SPEAKER_46]: Sometimes I make an amendment to my resolution.

2321
02:51:27,802 --> 02:51:29,423
[SPEAKER_46]: Sometimes we find a different answer.

2322
02:51:29,863 --> 02:51:30,844
[SPEAKER_46]: Sometimes we don't.

2323
02:51:31,758 --> 02:51:45,109
[SPEAKER_46]: We were on the opposite ends of this for two years, where I was on the end of a lot of 5-2 votes, where I lost, and I didn't go out at the end of the day and say, oh, these people, they're bad counselors, and I don't like serving with them, and I don't think they're my friends.

2324
02:51:45,149 --> 02:51:52,374
[SPEAKER_46]: How many times have I gone and defended George or Rick or John or Adam to people who think they're the worst person in the world?

2325
02:51:52,414 --> 02:51:59,200
[SPEAKER_46]: And I say, no, I sat next to them, and they have their best intents at heart, and so do I. And sometimes we disagree.

2326
02:52:00,922 --> 02:52:04,123
[SPEAKER_46]: There are rules in place to allow the public business to happen.

2327
02:52:04,664 --> 02:52:13,328
[SPEAKER_46]: There are state laws that govern this process their city council rules, and quite frankly, cancer Collins is right, unless this council chooses, they want to remove me.

2328
02:52:14,696 --> 02:52:21,398
[SPEAKER_46]: State law gives me, as the chair of this body and the chair of the meeting, the ultimate authority on any public participation.

2329
02:52:21,999 --> 02:52:31,082
[SPEAKER_46]: If I really wanted to silence everybody, I could stand there and bully my minions, as people think they are, and say, I'll stand here and public participation's over.

2330
02:52:31,902 --> 02:52:33,943
[SPEAKER_46]: And you vote me out of this chair if you don't want it.

2331
02:52:35,031 --> 02:52:36,472
[SPEAKER_46]: And you know, my minions will do it, right?

2332
02:52:36,932 --> 02:52:38,694
[SPEAKER_46]: Because they just think the way that I think.

2333
02:52:39,154 --> 02:52:46,899
[SPEAKER_46]: And everything I say, we sit here and we put our minds into telepathy and we connect us, the six of us, and we all vote the same way.

2334
02:52:46,939 --> 02:52:50,442
[SPEAKER_46]: We all believe the same thing because it's a cult of personality.

2335
02:52:51,283 --> 02:52:52,503
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's what happens, right?

2336
02:52:53,244 --> 02:52:54,565
[SPEAKER_46]: I could do that if I wanted to.

2337
02:52:55,926 --> 02:52:58,428
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't do that because I value the public forum.

2338
02:52:59,268 --> 02:53:01,210
[SPEAKER_46]: I may not support this resolution tonight.

2339
02:53:01,890 --> 02:53:02,631
[SPEAKER_46]: You don't know that.

2340
02:53:03,769 --> 02:53:13,713
[SPEAKER_46]: What I can tell you is that in 2022, 6-0, the council voted on a final rules package that reduced public participation from 10 minutes to five minutes.

2341
02:53:15,354 --> 02:53:20,316
[SPEAKER_46]: And where was the outrage in 2022 when this council reduced from 10 to five, and now we wanna go from five to three?

2342
02:53:20,936 --> 02:53:28,179
[SPEAKER_46]: Because a lot of people wanna talk, and a lot of people get in touch with me and say, I'm not coming to a meeting, I can't wait till 10 p.m., I got things to do.

2343
02:53:28,199 --> 02:53:30,540
[SPEAKER_46]: There's a lot of people.

2344
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:32,781
[SPEAKER_46]: Just because you show up here in this room,

2345
02:53:33,837 --> 02:53:38,040
[SPEAKER_46]: even if it's 100 to one, it doesn't mean that you're representing all the people.

2346
02:53:38,981 --> 02:53:39,742
[SPEAKER_46]: It just doesn't.

2347
02:53:41,823 --> 02:53:47,347
[SPEAKER_46]: There was a night proposal in 2022 to create a public forum that's mentioned here.

2348
02:53:47,387 --> 02:53:48,548
[SPEAKER_46]: Some other cities and towns do that.

2349
02:53:48,568 --> 02:53:49,649
[SPEAKER_46]: We didn't vote for it at the time.

2350
02:53:50,229 --> 02:53:52,931
[SPEAKER_46]: The more I think about it, the more I think it might be the fairest way to do this.

2351
02:53:52,991 --> 02:53:53,352
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't know.

2352
02:53:54,032 --> 02:54:01,418
[SPEAKER_46]: I like the idea of Councilor Callahan to entertain alternatives, but I'm also gonna respect if there's a vote tonight that I'm on the wrong end of, I lost.

2353
02:54:02,895 --> 02:54:03,796
[SPEAKER_46]: Am I gonna get furious?

2354
02:54:03,836 --> 02:54:04,476
[SPEAKER_46]: Am I gonna scream?

2355
02:54:04,536 --> 02:54:05,157
[SPEAKER_46]: Am I gonna shout?

2356
02:54:05,197 --> 02:54:10,681
[SPEAKER_46]: Am I gonna say that we should storm the castle and take the back of the city?

2357
02:54:10,762 --> 02:54:14,264
[SPEAKER_46]: And these people are just, where did they come from?

2358
02:54:14,304 --> 02:54:16,747
[SPEAKER_46]: And they don't care about Medford, they don't love Medford.

2359
02:54:18,688 --> 02:54:20,109
[SPEAKER_46]: We agree to disagree.

2360
02:54:21,350 --> 02:54:24,513
[SPEAKER_46]: And what people call division is disagreement.

2361
02:54:25,354 --> 02:54:28,636
[SPEAKER_46]: We can listen, we can hear, we can sit there for hours.

2362
02:54:29,574 --> 02:54:35,137
[SPEAKER_46]: And at the end of it, I know we've all experienced it in our families, with our friends, with our colleagues.

2363
02:54:36,138 --> 02:54:37,639
[SPEAKER_46]: We may not agree at the end of the day.

2364
02:54:38,239 --> 02:54:49,926
[SPEAKER_46]: What's important is that we respect the systems and structures that we have created to work through the difficulties of these decisions, the democratic process, the elections of representatives to take votes.

2365
02:54:50,936 --> 02:54:52,457
[SPEAKER_46]: That is how this process works.

2366
02:54:52,998 --> 02:54:56,040
[SPEAKER_46]: If you want to change that process, run for office.

2367
02:54:56,120 --> 02:55:00,123
[SPEAKER_46]: If you want to change that process, go tell the Charter Committee to change the process.

2368
02:55:00,443 --> 02:55:10,351
[SPEAKER_46]: If you want to change that process, there are myriad ways to petition your government for the redress of your grievances, but it does not entitle anyone, anyone to

2369
02:55:11,164 --> 02:55:23,009
[SPEAKER_46]: say that I can talk for as much as I want, and I can say whatever I want, and that I shouldn't have to respect, because it's actually the disrespect of the people and the institution that degrades community trust.

2370
02:55:23,349 --> 02:55:35,755
[SPEAKER_46]: So when we can't talk to each other across our divisions and differences, there are plenty of people who I've talked to on the phone for an hour, and we were no closer at the end of that hour than we were at the beginning, and they said, you didn't hear me, you didn't listen to me, but I'll talk.

2371
02:55:37,924 --> 02:55:39,389
[SPEAKER_46]: It doesn't mean I'm going to change my mind.

2372
02:55:39,429 --> 02:55:42,819
[SPEAKER_46]: And there's a lot of people in this room I don't think I'm ever going to get to agree with everything I believe.

2373
02:55:42,879 --> 02:55:43,701
[SPEAKER_46]: And I understand that.

2374
02:55:44,957 --> 02:55:46,498
[SPEAKER_46]: But that's what this process is about.

2375
02:55:47,138 --> 02:55:50,341
[SPEAKER_46]: And at the end of the day, maybe this isn't the right approach.

2376
02:55:50,381 --> 02:55:50,941
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe it is.

2377
02:55:51,141 --> 02:55:52,922
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll see how I vote at the end of it.

2378
02:55:53,483 --> 02:55:55,444
[SPEAKER_46]: But that's the vision of government.

2379
02:55:55,564 --> 02:55:58,026
[SPEAKER_46]: We are being as transparent as we can possibly be.

2380
02:55:58,446 --> 02:56:01,688
[SPEAKER_46]: We are entertaining and engaging with residents in myriad ways.

2381
02:56:02,048 --> 02:56:04,950
[SPEAKER_46]: We are having these public comment sessions on our issues.

2382
02:56:05,831 --> 02:56:12,896
[SPEAKER_46]: The way that every legislative body in the history of the world works is that a proposal is initiated, it's sent to committee, and we have a discussion.

2383
02:56:13,922 --> 02:56:18,389
[SPEAKER_46]: We have a lot of people online said, hey, we should just have one topic meetings when there's a lot of people who are interested.

2384
02:56:18,669 --> 02:56:20,312
[SPEAKER_46]: There are, they're called committees.

2385
02:56:20,712 --> 02:56:25,520
[SPEAKER_46]: When this goes to committee, when what just went to committee rental registry, we'll have a meeting on the rental registry.

2386
02:56:25,540 --> 02:56:26,541
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll have another four hours.

2387
02:56:27,537 --> 02:56:39,482
[SPEAKER_46]: and we'll talk about it, and maybe we'll disagree, and maybe at the end of this two years, so many people will disagree with six of us, that three of us will lose, and three more people will come on, and they'll repeal what we did, or they'll try, and I welcome it.

2388
02:56:39,962 --> 02:56:45,725
[SPEAKER_46]: That is what democracy is, and I invite anyone to participate in good faith in the process.

2389
02:56:45,745 --> 02:56:46,085
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2390
02:56:50,327 --> 02:56:51,247
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Cassidy.

2391
02:56:52,808 --> 02:56:54,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comment from councilors?

2392
02:56:56,370 --> 02:56:56,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

2393
02:56:58,561 --> 02:57:11,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to be slightly more clear than what I said before, which is I would actually really like to discuss this, to be able to come up with some other ideas in committee rather than voting on this right now.

2394
02:57:12,216 --> 02:57:13,077
[SPEAKER_15]: So that'd be my preference.

2395
02:57:16,461 --> 02:57:16,821
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2396
02:57:16,881 --> 02:57:18,043
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

2397
02:57:18,063 --> 02:57:18,964
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2398
02:57:23,564 --> 02:57:26,446
[SPEAKER_26]: Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street.

2399
02:57:26,466 --> 02:57:28,588
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually like this idea.

2400
02:57:28,608 --> 02:57:33,032
[SPEAKER_26]: I thank the counselors that put it forward for putting it forward.

2401
02:57:34,133 --> 02:57:35,634
[SPEAKER_26]: But I also think it's half the story.

2402
02:57:35,934 --> 02:57:44,241
[SPEAKER_26]: So I do think that people tend to, not everyone, but a lot of people tend to bloviate and they tend to like a gas fill whatever space is given to them.

2403
02:57:45,923 --> 02:57:54,190
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that Medford is going through a tough time of transition and transformation right now, and that we're pretty dysfunctional.

2404
02:57:54,751 --> 02:58:02,358
[SPEAKER_26]: And so I do think that it is important to have some measures like this in place to, to sort of

2405
02:58:03,584 --> 02:58:17,650
[SPEAKER_26]: rain people in a bit and I think in a functional city, you have the public and the governing bodies, holding each other accountable, as well as having some degree of self regulation but you can always rely on the self regulation so

2406
02:58:19,111 --> 02:58:26,173
[SPEAKER_26]: I like what was put forward, and I like that Councilor Callahan suggested some alternatives to it as well.

2407
02:58:27,193 --> 02:58:37,896
[SPEAKER_26]: The other half of this, though, is that I think that the council should potentially consider, and the committee's address is part of this, but putting maybe less agenda items per agenda.

2408
02:58:38,396 --> 02:58:47,578
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the second thing, and I've mentioned this before, is staying within the realm of local issues, because bringing in national and global issues as well

2409
02:58:47,978 --> 02:58:59,003
[SPEAKER_26]: a couple weeks back, Gaza and the embargo in Cuba, tonight talking about some of the big oil company issues.

2410
02:58:59,444 --> 02:59:10,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Those might touch on local issues to some extent, but I think that it also massively extends the conversation beyond the local purview.

2411
02:59:10,689 --> 02:59:14,571
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll, as time goes on,

2412
02:59:16,092 --> 02:59:25,034
[SPEAKER_26]: very much track, like even if everything that was talked about here was put into effect, I think that it would still extend the conversation into the hours of the night.

2413
02:59:25,854 --> 02:59:33,995
[SPEAKER_26]: So something that I've been focusing on on the side is just filling the communications and information void in the city.

2414
02:59:34,175 --> 02:59:42,337
[SPEAKER_26]: And if outside of council, some of the councillors wanted to talk to me on how to better reach the public in certain ways, I'd be open to that conversation.

2415
02:59:42,617 --> 02:59:42,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2416
02:59:45,981 --> 02:59:46,421
[SPEAKER_46]: We're gonna go to Zoom.

2417
02:59:46,441 --> 02:59:48,103
[SPEAKER_26]: We're gonna go- And that was two and a half minutes, by the way.

2418
02:59:48,283 --> 02:59:48,763
[SPEAKER_46]: You did great.

2419
02:59:48,783 --> 02:59:50,865
[SPEAKER_46]: I clocked it at 2.20.

2420
02:59:52,226 --> 02:59:57,830
[SPEAKER_46]: We're gonna go to, and if folks, you can see, there's a little timer in the top right of the screen when I started.

2421
02:59:59,231 --> 03:00:00,652
[SPEAKER_46]: Gonna go to Haley Carr on Zoom.

2422
03:00:01,312 --> 03:00:02,733
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes, Haley.

2423
03:00:02,773 --> 03:00:04,434
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

2424
03:00:06,876 --> 03:00:09,538
[SPEAKER_60]: Haley Carr, 68 Central Ave.

2425
03:00:11,616 --> 03:00:18,004
[SPEAKER_60]: President bears I've known you probably since the early 2000s, let's say when we were kids.

2426
03:00:18,685 --> 03:00:30,160
[SPEAKER_60]: I never saw you being president of this council on my bingo card for any time soon, but I respect you for the position and it's definitely

2427
03:00:31,710 --> 03:00:32,631
[SPEAKER_60]: a difficult one.

2428
03:00:33,231 --> 03:00:47,544
[SPEAKER_60]: However, I the reason why I hopped on to zoom tonight is because a few hours ago now my father spoke, who has been a citizen of the city for about 60 years now.

2429
03:00:48,405 --> 03:00:54,350
[SPEAKER_60]: And it seems like it's a common theme for many of you on council.

2430
03:00:55,393 --> 03:01:09,903
[SPEAKER_60]: to smirk or think that some of these citizens with real grievances based on the proposals that you're bringing forward aren't to be taken seriously.

2431
03:01:09,923 --> 03:01:16,727
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think that this agenda item just further serves that idea that

2432
03:01:18,402 --> 03:01:37,080
[SPEAKER_60]: You want you say you want to listen to the public and you say you want to you know in return be respected by the public and and limit their Ability to come up and talk because it can get out of hand and what have you but it's a total total oxymoron and It just shows

2433
03:01:38,433 --> 03:02:00,203
[SPEAKER_60]: You know You just sat here and gave this this this long monologue, uh president bears and you said that you do have the ultimate authority and if you wanted to Exercise that authority you very well could and to me as a citizen a tax paying Citizen, I own property here.

2434
03:02:00,463 --> 03:02:07,567
[SPEAKER_60]: That sounds like a threat and I don't know why you think that there's

2435
03:02:08,988 --> 03:02:11,972
[SPEAKER_60]: Not a divide in this city and why?

2436
03:02:11,992 --> 03:02:28,571
[SPEAKER_60]: You many of you can't fathom that so many people are outraged about the things that you're all proposing And the division really comes from the way that you and other council members and school committee members ran your election I've been involved

2437
03:02:29,312 --> 03:02:31,713
[SPEAKER_60]: In politics since I was seven years old.

2438
03:02:32,353 --> 03:02:34,174
[SPEAKER_60]: I was holding signs for my grandfather.

2439
03:02:34,194 --> 03:02:56,103
[SPEAKER_60]: I was Participating in the recount when he got in for his second term So I have a i've watched my father run campaigns over the years for certain individuals I have an idea of what i'm talking about And when I tell you i've never seen a campaign run the way that your our revolution our revolution group did this past election term

2440
03:02:57,063 --> 03:03:09,147
[SPEAKER_60]: Whatever you sent out a pamphlet of however many individuals telling people go out and vote for the we all have the same ideas This is what we stand for go out our resolution.

2441
03:03:09,347 --> 03:03:24,732
[SPEAKER_60]: We follow this national agenda and That's where the division stemmed from And it's great that you said that you passed some sort of agenda for the the next two years about the high school and the the roads and

2442
03:03:25,812 --> 03:03:26,794
[SPEAKER_60]: Medford Square.

2443
03:03:27,675 --> 03:03:35,668
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know why those issues weren't on the forefront of this year starting in January when you all took an oath and got sworn in again.

2444
03:03:36,550 --> 03:03:37,952
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know why the first

2445
03:03:39,175 --> 03:03:58,435
[SPEAKER_60]: Things on the agenda had to be things that absolutely outrage majority of the citizens in medford and property owners And you're shocked that they're outraged I don't know why you didn't come out the gate with these ideas you have about a new high school about you know

2446
03:03:59,972 --> 03:04:04,114
[SPEAKER_60]: Medford square like somebody said medford square add a few more restaurants.

2447
03:04:04,214 --> 03:04:07,336
[SPEAKER_60]: That's where you'll get taxed You have one minute i'm aware.

2448
03:04:07,416 --> 03:04:07,956
[SPEAKER_60]: I can see it.

2449
03:04:07,996 --> 03:04:20,103
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you And i'm just kind of perplexed that you're perplexed that you you can't see how hypocritical this whole thing has become and

2450
03:04:21,482 --> 03:04:23,462
[SPEAKER_60]: People don't trust you.

2451
03:04:23,722 --> 03:04:32,064
[SPEAKER_60]: There seems to be a lack of transparency when it comes to, Councilor Scarpelli said he's not even aware of some of these things that are being presented.

2452
03:04:32,084 --> 03:04:34,164
[SPEAKER_60]: You talk amongst yourselves.

2453
03:04:34,504 --> 03:04:43,046
[SPEAKER_60]: And I just hope in the future, and I really hope that you can level with me, Councilor Beers and whoever else here, because I'm your age, and I hope you can understand.

2454
03:04:43,886 --> 03:04:49,747
[SPEAKER_60]: There has to be more trust, transparency, and the people need to feel like they're not being made

2455
03:04:51,067 --> 03:04:52,748
[SPEAKER_60]: fools when they come up to the podium.

2456
03:04:53,809 --> 03:04:56,490
[SPEAKER_60]: And that's my take on it.

2457
03:04:56,550 --> 03:04:57,971
[SPEAKER_60]: And you can do with it what you have.

2458
03:04:58,011 --> 03:05:02,634
[SPEAKER_60]: And I know I'm up on my time, but I do appreciate all your services.

2459
03:05:03,835 --> 03:05:04,655
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Haley.

2460
03:05:05,656 --> 03:05:09,839
[SPEAKER_46]: I generally wouldn't respond, but since that was pretty much about me, I'll entertain it.

2461
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:13,581
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not perplexed that people disagree with me.

2462
03:05:13,601 --> 03:05:15,242
[SPEAKER_46]: I know a lot of people disagree with me.

2463
03:05:17,835 --> 03:05:19,736
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, that whole thing was about me, actually.

2464
03:05:19,776 --> 03:05:20,037
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2465
03:05:20,157 --> 03:05:23,018
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm taking quite a personal privilege to respond to a resident.

2466
03:05:23,058 --> 03:05:25,500
[SPEAKER_60]: Well, to be fair, we have to address you directly.

2467
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:29,322
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, you did ask me to level with you, so I'm going to level with you, Haley.

2468
03:05:30,842 --> 03:05:31,143
[SPEAKER_60]: OK.

2469
03:05:33,144 --> 03:05:37,606
[SPEAKER_46]: In any case, yeah, I'm not perplexed that there's disagreement.

2470
03:05:38,307 --> 03:05:39,727
[SPEAKER_46]: There's been disagreement for a long time.

2471
03:05:40,488 --> 03:05:45,450
[SPEAKER_46]: There was a Boston Globe article about people almost throwing chairs at each other across this

2472
03:05:46,687 --> 03:05:49,390
[SPEAKER_46]: this stage about 15 years ago.

2473
03:05:50,411 --> 03:05:52,593
[SPEAKER_46]: And yeah, there's disagreement in a community.

2474
03:05:52,934 --> 03:05:54,896
[SPEAKER_46]: And you can call it division, you can call it whatever you want.

2475
03:05:55,336 --> 03:05:57,458
[SPEAKER_46]: I can't actually remember all the things you want me to respond to.

2476
03:05:57,478 --> 03:06:00,001
[SPEAKER_46]: I know there are people in this community who don't trust me.

2477
03:06:00,922 --> 03:06:02,043
[SPEAKER_46]: I respect that.

2478
03:06:02,383 --> 03:06:03,705
[SPEAKER_46]: That's their right not to trust me.

2479
03:06:05,326 --> 03:06:05,547
[SPEAKER_46]: But

2480
03:06:07,714 --> 03:06:09,275
[SPEAKER_46]: I appreciate you bringing up the election.

2481
03:06:09,375 --> 03:06:11,978
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, there was an electoral process, a campaign was run.

2482
03:06:12,538 --> 03:06:13,199
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe it was new.

2483
03:06:13,259 --> 03:06:14,160
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe it was innovative.

2484
03:06:14,580 --> 03:06:15,761
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe people hadn't seen it before.

2485
03:06:15,821 --> 03:06:17,402
[SPEAKER_46]: It was successful and people were elected.

2486
03:06:18,103 --> 03:06:19,905
[SPEAKER_46]: We have been highly transparent as a body.

2487
03:06:21,226 --> 03:06:29,433
[SPEAKER_46]: And to be honest, I do, after these meetings, think about all the times that I have not held my composure when I have responded or made a face or

2488
03:06:29,973 --> 03:06:36,758
[SPEAKER_46]: said something when something that I feel in my heart and in my mind, ridiculous was said, and I can't hold it in.

2489
03:06:36,838 --> 03:06:37,859
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm working on it.

2490
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:40,220
[SPEAKER_46]: And I appreciate that comment.

2491
03:06:41,461 --> 03:06:43,903
[SPEAKER_46]: There are people here in this city who disagree with each other.

2492
03:06:45,004 --> 03:06:46,905
[SPEAKER_46]: That is what the democratic process is about.

2493
03:06:47,285 --> 03:06:48,866
[SPEAKER_46]: I never expect to win everybody's vote.

2494
03:06:49,427 --> 03:06:51,048
[SPEAKER_46]: I never expect to win anybody's trust.

2495
03:06:51,828 --> 03:06:52,589
[SPEAKER_46]: Everybody's trust.

2496
03:06:53,770 --> 03:06:56,252
[SPEAKER_46]: Anybody, any politician who says they do is lying to you.

2497
03:06:57,801 --> 03:06:59,862
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm going to continue to do what I think is right.

2498
03:07:00,743 --> 03:07:08,086
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to continue to do what I think means representing the people of the city, not just the people who show up and speak in public meetings.

2499
03:07:08,986 --> 03:07:10,767
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's what you're going to get.

2500
03:07:11,447 --> 03:07:18,611
[SPEAKER_46]: And it's what I've said on every mailer and in every video and every debate and every council meeting for the last five years.

2501
03:07:18,691 --> 03:07:22,532
[SPEAKER_46]: And if I'm lucky, I'll be able to continue to do that for many years more.

2502
03:07:24,113 --> 03:07:26,154
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2503
03:07:28,540 --> 03:07:34,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Nicholas Jorleo, Forty Robinson wrote, I'm speaking tonight in opposition to this resolution.

2504
03:07:36,408 --> 03:07:49,557
[SPEAKER_17]: There's talk of efficiency, there's talk of, this is about making the process more open to other people, so they don't have to wait, because maybe people have to go to work tomorrow, or there's other reasons why they don't want to stay the whole night and wait for their turn to speak.

2505
03:07:50,077 --> 03:07:51,378
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, though, I just don't buy that.

2506
03:07:51,778 --> 03:07:53,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I really do think this is pretextual.

2507
03:07:53,479 --> 03:07:58,062
[SPEAKER_17]: I really do think this is an attempt to limit democracy in Medford.

2508
03:07:58,722 --> 03:08:00,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's very sad, it's very troubling.

2509
03:08:01,504 --> 03:08:02,885
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a public forum here.

2510
03:08:02,905 --> 03:08:07,668
[SPEAKER_17]: This body of elected officials is supposed to be accountable to the people of Medford.

2511
03:08:08,628 --> 03:08:11,950
[SPEAKER_17]: We should have an opportunity to stand up here and tell you what we think.

2512
03:08:12,870 --> 03:08:21,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Now reflected in the previous debate here on the registry resolution, it's very clear here that this council doesn't really want to listen to the popular will.

2513
03:08:22,756 --> 03:08:28,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Every single person who spoke here tonight was opposed to the registry resolution and it passed.

2514
03:08:29,440 --> 03:08:39,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Aside from one councilor who had a change of conscience and another who was opposed from the beginning, the resolution passed without any sort of consideration of the public input.

2515
03:08:39,372 --> 03:08:43,857
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really reflects how detached from reality the city council is.

2516
03:08:44,358 --> 03:08:44,738
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sad.

2517
03:08:46,152 --> 03:08:47,913
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not reflecting the popular will here.

2518
03:08:49,074 --> 03:08:50,736
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a person, I have to wake up at 6 a.m.

2519
03:08:50,776 --> 03:08:52,077
[SPEAKER_17]: to go to work every day.

2520
03:08:52,097 --> 03:08:56,700
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't wanna stay here all night to speak here for a few minutes about an issue.

2521
03:08:56,720 --> 03:09:04,226
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna go to bed, I wanna go home, spend time with my family, relax, read a book, do something normal after work.

2522
03:09:04,326 --> 03:09:08,510
[SPEAKER_17]: But I wait, I wait my turn, I wait patiently, I stand up here, I speak, I say what I have to say.

2523
03:09:08,830 --> 03:09:09,831
[SPEAKER_17]: It's part of the process.

2524
03:09:11,274 --> 03:09:13,855
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't be limiting public availability here.

2525
03:09:14,075 --> 03:09:16,877
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't be limiting public participation in debate.

2526
03:09:18,137 --> 03:09:20,058
[SPEAKER_17]: This resolution is really, it's despicable.

2527
03:09:20,498 --> 03:09:22,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Scarpelli was exactly correct.

2528
03:09:22,679 --> 03:09:23,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, I'm opposed.

2529
03:09:24,540 --> 03:09:25,001
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2530
03:09:25,021 --> 03:09:33,665
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go to Maureen on Zoom, but before I do that, when we talk about popular will, 25 individuals spoke against the rental registry.

2531
03:09:34,125 --> 03:09:35,205
[SPEAKER_46]: Thousands of people voted.

2532
03:09:35,345 --> 03:09:38,147
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we have an honest disagreement about what the definition of popular will is.

2533
03:09:40,202 --> 03:09:42,122
[SPEAKER_46]: Maureen, we're gonna go to you on Zoom.

2534
03:09:42,142 --> 03:09:43,163
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record.

2535
03:09:43,203 --> 03:09:44,083
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2536
03:09:47,283 --> 03:09:49,264
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you for allowing me to participate.

2537
03:09:50,244 --> 03:10:08,808
[SPEAKER_50]: With all due respect to the entire city council, I voted for three out of the seven of you, and I voted for those three individuals because I had trust that they were gonna represent the entire city of Medford

2538
03:10:09,864 --> 03:10:12,147
[SPEAKER_50]: just not a small number of people.

2539
03:10:13,528 --> 03:10:24,960
[SPEAKER_50]: And a lot of conversations tonight has been around, you know, the animosity between the residents of Medford and the city council.

2540
03:10:25,701 --> 03:10:28,243
[SPEAKER_50]: Well, it does all come down to trust.

2541
03:10:29,164 --> 03:10:31,026
[SPEAKER_50]: Okay, but trust isn't just

2542
03:10:31,946 --> 03:10:37,291
[SPEAKER_50]: You don't gain trust automatically because you've just voted in the city council.

2543
03:10:37,852 --> 03:10:39,213
[SPEAKER_50]: Trust is earned.

2544
03:10:39,233 --> 03:10:43,177
[SPEAKER_50]: I have been in the healthcare industry for 40 years.

2545
03:10:45,549 --> 03:10:58,180
[SPEAKER_50]: No, not everybody likes me, not everybody trusts me, but I treat all of the people that I care for the way I would care for a member of my family.

2546
03:10:58,960 --> 03:11:06,006
[SPEAKER_50]: I respect them all despite race, despite religion, despite politics, et cetera, et cetera.

2547
03:11:06,946 --> 03:11:15,569
[SPEAKER_50]: And I think the problem, the crux of the problem in the city of Medford is there is a lack of trust between the residents and the city council.

2548
03:11:16,570 --> 03:11:19,851
[SPEAKER_50]: But again, you have to earn that trust.

2549
03:11:20,571 --> 03:11:26,353
[SPEAKER_50]: And we, you're there because the populace did trust you.

2550
03:11:27,213 --> 03:11:31,495
[SPEAKER_50]: So earn that trust and, you know,

2551
03:11:33,050 --> 03:11:38,692
[SPEAKER_50]: nurture that trust and then we can all become one and all work together.

2552
03:11:39,352 --> 03:11:49,875
[SPEAKER_50]: A lot of time is wasted in city council meetings on agendas that are not at the top of the City of Medford's agenda.

2553
03:11:50,675 --> 03:11:58,538
[SPEAKER_50]: And I think my opinion is that all seven of you are there to support the agenda

2554
03:11:59,776 --> 03:12:03,617
[SPEAKER_50]: of the important agendas on the city of Medford.

2555
03:12:04,538 --> 03:12:11,220
[SPEAKER_50]: The infrastructure, the streets were a mess, the public school system, the high school.

2556
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:13,520
[SPEAKER_50]: I won't say the entire public school system.

2557
03:12:15,081 --> 03:12:18,342
[SPEAKER_50]: My brother has lived in the city of Medford for 30 years.

2558
03:12:18,882 --> 03:12:24,464
[SPEAKER_50]: He and his wife have four sons, okay?

2559
03:12:27,078 --> 03:12:50,157
[SPEAKER_50]: 18 months ago, they took all four of their boys out of the Medford public school system because they no longer trusted that the teachers, that school committee, that the mayor and others would provide their children with the education that they deserved and that he worked hard to give them.

2560
03:12:51,318 --> 03:12:54,661
[SPEAKER_50]: I thank you for allowing me to speak and listen to me.

2561
03:12:57,605 --> 03:12:58,105
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2562
03:12:58,125 --> 03:13:00,746
[SPEAKER_46]: Go to the podium name and address for the record, please.

2563
03:13:00,766 --> 03:13:01,427
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2564
03:13:01,727 --> 03:13:04,888
[SPEAKER_55]: Robert Penta zero summit road former member of the circus body.

2565
03:13:05,268 --> 03:13:07,269
[SPEAKER_55]: Number one local government is what it's all about.

2566
03:13:07,409 --> 03:13:09,150
[SPEAKER_55]: So we're not talking about state government here.

2567
03:13:09,470 --> 03:13:14,292
[SPEAKER_55]: We're not talking about federal government and I don't really care what was on that shot about other cities and towns.

2568
03:13:14,673 --> 03:13:16,934
[SPEAKER_55]: We're talking about our city of Medford.

2569
03:13:17,894 --> 03:13:29,640
[SPEAKER_55]: And for 12 consecutive years, his name was Council President Bob Miyako, it was emphasized every single night during those 12 years of city council meetings, that this was the people's forum.

2570
03:13:30,260 --> 03:13:37,183
[SPEAKER_55]: This is the only place that they could go for redress, whether they went to a department, the mayor, what have you, they were dissatisfied.

2571
03:13:37,643 --> 03:13:41,385
[SPEAKER_55]: And there were nights we stayed here till 12 and one o'clock in the morning.

2572
03:13:41,645 --> 03:13:44,847
[SPEAKER_55]: And that didn't bother me because that's what the job was all about.

2573
03:13:46,294 --> 03:13:56,741
[SPEAKER_55]: First and second of all, if you have a meeting as you've had over the past, since December now coming forward, when you have lines of people waiting to speak, let them speak first.

2574
03:13:56,781 --> 03:14:00,744
[SPEAKER_55]: The people at home, they're sitting in their chairs, they're sitting in their comfort zone.

2575
03:14:01,044 --> 03:14:07,268
[SPEAKER_55]: You have people here that need to go to work the next day, have paid for a babysitter, or just came down here because it's finally got to them.

2576
03:14:07,569 --> 03:14:08,769
[SPEAKER_55]: Something is really interested.

2577
03:14:09,490 --> 03:14:12,052
[SPEAKER_55]: Two of your free people that are sponsoring this,

2578
03:14:13,294 --> 03:14:19,862
[SPEAKER_55]: have never done anything here in the city of Medford that should even qualify them to make a result of going to two minutes.

2579
03:14:20,322 --> 03:14:22,625
[SPEAKER_55]: And then you go from two minutes to three, just like that.

2580
03:14:23,305 --> 03:14:25,408
[SPEAKER_55]: I mean, that's the way it was the consideration for that.

2581
03:14:25,688 --> 03:14:28,191
[SPEAKER_55]: Why don't you just keep it at five minutes.

2582
03:14:28,351 --> 03:14:31,455
[SPEAKER_55]: In 2022, you went from 10 to five and everything seemed to work out.

2583
03:14:31,835 --> 03:14:37,478
[SPEAKER_55]: And the only reason why these meetings are getting to be as long as they are, unfortunately, because you're every other week.

2584
03:14:37,518 --> 03:14:39,999
[SPEAKER_55]: So maybe you should go back to being every week.

2585
03:14:40,259 --> 03:14:43,761
[SPEAKER_55]: And that way the the agendas won't be as long and they won't be as contentious.

2586
03:14:44,401 --> 03:14:53,186
[SPEAKER_55]: But to worry about the length of time that you would have to sit here, you get $30,000 a year to supposedly represent the people of this city.

2587
03:14:54,403 --> 03:15:01,405
[SPEAKER_55]: And don't you dare think you're gonna come back here and ask for a pay raise because you have to stay late at night and you do committee meetings.

2588
03:15:01,966 --> 03:15:02,606
[SPEAKER_55]: That's crazy.

2589
03:15:02,646 --> 03:15:10,548
[SPEAKER_55]: If anything, it would be wise for you to make a decrease in your salary because of the conditions that the city of Memphis is in right now to show and put your good fest forward.

2590
03:15:10,808 --> 03:15:11,809
[SPEAKER_55]: But that'll never happen.

2591
03:15:12,509 --> 03:15:14,870
[SPEAKER_55]: just like a pay raise will probably come forward.

2592
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:20,313
[SPEAKER_55]: You know, the sad part about this whole thing is, again, you're spending time on what?

2593
03:15:20,893 --> 03:15:25,775
[SPEAKER_55]: Just tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes?

2594
03:15:26,476 --> 03:15:30,517
[SPEAKER_55]: What is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do?

2595
03:15:30,778 --> 03:15:32,318
[SPEAKER_55]: You're talking about Medford.

2596
03:15:32,678 --> 03:15:42,363
[SPEAKER_55]: And if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea,

2597
03:15:43,944 --> 03:15:48,506
[SPEAKER_55]: Let me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes.

2598
03:15:49,106 --> 03:15:51,767
[SPEAKER_55]: Did you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go.

2599
03:15:51,827 --> 03:15:53,608
[SPEAKER_55]: I only give them two minutes to speak to you.

2600
03:15:53,988 --> 03:15:54,809
[SPEAKER_55]: Of course not.

2601
03:15:55,549 --> 03:15:57,250
[SPEAKER_55]: That would be the height of insulting.

2602
03:15:57,850 --> 03:16:03,713
[SPEAKER_55]: But you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars.

2603
03:16:05,353 --> 03:16:07,033
[SPEAKER_55]: That's a shame, that is wrong.

2604
03:16:08,054 --> 03:16:20,637
[SPEAKER_55]: And not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government.

2605
03:16:21,457 --> 03:16:24,898
[SPEAKER_55]: You can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days.

2606
03:16:25,458 --> 03:16:29,680
[SPEAKER_55]: And just as an information to Councilor Zeng, you indicated this month is Ramadan.

2607
03:16:29,700 --> 03:16:30,660
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, do you know what today is?

2608
03:16:31,803 --> 03:16:32,524
[SPEAKER_55]: Do you know what today is?

2609
03:16:32,584 --> 03:16:36,067
[SPEAKER_55]: Today is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations.

2610
03:16:36,127 --> 03:16:37,448
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't see that on the calendar.

2611
03:16:37,909 --> 03:16:39,911
[SPEAKER_55]: That to me is as important as your Ramadan.

2612
03:16:40,491 --> 03:16:44,455
[SPEAKER_55]: But you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar.

2613
03:16:44,996 --> 03:16:51,622
[SPEAKER_55]: What does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here?

2614
03:16:52,683 --> 03:16:59,747
[SPEAKER_55]: I strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone.

2615
03:16:59,807 --> 03:17:06,130
[SPEAKER_55]: And let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be.

2616
03:17:06,250 --> 03:17:16,034
[SPEAKER_55]: And hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here.

2617
03:17:16,655 --> 03:17:20,457
[SPEAKER_55]: But even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job.

2618
03:17:21,357 --> 03:17:22,558
[SPEAKER_55]: That's what you signed up for.

2619
03:17:22,938 --> 03:17:25,139
[SPEAKER_55]: You wanted to be a council to represent the people.

2620
03:17:25,699 --> 03:17:29,900
[SPEAKER_55]: And if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you.

2621
03:17:30,261 --> 03:17:35,062
[SPEAKER_55]: So to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything.

2622
03:17:35,803 --> 03:17:38,204
[SPEAKER_55]: You spent two hours of your time on a conversation.

2623
03:17:38,684 --> 03:17:40,965
[SPEAKER_55]: But you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium.

2624
03:17:41,545 --> 03:17:43,147
[SPEAKER_55]: That makes absolutely no sense at all.

2625
03:17:43,167 --> 03:17:46,933
[SPEAKER_55]: And it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about.

2626
03:17:47,414 --> 03:17:51,499
[SPEAKER_55]: Again, I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out.

2627
03:17:51,760 --> 03:17:54,844
[SPEAKER_55]: And also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist.

2628
03:17:54,924 --> 03:17:55,785
[SPEAKER_55]: Anyone have ever heard of it?

2629
03:17:56,852 --> 03:17:58,974
[SPEAKER_55]: It's a very interesting book, okay?

2630
03:17:58,994 --> 03:17:59,574
[SPEAKER_55]: It's a naked socialist.

2631
03:17:59,594 --> 03:18:00,715
[SPEAKER_44]: I just hope it's not about me.

2632
03:18:00,735 --> 03:18:01,416
[SPEAKER_55]: Pardon me?

2633
03:18:02,056 --> 03:18:03,438
[SPEAKER_44]: I said, I just hope it's not about me.

2634
03:18:03,558 --> 03:18:04,418
[SPEAKER_55]: No, it's not about you.

2635
03:18:04,478 --> 03:18:07,781
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says.

2636
03:18:07,841 --> 03:18:09,162
[SPEAKER_55]: This goes back to 1968.

2637
03:18:10,423 --> 03:18:20,932
[SPEAKER_55]: A lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in.

2638
03:18:20,952 --> 03:18:22,394
[SPEAKER_55]: Regarding public participation.

2639
03:18:22,654 --> 03:18:24,395
[SPEAKER_55]: One line, and it says the following.

2640
03:18:25,376 --> 03:18:33,643
[SPEAKER_55]: Government may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well.

2641
03:18:34,223 --> 03:18:36,806
[SPEAKER_55]: When it does, you're operating toward tyranny.

2642
03:18:36,826 --> 03:18:37,626
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2643
03:18:37,646 --> 03:18:39,988
[SPEAKER_55]: Let me just finish, please, okay?

2644
03:18:40,308 --> 03:18:40,649
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2645
03:18:41,229 --> 03:18:42,850
[SPEAKER_55]: I would can I just finish please.

2646
03:18:43,170 --> 03:18:43,551
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2647
03:18:44,271 --> 03:18:46,472
[SPEAKER_55]: Can I just finish please sentence.

2648
03:18:46,993 --> 03:18:47,373
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

2649
03:18:47,913 --> 03:19:00,281
[SPEAKER_55]: I would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking.

2650
03:19:00,701 --> 03:19:01,122
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2651
03:19:08,746 --> 03:19:09,987
[SPEAKER_14]: So quick point of privilege.

2652
03:19:10,087 --> 03:19:11,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to clarify.

2653
03:19:11,127 --> 03:19:17,251
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not for the council's comfort that we would like to offer this resolution.

2654
03:19:17,431 --> 03:19:27,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because two meetings ago, we had a very long public comment period after one agenda item and one member of the public.

2655
03:19:27,837 --> 03:19:30,478
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an example, but this has happened, I think, to multiple people.

2656
03:19:31,928 --> 03:19:42,134
[SPEAKER_14]: the leaf blower ordinance was being voted on, and then he stood up and he said, Good morning, counselors, because it was after midnight, and he had waited that whole time to talk about leaf blowers.

2657
03:19:42,174 --> 03:19:44,315
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for Norman, who waited to do that.

2658
03:19:44,415 --> 03:19:46,076
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not for us and for our comfort.

2659
03:19:46,817 --> 03:19:47,577
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for the public.

2660
03:19:47,637 --> 03:19:49,418
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for people who wait to speak.

2661
03:19:50,239 --> 03:19:51,500
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so more people can speak.

2662
03:19:52,340 --> 03:19:52,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2663
03:20:00,589 --> 03:20:03,712
[SPEAKER_46]: When a zoom K Lazaro name and address for the record please you have five minutes.

2664
03:20:04,393 --> 03:20:06,675
[SPEAKER_48]: Hi Kathleen Lazaro 52 Grace Road.

2665
03:20:07,736 --> 03:20:11,680
[SPEAKER_48]: And I don't, I oppose this as well.

2666
03:20:13,962 --> 03:20:21,808
[SPEAKER_48]: I think by reducing the time from five minutes to now three minutes, on a night like tonight, there's a lot to say about these issues.

2667
03:20:22,629 --> 03:20:27,853
[SPEAKER_48]: And when you're sitting waiting, more ideas come to mind that you want to bring up.

2668
03:20:29,354 --> 03:20:36,279
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't think anybody will, I always say that, I would not speak for more than the time that I want to say what I need to say.

2669
03:20:38,491 --> 03:20:43,754
[SPEAKER_48]: You know, move along, I'm not going to stand up here and chat for 5 minutes.

2670
03:20:44,314 --> 03:20:55,801
[SPEAKER_48]: I also think that not everyone is a. Has ease with public speaking, and it might take someone 5 minutes to get out their issues with the item.

2671
03:20:56,421 --> 03:20:59,043
[SPEAKER_48]: Whereas someone else might get it out in 2 or even less.

2672
03:20:59,683 --> 03:21:01,624
[SPEAKER_48]: So, I think 5 minutes is a.

2673
03:21:03,021 --> 03:21:08,811
[SPEAKER_48]: a good amount of time, and if someone needs the full time to talk, they should be able to have it.

2674
03:21:09,311 --> 03:21:13,819
[SPEAKER_48]: If someone doesn't need the full time, they can end and move along to a new item.

2675
03:21:17,204 --> 03:21:17,525
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

2676
03:21:18,561 --> 03:21:19,222
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you very much.

2677
03:21:19,722 --> 03:21:20,963
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

2678
03:21:20,983 --> 03:21:21,763
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2679
03:21:22,684 --> 03:21:25,266
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street.

2680
03:21:26,667 --> 03:21:33,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, I have a few things to say, and some of them sort of a little bit at cross purposes, but anyway.

2681
03:21:34,773 --> 03:21:40,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a concept that I'll introduce, sort of refers to what Councilor Tsai was getting at, the heckler's veto.

2682
03:21:41,077 --> 03:21:42,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the heckler's veto.

2683
03:21:42,899 --> 03:21:54,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time somebody wants to build an apartment or put in a chicken restaurant or extend a subway line, a bunch of people are like, no, and they come and they oppose it, and then it gets opposed.

2684
03:21:54,907 --> 03:22:02,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I could see why that's not always great because sometimes certain things have a concentrated harm.

2685
03:22:03,493 --> 03:22:06,016
[SPEAKER_07]: and diffuse benefit.

2686
03:22:06,576 --> 03:22:14,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we sort of get screwed up by the angry people coming to oppose something happening in their neighborhood or something like that.

2687
03:22:15,825 --> 03:22:21,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one aspect where too much public comment, I think, I think can be

2688
03:22:23,516 --> 03:22:26,978
[SPEAKER_07]: destructive to the general, the general thing.

2689
03:22:27,478 --> 03:22:32,261
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, the specific resolution I share some of the concerns that counselor Callahan has.

2690
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:41,954
[SPEAKER_07]: But my specific concern is that I really feel like there's like four reforms here and I feel like that's doing too much.

2691
03:22:41,974 --> 03:22:51,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the sponsors could pick their favorite one and pass one rather than multiple, you know, especially with the petitions.

2692
03:22:53,081 --> 03:22:59,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that the petitions have been a problem and the people who stay till all the way at the end of the meeting

2693
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:14,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd be fair to give them more than three minutes, personally, because they did the paperwork, they probably spent an hour to come down here to fill out the paperwork, and then they're going to wait till perhaps midnight, so we can give them more than three minutes I feel.

2694
03:23:18,416 --> 03:23:29,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I wanted to say was that I sort of asked, and I created a Facebook post to this effect, was what is the purpose of public comment?

2695
03:23:29,925 --> 03:23:31,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, I think people have two answers.

2696
03:23:32,207 --> 03:23:40,093
[SPEAKER_07]: You can bring a unique knowledge, expertise, or lived experience to the question, something that you've studied or that you've dealt with firsthand or anecdote.

2697
03:23:41,794 --> 03:23:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes that's wishful thinking, as you know, Mr. President.

2698
03:23:47,489 --> 03:23:49,811
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is you want to make residents feel heard.

2699
03:23:51,072 --> 03:24:00,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I basically wanted to say that I think one of the reasons, besides the structure of public comment that is making residents feel unheard is

2700
03:24:02,011 --> 03:24:08,155
[SPEAKER_07]: that I think it is confusing to people and illegible that this thing where we're saying all we're doing today is we're sending this to committee.

2701
03:24:08,615 --> 03:24:09,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

2702
03:24:09,515 --> 03:24:10,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why committee is valuable.

2703
03:24:11,757 --> 03:24:18,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why you can get work done in committee that you can't get done in the main meeting.

2704
03:24:20,185 --> 03:24:23,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said, I think some people feel that that's confusing.

2705
03:24:23,726 --> 03:24:30,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it comes up as an answer when, you know, the actual answer is inconvenient, not right at hand or something like that.

2706
03:24:30,867 --> 03:24:33,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it just confuses people, doesn't make a lot of sense.

2707
03:24:34,108 --> 03:24:36,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one thing I would say.

2708
03:24:36,628 --> 03:24:39,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sort of what Councilor Lazaro said earlier.

2709
03:24:40,369 --> 03:24:43,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this thing where, you know,

2710
03:24:47,608 --> 03:24:53,451
[SPEAKER_07]: where we're not defending the policy of the merits, but waiting for committee to defend the policy, certain aspects of it.

2711
03:24:53,831 --> 03:24:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that confuses people.

2712
03:24:54,972 --> 03:25:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that there could be ways to make that more legible, doesn't necessarily have to change the actual process, but something to make it more clear to people what is going on with that, I think would make people feel heard.

2713
03:25:06,337 --> 03:25:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if that's the purpose of public comment, then it matters what people feel, you know, I mean,

2714
03:25:12,978 --> 03:25:15,120
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanna be able to feel heard, you have to ask, do you feel heard?

2715
03:25:15,880 --> 03:25:17,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that would make it easier.

2716
03:25:17,982 --> 03:25:18,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2717
03:25:18,903 --> 03:25:19,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, William.

2718
03:25:21,685 --> 03:25:22,366
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Zaro.

2719
03:25:24,628 --> 03:25:26,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a quick point of clarification.

2720
03:25:26,770 --> 03:25:28,952
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no changes to anything about petitions.

2721
03:25:29,792 --> 03:25:32,034
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all in the rules as they stand right now.

2722
03:25:32,455 --> 03:25:33,876
[SPEAKER_14]: The only changes are in the first paragraph.

2723
03:25:34,536 --> 03:25:36,358
[SPEAKER_46]: I think actually there's the inclusion of the form as well.

2724
03:25:42,691 --> 03:25:43,351
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a separate.

2725
03:25:43,491 --> 03:25:44,051
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you.

2726
03:25:45,172 --> 03:25:45,532
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2727
03:25:45,872 --> 03:25:47,493
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom.

2728
03:25:47,513 --> 03:25:48,813
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

2729
03:25:48,853 --> 03:25:49,813
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2730
03:25:57,416 --> 03:25:57,796
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello.

2731
03:25:59,817 --> 03:26:00,197
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, Jess.

2732
03:26:00,237 --> 03:26:00,977
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record.

2733
03:26:00,997 --> 03:26:01,457
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2734
03:26:02,958 --> 03:26:04,719
[SPEAKER_24]: Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road.

2735
03:26:06,919 --> 03:26:11,521
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm opposed to putting it down to three minutes

2736
03:26:12,293 --> 03:26:27,979
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the best option would possibly to put the people who are like me on Zoom down to three minutes and leave the people that actually show up in person, leave that at five minutes.

2737
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:37,223
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that too much stuff goes on for one meeting twice a month.

2738
03:26:38,180 --> 03:26:42,463
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe going back to meeting once a week would be helpful.

2739
03:26:42,483 --> 03:26:46,326
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're not there till 1, 2 o'clock in the morning.

2740
03:26:46,626 --> 03:26:51,430
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand no one wants to be, but people also need to be heard and can't be limited.

2741
03:26:52,110 --> 03:27:00,136
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think maybe staying till five minutes, if you're in person, three minutes on Zoom, at least we'll cut it down a little bit.

2742
03:27:00,536 --> 03:27:00,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2743
03:27:02,958 --> 03:27:04,179
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Jess.

2744
03:27:04,339 --> 03:27:05,740
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

2745
03:27:05,800 --> 03:27:06,461
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2746
03:27:06,749 --> 03:27:09,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Beres, Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

2747
03:27:10,791 --> 03:27:12,612
[SPEAKER_22]: So I wanted to mention several points.

2748
03:27:12,732 --> 03:27:20,777
[SPEAKER_22]: So first of all, I do oppose changing the minutes from 5 down to 3 and cutting it at 90 minutes maximum.

2749
03:27:22,598 --> 03:27:42,747
[SPEAKER_22]: So what I just wanted to say that I think the problem that I'm seeing, and this relates to all the issues that have been present at the City Council lately with the real estate tax, sales tax, with the rental ordinance that just passed and then with this, is that

2750
03:27:44,783 --> 03:27:47,325
[SPEAKER_22]: You have already decided what you want to do.

2751
03:27:47,605 --> 03:27:51,489
[SPEAKER_22]: So you want the rental licensing audience, you have already decided that.

2752
03:27:51,989 --> 03:27:56,493
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to implement a real estate sales tax, you have already decided that.

2753
03:27:57,033 --> 03:28:04,600
[SPEAKER_22]: And now you have already decided that you want to reduce the number of minutes that people talk from five down to three.

2754
03:28:06,598 --> 03:28:11,902
[SPEAKER_22]: What I think, and this is why people get kind of fearful, is because you have already decided your agenda.

2755
03:28:11,942 --> 03:28:16,645
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I think all the goals that you have are laudable.

2756
03:28:16,845 --> 03:28:19,928
[SPEAKER_22]: I think everyone wants affordable housing related to real estate sales tax.

2757
03:28:20,468 --> 03:28:29,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone wants, you know, sustainability, and everyone wants housing affordability, which was the other goal for that rental license in Orleans.

2758
03:28:31,216 --> 03:28:43,884
[SPEAKER_22]: So then, why aren't we, why aren't you discussing, and then we participating, about what are all the different approaches, in this case, for example, that we can have?

2759
03:28:44,204 --> 03:28:52,710
[SPEAKER_22]: How can we approach the problem that meetings are running until really late, and that people, including all of us, we have to wake up really early tomorrow to go to work.

2760
03:28:53,290 --> 03:28:59,935
[SPEAKER_22]: What can we do to sort of make the process more efficient, instead of already having decided what you are gonna do?

2761
03:29:00,915 --> 03:29:09,581
[SPEAKER_22]: So, for example, there's a lot of technology that could be used to get people's input and make this a lot more efficient.

2762
03:29:09,861 --> 03:29:13,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Machine learning, collaborative full-chain approaches, and we have generative AI.

2763
03:29:13,643 --> 03:29:20,588
[SPEAKER_22]: You could just like, you know, analyze everyone's comments, get summaries out of it, come here, we discuss, saves a lot of time.

2764
03:29:22,349 --> 03:29:28,216
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, I'm assuming that everyone is in favor of making the democratic process as democratic as possible.

2765
03:29:28,256 --> 03:29:33,683
[SPEAKER_22]: So I consider town meeting, the direct democracy clearly were too big for town meeting, obviously.

2766
03:29:34,344 --> 03:29:38,929
[SPEAKER_22]: But in the town meeting, I was in New Hampshire, so during the town meeting, the moderator

2767
03:29:39,770 --> 03:29:49,480
[SPEAKER_22]: the morning of, basically sets the rules, and then the people that are present in the town meeting actually have the capability to sort of override those rules or ask for modifications.

2768
03:29:50,041 --> 03:29:52,824
[SPEAKER_22]: So what about, for example, again, discussions?

2769
03:29:52,884 --> 03:29:59,951
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not saying this is a good idea, that you're the moderator, Mr. President, and then you say, well, today there's a lot of people who have a very big agenda.

2770
03:30:00,151 --> 03:30:00,992
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the rules should be this.

2771
03:30:01,733 --> 03:30:05,417
[SPEAKER_22]: open to the floor, discuss, see whether that works, that doesn't work.

2772
03:30:05,838 --> 03:30:07,440
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're not allowed to discuss that.

2773
03:30:07,480 --> 03:30:10,543
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not discussing that, you have already decided that you want it done from five to three, and that's it.

2774
03:30:11,064 --> 03:30:17,030
[SPEAKER_22]: So I encourage the council to basically, in general, again, because this has applied to every issue I've been present for,

2775
03:30:18,018 --> 03:30:27,306
[SPEAKER_22]: that maybe instead of just saying like, well, I'm gonna tackle housing affordability by taxing homeowners, which is not gonna address housing affordability.

2776
03:30:27,326 --> 03:30:28,627
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, it's gonna make it a lot worse.

2777
03:30:29,348 --> 03:30:32,911
[SPEAKER_22]: So that you say like, we wanna make housing more affordable.

2778
03:30:33,612 --> 03:30:34,913
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what we can do.

2779
03:30:35,213 --> 03:30:35,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Taxing.

2780
03:30:36,494 --> 03:30:47,943
[SPEAKER_22]: market-oriented approaches, removing regulations, opening the, you know, changing zoning so there can be more construction, more competition, so we're going to lower prices, more supply, equal demand, prices are going to go down.

2781
03:30:48,744 --> 03:30:52,107
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I think that's going to lead to a lot of better results.

2782
03:30:52,147 --> 03:31:00,173
[SPEAKER_22]: So, we define the issues, but again, I applaud you for the issues, they're all good, but I don't agree at all with the methods and you have already decided.

2783
03:31:00,233 --> 03:31:01,815
[SPEAKER_22]: So, define the issues,

2784
03:31:02,833 --> 03:31:06,135
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's discuss every single option, taxation, non-taxation.

2785
03:31:06,535 --> 03:31:07,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Give me one minute.

2786
03:31:07,576 --> 03:31:11,038
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I think that would lead to a lot better results.

2787
03:31:11,178 --> 03:31:17,802
[SPEAKER_22]: It will help develop trust because we would see, you know, we will have an input, we'll be able to discuss with you.

2788
03:31:20,288 --> 03:31:26,489
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe we'll just improve how things work, and then there wouldn't be a need for meetings to run over as such.

2789
03:31:26,509 --> 03:31:28,530
[SPEAKER_22]: Because the city council is not new, right?

2790
03:31:28,690 --> 03:31:31,970
[SPEAKER_22]: So it has been going on since Medford was created?

2791
03:31:32,830 --> 03:31:33,610
[SPEAKER_22]: Since 1892.

2792
03:31:33,831 --> 03:31:34,791
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, thank you very much.

2793
03:31:34,811 --> 03:31:34,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Since 1892.

2794
03:31:36,731 --> 03:31:41,552
[SPEAKER_22]: So if it has worked up until now, then obviously it can be improved.

2795
03:31:41,912 --> 03:31:45,593
[SPEAKER_22]: But then discuss how to improve it, rather than, we have decided to improve it this way.

2796
03:31:46,073 --> 03:31:47,353
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you very much for listening.

2797
03:31:47,373 --> 03:31:47,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2798
03:31:48,772 --> 03:31:57,654
[SPEAKER_46]: I feel like you're engaging in good faith, and I want to engage back in good faith on a couple of things really quickly, which is just to say that the rules have changed over time.

2799
03:31:57,674 --> 03:32:00,855
[SPEAKER_46]: This charter's been in since 1987, passed in 1986.

2800
03:32:01,676 --> 03:32:03,496
[SPEAKER_46]: Before then, the council appointed a city manager.

2801
03:32:03,516 --> 03:32:04,876
[SPEAKER_46]: There's been a variety of approaches.

2802
03:32:05,377 --> 03:32:07,777
[SPEAKER_46]: I personally think part of democracy is trying new things.

2803
03:32:08,797 --> 03:32:15,019
[SPEAKER_46]: And Thomas Jefferson had the idea of a revolution every 30 years, because things need to change with the times.

2804
03:32:15,079 --> 03:32:17,420
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that's some of what we're seeing happen.

2805
03:32:18,240 --> 03:32:19,560
[SPEAKER_46]: in many places across the country.

2806
03:32:20,081 --> 03:32:30,343
[SPEAKER_46]: Just on the point of what you're saying, I think we are trying our best, and I think I would speak for every councilor here, that we are open to hearing from people about how we can do better on the housing issue.

2807
03:32:30,444 --> 03:32:35,165
[SPEAKER_46]: If you look at the governing agenda we put out, which hadn't been put out before, there's a number of things under there.

2808
03:32:35,525 --> 03:32:38,526
[SPEAKER_46]: You listed things I think you would agree with, and I would agree with.

2809
03:32:38,966 --> 03:32:40,386
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe things you would agree with, I would disagree with.

2810
03:32:40,406 --> 03:32:42,167
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe things I would agree with, you would disagree with.

2811
03:32:42,967 --> 03:32:44,709
[SPEAKER_46]: trying to get the full scope of the strategy.

2812
03:32:44,729 --> 03:32:55,201
[SPEAKER_46]: We are having the meetings on zoning reform to significantly look at reducing regulations and allowing more to happen in this community to advance climate goals and planning goals and walkability goals and things like that.

2813
03:32:55,622 --> 03:33:03,130
[SPEAKER_46]: We're also looking at things like the transfer fee because there's a political window of possibility of how the city can acquire funding

2814
03:33:03,991 --> 03:33:09,216
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't think it's an ideal policy, but it's not just to say that we should only implement ideal policies and like when it comes to town meeting.

2815
03:33:09,716 --> 03:33:25,090
[SPEAKER_46]: I've been in town meetings before, you know, there's a reason that the city incorporated in 1892 into a city we used to have a town meeting right there's places that have town meeting representative town meeting Council Manager Mayor Council, this city's charter is a mayor council and it's representative democracy so you know.

2816
03:33:25,819 --> 03:33:29,541
[SPEAKER_46]: I just think these are good things to debate, but I also think there's systems and structures in place.

2817
03:33:30,862 --> 03:33:40,628
[SPEAKER_46]: But I do think we're trying to be as transparent as we can and say that we're looking at a number of different ways to approach major challenges and trying to be as open with the community as we can by listing those things.

2818
03:33:40,708 --> 03:33:47,532
[SPEAKER_46]: And I personally don't think it's always, we've decided there's one specific path and we're not willing to debate details and approaches.

2819
03:33:47,592 --> 03:33:50,893
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that's what we wanna do and one of the reasons that we have these committee meetings.

2820
03:33:50,974 --> 03:33:55,216
[SPEAKER_46]: So I hope that we can get more people attending and sharing their opinions at them.

2821
03:33:56,462 --> 03:33:56,782
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2822
03:33:56,802 --> 03:33:59,824
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, then we'll go to Zoom.

2823
03:34:00,464 --> 03:34:00,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2824
03:34:00,825 --> 03:34:10,611
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to address one thing, because I'm feeling frustrated that I brought the rental registry here

2825
03:34:11,932 --> 03:34:14,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And I very purposefully did not decide a lot of things.

2826
03:34:15,453 --> 03:34:20,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not want to have come up with all the answers because I wanted to be part of the public process.

2827
03:34:20,974 --> 03:34:30,475
[SPEAKER_15]: So this you have already decided everything, that's why I couldn't answer questions about the details of rental registry because I don't want to come here having decided everything.

2828
03:34:30,695 --> 03:34:31,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the process.

2829
03:34:32,015 --> 03:34:33,256
[SPEAKER_15]: We get a number for something.

2830
03:34:34,116 --> 03:34:41,017
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's frustrating that dozens of people are coming out to say, don't give it a number so that it can be discussed.

2831
03:34:41,912 --> 03:34:43,215
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm having trouble with.

2832
03:34:43,476 --> 03:34:44,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to be able to give something a number.

2833
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:48,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we should not have all the details before we give it a number.

2834
03:34:48,549 --> 03:34:49,270
[SPEAKER_15]: But then I'm being...

2835
03:34:50,222 --> 03:34:53,903
[SPEAKER_15]: criticized that I don't have all the answers.

2836
03:34:54,223 --> 03:34:59,124
[SPEAKER_15]: But the reason I don't have all the answers is because I don't want to have come here having decided everything.

2837
03:34:59,444 --> 03:35:11,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to give it a number so that we can have a public process of many public meetings so that your opinions, the public opinions, can exactly be part of this process that you're talking about.

2838
03:35:11,988 --> 03:35:16,849
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's part of what I want to be able to do here is have fewer

2839
03:35:19,135 --> 03:35:31,183
[SPEAKER_15]: long extended discussions, and I'm not talking about this particular resolution, but fewer long extended discussions that prevent us, people saying, please do not begin a discussion about this.

2840
03:35:31,543 --> 03:35:34,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I would much rather people come to the discussion about it.

2841
03:35:34,465 --> 03:35:36,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, let's agree to have a discussion.

2842
03:35:36,467 --> 03:35:39,249
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can have the discussion where people can give their opinions.

2843
03:35:39,569 --> 03:35:41,951
[SPEAKER_15]: But to come here with dozens and dozens of people saying,

2844
03:35:43,171 --> 03:36:01,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever you do, you're a terrible person, if you agree to allow this to be discussed, I find it... This is why you might see me not, quote-unquote, listening to dozens of people, because all I'm voting for is for it to be allowed to be discussed.

2845
03:36:02,203 --> 03:36:10,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it should be discussed and that's for, you know, these other things, whether it's the real estate transfer fee, the rental registry.

2846
03:36:11,087 --> 03:36:16,090
[SPEAKER_15]: All I'm saying is, we should be able to discuss it in open public meetings.

2847
03:36:16,590 --> 03:36:22,533
[SPEAKER_15]: This is part of what I'm a little bit frustrated with is the idea that we're coming here having already decided and then suddenly it's like,

2848
03:36:23,193 --> 03:36:35,216
[SPEAKER_15]: to zero or six to one or five to two because we've already decided, but like all I wanted to do is discuss and be able to like have the open public forum that you are asking for.

2849
03:36:35,997 --> 03:36:37,657
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess that's it.

2850
03:36:37,737 --> 03:36:37,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

2851
03:36:39,738 --> 03:36:41,398
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins.

2852
03:36:42,218 --> 03:36:42,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2853
03:36:42,738 --> 03:36:51,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll try to keep this brief, but I think that we are touching on what seems to me to be an important topic kind of underwriting this council right now.

2854
03:36:51,901 --> 03:36:52,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that

2855
03:36:52,895 --> 03:36:58,876
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, as we have stated tonight and many other times, we're doing things a little bit differently this term.

2856
03:36:59,416 --> 03:37:03,137
[SPEAKER_18]: We have more in different committees where meeting in committee is way more often.

2857
03:37:03,157 --> 03:37:07,098
[SPEAKER_18]: We put out a governing agenda, which we'll continue to revise and update, which we've never done before.

2858
03:37:08,278 --> 03:37:10,098
[SPEAKER_18]: The council is going through growing pains.

2859
03:37:10,158 --> 03:37:21,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the committee is, the community is going through growing pains and seeing our evolution as a council and our workflow and trying to get used to that and trying to participate and understand, you know,

2860
03:37:21,756 --> 03:37:23,597
[SPEAKER_18]: what that looks like and how to plug into it.

2861
03:37:23,698 --> 03:37:31,483
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to acknowledge that as a thing that I think is going on and that it makes sense to be going on.

2862
03:37:31,543 --> 03:37:39,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is an important topic because I think that a lot of what people are wanting, we are trying to do.

2863
03:37:40,269 --> 03:37:44,813
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that there's some breakdowns in trust because I think that there's some

2864
03:37:46,229 --> 03:37:49,872
[SPEAKER_18]: messaging about what we're here to do, that is unfair and untrue, but has legs.

2865
03:37:49,992 --> 03:37:51,594
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, I hope we're going to work through that.

2866
03:37:52,094 --> 03:38:00,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that that makes it hard to communicate when we say, you know, I hear folks say, you know, we feel like we should be a part of the process and we're not a part of the process.

2867
03:38:00,782 --> 03:38:03,424
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this council is trying to, for example,

2868
03:38:04,116 --> 03:38:08,001
[SPEAKER_18]: make committees a place where people really do come together and get into the weeds with us.

2869
03:38:08,041 --> 03:38:09,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Historically, they haven't been that.

2870
03:38:09,583 --> 03:38:10,684
[SPEAKER_18]: The fellow counselors are right.

2871
03:38:10,924 --> 03:38:12,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually attendance is super low.

2872
03:38:12,486 --> 03:38:14,128
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we all really want to change that.

2873
03:38:14,528 --> 03:38:15,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we there right now?

2874
03:38:16,070 --> 03:38:17,111
[SPEAKER_18]: No, absolutely not.

2875
03:38:17,172 --> 03:38:17,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it need to get better?

2876
03:38:18,493 --> 03:38:19,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

2877
03:38:19,474 --> 03:38:23,799
[SPEAKER_18]: I really appreciate people calling that out and also making suggestions to say,

2878
03:38:24,520 --> 03:38:40,758
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, here's how we need to do this differently so that the energy and the input that we get at these meetings, what can we do differently and what just needs time so that that energy and that level of input is occurring in the place where it is on the schedule for us to get into the weeds together.

2879
03:38:41,098 --> 03:38:45,403
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we have some co-evolving to do to get to that place.

2880
03:38:48,260 --> 03:38:49,721
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that we'll get there.

2881
03:38:49,901 --> 03:39:04,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And for myself as one counselor for this group, I think that's an honest effort in good faith and to anybody from the community who is willing to bring that energy and that frustration and that irritation to help us get there, that's welcome.

2882
03:39:04,366 --> 03:39:16,690
[SPEAKER_18]: And just as an illustrative example, because for me as one counselor, it is frustrating to hear people say, we know this is a done deal or see what is sometimes a consensus and call it a conspiracy

2883
03:39:18,212 --> 03:39:26,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's fairly intuitive that people running, committing to do similar things, similar people voted for similar ideas.

2884
03:39:27,017 --> 03:39:29,298
[SPEAKER_18]: And so now there's plurality of that opinion on the council.

2885
03:39:29,738 --> 03:39:30,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that's a conspiracy.

2886
03:39:30,859 --> 03:39:33,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's statistics.

2887
03:39:33,600 --> 03:39:47,428
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's frustrating to me to hear, this is a done deal, this is something shady, for an example of, I think what we're trying to, I wish that we got more,

2888
03:39:48,484 --> 03:39:50,625
[SPEAKER_18]: attention all the times when we're stuck in the weeds.

2889
03:39:50,885 --> 03:40:02,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Council President Behrs mentioned earlier at the very beginning of the meeting 10 years ago, the report on the food trucks ordinance.

2890
03:40:02,691 --> 03:40:06,153
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been one particular constituent that's been hounding me for months about the food trucks ordinance.

2891
03:40:06,233 --> 03:40:06,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is it?

2892
03:40:06,693 --> 03:40:07,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is it?

2893
03:40:07,194 --> 03:40:08,014
[SPEAKER_18]: When's it going to get done?

2894
03:40:09,014 --> 03:40:09,935
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still working on it.

2895
03:40:10,155 --> 03:40:11,236
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still hearing from people.

2896
03:40:11,256 --> 03:40:13,137
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still hearing from staff.

2897
03:40:13,857 --> 03:40:15,318
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to give that the space that it needs.

2898
03:40:17,327 --> 03:40:32,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, I've gone on longer than I meant to, but I think that what we're talking about tonight, I think that we're circling around a topic that we are really earnestly trying to work through on the council, which is trying to get to a place where we can do this work together, we can bring in more people, we can put in the places where more people can be involved.

2899
03:40:32,539 --> 03:40:34,061
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for indulging me.

2900
03:40:34,361 --> 03:40:35,302
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

2901
03:40:35,322 --> 03:40:36,943
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Nadine on Zoom.

2902
03:40:36,963 --> 03:40:38,264
[SPEAKER_46]: Nadine, name and address for the record.

2903
03:40:38,284 --> 03:40:39,065
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

2904
03:40:42,626 --> 03:40:43,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thank you.

2905
03:40:43,567 --> 03:40:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Nadine Moretti, 126 Birgit Ave.

2906
03:40:47,009 --> 03:40:52,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to talk about what you had said a few minutes ago, Zach.

2907
03:40:53,434 --> 03:41:08,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You had mentioned that just because 25 people got up today, you know, tonight to speak, means that, you know, they're the only ones that are against this resolution amongst the other resolutions during all the past meetings that, you know, you've had a big number of people in chambers.

2908
03:41:09,486 --> 03:41:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely not the case that only 25 people are against this registry.

2909
03:41:13,507 --> 03:41:20,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably like, you know, countless numbers, but basically people aren't comfortable with public speaking.

2910
03:41:21,090 --> 03:41:25,131
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe they're at work, maybe they're home asleep because they have to work early.

2911
03:41:25,671 --> 03:41:27,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they know that despite all their

2912
03:41:29,013 --> 03:41:33,837
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking at the podium and on zoom, the opposing views will fall on deaf ears.

2913
03:41:33,877 --> 03:41:35,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's how we feel.

2914
03:41:35,758 --> 03:41:36,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2915
03:41:36,118 --> 03:41:37,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you say you hear everybody.

2916
03:41:37,899 --> 03:41:42,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It still isn't registering with us that anyone's listening to us except for one counselor.

2917
03:41:42,863 --> 03:41:46,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it keeps being said because we truly feel that

2918
03:41:47,694 --> 03:41:52,915
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, at least I do, that George cares the most and really wants to listen to the people in Medford.

2919
03:41:54,596 --> 03:41:58,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's wrong that you think that.

2920
03:41:58,277 --> 03:42:00,777
[SPEAKER_05]: 25 people got up tonight because they went to the meeting.

2921
03:42:00,817 --> 03:42:08,839
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 90 people on Zoom and there's people that just, you know, don't have any faith anymore in the council.

2922
03:42:08,899 --> 03:42:10,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to make that point.

2923
03:42:10,560 --> 03:42:10,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2924
03:42:12,349 --> 03:42:15,312
[SPEAKER_46]: Thanks, Nadine, and I apologize if I actually agree with you.

2925
03:42:15,332 --> 03:42:20,718
[SPEAKER_46]: I was trying to make the point that there are a lot of people who don't get to talk in the meeting, so I agree with you on that.

2926
03:42:21,318 --> 03:42:23,821
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, five minutes.

2927
03:42:27,044 --> 03:42:28,886
[SPEAKER_42]: Bill Carr, 47 Blakely Road.

2928
03:42:30,408 --> 03:42:31,128
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just looking at

2929
03:42:32,113 --> 03:42:34,995
[SPEAKER_42]: a brochure that was passed out at election time.

2930
03:42:35,816 --> 03:42:37,197
[SPEAKER_42]: And this city is in a major problem.

2931
03:42:37,237 --> 03:42:37,837
[SPEAKER_42]: George, it's all right.

2932
03:42:37,857 --> 03:42:38,537
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll be all right, George.

2933
03:42:39,018 --> 03:42:41,279
[SPEAKER_42]: I know, he looks at me, because we're old friends.

2934
03:42:41,319 --> 03:42:42,360
[SPEAKER_42]: He's worried about what I'm going to say.

2935
03:42:42,460 --> 03:42:43,061
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't worry, George.

2936
03:42:43,121 --> 03:42:43,601
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm all set.

2937
03:42:44,402 --> 03:42:50,826
[SPEAKER_43]: So anyway, it says right here, Zach Beers, Anna Callahan, Kit Collins, Emily Zell, Matt, Jacqueline, Justin.

2938
03:42:50,846 --> 03:42:51,907
[SPEAKER_43]: So this is your brochure.

2939
03:42:51,947 --> 03:43:00,513
[SPEAKER_43]: The first thing it says right off the bat, fix the budget process and raise revenue to fully fund school city services infrastructure.

2940
03:43:01,656 --> 03:43:06,819
[SPEAKER_43]: I asked for the chair, how many meetings have you had with the mayor in the last three months to do that?

2941
03:43:07,520 --> 03:43:11,022
[SPEAKER_46]: We have met since last March on the budget ordinance.

2942
03:43:11,042 --> 03:43:12,403
[SPEAKER_46]: We just passed it at our last meeting.

2943
03:43:12,423 --> 03:43:13,023
[SPEAKER_46]: Not the budget.

2944
03:43:13,123 --> 03:43:14,784
[SPEAKER_46]: No, it created a brand new budget process.

2945
03:43:14,804 --> 03:43:15,245
[SPEAKER_42]: No, no, no.

2946
03:43:15,285 --> 03:43:15,845
[SPEAKER_42]: To create revenue.

2947
03:43:15,865 --> 03:43:16,426
[SPEAKER_46]: No, hold on a minute.

2948
03:43:16,726 --> 03:43:17,226
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

2949
03:43:17,386 --> 03:43:17,686
[SPEAKER_46]: You read it.

2950
03:43:17,706 --> 03:43:18,567
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to answer your question.

2951
03:43:18,827 --> 03:43:18,967
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2952
03:43:19,047 --> 03:43:21,589
[SPEAKER_46]: It said fix the budget process and raise revenue to fund our schools.

2953
03:43:22,574 --> 03:43:44,968
[SPEAKER_46]: We just passed the first budget ordinance in the history of the city to fix the budget process we're starting budget meetings, April 15, two months earlier than we ever have for, and we just released a press release from the financial task force of the council leadership the school committee leadership and the mayor to discuss raising revenue to fund our schools, city services and our capital needs so literally in the last two weeks we've done exactly what that bullet point said.

2954
03:43:45,247 --> 03:43:48,391
[SPEAKER_43]: How many meetings have you had with the mayor to raise revenue?

2955
03:43:48,752 --> 03:43:49,933
[SPEAKER_43]: Because we're in a cash crunch.

2956
03:43:50,173 --> 03:43:50,774
[SPEAKER_43]: Just let me finish.

2957
03:43:51,375 --> 03:43:51,595
[SPEAKER_43]: Sure.

2958
03:43:51,836 --> 03:43:53,157
[SPEAKER_43]: So we're in a real crowd.

2959
03:43:53,278 --> 03:43:55,761
[SPEAKER_43]: We know the schools are in the hole, millions of dollars.

2960
03:43:56,161 --> 03:43:57,783
[SPEAKER_46]: It's not, it's about $215,000 in the deficit.

2961
03:43:57,803 --> 03:44:00,948
[SPEAKER_43]: We shouldn't be in the hole at all, but that's okay.

2962
03:44:00,968 --> 03:44:01,869
[SPEAKER_43]: So we shouldn't really be in the hole.

2963
03:44:03,066 --> 03:44:05,127
[SPEAKER_43]: We can't give the fire department a decent raise.

2964
03:44:05,167 --> 03:44:07,869
[SPEAKER_43]: We can't give our school teachers a different raise.

2965
03:44:07,949 --> 03:44:11,851
[SPEAKER_43]: What's happening is people leaving the city, they're not sending their kids to Meffitt High School.

2966
03:44:12,152 --> 03:44:13,452
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm a graduate of Meffitt High, so are you.

2967
03:44:13,893 --> 03:44:15,274
[SPEAKER_43]: They're afraid to send their kids there.

2968
03:44:15,694 --> 03:44:18,896
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, we need to raise revenue to make the schools more secure.

2969
03:44:19,176 --> 03:44:23,199
[SPEAKER_43]: We need to raise the revenue so we can keep teachers here, we can keep firefighters here.

2970
03:44:24,252 --> 03:44:28,734
[SPEAKER_43]: You had how many meetings since January 1st with the mayor to raise revenue?

2971
03:44:28,754 --> 03:44:32,156
[SPEAKER_43]: When I talk raise revenue, I come from a business perspective.

2972
03:44:33,036 --> 03:44:34,557
[SPEAKER_43]: We can talk about Assembly Square, George.

2973
03:44:34,577 --> 03:44:38,699
[SPEAKER_43]: How many hundreds of millions of dollars have come from that postage stamp in Solomon, George?

2974
03:44:39,299 --> 03:44:39,799
[SPEAKER_43]: Take a guess.

2975
03:44:41,740 --> 03:44:42,360
[SPEAKER_43]: Hundreds of millions.

2976
03:44:42,941 --> 03:44:46,182
[SPEAKER_43]: We have Mystic Gap, we have Memphis, we have this whole area that's underdeveloped.

2977
03:44:46,202 --> 03:44:47,803
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm just asking, how many meetings have you had with the mayor?

2978
03:44:48,351 --> 03:44:48,871
[SPEAKER_46]: with the mayor.

2979
03:44:49,091 --> 03:44:49,271
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah.

2980
03:44:49,872 --> 03:44:59,915
[SPEAKER_46]: In what like to raise revenue, real revenue to bring in developers to bring real if you want to put the with the mayor on it, I've had two or three financial task force meetings with Vice President Collins and the mayor.

2981
03:45:00,055 --> 03:45:09,598
[SPEAKER_46]: So we've also had two meetings on the zoning ordinance two minutes on the linkage for your ordinance, three meetings on the governing agenda, two meetings on budget recommendations where we requested a lot of the things you're talking about.

2982
03:45:09,638 --> 03:45:12,699
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, probably 1015 if you if you count what is this council done?

2983
03:45:13,559 --> 03:45:14,519
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll give you a perfect example.

2984
03:45:14,579 --> 03:45:15,520
[SPEAKER_43]: Rick Orlando is standing right here.

2985
03:45:15,540 --> 03:45:17,460
[SPEAKER_43]: This is how things get done in the last 40 years.

2986
03:45:17,480 --> 03:45:20,061
[SPEAKER_43]: There's only been a handful of products that have had any success in the city.

2987
03:45:20,421 --> 03:45:20,921
[SPEAKER_43]: Very few.

2988
03:45:21,701 --> 03:45:22,842
[SPEAKER_43]: He was one of the first ones.

2989
03:45:22,862 --> 03:45:25,342
[SPEAKER_46]: We approved two planned development districts so far this year.

2990
03:45:26,163 --> 03:45:30,764
[SPEAKER_43]: So you had nine meetings on the blowers.

2991
03:45:30,784 --> 03:45:32,404
[SPEAKER_43]: What do you guys use?

2992
03:45:32,444 --> 03:45:32,944
[SPEAKER_43]: What are they called?

2993
03:45:33,625 --> 03:45:34,525
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm pretty sure it was six.

2994
03:45:35,769 --> 03:46:04,634
[SPEAKER_43]: you need one you need one right here yes or no and that's it that there's no community there's no meaning just that you just you forward against and that you call it i agree with you but the people wanted to talk the new school the new schools got done because the gentleman right behind me and another lady decided to get together with a bunch of people like yourself and they went to the mayor's office they said we need new schools and it happened they figured out how to make it happen they got community what you need to do and i'm giving the council you're all young people you've been around just a little bit of time

2995
03:46:06,064 --> 03:46:08,065
[SPEAKER_43]: the mayor, find out what's got to be done.

2996
03:46:08,285 --> 03:46:13,146
[SPEAKER_43]: You don't need meetings on real estate and landscape blow dry.

2997
03:46:13,226 --> 03:46:13,687
[SPEAKER_43]: That's all.

2998
03:46:14,167 --> 03:46:15,067
[SPEAKER_43]: We don't need that stuff.

2999
03:46:15,307 --> 03:46:18,068
[SPEAKER_43]: We need real revenue coming to the city, and we are missing it.

3000
03:46:18,468 --> 03:46:20,909
[SPEAKER_43]: So all these little subcommittees, that's all great.

3001
03:46:21,189 --> 03:46:22,630
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not working for the city.

3002
03:46:23,050 --> 03:46:24,130
[SPEAKER_43]: We don't have enough money.

3003
03:46:24,290 --> 03:46:26,111
[SPEAKER_43]: We're struggling to pay for things.

3004
03:46:26,631 --> 03:46:28,131
[SPEAKER_43]: We can't give people decent wages.

3005
03:46:28,652 --> 03:46:31,773
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't give teachers, my parents are both teachers, you can't give a teacher a 2% raise.

3006
03:46:32,793 --> 03:46:33,433
[SPEAKER_43]: That's insane.

3007
03:46:33,873 --> 03:46:36,054
[SPEAKER_43]: They can't afford to live in their own city that they're teaching.

3008
03:46:36,954 --> 03:46:38,534
[SPEAKER_43]: So it's got to start from this group.

3009
03:46:38,834 --> 03:46:49,576
[SPEAKER_43]: You need to go to the mayor's office, whether you like it or you don't like it, and sit down and figure out what's going on, and hold her feet to the fire, and make her put a plan together with the council, work together.

3010
03:46:49,937 --> 03:46:51,637
[SPEAKER_43]: That's how Rick Orlando got the schools done.

3011
03:46:52,017 --> 03:46:53,517
[SPEAKER_43]: They raised $90 million.

3012
03:46:53,757 --> 03:46:55,178
[SPEAKER_43]: We got all new schools for the city.

3013
03:46:55,198 --> 03:46:57,058
[SPEAKER_43]: You probably don't know that because you didn't live here at that time.

3014
03:46:57,398 --> 03:47:00,401
[SPEAKER_46]: I was in the first fifth grade at the Brooks, and I'm a good friend of Beth Fuller.

3015
03:47:00,421 --> 03:47:02,483
[SPEAKER_43]: You benefited because of this gentleman right here.

3016
03:47:02,643 --> 03:47:06,787
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, and the building committee, and Orlando was the co-chair, Rick.

3017
03:47:07,007 --> 03:47:09,049
[SPEAKER_43]: Rick, how long did you work?

3018
03:47:09,069 --> 03:47:12,373
[SPEAKER_43]: How long did you work?

3019
03:47:12,453 --> 03:47:14,655
[SPEAKER_10]: About three years?

3020
03:47:15,175 --> 03:47:15,896
[SPEAKER_10]: How long?

3021
03:47:15,936 --> 03:47:16,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

3022
03:47:16,957 --> 03:47:18,498
[SPEAKER_46]: How much were you paid?

3023
03:47:21,781 --> 03:47:32,868
[SPEAKER_43]: I've been, I've been, I've engaged with you a little bit more time, but if you get people like Rick and other people that still care about the city that have a lot of knowledge, we can help you get this process pushed forward.

3024
03:47:33,309 --> 03:47:33,549
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

3025
03:47:33,589 --> 03:47:34,349
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't do it alone.

3026
03:47:34,389 --> 03:47:39,393
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't do it when you have these different agendas, whether that, whether I agree or disagree with them, you can't have these things.

3027
03:47:39,413 --> 03:47:40,954
[SPEAKER_43]: You've got to get everybody on board.

3028
03:47:40,974 --> 03:47:48,039
[SPEAKER_43]: And when you divide the city, you don't get people like myself and Rick and all these other people that good people want to come out and help you guys go forward.

3029
03:47:48,479 --> 03:47:50,660
[SPEAKER_43]: We will just come up here and fight you all the time.

3030
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:51,601
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's no good either.

3031
03:47:52,121 --> 03:47:52,802
[SPEAKER_43]: Nothing gets done.

3032
03:47:53,203 --> 03:48:00,131
[SPEAKER_46]: I would I would respectfully say that there's a lot of avenues where we're trying to do that and I would hope that we can consider all of our individual proposals and plans.

3033
03:48:00,151 --> 03:48:01,332
[SPEAKER_43]: How do you think the field's got built?

3034
03:48:01,532 --> 03:48:02,453
[SPEAKER_43]: How do you think the science does?

3035
03:48:06,698 --> 03:48:12,483
[SPEAKER_43]: Those are good community people, those are Medford old school people that came forward, and they wanted to do something good.

3036
03:48:12,783 --> 03:48:17,747
[SPEAKER_43]: You have a lot of people behind me that would do something, but if we keep this fight up, you're never going to get.

3037
03:48:17,947 --> 03:48:24,353
[SPEAKER_46]: I really hope folks applied for the building committee for the high school, we're going to have a lot of conversations coming out of the budget and the financial task force.

3038
03:48:24,893 --> 03:48:29,257
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we just need to consider everything on the merits, and I appreciate your input, and I hope that we can continue to do that.

3039
03:48:29,277 --> 03:48:31,799
[SPEAKER_43]: The school committee's got to put their agenda down, make the school safe.

3040
03:48:31,859 --> 03:48:33,000
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford High is not safe.

3041
03:48:33,400 --> 03:48:36,763
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't have people not coming to us, sending their kids to the high school.

3042
03:48:36,803 --> 03:48:37,804
[SPEAKER_43]: It's very unsafe up there.

3043
03:48:38,124 --> 03:48:40,025
[SPEAKER_43]: That's not a good image for the city.

3044
03:48:40,626 --> 03:48:42,487
[SPEAKER_43]: That's just one thing that could be changed very easily.

3045
03:48:42,688 --> 03:48:42,948
[SPEAKER_46]: Thanks.

3046
03:48:43,068 --> 03:48:43,488
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Bill.

3047
03:48:44,489 --> 03:48:46,591
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Tony Tanks on Zoom.

3048
03:48:48,596 --> 03:48:51,837
[SPEAKER_37]: I, again, thank you for this privilege that I'm going to enjoy.

3049
03:48:51,857 --> 03:48:54,678
[SPEAKER_37]: Hopefully it lasts five minutes.

3050
03:48:54,798 --> 03:48:58,319
[SPEAKER_37]: And I actually had a long list of points I wanted to present.

3051
03:48:58,640 --> 03:49:09,663
[SPEAKER_37]: Most of my points were covered eloquently by previous speakers, such as Mr. Jelomino, former Council Pantera, and former Council Pantera, and Mr. Carr, who just spoke.

3052
03:49:09,943 --> 03:49:11,344
[SPEAKER_37]: I really appreciate their input.

3053
03:49:11,424 --> 03:49:16,526
[SPEAKER_37]: And they have some common sense answers to

3054
03:49:17,873 --> 03:49:19,153
[SPEAKER_37]: this particular resolution.

3055
03:49:19,373 --> 03:49:42,499
[SPEAKER_37]: In the spirit and the reasons for it, I'm not going to go on and repeat what they said, but I do believe that this council would have better success in regaining some of the faith of this community by retracting this resolution and coming up with alternate ways to ensure that residents have available time to speak fairly.

3056
03:49:43,379 --> 03:49:46,060
[SPEAKER_37]: I know there's other ways to do it and some of them were mentioned,

3057
03:49:47,094 --> 03:49:53,717
[SPEAKER_37]: I do want to state and be clear, though, I am formally opposed to this resolution, and I hope alternate means can be found.

3058
03:49:53,857 --> 03:49:55,338
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you again for the ability to speak.

3059
03:49:56,438 --> 03:49:57,038
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you very much.

3060
03:49:57,879 --> 03:49:59,239
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to the podium.

3061
03:50:00,160 --> 03:50:01,240
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3062
03:50:01,260 --> 03:50:02,661
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Orlando, you have five minutes.

3063
03:50:03,517 --> 03:50:12,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Richard Orlando, Winford Way, Medford, Bill, Mr. Carr, thank you, but there are a lot of other people involved with that project, aside from myself.

3064
03:50:12,630 --> 03:50:17,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I happen to be the face many times, but a lot of great people, both within and outside of the government.

3065
03:50:18,457 --> 03:50:20,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just just a point.

3066
03:50:20,459 --> 03:50:25,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about democratic process, representative government and so on.

3067
03:50:25,364 --> 03:50:35,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And through you to Councilor Callahan, I'm glad you talked about the process to bring it to a committee, release it from this group to a subcommittee.

3068
03:50:37,506 --> 03:50:51,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think the people in this community that have been listening to these last few meetings with hundreds of people here have any confidence and trust that what you're going to do in the subcommittees is going to be representative of their interests?

3069
03:50:52,636 --> 03:50:53,777
[SPEAKER_10]: The trust is not there.

3070
03:50:54,817 --> 03:50:58,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you may need to figure out how to bring that back, but the trust is not there.

3071
03:50:59,501 --> 03:51:02,703
[SPEAKER_10]: What you do here, we're going to see you do in those subcommittees.

3072
03:51:02,783 --> 03:51:03,503
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the feeling.

3073
03:51:05,785 --> 03:51:09,147
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you need to think about trust without trust.

3074
03:51:11,288 --> 03:51:16,772
[SPEAKER_10]: The opinion is this council doesn't care for Medford, doesn't care for the community, and doesn't care for the citizens.

3075
03:51:17,852 --> 03:51:24,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And I find it interesting when we talk about debate, disagreement, it's almost like those are results.

3076
03:51:25,737 --> 03:51:28,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Those aren't results, that's stagnation.

3077
03:51:29,739 --> 03:51:33,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Creating results are the kinds of things that Mr. Carr did with the field of dreams.

3078
03:51:34,704 --> 03:51:39,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Creating results are doing things through the schools with all of the good people.

3079
03:51:39,907 --> 03:51:43,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at what's going on in the schools now and it breaks my heart.

3080
03:51:44,170 --> 03:51:50,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at 10, 15 years ago, how the schools, the growth in there, the educational programs and so on were going.

3081
03:51:50,654 --> 03:51:51,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are results.

3082
03:51:52,515 --> 03:51:59,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Debate, disagreement as a badge of accomplishment, sorry, that's coming up short.

3083
03:52:00,080 --> 03:52:01,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last point,

3084
03:52:02,315 --> 03:52:19,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Khamid is that you have a lot of people that are being put off for helping because they don't feel that either whether it's a council, the person in the corner office over there even cares about reaching out to people that can help.

3085
03:52:20,128 --> 03:52:31,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And volunteerism, that was an amazing, when you work with a group of people that accomplish great things, it's wonderful.

3086
03:52:32,219 --> 03:52:35,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, I'm not seeing that go on in the city, and it's sad.

3087
03:52:36,060 --> 03:52:37,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just hope that can change.

3088
03:52:37,361 --> 03:52:37,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

3089
03:52:38,301 --> 03:52:39,161
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Orlando.

3090
03:52:41,262 --> 03:52:44,583
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not going to recognize this name.

3091
03:52:44,603 --> 03:52:48,644
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Ron Giovino on Zoom.

3092
03:52:49,164 --> 03:52:50,385
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3093
03:52:50,445 --> 03:52:51,025
[SPEAKER_46]: Five minutes.

3094
03:52:57,433 --> 03:53:01,456
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Ron Givino, 326 East Border Road, Medford, Mass.

3095
03:53:02,637 --> 03:53:07,660
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try to get back on this topic of this agenda, which is public participation.

3096
03:53:08,461 --> 03:53:26,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Since this council has been in session, we've had the Gaza issue, the fire chief issue, the property transfer fee issue, the rental registry issue, and soon to be public participation issue that have all gone over 90 minutes.

3097
03:53:27,645 --> 03:53:33,089
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just wondering which citizen would you tell to be quiet because we've reached the 90 minute limit.

3098
03:53:33,649 --> 03:53:38,432
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the timing of this is incredibly poor.

3099
03:53:38,853 --> 03:53:44,977
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that it's unacceptable to assume that people will not have a voice anymore in this city.

3100
03:53:45,237 --> 03:53:46,738
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's a bad step for you.

3101
03:53:47,178 --> 03:53:56,965
[SPEAKER_19]: I also would remind the public that despite comments from the president of the city council, the Medford Charter Review Committee

3102
03:53:57,785 --> 03:54:04,849
[SPEAKER_19]: is working diligently and hard and do and will have a say in the future of how this government is run.

3103
03:54:05,390 --> 03:54:14,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Things like how to get on the agenda, things like how much time you get to talk at a city council meeting, things like how long a discussion will be, will all be on there.

3104
03:54:14,355 --> 03:54:23,420
[SPEAKER_19]: So I encourage the public to, if they're looking for another place to voice their opinion, the Medford Charter Committee is the place to do it.

3105
03:54:23,480 --> 03:54:24,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

3106
03:54:26,681 --> 03:54:30,923
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Ron, and the council looks forward to considering the recommendations of the Charter Study Committee.

3107
03:54:30,943 --> 03:54:32,965
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3108
03:54:37,387 --> 03:54:40,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street in Medford.

3109
03:54:40,749 --> 03:54:50,395
[SPEAKER_06]: The night of the transfer tax, I didn't get to talk till 1230 at night, but I'd like to think that the information and the education I was able to give this council

3110
03:54:51,055 --> 03:54:54,597
[SPEAKER_06]: was taken into consideration and I'd like to think it was helpful.

3111
03:54:55,218 --> 03:55:01,721
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had a 90 minute roll, I never would have been able to speak and I stayed here all night long.

3112
03:55:02,162 --> 03:55:07,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't speak just on behalf of myself, but on a lot of property owners and a lot of tenants in this city.

3113
03:55:08,125 --> 03:55:14,169
[SPEAKER_06]: People that can't find their voice, they're not gonna send you an email, they're not gonna come to this podium.

3114
03:55:14,729 --> 03:55:18,672
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll call me, they'll call somebody they know, can you go speak for me?

3115
03:55:19,412 --> 03:55:23,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an 81-year-old lady ask me the other day, Cal, I give you my proxy.

3116
03:55:23,256 --> 03:55:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need me to sign it?

3117
03:55:24,797 --> 03:55:27,440
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't need you to sign it, but I will go.

3118
03:55:28,421 --> 03:55:33,466
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these people, they need a voice, but they don't have a voice here.

3119
03:55:33,987 --> 03:55:36,289
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't feel like they can walk in the door.

3120
03:55:36,910 --> 03:55:39,973
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about trust, that

3121
03:55:40,413 --> 03:55:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just asking for a discussion.

3122
03:55:43,237 --> 03:55:44,178
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we heard.

3123
03:55:44,258 --> 03:55:46,881
[SPEAKER_06]: President beer is the night of the transfer tax.

3124
03:55:46,941 --> 03:55:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You said we're only here to open a discussion.

3125
03:55:51,067 --> 03:55:51,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you said.

3126
03:55:53,837 --> 03:55:56,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Zaro wrote a blog.

3127
03:55:56,718 --> 03:55:59,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We are crafting this ordinance.

3128
03:55:59,599 --> 03:56:03,061
[SPEAKER_06]: We voted to craft a transfer fee ordinance.

3129
03:56:03,721 --> 03:56:05,042
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have a new discussion.

3130
03:56:05,222 --> 03:56:06,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we crafting an ordinance?

3131
03:56:07,122 --> 03:56:08,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big question.

3132
03:56:08,843 --> 03:56:10,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You are doing things differently.

3133
03:56:11,424 --> 03:56:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Never ever in the history of the city of Medford have I seen more than

3134
03:56:15,926 --> 03:56:21,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The council work on three or four different things, and they're usually things to improve the city.

3135
03:56:21,490 --> 03:56:23,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not things to change the city.

3136
03:56:24,092 --> 03:56:36,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen so many housing issues in front of a local city council, we have three branches of government because every branch has different resources, different funds

3137
03:56:36,658 --> 03:56:39,602
[SPEAKER_06]: in access to different specialized people.

3138
03:56:40,182 --> 03:56:43,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked a couple of state representatives and a couple of state senators.

3139
03:56:44,407 --> 03:56:49,273
[SPEAKER_06]: If a housing issue comes into your house, what do you do with it?

3140
03:56:50,074 --> 03:56:52,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We put aside money, we send it for a study.

3141
03:56:53,017 --> 03:56:55,260
[SPEAKER_06]: They send it out to other people.

3142
03:56:56,041 --> 03:57:00,803
[SPEAKER_06]: that have the knowledge and the expertise to bring back the information to them.

3143
03:57:01,223 --> 03:57:07,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And if on the state level, that's what they're doing, I question if any of this is local level.

3144
03:57:08,066 --> 03:57:14,109
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at the agenda and you look at everything that has been put forth, and we're only on April 2.

3145
03:57:15,703 --> 03:57:16,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot.

3146
03:57:17,185 --> 03:57:20,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that you're proud of this big governing agenda.

3147
03:57:20,169 --> 03:57:26,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I have read pages 12 through 15, because all your housing issues are there, but it's too much.

3148
03:57:27,538 --> 03:57:29,701
[SPEAKER_06]: People do not like change.

3149
03:57:30,241 --> 03:57:31,683
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to be heard.

3150
03:57:32,264 --> 03:57:33,926
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got this big, long agenda.

3151
03:57:34,787 --> 03:57:55,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe you might find some more balance by picking what's most important and what's beneficial and what can actually be accomplished within the next 12 months and lowering the agenda before telling people that they can't come to the podium and speak anymore, that their voice isn't valued, that if they don't get here,

3152
03:57:55,934 --> 03:57:59,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seven o'clock and there's not already 200 people here to speak.

3153
03:58:00,158 --> 03:58:01,680
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not get to be heard.

3154
03:58:02,100 --> 03:58:03,421
[SPEAKER_06]: The email doesn't always work.

3155
03:58:03,842 --> 03:58:06,224
[SPEAKER_06]: We met the 80 year old lady that doesn't even have a computer.

3156
03:58:06,264 --> 03:58:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been here twice, right?

3157
03:58:08,386 --> 03:58:13,571
[SPEAKER_06]: How many other people are across the street that they were not heard at all during COVID?

3158
03:58:13,591 --> 03:58:15,633
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do Zoom.

3159
03:58:16,194 --> 03:58:17,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make them wrong?

3160
03:58:17,795 --> 03:58:18,016
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

3161
03:58:19,414 --> 03:58:20,534
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be heard too.

3162
03:58:21,235 --> 03:58:27,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to ask you, please don't put a 90 minute limit that if you're not here to be heard 90 minutes, you can't be heard.

3163
03:58:28,237 --> 03:58:29,618
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe the forums.

3164
03:58:29,738 --> 03:58:31,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the whole idea of the forum.

3165
03:58:31,398 --> 03:58:40,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do because then maybe, you know, Javier, the guy who was the, he's on the board of directors for the affordable housing council.

3166
03:58:40,381 --> 03:58:42,282
[SPEAKER_46]: I was going to say it was George's moving van driver.

3167
03:58:45,732 --> 03:58:48,734
[SPEAKER_46]: He joked that he drove Georgia's moving van.

3168
03:58:48,974 --> 03:58:49,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

3169
03:58:49,474 --> 03:58:51,416
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but Harvey, what a great resource.

3170
03:58:51,436 --> 03:58:53,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't you like to sit down and have a conversation with him?

3171
03:58:54,258 --> 03:58:56,099
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I look at these subcommittee meetings.

3172
03:58:56,299 --> 03:59:00,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how in a one hour frame, you're going to talk about transfer tax.

3173
03:59:01,243 --> 03:59:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three and a half hours here that night.

3174
03:59:03,304 --> 03:59:06,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you're going to take it and put in a subcommittee that's only an hour long.

3175
03:59:06,086 --> 03:59:07,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand it.

3176
03:59:08,888 --> 03:59:11,450
[SPEAKER_46]: But the subcommittees, the committees last as long as they need to last.

3177
03:59:11,570 --> 03:59:12,531
[SPEAKER_46]: So they're not just one hour.

3178
03:59:12,591 --> 03:59:14,192
[SPEAKER_46]: They could be five hours if they need to be.

3179
03:59:14,943 --> 03:59:18,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you please not put a 90 minute limit?

3180
03:59:18,226 --> 03:59:19,628
[SPEAKER_46]: I have one vote.

3181
03:59:19,748 --> 03:59:26,415
[SPEAKER_06]: But topics need to be discussed to the point of exhaustion if you're going to make laws.

3182
03:59:27,860 --> 03:59:29,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it's funny.

3183
03:59:29,800 --> 03:59:33,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that I give a lot of my time to kind of this podium for other people.

3184
03:59:33,861 --> 03:59:37,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't appreciate the two counselors that are sitting here laughing at me.

3185
03:59:37,542 --> 03:59:38,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

3186
03:59:38,742 --> 03:59:39,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3187
03:59:39,742 --> 03:59:45,363
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Bianca Sasso on Zoom.

3188
03:59:46,064 --> 03:59:47,824
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3189
03:59:48,944 --> 03:59:49,844
[SPEAKER_49]: Can you hear me?

3190
03:59:51,285 --> 03:59:51,605
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3191
03:59:51,905 --> 03:59:52,965
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3192
03:59:52,985 --> 03:59:53,585
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3193
03:59:54,008 --> 03:59:56,269
[SPEAKER_49]: My name's Bianca Sasso, 8 Madison Street.

3194
03:59:57,750 --> 04:00:04,073
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it's really important that we do keep the 90 minutes and, or, sorry.

3195
04:00:05,131 --> 04:00:13,818
[SPEAKER_49]: We keep the five minutes speaking time because the most important part of democracy, as democracy keeps coming up as a theme, is the citizens, especially with trust as well.

3196
04:00:13,858 --> 04:00:15,119
[SPEAKER_49]: That's also another running theme.

3197
04:00:15,580 --> 04:00:21,004
[SPEAKER_49]: How are we supposed to trust you if we continue to talk about things that the majority don't want to talk to?

3198
04:00:21,024 --> 04:00:28,930
[SPEAKER_49]: You guys can say it's not the majority, but almost every single person who has come up and spoke has been against the things that you guys are trying to pass.

3199
04:00:29,811 --> 04:00:31,473
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it's really important that we keep

3200
04:00:32,213 --> 04:00:35,255
[SPEAKER_49]: time for people to talk and we don't restrict things for 90 minutes.

3201
04:00:35,355 --> 04:00:37,997
[SPEAKER_49]: It is so important that we continue to talk about these issues.

3202
04:00:39,618 --> 04:00:50,765
[SPEAKER_49]: I also think, going back to what Mr. Carr was saying, to me he represents what many of the citizens of Medford are trying to get through to you guys, that we don't want to focus on things like this.

3203
04:00:51,266 --> 04:00:52,526
[SPEAKER_49]: We don't want to focus on landlords.

3204
04:00:52,546 --> 04:00:54,188
[SPEAKER_49]: We don't want to focus on our time limit.

3205
04:00:54,208 --> 04:00:58,831
[SPEAKER_49]: We want to focus on the high school, things like the square, adding revenue to our city.

3206
04:00:59,775 --> 04:01:05,679
[SPEAKER_49]: That's all I really wanted to say because everyone else kind of, I didn't want to really want to reiterate everything everyone else said.

3207
04:01:07,661 --> 04:01:08,041
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3208
04:01:08,061 --> 04:01:11,724
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

3209
04:01:11,744 --> 04:01:12,644
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

3210
04:01:14,005 --> 04:01:15,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Kelly Allen, Century Street.

3211
04:01:16,027 --> 04:01:17,228
[SPEAKER_16]: I have lived here many years.

3212
04:01:17,928 --> 04:01:22,351
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never been up here to speak in all the years I've lived here.

3213
04:01:24,453 --> 04:01:25,894
[SPEAKER_16]: I've watched many of these people

3214
04:01:26,954 --> 04:01:27,494
[SPEAKER_16]: for years.

3215
04:01:27,775 --> 04:01:33,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I volunteered my time for with everything, anything that someone needed.

3216
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:34,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been there.

3217
04:01:34,259 --> 04:01:34,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I've done it.

3218
04:01:35,680 --> 04:01:36,821
[SPEAKER_16]: No one trusts you.

3219
04:01:37,462 --> 04:01:37,842
[SPEAKER_16]: No one.

3220
04:01:39,123 --> 04:01:42,345
[SPEAKER_16]: You have improved that you can be trusted with your time.

3221
04:01:43,106 --> 04:01:44,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Wake up Medford.

3222
04:01:44,327 --> 04:01:47,069
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time to take the city back.

3223
04:01:48,143 --> 04:01:49,764
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time to be heard.

3224
04:01:50,344 --> 04:01:51,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Show up at these subcommittees.

3225
04:01:52,805 --> 04:01:54,445
[SPEAKER_16]: They need to be shaken up.

3226
04:01:54,905 --> 04:01:55,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Show up.

3227
04:01:56,146 --> 04:01:56,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Come out.

3228
04:01:57,866 --> 04:01:59,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Figure out what they're planning.

3229
04:01:59,707 --> 04:02:00,587
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the next step?

3230
04:02:01,928 --> 04:02:03,168
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to be involved.

3231
04:02:03,708 --> 04:02:04,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody show up.

3232
04:02:06,169 --> 04:02:06,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

3233
04:02:06,729 --> 04:02:07,190
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3234
04:02:07,210 --> 04:02:10,651
[SPEAKER_46]: We're gonna go to Jennifer Yanko on Zoom.

3235
04:02:10,691 --> 04:02:12,631
[SPEAKER_46]: Jennifer, name and address for the record, please.

3236
04:02:12,651 --> 04:02:13,692
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3237
04:02:18,186 --> 04:02:18,786
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

3238
04:02:21,048 --> 04:02:24,970
[SPEAKER_51]: I would like to simply voice my support for the council.

3239
04:02:25,871 --> 04:02:28,412
[SPEAKER_51]: I have lived in Medford for over 30 years.

3240
04:02:28,432 --> 04:02:29,373
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm a homeowner.

3241
04:02:30,153 --> 04:02:31,454
[SPEAKER_51]: I raised my daughter here.

3242
04:02:31,594 --> 04:02:33,115
[SPEAKER_51]: She's raising her children here.

3243
04:02:35,096 --> 04:02:38,458
[SPEAKER_51]: I've been involved in Medford Affairs for many, many years.

3244
04:02:39,179 --> 04:02:43,902
[SPEAKER_51]: And I want to say that I feel that this council is in fact hearing people.

3245
04:02:44,582 --> 04:02:46,063
[SPEAKER_51]: They are in fact listening.

3246
04:02:46,653 --> 04:02:50,016
[SPEAKER_51]: They are in fact interested in doing what's best for Medford.

3247
04:02:50,076 --> 04:02:56,503
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think it's an opportunity for us all to work together rather than assuming the worst.

3248
04:02:57,544 --> 04:03:07,894
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think that it's really important that we figure out a way to work together and to really extend each other.

3249
04:03:08,752 --> 04:03:16,578
[SPEAKER_51]: the benefit of the doubt rather than assuming from the get-go that people don't have our best interests in mind.

3250
04:03:17,278 --> 04:03:25,003
[SPEAKER_51]: And I would like to just affirm the work of the council.

3251
04:03:25,744 --> 04:03:28,446
[SPEAKER_51]: And I really appreciate each of your work.

3252
04:03:30,467 --> 04:03:30,908
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

3253
04:03:33,029 --> 04:03:33,489
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3254
04:03:33,509 --> 04:03:34,830
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3255
04:03:34,850 --> 04:03:35,551
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3256
04:03:37,093 --> 04:03:38,594
[SPEAKER_32]: Ricky Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave.

3257
04:03:39,154 --> 04:03:43,215
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to first point out that Councilor Scott Kelly, you were incorrect earlier.

3258
04:03:43,256 --> 04:03:45,096
[SPEAKER_32]: You mentioned that you guys haven't accomplished anything.

3259
04:03:46,037 --> 04:03:55,781
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys were very successful in giving the school committee a giant raise and getting, well, at least one teacher or maybe two aides terminated because they won't have enough money in the upcoming budget.

3260
04:03:56,481 --> 04:04:01,463
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that money you've given them is a small amount, but that amount still adds up to at least one teacher.

3261
04:04:01,623 --> 04:04:03,764
[SPEAKER_32]: So congratulations on that success.

3262
04:04:06,667 --> 04:04:14,009
[SPEAKER_32]: President Beers, you mentioned that two years ago, or probably less than two years ago, you were able to reduce the time from 10 minutes to five minutes, and very few people said anything.

3263
04:04:15,009 --> 04:04:15,709
[SPEAKER_32]: Congratulations.

3264
04:04:16,149 --> 04:04:17,929
[SPEAKER_32]: Not I, but it was a unanimous vote.

3265
04:04:18,150 --> 04:04:19,490
[SPEAKER_32]: Great, congratulations.

3266
04:04:19,510 --> 04:04:23,491
[SPEAKER_32]: Of a council that included- And now there's an uproar because you want to reduce it again.

3267
04:04:23,551 --> 04:04:27,011
[SPEAKER_32]: Less than two years later, you want to reduce it again from five minutes to two minutes.

3268
04:04:27,051 --> 04:04:28,332
[SPEAKER_46]: Not I, but thank you.

3269
04:04:28,532 --> 04:04:33,693
[SPEAKER_32]: As a council, I'm just saying what you would mention, the 10 minutes down to five minutes without an uproar, that's what you mentioned.

3270
04:04:34,997 --> 04:04:39,580
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, less than two years later, you want to bring it from five minutes down to two minutes, or we'll compromise and go to three minutes.

3271
04:04:40,841 --> 04:04:42,182
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe we'll only wait a year.

3272
04:04:42,202 --> 04:04:45,765
[SPEAKER_32]: If nobody says anything, we'll bring it down to one minute, and then no minutes.

3273
04:04:47,005 --> 04:04:48,126
[SPEAKER_32]: That's where it seems like we're headed.

3274
04:04:49,567 --> 04:04:56,232
[SPEAKER_32]: So I sat through hundreds and hundreds of city council meetings, filming them for years.

3275
04:04:57,953 --> 04:05:00,615
[SPEAKER_32]: It was rare to see the council chambers filled like this.

3276
04:05:01,576 --> 04:05:03,197
[SPEAKER_32]: Certainly not week after week after week.

3277
04:05:04,329 --> 04:05:05,730
[SPEAKER_32]: And I thought to myself, why is that?

3278
04:05:06,751 --> 04:05:15,259
[SPEAKER_32]: During those times, the council heard the people, they heard from companies, they heard from the mayor, they got ideas and they acted on those.

3279
04:05:15,499 --> 04:05:20,203
[SPEAKER_32]: They didn't bring their own agenda, their own playbook of things that they want to change.

3280
04:05:21,221 --> 04:05:24,163
[SPEAKER_32]: and put that out every single week, week after week.

3281
04:05:24,223 --> 04:05:29,467
[SPEAKER_32]: They would hear things, they would hear the hospitals closing, and let's bring people together and see how we can fight against hospital closing.

3282
04:05:29,948 --> 04:05:32,329
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's deal with the Green Line extension.

3283
04:05:32,369 --> 04:05:33,730
[SPEAKER_32]: How are we gonna work with that?

3284
04:05:34,271 --> 04:05:35,892
[SPEAKER_32]: Those were the discussions that happened in here.

3285
04:05:37,053 --> 04:05:42,317
[SPEAKER_32]: Not just, this is what we wanna do, and we're gonna go out there, and we're gonna push, push, push, and we're just gonna make this happen.

3286
04:05:43,057 --> 04:05:49,182
[SPEAKER_32]: It would save a bunch of time if you guys would just do your whole agenda in one night, say, pass it all through six to one, and we're all done.

3287
04:05:50,512 --> 04:05:52,493
[SPEAKER_32]: We know it's a done deal, and yes, it's a done deal.

3288
04:05:52,693 --> 04:05:53,274
[SPEAKER_32]: We know this.

3289
04:05:53,854 --> 04:05:55,435
[SPEAKER_32]: Nothing we say is going to change anything.

3290
04:05:55,675 --> 04:05:58,177
[SPEAKER_32]: You said we could talk for three days straight.

3291
04:05:59,058 --> 04:06:02,400
[SPEAKER_32]: A disagreement is a disagreement, and it's gonna be my way, and that's the way it is.

3292
04:06:02,460 --> 04:06:04,241
[SPEAKER_46]: I said we could talk for three days straight.

3293
04:06:04,281 --> 04:06:05,242
[SPEAKER_46]: We may not agree on everything.

3294
04:06:05,282 --> 04:06:06,562
[SPEAKER_46]: We may not get to a point of agreement.

3295
04:06:06,582 --> 04:06:07,863
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, and nothing's going to change.

3296
04:06:08,083 --> 04:06:08,544
[SPEAKER_46]: That's not true.

3297
04:06:08,564 --> 04:06:09,644
[SPEAKER_32]: You're still gonna pass it through.

3298
04:06:09,845 --> 04:06:10,385
[SPEAKER_46]: That's how it works.

3299
04:06:10,425 --> 04:06:11,345
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Krumman, it changed tonight.

3300
04:06:12,206 --> 04:06:13,927
[SPEAKER_46]: The initial proposal was two minutes, now it's three minutes.

3301
04:06:13,947 --> 04:06:15,288
[SPEAKER_46]: It changed because people spoke.

3302
04:06:15,568 --> 04:06:15,808
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

3303
04:06:16,129 --> 04:06:16,689
[SPEAKER_46]: So it changed.

3304
04:06:16,989 --> 04:06:17,169
[SPEAKER_46]: Right.

3305
04:06:17,249 --> 04:06:18,110
[SPEAKER_46]: So there's evidence.

3306
04:06:19,059 --> 04:06:21,201
[SPEAKER_32]: Still reducing it, still reducing.

3307
04:06:23,542 --> 04:06:34,971
[SPEAKER_32]: It's just this every week you guys just come in creating problems that don't exist, changing things for no reason.

3308
04:06:35,511 --> 04:06:38,834
[SPEAKER_32]: The city was great before and the chambers weren't that full.

3309
04:06:38,874 --> 04:06:39,875
[SPEAKER_32]: That's because people were happy.

3310
04:06:39,895 --> 04:06:41,196
[SPEAKER_32]: They had no reason to come up here and complain.

3311
04:06:42,861 --> 04:06:43,721
[SPEAKER_32]: That's why they weren't here.

3312
04:06:43,942 --> 04:06:47,423
[SPEAKER_32]: So you guys were able to sneak in, get your 7,500 votes, get in, take these seats.

3313
04:06:47,723 --> 04:06:48,804
[SPEAKER_32]: Congratulations, you did that.

3314
04:06:49,284 --> 04:06:51,425
[SPEAKER_32]: And you're appeasing to the 7,500 people that voted for you.

3315
04:06:51,625 --> 04:06:52,006
[SPEAKER_32]: That's great.

3316
04:06:53,046 --> 04:06:57,709
[SPEAKER_32]: The 60,000 people, 40,000 other people that didn't vote for you, they didn't vote.

3317
04:06:58,029 --> 04:06:58,649
[SPEAKER_32]: That's our fault.

3318
04:06:59,850 --> 04:07:02,611
[SPEAKER_32]: And some of the people that did vote for you have come up and said, oops, we made a mistake.

3319
04:07:02,711 --> 04:07:03,471
[SPEAKER_32]: We shouldn't have voted for you.

3320
04:07:04,392 --> 04:07:05,612
[SPEAKER_32]: So hopefully next time it'll go better.

3321
04:07:08,302 --> 04:07:10,064
[SPEAKER_32]: Hopefully we can not change the time.

3322
04:07:10,685 --> 04:07:11,867
[SPEAKER_32]: At least not the 90 minutes.

3323
04:07:11,927 --> 04:07:16,113
[SPEAKER_32]: The 90 minutes will be a big part because three minutes, that's 30 people can talk and that's it.

3324
04:07:16,293 --> 04:07:22,642
[SPEAKER_32]: If there's actually somebody that supports you guys, that's 15 people on each side and that's really not a lot of people, so.

3325
04:07:23,991 --> 04:07:25,012
[SPEAKER_32]: three minutes, 30 times.

3326
04:07:25,713 --> 04:07:25,973
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3327
04:07:26,294 --> 04:07:26,774
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3328
04:07:27,655 --> 04:07:30,659
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to school committee member and Toppa name and address for the record.

3329
04:07:30,699 --> 04:07:33,983
[SPEAKER_46]: Please welcome for your first time as a school committee member and congratulations.

3330
04:07:34,083 --> 04:07:34,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

3331
04:07:35,344 --> 04:07:38,848
[SPEAKER_27]: John Ellen Toppa, 12 Murray Hill Road, Medford.

3332
04:07:39,849 --> 04:07:40,911
[SPEAKER_27]: I just wanted to take a moment

3333
04:07:41,691 --> 04:07:46,834
[SPEAKER_27]: and voice my opposition for the current bill as it stands.

3334
04:07:48,034 --> 04:07:54,878
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel like while I appreciate the amendment of having two to three minutes, I feel like that the

3335
04:07:56,750 --> 04:08:01,032
[SPEAKER_27]: especially have strong disregard for the 90 minute cap.

3336
04:08:01,152 --> 04:08:07,795
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of I understand where it comes from, I can sympathize with a lot of the issues that come with 1 a.m.

3337
04:08:07,815 --> 04:08:08,236
[SPEAKER_27]: meetings.

3338
04:08:09,236 --> 04:08:13,618
[SPEAKER_27]: I also worry about the discomfort of someone who has waited those 90 minutes and their opportunities cut off.

3339
04:08:15,039 --> 04:08:19,421
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm lucky that I have spoken up here a few times and can get my point across in three minutes.

3340
04:08:19,921 --> 04:08:22,963
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that for a lot of people who may wanna speak for the first time,

3341
04:08:23,963 --> 04:08:35,052
[SPEAKER_27]: a two-minute conversation can take five, and that's sort of where I'm at with that, but wanted to appreciate the studies that were brought in and appreciate what was going on.

3342
04:08:35,112 --> 04:08:36,053
[SPEAKER_27]: However, I feel like this

3343
04:08:37,523 --> 04:08:44,385
[SPEAKER_27]: proposed motion as it stands with the single amendment does not seem fit and I'd worry about the effect it may have.

3344
04:08:44,485 --> 04:08:46,105
[SPEAKER_27]: The timing, of course, is a huge thing.

3345
04:08:46,225 --> 04:08:47,546
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why there's a lot of discomfort.

3346
04:08:47,586 --> 04:08:48,466
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a lot of anger.

3347
04:08:49,926 --> 04:08:59,809
[SPEAKER_27]: And I wonder where that would be, if this would be proposed later, as well as other future sort of amendments that may differ at shorter agenda, caps on agenda time, things like that.

3348
04:09:00,289 --> 04:09:01,350
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know the legality of that.

3349
04:09:03,297 --> 04:09:04,137
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't run for city council.

3350
04:09:04,157 --> 04:09:05,177
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't understand any of that.

3351
04:09:06,378 --> 04:09:13,719
[SPEAKER_27]: However, I appreciate you giving me the time to speak and would like to voice my opposition for the 90 minute cap and decrease from five to three.

3352
04:09:13,939 --> 04:09:14,999
[SPEAKER_27]: So, thank you very much.

3353
04:09:15,819 --> 04:09:16,299
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3354
04:09:16,319 --> 04:09:18,800
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we have three people who already spoken.

3355
04:09:19,500 --> 04:09:21,600
[SPEAKER_46]: So, have you spoken to Mr Cassidy on this paper.

3356
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:24,581
[SPEAKER_46]: All right, sorry you, you get to go first.

3357
04:09:26,161 --> 04:09:29,041
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record you have five minutes Mr Cassidy.

3358
04:09:33,143 --> 04:09:34,464
[SPEAKER_11]: At least it's not 1 a.m.

3359
04:09:34,524 --> 04:09:37,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Last time I was here, I spoke at 1 a.m., I was the last one.

3360
04:09:43,090 --> 04:09:51,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew Paul Castanetti, C-A-S-T-A-G-N-E-T-T-I, alias Burrata III.

3361
04:09:51,837 --> 04:09:52,457
[SPEAKER_46]: You have that, Mr. Clerk?

3362
04:09:52,477 --> 04:09:52,677
[SPEAKER_46]: I got it.

3363
04:09:53,318 --> 04:09:53,498
[SPEAKER_46]: All right.

3364
04:09:54,058 --> 04:09:56,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my two and three minutes up yet?

3365
04:09:58,642 --> 04:09:59,943
[SPEAKER_46]: You have four minutes, 30 seconds.

3366
04:10:00,323 --> 04:10:01,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, aren't you kind?

3367
04:10:04,706 --> 04:10:24,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard at least three constants mentioned that the flowers are getting late 10 1112 after even one o'clock in the morning two weeks ago, and counselor Penta mentioned a good solution that would be common sense to return to full time work.

3368
04:10:26,260 --> 04:10:27,861
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting full-time pay, 30,000.

3369
04:10:28,661 --> 04:10:36,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the Boston City Councils make 130,000, but after that, I think you're in the next tier of three or so.

3370
04:10:37,106 --> 04:10:37,847
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of cake.

3371
04:10:38,407 --> 04:10:41,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus you get pens and pencil expenses, a couple of grand.

3372
04:10:42,449 --> 04:10:43,590
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I feel bad.

3373
04:10:43,610 --> 04:10:49,934
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I get for the last, since we had injury, 30 years?

3374
04:10:49,954 --> 04:10:51,655
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a zero.

3375
04:10:52,853 --> 04:10:55,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, back to zero, what is next?

3376
04:10:55,974 --> 04:10:58,235
[SPEAKER_11]: One minute or zero minutes?

3377
04:10:59,316 --> 04:11:02,357
[SPEAKER_11]: A la Groucho Marxist commie bastard government.

3378
04:11:04,698 --> 04:11:05,739
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, could that happen?

3379
04:11:05,759 --> 04:11:07,580
[SPEAKER_46]: Can we try to keep the swearing off of public access?

3380
04:11:07,880 --> 04:11:08,380
[SPEAKER_11]: What swear?

3381
04:11:08,400 --> 04:11:10,121
[SPEAKER_46]: Did you just say commie and B word?

3382
04:11:11,321 --> 04:11:14,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, is this gonna end up as zero minutes?

3383
04:11:14,643 --> 04:11:16,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have zero input?

3384
04:11:16,484 --> 04:11:21,626
[SPEAKER_11]: A la the communist Groucho Marxist commie bastardo government?

3385
04:11:22,918 --> 04:11:23,699
[SPEAKER_46]: And he said it again.

3386
04:11:23,719 --> 04:11:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I did it.

3387
04:11:24,980 --> 04:11:25,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I added a no.

3388
04:11:27,802 --> 04:11:29,423
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

3389
04:11:30,144 --> 04:11:30,564
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll go.

3390
04:11:30,584 --> 04:11:32,005
[SPEAKER_46]: And I want to be clear here.

3391
04:11:32,346 --> 04:11:35,248
[SPEAKER_46]: If we could try to keep second comments to two minutes, it is getting late.

3392
04:11:36,009 --> 04:11:38,010
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Fiori, name and address record, please.

3393
04:11:38,030 --> 04:11:39,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

3394
04:11:39,051 --> 04:11:39,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm Gaston Fiori, 61 Sydney.

3395
04:11:40,012 --> 04:11:40,592
[SPEAKER_22]: I apologize.

3396
04:11:40,652 --> 04:11:42,394
[SPEAKER_22]: I forgot about one point, so I will be really quick.

3397
04:11:42,414 --> 04:11:51,361
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think related to reusing the minutes, it's particularly important, and since this has been brought up repeatedly as well, that we keep in mind that

3398
04:11:52,842 --> 04:12:09,986
[SPEAKER_22]: at least based on the previous three elections, because I've requested the data about the number of registered voters, and apparently we don't have it for the last election, about only 30% of registered voters, which are not all people that could vote, voted in this election.

3399
04:12:10,406 --> 04:12:13,027
[SPEAKER_22]: And not every one of you got all of those votes.

3400
04:12:13,487 --> 04:12:20,469
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're talking here that more than 70%, maybe getting close to 75%, we don't know, because we don't have the data.

3401
04:12:21,351 --> 04:12:29,721
[SPEAKER_22]: of the residents of Medford, between 70, 75% of the residents of Medford did not vote for you, okay?

3402
04:12:30,382 --> 04:12:38,531
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's particularly important given that the vast majority of residents of this city did not vote for any of you.

3403
04:12:39,585 --> 04:12:45,250
[SPEAKER_22]: to give them access to this public forum to come and express their opinions on different issues.

3404
04:12:46,912 --> 04:12:50,174
[SPEAKER_22]: So numbers have been talked, we're like 100, I don't know.

3405
04:12:50,535 --> 04:13:01,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, so please also, I encourage the council to remember that more than 70% of this city, of people that could vote in this city did not vote for this council.

3406
04:13:01,264 --> 04:13:01,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

3407
04:13:02,225 --> 04:13:08,793
[SPEAKER_46]: Again, I haven't responded to your email, but I might have some data on some of the previous elections I'll try to find in my sandbox.

3408
04:13:09,613 --> 04:13:11,956
[SPEAKER_46]: One interesting thing I've noticed, if you look at the 2005 to 2013 results, the average turnout was like 20 to 25%.

3409
04:13:11,996 --> 04:13:12,577
[SPEAKER_46]: And if you look at 2015 to 2023,

3410
04:13:17,422 --> 04:13:19,023
[SPEAKER_46]: It was 30 to 34%.

3411
04:13:19,583 --> 04:13:31,891
[SPEAKER_46]: And some of the interesting things I've noted blanks are way down, and usually you didn't see people on the down ballot races getting majority of votes cast, it was usually below 50% of votes cast very rarely one or two people were getting over 50% of votes cast.

3412
04:13:32,851 --> 04:13:34,051
[SPEAKER_46]: and that's starting to change as well.

3413
04:13:34,071 --> 04:13:42,973
[SPEAKER_46]: So I think some of the data and interesting facts about the election results would show that I think we're actually making improvement, and I'm hoping we can keep making improvement and getting more people involved.

3414
04:13:42,993 --> 04:13:43,514
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

3415
04:13:43,894 --> 04:13:46,274
[SPEAKER_22]: I do think that it's important to keep that in mind, right?

3416
04:13:46,294 --> 04:13:50,275
[SPEAKER_22]: So if 70% of people had voted, then that's different than 70% did not vote.

3417
04:13:50,335 --> 04:13:50,575
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

3418
04:13:51,455 --> 04:13:56,057
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go to Jess Healy, who spoke before for two minutes, then we'll come back to you, former Councilor Berta.

3419
04:13:56,537 --> 04:13:59,297
[SPEAKER_46]: Jess, if you could, for two minutes, thank you.

3420
04:14:00,458 --> 04:14:02,318
[SPEAKER_24]: Jess Healy, Lockroad, Medford.

3421
04:14:03,240 --> 04:14:08,485
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to remind everyone that's on the council, except I believe only one member.

3422
04:14:09,766 --> 04:14:14,911
[SPEAKER_24]: The reason you are all sitting there is because of a national organization, Our Revolution.

3423
04:14:15,712 --> 04:14:17,954
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the reason you're sitting right where you are.

3424
04:14:19,135 --> 04:14:22,299
[SPEAKER_24]: You're saying, you know, if you don't like us, vote us out.

3425
04:14:22,419 --> 04:14:25,942
[SPEAKER_24]: If you don't like this, well, I would like to see you each run on your own.

3426
04:14:26,643 --> 04:14:27,824
[SPEAKER_24]: See how many votes you get then.

3427
04:14:29,033 --> 04:14:42,777
[SPEAKER_24]: See if you have to run like mr. Scott pelly had to run you guys run as a big group you come out of nowhere And for whatever reason in this city Like the gentleman said probably 75 didn't even vote for you.

3428
04:14:43,298 --> 04:14:50,840
[SPEAKER_24]: But the other 25 30 Those people go and they vote for all the people on one pamphlet.

3429
04:14:51,340 --> 04:14:56,882
[SPEAKER_24]: That's how you are all sitting there Let me tell you if one of you tried to run on your own

3430
04:14:57,284 --> 04:14:58,825
[SPEAKER_24]: You wouldn't be sitting there right now.

3431
04:14:59,526 --> 04:15:03,109
[SPEAKER_24]: You're on the backs of each other, you and the school committee.

3432
04:15:04,350 --> 04:15:08,894
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is the reason we do not trust you because you're all running as a group.

3433
04:15:09,855 --> 04:15:14,018
[SPEAKER_24]: And we feel that as a group, you've all made the same decisions.

3434
04:15:14,358 --> 04:15:19,603
[SPEAKER_24]: You all have the same feeling and you all back our revolution in their national movement.

3435
04:15:20,203 --> 04:15:21,965
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not here to change Medford.

3436
04:15:22,625 --> 04:15:25,648
[SPEAKER_24]: You're here to change the national movement of our revolution.

3437
04:15:26,670 --> 04:15:27,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Go on the website.

3438
04:15:27,590 --> 04:15:30,211
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a whole thing of what the our revolution is about.

3439
04:15:31,252 --> 04:15:33,553
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's what you're trying to change my fit into.

3440
04:15:34,833 --> 04:15:36,794
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's why people don't trust you.

3441
04:15:37,874 --> 04:15:40,675
[SPEAKER_24]: And you're looking at us like, how don't you trust us?

3442
04:15:41,416 --> 04:15:47,918
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you expect us to when you just run as a big group of people who all have the same agenda?

3443
04:15:48,438 --> 04:15:50,259
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not running as individuals.

3444
04:15:51,659 --> 04:15:53,800
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the main problem we have here.

3445
04:15:54,200 --> 04:15:55,841
[SPEAKER_24]: And now you want to keep us quiet.

3446
04:15:56,758 --> 04:15:57,781
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not gonna happen.

3447
04:15:59,245 --> 04:16:01,030
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can try, but it's not gonna work.

3448
04:16:01,832 --> 04:16:02,814
[SPEAKER_24]: There's my two minutes.

3449
04:16:03,396 --> 04:16:03,757
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3450
04:16:04,505 --> 04:16:07,306
[SPEAKER_46]: And I would just note, again, there's no national thing.

3451
04:16:07,346 --> 04:16:09,287
[SPEAKER_46]: There's an organization called Our Revolution Medford.

3452
04:16:09,627 --> 04:16:10,887
[SPEAKER_46]: It's made up of Medford residents.

3453
04:16:11,347 --> 04:16:12,448
[SPEAKER_46]: We work together as a team.

3454
04:16:12,488 --> 04:16:23,931
[SPEAKER_46]: If you go to ourrevolutionmedford.com, you can read the Medford People's Platform, which was created solely by Medford residents and Medford community organizations to advance a vision of Medford for all of us.

3455
04:16:24,111 --> 04:16:24,992
[SPEAKER_46]: So check it out.

3456
04:16:25,392 --> 04:16:26,552
[SPEAKER_46]: It's a local organization.

3457
04:16:26,572 --> 04:16:32,394
[SPEAKER_46]: I've lived here my whole life, and I care about this city deeply, along with my fellow colleagues, all of us here on the city council.

3458
04:16:33,240 --> 04:16:36,081
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Penta, if you could, two more minutes, thank you.

3459
04:16:36,441 --> 04:16:38,082
[SPEAKER_55]: Why do I only have two when I should have five?

3460
04:16:38,102 --> 04:16:40,743
[SPEAKER_46]: Because I'm as the chair at this late hour asking for people who are speaking.

3461
04:16:40,763 --> 04:16:43,003
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, you're tired, you want to go home, is this all about?

3462
04:16:43,043 --> 04:16:48,425
[SPEAKER_46]: For speaking a second time against the rules of the council, Mr. Penta, allow one person to speak.

3463
04:16:48,465 --> 04:16:52,467
[SPEAKER_55]: Show me the rule on the council, because rule 16 says five minutes.

3464
04:16:53,227 --> 04:16:54,007
[SPEAKER_55]: That's what it says.

3465
04:16:54,027 --> 04:16:55,328
[SPEAKER_46]: It says five minutes one time.

3466
04:16:55,348 --> 04:16:58,169
[SPEAKER_46]: It doesn't say one time, it does not say one time.

3467
04:16:58,209 --> 04:16:59,830
[SPEAKER_46]: I would suggest you read it.

3468
04:16:59,950 --> 04:17:02,091
[SPEAKER_46]: That's beside the point.

3469
04:17:02,131 --> 04:17:03,092
[SPEAKER_55]: Can I finish what I'm saying?

3470
04:17:03,132 --> 04:17:04,092
[SPEAKER_55]: You have two minutes, we accept two minutes.

3471
04:17:04,112 --> 04:17:05,733
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, you shouldn't be speaking from the chair.

3472
04:17:05,753 --> 04:17:08,974
[SPEAKER_55]: You have no right to make an opinion from the chair.

3473
04:17:09,574 --> 04:17:12,116
[SPEAKER_55]: You have no right from the chair to make an opinion.

3474
04:17:12,316 --> 04:17:12,756
[SPEAKER_55]: Excuse me.

3475
04:17:12,896 --> 04:17:13,696
[SPEAKER_18]: You have no right.

3476
04:17:13,756 --> 04:17:14,777
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, I think we should just move on.

3477
04:17:14,797 --> 04:17:16,518
[SPEAKER_55]: You're against Robert's rules of order.

3478
04:17:16,578 --> 04:17:18,138
[SPEAKER_46]: Freedom, freedom.

3479
04:17:18,338 --> 04:17:19,319
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd like to ask the question.

3480
04:17:20,859 --> 04:17:21,920
[SPEAKER_46]: Any motions on the floor.

3481
04:17:22,000 --> 04:17:23,980
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd like to ask the vice president question.

3482
04:17:24,020 --> 04:17:24,480
[SPEAKER_46]: No, you may not.

3483
04:17:24,801 --> 04:17:25,801
[SPEAKER_55]: We may I know I can't.

3484
04:17:26,001 --> 04:17:26,701
[SPEAKER_46]: I just said you can't.

3485
04:17:28,002 --> 04:17:31,102
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of this meeting, I am not the chair of this meeting.

3486
04:17:31,343 --> 04:17:33,423
[SPEAKER_55]: City Council meeting bears.

3487
04:17:33,503 --> 04:17:36,924
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, Councilor saying thank you.

3488
04:17:37,164 --> 04:17:38,705
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

3489
04:17:38,725 --> 04:17:40,125
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

3490
04:17:40,185 --> 04:17:41,125
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not how it works.

3491
04:17:41,226 --> 04:17:42,986
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor saying thank you President bears.

3492
04:17:43,306 --> 04:17:45,827
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, you know, having heard a lot of the feedback tonight.

3493
04:17:45,887 --> 04:17:48,668
[SPEAKER_29]: I think there I think there was a lot of nuance.

3494
04:17:48,728 --> 04:17:49,008
[SPEAKER_39]: I think

3495
04:17:50,269 --> 04:17:57,195
[SPEAKER_46]: You can go on, sir, you can go on, you can make an embarrassment of yourself, but it's me, Mr Penta.

3496
04:17:57,275 --> 04:17:58,116
[SPEAKER_46]: No, you're not.

3497
04:17:59,217 --> 04:18:00,558
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3498
04:18:01,519 --> 04:18:07,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Having heard a lot of the opinions tonight, I think that there's a lot of nuance in what people want and, you know,

3499
04:18:08,145 --> 04:18:16,410
[SPEAKER_29]: I take the criticism in stride, and I, you know, I want to engage in good faith, and that's why I would, I want to amend this resolution.

3500
04:18:17,791 --> 04:18:25,836
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of folks who have talked about their support for three minutes, but not the 90 minute.

3501
04:18:26,857 --> 04:18:28,257
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion for a five minute recess.

3502
04:18:28,277 --> 04:18:28,758
[SPEAKER_46]: So moved.

3503
04:18:29,358 --> 04:18:29,778
[SPEAKER_46]: Second.

3504
04:18:31,419 --> 04:18:32,220
[SPEAKER_46]: Seconded by Councilors.

3505
04:18:32,680 --> 04:18:33,441
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor.

3506
04:18:33,461 --> 04:18:33,861
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

3507
04:18:34,001 --> 04:18:34,461
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed.

3508
04:18:34,521 --> 04:18:35,362
[SPEAKER_46]: Meeting is in recess.

3509
04:18:43,564 --> 04:18:44,545
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Sang had the floor.

3510
04:18:44,585 --> 04:18:45,206
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Sang.

3511
04:18:46,768 --> 04:18:47,109
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3512
04:18:47,229 --> 04:18:53,877
[SPEAKER_29]: As I was saying, I think there's a lot of nuance to the conversation that we've had tonight, particularly in the critiques.

3513
04:18:53,998 --> 04:19:01,808
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think there's a wide spectrum of views on what folks don't like about it and how much they don't like it.

3514
04:19:02,729 --> 04:19:06,232
[SPEAKER_29]: In good faith, I want to amend the resolution on the floor.

3515
04:19:07,193 --> 04:19:19,544
[SPEAKER_29]: Instead of having a 90-minute hard cap, I would like to move that we have 90 minutes of discussion with participants having three minutes to speak each, and then after that, one minute per resident to speak on a topic.

3516
04:19:19,744 --> 04:19:28,690
[SPEAKER_29]: I know this isn't, you know, this isn't a compromise that everyone will love, but it is a good faith attempt to respond to what residents have been saying.

3517
04:19:29,151 --> 04:19:39,498
[SPEAKER_29]: I think I've heard residents whose main critique is that what happens to the person who speaks after that, who wants to speak after the 90th minute, and they haven't had a chance to speak.

3518
04:19:39,538 --> 04:19:41,579
[SPEAKER_29]: And I do sympathize with that quite a bit.

3519
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:43,601
[SPEAKER_29]: And so that's why I want to offer that amendment.

3520
04:19:43,901 --> 04:19:49,365
[SPEAKER_46]: So we have the motion to approve by Councillor Lazaro as amended by Councillor Lazaro to increase from two minutes to three minutes.

3521
04:19:49,865 --> 04:19:58,533
[SPEAKER_46]: and as amended by councilor saying to add a 90 minute initial cap for discussion and any speakers after the 90 minutes would go for one minute each.

3522
04:19:59,313 --> 04:20:01,655
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins, could you take the chair?

3523
04:20:02,236 --> 04:20:03,557
[SPEAKER_46]: I have a B paper to propose.

3524
04:20:20,316 --> 04:20:20,816
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Madam President.

3525
04:20:20,896 --> 04:20:21,757
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam President.

3526
04:20:22,017 --> 04:20:22,117
[SPEAKER_46]: Um.

3527
04:20:23,317 --> 04:20:29,980
[SPEAKER_46]: So one of the other things I've seen from some of the discussions online as well as some of the comments tonight is about making clear our process.

3528
04:20:30,020 --> 04:20:40,344
[SPEAKER_46]: So I would propose of the paper to add to rule 12 section three, uh, subsection, a new subsection subsection F, which would be referred to committee for further discussion.

3529
04:20:40,964 --> 04:20:41,385
[SPEAKER_46]: And there if

3530
04:20:45,026 --> 04:20:48,369
[SPEAKER_46]: to come on the agenda with the specific intent of going to committee for further discussion.

3531
04:20:48,409 --> 04:20:59,980
[SPEAKER_46]: That would then be clear and obvious to all parties reading the agenda that this is not the consideration of the proper topic, but that the topic is simply being referred to committee for further discussion.

3532
04:21:00,040 --> 04:21:02,862
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that would address some of the procedural issues.

3533
04:21:03,983 --> 04:21:10,469
[SPEAKER_46]: And I also think it is a reflection of adjusting and changing as we hear feedback about some of the new things that we're trying.

3534
04:21:11,210 --> 04:21:11,450
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3535
04:21:14,295 --> 04:21:16,176
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to Councilor Shang and then Councilor Callahan.

3536
04:21:16,456 --> 04:21:16,837
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3537
04:21:17,757 --> 04:21:19,358
[SPEAKER_29]: I would support that B paper.

3538
04:21:19,558 --> 04:21:20,639
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it makes a lot of sense.

3539
04:21:20,999 --> 04:21:40,592
[SPEAKER_29]: It goes, it speaks to what Councilor Zaro and I had talked about earlier tonight in that there seems to be a way to clarify things so that we caught, so that we are clear as a council that things are being brought up for discussion and rather not being decided on that night of.

3540
04:21:41,453 --> 04:21:42,874
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I would second the B paper.

3541
04:21:45,797 --> 04:21:47,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I just don't exactly understand.

3542
04:21:48,999 --> 04:21:51,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that there's a B paper attached to this motion.

3543
04:21:52,521 --> 04:21:55,122
[SPEAKER_46]: It's since we're under consideration of the rules.

3544
04:21:55,822 --> 04:21:57,063
[SPEAKER_46]: It's just it would be a separate vote.

3545
04:21:57,503 --> 04:22:08,129
[SPEAKER_46]: So vote on this motion, it's not an amendment to this motion, it's a separate vote on changing that rule as well given what we've heard tonight about some of the rules issues around this thing I voted on before.

3546
04:22:08,820 --> 04:22:14,664
[SPEAKER_46]: It would be voted on first as the B paper be considered first, and then we would consider the promotion as amended by Councilor Zara.

3547
04:22:15,244 --> 04:22:16,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you restate that B paper?

3548
04:22:17,202 --> 04:22:25,969
[SPEAKER_46]: it would be a motion to add to rule 12 section three to create a new subsection F that would be titled refer to committee for further discussion.

3549
04:22:26,129 --> 04:22:41,642
[SPEAKER_46]: And it would basically create under the rules of order, a new header on the council agenda where counselors could specifically refer, have items that would be going to the committee system for discussion in the committee, put them there instead of having them mixed in with everything else where there may be final decisions happening during the meeting.

3550
04:22:41,662 --> 04:22:42,403
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3551
04:22:42,423 --> 04:22:44,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that is a great idea.

3552
04:22:48,120 --> 04:22:48,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lazzaro.

3553
04:22:50,121 --> 04:22:51,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think that's a great idea.

3554
04:22:51,361 --> 04:22:58,104
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the clarity of everything being called a resolution kind of lumps everything in together.

3555
04:22:58,124 --> 04:23:02,405
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it can, I think it's contributing to some of the confusion of the community.

3556
04:23:02,605 --> 04:23:07,887
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think having a new heading is really smart.

3557
04:23:07,967 --> 04:23:09,208
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would support that as well.

3558
04:23:10,222 --> 04:23:14,605
[SPEAKER_46]: And if I may, Madam President, we also made a change to the new committee agendas.

3559
04:23:14,945 --> 04:23:20,569
[SPEAKER_46]: We had had a papers and committee section, because we wanted to show everyone what is all the things that this committee is currently considering.

3560
04:23:21,090 --> 04:23:23,591
[SPEAKER_46]: People thought that that meant that all of them were on the agenda for that night.

3561
04:23:23,611 --> 04:23:26,694
[SPEAKER_46]: It actually ended up creating, in a goal for transparency, it created confusion.

3562
04:23:27,254 --> 04:23:29,796
[SPEAKER_46]: So we removed that, and now you can ask the clerk for it.

3563
04:23:29,896 --> 04:23:38,802
[SPEAKER_46]: So I think, again, as we try these new things, we are adjusting and changing as we get the feedback from the public about what helps and what doesn't.

3564
04:23:41,127 --> 04:23:43,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comment from councilors on the B paper?

3565
04:23:46,142 --> 04:23:47,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing none, I will relinquish the chair.

3566
04:24:01,280 --> 04:24:03,821
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion by members of the Council on the B paper?

3567
04:24:04,781 --> 04:24:13,084
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing none, is there a motion to approve on the motion of Councillor Callahan, seconded by Vice President Collins on the B paper only?

3568
04:24:13,604 --> 04:24:15,264
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3569
04:24:21,947 --> 04:24:22,547
[SPEAKER_40]: Councillor Callahan?

3570
04:24:22,707 --> 04:24:22,867
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

3571
04:24:24,067 --> 04:24:24,848
[SPEAKER_40]: Vice President Collins?

3572
04:24:25,228 --> 04:24:25,408
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

3573
04:24:25,808 --> 04:24:26,508
[SPEAKER_40]: Councillor Lozano?

3574
04:24:26,728 --> 04:24:26,928
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

3575
04:24:27,468 --> 04:24:27,949
[SPEAKER_40]: Councillor Linden?

3576
04:24:28,209 --> 04:24:28,389
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

3577
04:24:32,196 --> 04:24:32,616
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Sanchez?

3578
04:24:32,816 --> 04:24:33,036
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3579
04:24:33,517 --> 04:24:33,997
[SPEAKER_40]: President Ferris?

3580
04:24:34,737 --> 04:24:35,018
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3581
04:24:35,178 --> 04:24:36,478
[SPEAKER_46]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

3582
04:24:36,619 --> 04:24:38,059
[SPEAKER_46]: The B paper is approved.

3583
04:24:39,180 --> 04:24:48,465
[SPEAKER_46]: On the main paper, as proposed for approval by Councilor Lazaro, as amended by Councilor Lazaro and Councilor Sanchez, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

3584
04:24:48,525 --> 04:24:49,886
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Kellyanne.

3585
04:24:50,106 --> 04:24:59,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just that when there is a question of whether we're going to send something to committee to be able to open a many months long discussion, I'm going to vote yes.

3586
04:25:01,135 --> 04:25:02,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we need to be able to have those discussions.

3587
04:25:03,917 --> 04:25:10,163
[SPEAKER_15]: This is actually something that we're gonna be changing these rules today, and that will be a permanent change.

3588
04:25:10,363 --> 04:25:11,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't feel comfortable.

3589
04:25:11,524 --> 04:25:16,008
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't feel comfortable when I read it, and my position has not changed.

3590
04:25:17,310 --> 04:25:21,713
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not gonna be voting this one.

3591
04:25:23,455 --> 04:25:25,317
[SPEAKER_46]: And for the discussion by members of the council on the motion.

3592
04:25:28,007 --> 04:25:30,028
[SPEAKER_46]: And to be clear, that would be the motion as amended.

3593
04:25:30,048 --> 04:25:36,253
[SPEAKER_46]: It would be three minutes per speaker, 90 minutes at that level, and then anyone after the 90 minutes would be at one minute.

3594
04:25:39,315 --> 04:25:42,076
[SPEAKER_46]: So seeing no further discussion by members of the council, I'll go to the members of the public.

3595
04:25:42,377 --> 04:25:43,998
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Jones, I don't think you've spoken on this issue.

3596
04:25:44,038 --> 04:25:44,878
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record.

3597
04:25:44,918 --> 04:25:45,519
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3598
04:25:55,117 --> 04:26:01,178
[SPEAKER_33]: What he wanted to know was how the paper changed from two minutes to three minutes.

3599
04:26:01,198 --> 04:26:02,459
[SPEAKER_33]: You guys have just explained that.

3600
04:26:02,799 --> 04:26:04,259
[SPEAKER_33]: So that was just what he was trying to ask.

3601
04:26:05,039 --> 04:26:05,860
[SPEAKER_33]: I have a few questions.

3602
04:26:05,920 --> 04:26:11,001
[SPEAKER_33]: I stand at a rising opposition to the 90 minute limit on the city council meetings.

3603
04:26:12,301 --> 04:26:17,402
[SPEAKER_33]: There's definitely not enough time for a contentious issue, as we've had a few of them in the past weeks.

3604
04:26:18,643 --> 04:26:22,144
[SPEAKER_33]: You mentioned earlier that 25 people spoke against the rental registry.

3605
04:26:22,724 --> 04:26:23,864
[SPEAKER_33]: How many people spoke for it?

3606
04:26:25,859 --> 04:26:27,619
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not sure, maybe one?

3607
04:26:28,019 --> 04:26:35,141
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe one, so we'll say 99% of the people spoke in opposition to the rental registry, yet it was still passed five to three.

3608
04:26:35,741 --> 04:26:38,761
[SPEAKER_46]: It was referred to committee by a vote of five to two.

3609
04:26:39,481 --> 04:26:40,081
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, it was.

3610
04:26:40,341 --> 04:26:42,222
[SPEAKER_33]: So it wasn't passed?

3611
04:26:42,502 --> 04:26:43,982
[SPEAKER_33]: No, it was passed, it was referred to committee.

3612
04:26:44,402 --> 04:26:54,924
[SPEAKER_33]: The action was taken on the council, even though 25 people spoke in opposition to it and one person for, which you can understand everybody in the room thinks that

3613
04:26:56,107 --> 04:26:58,028
[SPEAKER_33]: What they're saying their input doesn't matter.

3614
04:26:58,968 --> 04:27:00,269
[SPEAKER_33]: Your votes are preordained.

3615
04:27:00,709 --> 04:27:03,490
[SPEAKER_33]: I commend one councilor for possibly changing her vote.

3616
04:27:03,670 --> 04:27:08,393
[SPEAKER_33]: It was a five to two vote, usually a six to one vote.

3617
04:27:08,433 --> 04:27:15,636
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing that you spoke about was that the discussion period would be in the committee meetings.

3618
04:27:15,656 --> 04:27:16,476
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that correct?

3619
04:27:17,357 --> 04:27:19,138
[SPEAKER_46]: The item was referred to committee for further discussion.

3620
04:27:19,278 --> 04:27:22,299
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, so you don't want discussion here at the city council meeting.

3621
04:27:23,059 --> 04:27:24,200
[SPEAKER_33]: You want it at the committee meetings?

3622
04:27:24,864 --> 04:27:30,026
[SPEAKER_46]: A lot of folks have said that it would be better when we have an item where there's a lot of discussion, have it be the only item on the agenda.

3623
04:27:30,046 --> 04:27:32,226
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, you said that the committee meetings had no time limit.

3624
04:27:32,727 --> 04:27:33,047
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct.

3625
04:27:33,107 --> 04:27:33,467
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct.

3626
04:27:33,747 --> 04:27:35,347
[SPEAKER_33]: When are they?

3627
04:27:35,388 --> 04:27:37,128
[SPEAKER_46]: They're every Tuesday and Wednesday, generally.

3628
04:27:37,608 --> 04:27:38,028
[SPEAKER_33]: What time?

3629
04:27:38,629 --> 04:27:41,189
[SPEAKER_46]: It's available on the city clerk's office, but 6 and 7 p.m.

3630
04:27:41,209 --> 04:27:44,310
[SPEAKER_46]: are the designated start times, but they can go much later than that.

3631
04:27:44,390 --> 04:27:45,911
[SPEAKER_33]: How are they communicated, though, to people?

3632
04:27:46,231 --> 04:27:47,692
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, the same way every other public meeting is.

3633
04:27:48,532 --> 04:27:49,792
[SPEAKER_33]: How's that?

3634
04:27:49,812 --> 04:27:51,773
[SPEAKER_46]: Through all the channels that public meetings are communicated by.

3635
04:27:52,344 --> 04:27:55,945
[SPEAKER_33]: Enlighten me, I don't, is there an email that's sent out?

3636
04:27:56,145 --> 04:27:56,805
[SPEAKER_33]: No, I'm not.

3637
04:27:56,925 --> 04:27:58,586
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't get the city council email anymore.

3638
04:27:59,086 --> 04:27:59,986
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't get a lot of things.

3639
04:28:00,967 --> 04:28:03,367
[SPEAKER_33]: How do you get on the email chain for this?

3640
04:28:04,968 --> 04:28:05,288
[SPEAKER_46]: Call?

3641
04:28:05,888 --> 04:28:08,469
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, call, email, the clerk, yeah.

3642
04:28:08,489 --> 04:28:16,951
[SPEAKER_33]: So anybody who wants that can call you, opt into the system for the agenda, for the subcommittee meetings and all of that.

3643
04:28:17,031 --> 04:28:19,192
[SPEAKER_33]: So they're not done during business hours is my point.

3644
04:28:20,017 --> 04:28:26,960
[SPEAKER_33]: regular business hours because a lot of people have other responsibilities and other all of our meetings are after six and 7pm up to 6pm.

3645
04:28:27,160 --> 04:28:27,720
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

3646
04:28:28,440 --> 04:28:38,264
[SPEAKER_46]: They are emailed out, they're emailed out their website, they're they're published in the clerk's office, good to know there was still a newspaper, they'd be noticed in the newspaper, it would be great if we had a newspaper.

3647
04:28:38,785 --> 04:28:39,265
[SPEAKER_33]: It would be nice.

3648
04:28:39,285 --> 04:28:39,745
[SPEAKER_33]: I agree.

3649
04:28:40,925 --> 04:28:46,428
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing I wanted to bring up was easy talked about

3650
04:28:47,455 --> 04:28:53,297
[SPEAKER_33]: how you ran on certain things, and this is your opinion, and this and that.

3651
04:28:53,797 --> 04:29:10,143
[SPEAKER_33]: So is your rationale that because 10% of the population voted for you that the other 90% of the population, whatever their opinion is, and if they disagree with you, then you're working for that 10%, and they're gonna do whatever you think is right?

3652
04:29:10,700 --> 04:29:16,662
[SPEAKER_46]: If I received 10,000 emails or there were 10,000 people in line for public comment, I think that would be a very different story.

3653
04:29:16,822 --> 04:29:17,662
[SPEAKER_33]: How about 200?

3654
04:29:18,262 --> 04:29:21,843
[SPEAKER_46]: I think, again, you're talking about very different scales of magnitude.

3655
04:29:21,963 --> 04:29:27,985
[SPEAKER_33]: Right, so 99% of the people voiced their opposition to the rental registry, but you still passed it.

3656
04:29:28,505 --> 04:29:29,806
[SPEAKER_33]: There was 200 people here.

3657
04:29:30,026 --> 04:29:30,906
[SPEAKER_33]: There's 300 people here.

3658
04:29:30,926 --> 04:29:31,566
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe 100, 150.

3659
04:29:31,626 --> 04:29:35,908
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, tonight, I'm talking about the other past meetings.

3660
04:29:36,568 --> 04:29:39,869
[SPEAKER_33]: Everybody is in opposition to things, and you guys still voted them in six to one.

3661
04:29:40,689 --> 04:29:42,030
[SPEAKER_33]: You understand the optics of that?

3662
04:29:42,710 --> 04:29:49,073
[SPEAKER_33]: That whatever people who oppose these things, you don't listen and your votes are already have been decided.

3663
04:29:49,514 --> 04:29:50,534
[SPEAKER_46]: I personally would disagree.

3664
04:29:50,554 --> 04:29:56,317
[SPEAKER_46]: I think the optics are that there are people who are not in the room who may hold a different opinion, who would ask us to make a different vote.

3665
04:29:56,437 --> 04:30:01,440
[SPEAKER_33]: So well, if they cared so much, they probably should be here is the other thing.

3666
04:30:01,500 --> 04:30:02,881
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe they understand.

3667
04:30:03,301 --> 04:30:03,961
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, that's fine.

3668
04:30:04,041 --> 04:30:04,642
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

3669
04:30:04,702 --> 04:30:07,003
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, that's that's that's my point.

3670
04:30:08,023 --> 04:30:08,844
[SPEAKER_33]: People feel that

3671
04:30:10,276 --> 04:30:13,658
[SPEAKER_33]: whatever we say here is not gonna make any difference.

3672
04:30:14,178 --> 04:30:15,739
[SPEAKER_33]: And you limited the meeting to 90 minutes.

3673
04:30:16,599 --> 04:30:20,822
[SPEAKER_33]: So you're gonna vote the way you're gonna vote, and you have to listen to us for 90 minutes now.

3674
04:30:21,622 --> 04:30:24,624
[SPEAKER_33]: Has George, you've been through the chair, George, you've been on the council for how long?

3675
04:30:24,664 --> 04:30:26,485
[SPEAKER_33]: Has this ever been an issue before?

3676
04:30:26,945 --> 04:30:27,785
[SPEAKER_33]: The length of the meetings?

3677
04:30:29,086 --> 04:30:30,247
[SPEAKER_33]: No, just now.

3678
04:30:31,007 --> 04:30:32,468
[SPEAKER_33]: Why do you think the meetings are so long?

3679
04:30:34,489 --> 04:30:36,210
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, these are certainly not the longest meetings we've had.

3680
04:30:37,914 --> 04:30:40,837
[SPEAKER_33]: I've been here for past midnight three times already.

3681
04:30:41,117 --> 04:30:43,139
[SPEAKER_46]: Why do you think the meetings are so long.

3682
04:30:43,159 --> 04:30:48,524
[SPEAKER_46]: 11 hours in June 2020 a whole Saturday was at 9am to 7pm, but that was a budget meeting probably right.

3683
04:30:49,004 --> 04:30:52,788
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, but it was 11 hours talking about a city councilman just your opinion.

3684
04:30:52,908 --> 04:30:53,849
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll tell you why.

3685
04:30:54,470 --> 04:31:00,735
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll tell you why this is because a lot of people in opposition to what you're trying to do here.

3686
04:31:01,636 --> 04:31:02,957
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's why the meetings are so long.

3687
04:31:03,317 --> 04:31:06,339
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's people voicing their opinion.

3688
04:31:06,359 --> 04:31:07,579
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the only place they can do it.

3689
04:31:08,140 --> 04:31:09,200
[SPEAKER_33]: Not everybody's on Zoom.

3690
04:31:09,480 --> 04:31:14,083
[SPEAKER_33]: Not everybody does email and all these other forms of communication with social media and such.

3691
04:31:14,924 --> 04:31:18,506
[SPEAKER_33]: People like to come down here, voice their opinion live and in person.

3692
04:31:19,286 --> 04:31:20,327
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's why we're here.

3693
04:31:20,627 --> 04:31:24,509
[SPEAKER_33]: We've enjoyed that privilege up until now.

3694
04:31:25,089 --> 04:31:27,571
[SPEAKER_33]: You guys are trying to take it away because you don't want to listen to the public.

3695
04:31:28,424 --> 04:31:29,025
[SPEAKER_33]: in my opinion.

3696
04:31:29,665 --> 04:31:33,388
[SPEAKER_33]: If you have some other reason why, I'd love to hear it.

3697
04:31:34,209 --> 04:31:37,352
[SPEAKER_33]: Other than that, it's obvious to me what's going on.

3698
04:31:38,593 --> 04:31:43,578
[SPEAKER_33]: Your votes have already been decided and you don't want to listen to the public comments.

3699
04:31:44,138 --> 04:31:44,458
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

3700
04:31:44,559 --> 04:31:45,279
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Jones.

3701
04:31:45,319 --> 04:31:45,820
[SPEAKER_46]: Councillor Lemming.

3702
04:31:47,267 --> 04:32:03,035
[SPEAKER_31]: just would like to say that I do sympathize with the inaccessibility of the email list at the resident services and public engagement committee we are working on proposals to update the website so I

3703
04:32:04,235 --> 04:32:11,819
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, I personally just look on the City Council page when I when I want to get the when I want to get the agendas myself, so I but we.

3704
04:32:12,739 --> 04:32:17,021
[SPEAKER_31]: We are trying to increase transparency on the technological front.

3705
04:32:17,061 --> 04:32:17,401
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_46]: I know we have a couple of folks here who've been waiting a long time.

3728
04:33:18,125 --> 04:33:18,826
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favour?

3729
04:33:19,587 --> 04:33:19,987
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

3730
04:33:20,027 --> 04:33:20,788
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

3731
04:33:22,764 --> 04:33:37,258
[SPEAKER_46]: 24-064 offered by Vice President Collins resolution to support state make polluters pay legislation, whereas this legislative session bill 8872 S481 an act establishing a climate change super fund and promoting polluter responsibility.

3732
04:33:37,878 --> 04:33:52,150
[SPEAKER_46]: Also known as the make polluters pay bill was filed and whereas if passed this bill would establish a climate change super fund into which the largest oil and gas companies would pay 75 billion over 25 years with each company share proportional to their contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2018.

3733
04:33:52,870 --> 04:34:00,116
[SPEAKER_46]: And whereas oil and gas companies bear the responsibility for exacerbating the climate crisis and have consistently misrepresented the destructive impacts of fossil fuel combustion.

3734
04:34:00,756 --> 04:34:29,267
[SPEAKER_46]: on the global climate, and whereas climate change caused by global warming poses many serious threats to the city of Medford and its residents, including extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, and other extreme weather, which are already impacting the Medford community, and whereas to adequately fund necessary climate adaptation and resilience projects, Medford requires funding at the scale beyond the reasonable constraints of the city's operating budget, and the passage of the proposed make polluters pay legislation in the state house would provide the means for Medford and other cities like it to adapt to climate impacts more adequately, equitably, and meaningfully, and

3735
04:34:29,867 --> 04:34:51,193
[SPEAKER_46]: Whereas the proposed legislation would mandate that 40% of the monies raised be allocated to projects benefiting environmental justice communities, encourage utilization of apprenticeship work programs and encourage adherence to prevailing wage laws and whereas this session the make polluters pay bill was given a study order by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources but will be reintroduced in the next legislative session and whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts currently does not have a plan

3736
04:34:51,873 --> 04:34:57,895
[SPEAKER_46]: to adequately, equitably, and meaningfully fund necessary resilience and adaptation projects in affected communities like Medford.

3737
04:34:57,935 --> 04:35:08,738
[SPEAKER_46]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council expresses its support of H872S481, an act establishing a climate change super fund and promoting polluter responsibility to build polluter accountability and fund climate resilience.

3738
04:35:08,798 --> 04:35:17,920
[SPEAKER_46]: Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation, as well as the House Speaker, the Senate President, and the Office of the Governor, Vice President Collins.

3739
04:35:18,868 --> 04:35:19,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Beers.

3740
04:35:19,908 --> 04:35:22,169
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate you reading out the full text of the resolution.

3741
04:35:22,189 --> 04:35:26,330
[SPEAKER_18]: I am really proud to have put this on the agenda today.

3742
04:35:26,830 --> 04:35:37,774
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason that this resolution is before us is because we have a really strong, robust, energetic climate and environment community here in Medford.

3743
04:35:38,594 --> 04:35:47,497
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of those groups have formed a coalition that came to me with the idea for this resolution, which is one of advocacy to say, we as a community,

3744
04:35:48,260 --> 04:35:51,401
[SPEAKER_18]: We see how climate change is already affecting our community.

3745
04:35:51,481 --> 04:35:54,082
[SPEAKER_18]: We see how it is going to affect our community in the future.

3746
04:35:54,822 --> 04:35:56,662
[SPEAKER_18]: We look around, we see reality for what it is.

3747
04:35:56,762 --> 04:36:13,287
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that we need resources greater than we can muster in a city's operating budget to adequately contend with how climate change is going to affect our community here on the banks of the Mystic River in a way that will protect residents of all backgrounds who live in all neighborhoods,

3748
04:36:13,909 --> 04:36:36,433
[SPEAKER_18]: of all the various geographies of Medford in a way that we can all continue to enjoy quality of life and safety here in Medford, both right now and a year in 50 years because of what we know about how our local environment is going to change because of the global weather trends that we are all experiencing and all projecting in different ways.

3749
04:36:37,619 --> 04:36:40,300
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a bill that was proposed this legislative session.

3750
04:36:41,360 --> 04:37:01,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, to sort of reiterate what was stated in the text of the resolution, this is a bill that would enable the state of Massachusetts to create a fund that the largest corporate polluters would pay into, that money would then be earmarked for local climate change resiliency projects.

3751
04:37:01,550 --> 04:37:17,499
[SPEAKER_18]: for cities like ours, who are on the banks of rivers, who are already suffering from heat islands, extreme weather, so that we can do the work that we already know we need to do, that people already need and actually don't have the access that they need quite already in our community, so that we can do those projects adequately.

3752
04:37:18,640 --> 04:37:28,165
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that eight-hour heating and cooling centers in the coldest and hottest days of the month in Medford are cutting it already, let alone what we're going to be feeling

3753
04:37:28,766 --> 04:37:30,526
[SPEAKER_18]: in five or 10 or 20 years.

3754
04:37:30,986 --> 04:37:44,009
[SPEAKER_18]: This state level legislation would try to create a stream of money to combat that at the local level in communities like ours from the corporations that are responsible for creating these conditions in communities like ours.

3755
04:37:44,049 --> 04:37:48,210
[SPEAKER_18]: So to be super, super clear, this is a tax on no consumer.

3756
04:37:48,310 --> 04:37:49,610
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a tax on no resident.

3757
04:37:50,010 --> 04:37:52,331
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to your Exxon mobiles and saying,

3758
04:37:54,537 --> 04:37:57,118
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't undo history, but now you have to help us.

3759
04:37:57,498 --> 04:37:58,778
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to help us stay alive.

3760
04:37:58,818 --> 04:38:00,279
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to help us stay safe.

3761
04:38:00,739 --> 04:38:03,640
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to help us preserve our communities with what we know is to come.

3762
04:38:05,200 --> 04:38:14,923
[SPEAKER_18]: As was noted in the text of the resolution, this was given a study order in this legislative session, which means that most likely the legislature will not take action on this section.

3763
04:38:14,943 --> 04:38:15,924
[SPEAKER_18]: They won't be able to.

3764
04:38:15,964 --> 04:38:21,946
[SPEAKER_18]: They've decided to consider it for the rest of the year instead, which means slower action.

3765
04:38:23,667 --> 04:38:30,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is, you know, in some cases, this is a way of taking the wind out of the sails of a legislative project or slowing the momentum.

3766
04:38:31,793 --> 04:38:44,042
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that this presents, you know, a really urgent opportunity for communities like ours to step in and say, you know, it's all the more important to be advocating because we know the clock is ticking.

3767
04:38:44,262 --> 04:38:49,146
[SPEAKER_18]: It was ticking before, it's certainly ticking now that the legislature has declined to take action on it in this session.

3768
04:38:50,302 --> 04:38:59,252
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm really proud to stand with many Medford residents who reached out to me to say, we can't afford to add any more years to this timeline.

3769
04:38:59,713 --> 04:39:01,495
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to start funding climate resiliency now.

3770
04:39:01,535 --> 04:39:07,182
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to thank the coalition that brought this before me and thank my counselors as I asked them for their support.

3771
04:39:14,127 --> 04:39:15,449
[SPEAKER_29]: Um okay, Councilor say.

3772
04:39:15,809 --> 04:39:16,230
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3773
04:39:16,250 --> 04:39:20,737
[SPEAKER_29]: Um I really wanted to thank Councilor Collins for introducing this resolution.

3774
04:39:21,974 --> 04:39:28,099
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, this, I think this resolution and what you just said really encapsulates how climate change is a local issue as well.

3775
04:39:28,539 --> 04:39:38,447
[SPEAKER_29]: We think of the in broad strokes and yes the impact of climate change is in broad strokes, but the effects of climate change affect every single one of us living here living on the ground.

3776
04:39:38,928 --> 04:39:46,674
[SPEAKER_29]: We see it very clearly with the mystic river which you brought up, and the potential for flooding, and we I think we can recognize how.

3777
04:39:48,680 --> 04:39:59,211
[SPEAKER_29]: Climate change disproportionately affects communities that haven't been super well off, that haven't been represented in the traditional political process, that have been traditionally overlooked.

3778
04:39:59,731 --> 04:40:02,454
[SPEAKER_29]: Communities of color, poor communities, immigrant communities.

3779
04:40:03,629 --> 04:40:09,851
[SPEAKER_29]: This resolution has another local angle to it, which is that it brings money back into the city.

3780
04:40:10,411 --> 04:40:20,815
[SPEAKER_29]: We talk about the need for revenue, we talk about the need to fund resiliency projects and nature projects and parks and flood protection.

3781
04:40:21,536 --> 04:40:25,701
[SPEAKER_29]: This is if past the state at the state level, this would be a mechanism to do it.

3782
04:40:26,462 --> 04:40:29,987
[SPEAKER_29]: And as you noted, we don't pay the bill for it.

3783
04:40:30,407 --> 04:40:31,969
[SPEAKER_29]: Residents won't pay for the bill for it.

3784
04:40:32,349 --> 04:40:37,396
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll be holding the large polluters, the Exxon Mobil's of the world to account.

3785
04:40:38,097 --> 04:40:38,337
[SPEAKER_29]: Now,

3786
04:40:40,273 --> 04:40:47,936
[SPEAKER_29]: I think there's a with with with the point that this brings money into the city much needed funds into the city.

3787
04:40:48,916 --> 04:40:57,299
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is a, this is a solid yes for me I'd like to second your motion, and actually one more point, you know, having worked with a lot of our state reps.

3788
04:40:57,799 --> 04:41:06,287
[SPEAKER_29]: they ask, oftentimes they also reach out to us to ask us to send in a resolution in support from the Medford City Council, because it does help at the State House.

3789
04:41:06,907 --> 04:41:14,234
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that's another reason why resolutions like this actually are important, because they do make a tangible difference at the State House.

3790
04:41:18,298 --> 04:41:18,918
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Councillor Sang.

3791
04:41:18,938 --> 04:41:20,360
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further comments by members of the Council?

3792
04:41:22,153 --> 04:41:22,713
[SPEAKER_46]: seeing none.

3793
04:41:22,773 --> 04:41:25,234
[SPEAKER_46]: Is there public participation on this item?

3794
04:41:25,754 --> 04:41:27,674
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll take folks in order.

3795
04:41:28,515 --> 04:41:35,576
[SPEAKER_46]: Um and Mr Jimmy, you know if you want to speak on on another matter, we'll take you up on the public participation section of the meeting.

3796
04:41:37,237 --> 04:41:38,417
[SPEAKER_46]: But we'll go to the podium first.

3797
04:41:39,677 --> 04:41:40,838
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3798
04:41:40,898 --> 04:41:41,658
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3799
04:41:41,678 --> 04:41:42,558
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr President.

3800
04:41:42,578 --> 04:41:43,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Gaston Fury 61 Stickney Road.

3801
04:41:43,698 --> 04:41:43,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Um

3802
04:41:46,846 --> 04:41:53,852
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would like to say that I do support holding oil and gas companies accountable for their pollution.

3803
04:41:55,374 --> 04:41:59,537
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do not support this specific retroactive penalty for past pollution.

3804
04:42:00,879 --> 04:42:02,900
[SPEAKER_22]: I do support imposing an effluent tax.

3805
04:42:04,222 --> 04:42:22,243
[SPEAKER_22]: such as carbon pricing, to account for the current and future pollution, and to incentivize them, and I find this very important, to incentivize them to pollute less, and then to use the money of the effluent tax or carbon pricing in the same fund, and that to be used to mitigate the effects of climate change.

3806
04:42:23,228 --> 04:42:30,972
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just consider that we need oil and gas companies to be key contributors to the transition into clean energy.

3807
04:42:32,352 --> 04:42:39,696
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is because I fervently believe that it is the private sector, not the government, who is going to enable us to enjoy a world free of fossil fuels.

3808
04:42:41,057 --> 04:42:48,060
[SPEAKER_22]: I would like to remind everyone here that we still need oil and gas today and for the next few years, indeed, simply to keep the world running forward.

3809
04:42:49,140 --> 04:42:51,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Some farming equipment necessary to grow food still runs on oil.

3810
04:42:52,722 --> 04:42:56,467
[SPEAKER_22]: Most used to transport that food to our tables and other goods.

3811
04:42:56,708 --> 04:42:58,831
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, all goods in the economy still run on oil.

3812
04:43:01,234 --> 04:43:03,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Same for cargo ships, same for commercial airplanes.

3813
04:43:04,158 --> 04:43:06,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Our military still needs oil to keep us all safe.

3814
04:43:07,799 --> 04:43:10,461
[SPEAKER_22]: And we still need natural gas to meet our current electricity demands.

3815
04:43:12,403 --> 04:43:23,792
[SPEAKER_22]: So because of that, as I said, I do support an effluent tax, such as carbon pricing, and to use the proceeds from that into a super fund.

3816
04:43:24,332 --> 04:43:33,720
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I would like to quickly address a couple of points that I took from material that I've been getting from people in support of this retroactive tax.

3817
04:43:34,460 --> 04:43:39,665
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm quoting here, we're also only targeting these companies for harm already caused

3818
04:43:40,385 --> 04:43:43,186
[SPEAKER_22]: asking them to contribute from profits already earned.

3819
04:43:43,346 --> 04:43:48,468
[SPEAKER_22]: So asking them to contribute from profits already earned, so it should not affect prices going forward.

3820
04:43:49,108 --> 04:44:01,732
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't understand this because companies clearly cannot, or at least cannot necessarily contribute from profits that have already been earned, because those profits most likely have already been spent.

3821
04:44:02,012 --> 04:44:06,194
[SPEAKER_22]: So the profits that a company earned 15 years ago are probably pretty much spent.

3822
04:44:07,435 --> 04:44:12,441
[SPEAKER_22]: So this means that the companies will more likely have to contribute to the superfund from current and future profits.

3823
04:44:13,882 --> 04:44:15,825
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why I support carbon pricing.

3824
04:44:17,324 --> 04:44:33,775
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the second point that I found in the material that I've been reading about is it says, quote, the payers into the Make Polluters Paid Climate Fund will be US-based fossil fuel extractors and oil refiners, and those foreign-owned companies doing business in the US.

3825
04:44:34,696 --> 04:44:42,762
[SPEAKER_22]: So this targets the national production of oil and gas in this country, placing the US at a disadvantage compared to other countries.

3826
04:44:44,242 --> 04:44:45,503
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't find this fair.

3827
04:44:45,823 --> 04:44:48,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't find this in the best interest of the US.

3828
04:44:48,264 --> 04:44:52,286
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this is actually potentially a national security threat.

3829
04:44:52,446 --> 04:44:54,587
[SPEAKER_22]: For what I said, our military runs on oil still.

3830
04:44:56,128 --> 04:45:06,032
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think if something like this approach were going to be implemented, I think it would be wise to try to pursue this at the global level.

3831
04:45:06,312 --> 04:45:09,974
[SPEAKER_22]: So all companies from other countries that don't necessarily operate here

3832
04:45:10,934 --> 04:45:14,976
[SPEAKER_22]: are put in the same situation as U.S.

3833
04:45:15,437 --> 04:45:20,780
[SPEAKER_22]: companies or foreign companies that get the gas and oil from here and process it here.

3834
04:45:21,360 --> 04:45:29,205
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think this will level out the playing field and would be better suited to the interests of the United States.

3835
04:45:29,425 --> 04:45:29,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

3836
04:45:29,985 --> 04:45:31,066
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you for your time.

3837
04:45:31,086 --> 04:45:32,887
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

3838
04:45:35,108 --> 04:45:36,549
[SPEAKER_46]: Ron, do you want to talk about this topic?

3839
04:45:42,794 --> 04:45:43,034
[SPEAKER_39]: No.

3840
04:45:44,155 --> 04:45:46,095
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, I'm gonna go to Patrick Clerkin.

3841
04:45:46,335 --> 04:45:47,776
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3842
04:45:48,976 --> 04:45:49,477
[SPEAKER_46]: Five minutes.

3843
04:45:57,800 --> 04:45:58,260
[SPEAKER_46]: Patrick.

3844
04:46:05,223 --> 04:46:06,563
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, we've lost him.

3845
04:46:06,803 --> 04:46:07,604
[SPEAKER_46]: All right, we'll go to the podium.

3846
04:46:08,744 --> 04:46:09,605
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3847
04:46:09,625 --> 04:46:10,345
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3848
04:46:12,066 --> 04:46:22,616
[SPEAKER_52]: My name is Martha Andrews, I am a member of the Medford Energy and Environment Committee wanted to let you know that that committee has

3849
04:46:24,256 --> 04:46:33,521
[SPEAKER_52]: endorsed this resolution and has requested that the council pass it for the reasons you've heard.

3850
04:46:34,981 --> 04:46:36,902
[SPEAKER_52]: I am a Medford resident.

3851
04:46:36,962 --> 04:46:42,905
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm also an environmental health and engineering consultant working on litigation.

3852
04:46:42,965 --> 04:46:45,926
[SPEAKER_52]: I'd like to address some of the points Scott Stone made.

3853
04:46:47,287 --> 04:46:52,730
[SPEAKER_52]: This is a relatively small amount of money for major gas and oil companies.

3854
04:46:54,853 --> 04:46:59,799
[SPEAKER_52]: almost impossible to imagine it would affect their bottom line.

3855
04:47:01,841 --> 04:47:13,614
[SPEAKER_52]: This is very typical, you know, superfund we're all familiar with, the polluters pay to clean up the pollution, that principle applied to climate would be very useful.

3856
04:47:15,496 --> 04:47:16,017
[SPEAKER_52]: It's not

3857
04:47:17,455 --> 04:47:20,576
[SPEAKER_52]: You know, it's the way things get done in America.

3858
04:47:20,616 --> 04:47:27,979
[SPEAKER_52]: There's tort law and you go after the people who cause damage to fix the damage.

3859
04:47:29,580 --> 04:47:46,087
[SPEAKER_52]: My other point is that Medford has some very expensive infrastructure issues because of climate, not just because of climate change, because of long period of deferred maintenance and disinvestment.

3860
04:47:47,726 --> 04:47:50,007
[SPEAKER_52]: in our drainage, our roads, and so forth.

3861
04:47:50,147 --> 04:48:04,713
[SPEAKER_52]: But it also is getting worse because of climate change, because of the rising water levels, the amount of heat, the change in our seasons, the increase in storm winds, and so forth.

3862
04:48:04,893 --> 04:48:05,833
[SPEAKER_52]: We need the money.

3863
04:48:05,853 --> 04:48:08,534
[SPEAKER_52]: This is where the money is going to come from.

3864
04:48:11,744 --> 04:48:19,626
[SPEAKER_52]: It's very hard for our hardworking planning and environment office to go out and get a grant every time they want to do something related to climate change.

3865
04:48:20,166 --> 04:48:32,089
[SPEAKER_52]: This money would really help make things happen here to protect us from what's going to be kind of a unfortunate scenario as the climate continues.

3866
04:48:32,229 --> 04:48:32,609
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

3867
04:48:33,909 --> 04:48:34,329
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3868
04:48:34,349 --> 04:48:36,290
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3869
04:48:39,393 --> 04:48:41,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Luca D'Alessio, 32, Diana Road.

3870
04:48:42,776 --> 04:48:49,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a Medford resident, an activist with 350 Massachusetts, a scientist and a father.

3871
04:48:49,020 --> 04:48:54,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand before you to support the state make polluter pay legislation.

3872
04:48:55,376 --> 04:49:01,779
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact of climate change is undeniable, as evidenced by the altered weather patterns we are facing.

3873
04:49:02,679 --> 04:49:11,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in New England, we are experiencing milder winter with increased rainfall and reduced snowfall, and hotter summer with extended period of extreme heat.

3874
04:49:12,844 --> 04:49:21,307
[SPEAKER_00]: This winter, the absence of snowfall led me to not needing my snow shovel, and my basement flooded for the first time.

3875
04:49:22,028 --> 04:49:24,889
[SPEAKER_00]: This is likely a situation that you have also experienced.

3876
04:49:26,707 --> 04:49:34,016
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is that our climate is transforming, necessitating adaptation on both personal and community levels.

3877
04:49:34,857 --> 04:49:43,227
[SPEAKER_00]: The flooding of my basement is a precursor of what awaits our municipal infrastructure, including roads, school, and public facilities.

3878
04:49:44,468 --> 04:49:49,892
[SPEAKER_00]: The make polluter pay legislation aims to secure funding from this necessary adaptation.

3879
04:49:50,893 --> 04:49:55,516
[SPEAKER_00]: The important decision before us is determining who bears the cost.

3880
04:49:56,276 --> 04:50:03,942
[SPEAKER_00]: The major oil and gas corporation, which have downplayed the harmful effect of fossil fuel emission, or the taxpayer of Massachusetts.

3881
04:50:04,982 --> 04:50:09,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe that the financial responsibility should fall on those corporation.

3882
04:50:11,440 --> 04:50:24,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge the Medford City Council to back the make polluter pay bill, therefore sending a powerful message to our state legislature to make immediate and decisive action to combat climate crisis.

3883
04:50:24,940 --> 04:50:25,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

3884
04:50:26,022 --> 04:50:26,362
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3885
04:50:27,881 --> 04:50:29,262
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3886
04:50:29,503 --> 04:50:35,448
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, Part B. So I support this tax.

3887
04:50:35,508 --> 04:50:36,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting tax.

3888
04:50:37,510 --> 04:50:41,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever a tax is proposed, you obviously gotta think about the incentives.

3889
04:50:41,634 --> 04:50:43,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a one-time tax.

3890
04:50:43,595 --> 04:50:48,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually looks backwards at damage already done over a fixed period defined.

3891
04:50:48,340 --> 04:50:52,484
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a period written in the legislation, and that's what they're gonna look at.

3892
04:50:52,884 --> 04:50:53,445
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my point.

3893
04:50:55,294 --> 04:50:57,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not designed to be an incentive scheme.

3894
04:50:57,640 --> 04:51:03,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not designed to encourage or discourage pollution, such taxes as the first speaker said would

3895
04:51:04,448 --> 04:51:06,810
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially be a good idea, but that's not what this is.

3896
04:51:08,150 --> 04:51:10,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, this is just about holding polluters accountable.

3897
04:51:11,312 --> 04:51:14,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of an alternative to a lawsuit.

3898
04:51:15,095 --> 04:51:19,898
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, there was that lawsuit against the opioid companies that Bedford got some money from.

3899
04:51:20,478 --> 04:51:26,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this will work quite similar to that and help with the infrastructure to deal with climate change.

3900
04:51:27,963 --> 04:51:29,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we should support that.

3901
04:51:29,844 --> 04:51:31,726
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously legal, political,

3902
04:51:33,430 --> 04:51:35,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows what else issues to be worked out.

3903
04:51:35,672 --> 04:51:38,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I have complete confidence in the state able to do that.

3904
04:51:38,815 --> 04:51:44,101
[SPEAKER_07]: The state, sorry, Beacon Hill, they could do that.

3905
04:51:44,741 --> 04:51:47,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, I see no reason why Medford shouldn't lend its support.

3906
04:51:47,584 --> 04:51:47,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

3907
04:51:50,350 --> 04:51:50,890
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, William.

3908
04:51:50,910 --> 04:51:52,151
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3909
04:51:52,171 --> 04:51:52,852
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3910
04:51:53,072 --> 04:51:55,113
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Tim Peters, 48 Harvard Ave.

3911
04:51:55,614 --> 04:51:57,835
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll be so extremely, extremely brief.

3912
04:51:58,115 --> 04:51:59,937
[SPEAKER_23]: I've lived in Medford my entire life.

3913
04:52:00,897 --> 04:52:04,820
[SPEAKER_23]: This is my first city council meeting, and I'm still here.

3914
04:52:05,420 --> 04:52:07,982
[SPEAKER_23]: So you can tell how much I care about this issue.

3915
04:52:08,522 --> 04:52:10,464
[SPEAKER_23]: It's 100% a local issue.

3916
04:52:10,944 --> 04:52:12,565
[SPEAKER_23]: Climate change is in our backyard.

3917
04:52:13,085 --> 04:52:14,226
[SPEAKER_23]: We have heat waves.

3918
04:52:14,326 --> 04:52:17,428
[SPEAKER_23]: We have rising temperatures, record temperatures.

3919
04:52:17,508 --> 04:52:19,310
[SPEAKER_23]: We have all these extreme weather events.

3920
04:52:20,526 --> 04:52:28,030
[SPEAKER_23]: So yeah, there was this beautiful pair of trees in my neighbor's front yard, huge branch, slam.

3921
04:52:28,291 --> 04:52:30,872
[SPEAKER_23]: It almost like it was just inches away from their car.

3922
04:52:31,552 --> 04:52:34,794
[SPEAKER_23]: So they cut it down because of all the storms constantly going down.

3923
04:52:35,235 --> 04:52:36,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Like that was a real shame.

3924
04:52:36,295 --> 04:52:40,318
[SPEAKER_23]: I grew up in the shade of those trees, but we're inches away from disaster.

3925
04:52:40,958 --> 04:52:41,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Same with climate change.

3926
04:52:42,699 --> 04:52:44,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so I think it makes so much sense.

3927
04:52:44,520 --> 04:52:47,963
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to be paying the costs of climate change, no matter what.

3928
04:52:48,643 --> 04:52:52,425
[SPEAKER_23]: So it makes sense to have the polluters, the people who caused it, be footing that bill.

3929
04:52:52,445 --> 04:52:54,267
[SPEAKER_23]: So yeah, I hope you support it.

3930
04:52:54,287 --> 04:52:57,649
[SPEAKER_23]: This is 100% in the interest of your constituents.

3931
04:52:58,169 --> 04:52:58,549
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

3932
04:52:59,430 --> 04:52:59,830
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3933
04:52:59,850 --> 04:53:02,332
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3934
04:53:02,392 --> 04:53:03,613
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3935
04:53:05,796 --> 04:53:07,417
[SPEAKER_26]: Patrick Lurken, 50 Princeton Street.

3936
04:53:09,518 --> 04:53:12,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Like Councillor Singh, I'm a man who appreciates nuance.

3937
04:53:12,640 --> 04:53:28,288
[SPEAKER_26]: And on this particular topic, I think that it's an example of a mistake we all often make, which is comparing the best aspects of something that we support with the worst aspects of something that we don't, rather than the best and worst aspects of both.

3938
04:53:29,269 --> 04:53:34,632
[SPEAKER_26]: And so really what I'm addressing here is kind of the philosophy behind this rather than kind of the details of it.

3939
04:53:35,533 --> 04:53:54,090
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think one of the mistakes that's made with with fossil fuels and I have many many criticisms against the fossil fuel industry, and it's negative externalities, but we're comparing a mature industry with against an industry that isn't mature yet which is renewables.

3940
04:53:54,730 --> 04:53:54,910
[SPEAKER_26]: So,

3941
04:53:55,751 --> 04:53:58,592
[SPEAKER_26]: Fossil fuels is a fully scaled enterprise at this point.

3942
04:53:58,832 --> 04:54:12,857
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's sort of like comparing Facebook as a startup to Facebook as a mega corporation, because we are not really aware of the externalities of scaling renewable energy yet.

3943
04:54:12,997 --> 04:54:16,818
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't know the externalities of scaling windmills or solar panels.

3944
04:54:17,219 --> 04:54:20,640
[SPEAKER_26]: We have small arrays of these things so far.

3945
04:54:21,060 --> 04:54:23,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Everything, once you scale it, has

3946
04:54:24,741 --> 04:54:27,504
[SPEAKER_26]: side effects and has unintended consequences.

3947
04:54:28,164 --> 04:54:46,500
[SPEAKER_26]: So windmills, for example, you have to source the materials from all across the globe through supply chains, some of which might be in fraught regions which require forever wars like oil has, some of which might require child labor to produce, some of which might have

3948
04:54:49,274 --> 04:54:52,697
[SPEAKER_26]: byproducts that you have to accumulate in big open pits.

3949
04:54:53,177 --> 04:55:00,002
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of them might have concentrated waste products like nuclear fuel.

3950
04:55:00,062 --> 04:55:06,526
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of them might have dispersed waste products like the CO2 emissions of fossil fuels.

3951
04:55:07,006 --> 04:55:15,813
[SPEAKER_26]: So when you really look at this from a systems level perspective, which we're not really used to doing, there's a lot of

3952
04:55:16,573 --> 04:55:18,315
[SPEAKER_26]: complexity and a lot of nuance.

3953
04:55:18,636 --> 04:55:28,288
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just want to remind people that while the fossil fuel companies are by no means saints, they're also not

3954
04:55:30,336 --> 04:55:31,557
[SPEAKER_26]: purely villains either.

3955
04:55:31,717 --> 04:55:37,121
[SPEAKER_26]: We do live in a world that has been for better or worse defined by the industrial revolution.

3956
04:55:37,901 --> 04:55:44,286
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that fossil fuel companies just like renewables companies are improving their products all the time.

3957
04:55:44,626 --> 04:55:49,630
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we should just keep this in mind when we put these carrots and sticks in place.

3958
04:55:49,790 --> 04:55:50,471
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you.

3959
04:55:51,351 --> 04:55:51,831
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3960
04:55:54,073 --> 04:55:55,714
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

3961
04:55:55,774 --> 04:55:56,495
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

3962
04:55:59,079 --> 04:56:02,643
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm Stephen Vigiani, I live at 15 Monmouth Avenue, Medford.

3963
04:56:04,585 --> 04:56:05,085
[SPEAKER_54]: Good morning.

3964
04:56:06,347 --> 04:56:07,708
[SPEAKER_54]: Sorry, couldn't resist.

3965
04:56:10,111 --> 04:56:14,035
[SPEAKER_46]: Every time we go after midnight, the first person they have to say that.

3966
04:56:15,236 --> 04:56:25,945
[SPEAKER_54]: Just really briefly, this is a simple resolution to encourage the state government to pass this bill, which I think will benefit Medford.

3967
04:56:26,646 --> 04:56:40,959
[SPEAKER_54]: I think everyone that was in this room tonight has probably taken real money out of their pocket already because of climate change, either because they've had to put in air conditioners or make their air conditioning systems better,

3968
04:56:41,559 --> 04:56:43,681
[SPEAKER_54]: They've had to put in French drain systems.

3969
04:56:44,121 --> 04:56:51,006
[SPEAKER_54]: They've had to fix rotting wood in their house because of increased water and precipitation.

3970
04:56:52,788 --> 04:56:57,772
[SPEAKER_54]: And we need more money in the city for a lot of things.

3971
04:56:57,832 --> 04:57:03,256
[SPEAKER_54]: But one of the things that we need it for is to address some of these climate things.

3972
04:57:03,316 --> 04:57:07,019
[SPEAKER_54]: So I hope that this will be an unanimous vote of the council.

3973
04:57:08,864 --> 04:57:10,305
[SPEAKER_54]: I urge the council to support it.

3974
04:57:10,566 --> 04:57:10,906
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

3975
04:57:11,186 --> 04:57:11,827
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you very much.

3976
04:57:11,847 --> 04:57:14,209
[SPEAKER_46]: We're going to go to Marie Izzo on Zoom.

3977
04:57:14,729 --> 04:57:16,490
[SPEAKER_46]: Marie, name and address for the record, please.

3978
04:57:16,530 --> 04:57:17,931
[SPEAKER_46]: And you have five minutes.

3979
04:57:21,195 --> 04:57:24,316
[SPEAKER_59]: Hi, thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.

3980
04:57:24,496 --> 04:57:38,881
[SPEAKER_59]: I support this initiative, but mostly what I'd like to address, if I can, is some of the comments that were made about the number of people that were pro or against some of the things that were discussed on the agenda this evening.

3981
04:57:40,102 --> 04:57:48,545
[SPEAKER_59]: I want to share with whoever's listening tonight that I, for one, I've been a Medford resident for over

3982
04:57:50,299 --> 04:57:53,401
[SPEAKER_59]: let's see, I've lost count, like 50 years or more.

3983
04:57:53,541 --> 04:57:57,844
[SPEAKER_59]: My family has been here, I own property, my children own property here and so on.

3984
04:57:58,684 --> 04:58:09,572
[SPEAKER_59]: And I belong to a number of different activist groups that have been in touch with the city council related to a lot of the topics that are on the agenda on a regular basis.

3985
04:58:10,472 --> 04:58:11,573
[SPEAKER_59]: And if people that come out,

3986
04:58:15,015 --> 04:58:38,148
[SPEAKER_59]: In you know in numbers like the ones like this week and the last weeks for certain, you know particular things that they care about What I what I really know for a fact given, you know, the number of meetings that I attend outside of these city council meetings Is that you know, we support 100 of the agenda that has come forward because we have very much

3987
04:58:39,208 --> 04:58:47,712
[SPEAKER_59]: as a group of citizens, you know, have very much partaken in the process of creating these agendas.

3988
04:58:48,312 --> 04:58:54,515
[SPEAKER_59]: So I support 100% all of the things that we discussed tonight that you are bringing forward.

3989
04:58:54,535 --> 04:59:03,339
[SPEAKER_59]: I want to excuse my fellow residents and people that came out tonight for some of the behaviors and some of the attacks on this council.

3990
04:59:04,279 --> 04:59:05,980
[SPEAKER_59]: Um, it's for me.

3991
04:59:06,020 --> 04:59:11,403
[SPEAKER_59]: It's really hard to listen to and very hard to speak to And honestly, I would not even come out.

3992
04:59:11,524 --> 04:59:28,314
[SPEAKER_59]: I came out one of the other nights and it felt so Dangerous to speak up, you know against what that whole group was talking about that I did not bring it forward And this evening I just couldn't be there, but I would have been because i'm i'm prone to want to you know sort of support

3993
04:59:28,954 --> 04:59:54,465
[SPEAKER_59]: The movement and the change in this in this city council, but mostly what I want to say is that if the city if we have potholes or our schools are in disarray and in really bad shape, it's because Everything was always tabled and all of the years that i've ever watched the city council before this one You know, it was easy to just table everything and table everything and take so no one would even attend these meetings I'd be on many meetings where there were five or six people

3994
04:59:55,225 --> 04:59:59,367
[SPEAKER_59]: you know, on Zoom during the COVID period.

3995
04:59:59,828 --> 05:00:01,849
[SPEAKER_59]: So once again, I don't want to take any more time.

3996
05:00:01,909 --> 05:00:02,649
[SPEAKER_59]: I know it's late.

3997
05:00:02,749 --> 05:00:04,250
[SPEAKER_59]: Good morning and all that good stuff.

3998
05:00:04,270 --> 05:00:12,835
[SPEAKER_59]: But I thank you for the courage to have run and continue to, you know, be there and put your best foot forward and really work for the city.

3999
05:00:13,555 --> 05:00:21,079
[SPEAKER_59]: And in the hope that there will be changes, because no change has brought us to where we are today and to no fault of your own.

4000
05:00:21,639 --> 05:00:23,380
[SPEAKER_59]: And thank you for continuing forward.

4001
05:00:25,611 --> 05:00:26,053
[SPEAKER_46]: That's it.

4002
05:00:26,775 --> 05:00:27,297
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

4003
05:00:27,678 --> 05:00:28,682
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

4004
05:00:28,822 --> 05:00:29,244
[SPEAKER_46]: Five minutes.

4005
05:00:31,530 --> 05:00:32,190
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

4006
05:00:32,431 --> 05:00:33,992
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Daniel Zakin.

4007
05:00:34,452 --> 05:00:46,920
[SPEAKER_28]: I am a resident of Five Warren Square in Boston, and I'm here as the organizer of the Make Fluters Pay campaign and the legislative coordinator for 350 Mass, a statewide network of climate activists.

4008
05:00:47,580 --> 05:00:53,664
[SPEAKER_28]: That includes some of the fantastic activists that are here tonight, sticking it out through the five hour meeting at this point, six.

4009
05:00:55,325 --> 05:00:56,566
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you all so much for being here.

4010
05:00:56,606 --> 05:00:58,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you to everyone who spoke and who has advocated

4011
05:00:59,668 --> 05:01:03,851
[SPEAKER_28]: in support and in opposition and taking part in this.

4012
05:01:03,871 --> 05:01:07,914
[SPEAKER_28]: I wasn't planning on speaking tonight, but I've given up on making the last train from Oak Grove.

4013
05:01:08,434 --> 05:01:13,317
[SPEAKER_28]: So at this point, it's going to be an Uber anyways, so I might as well give my two cents.

4014
05:01:13,337 --> 05:01:14,678
[SPEAKER_28]: I am so proud of this resolution.

4015
05:01:14,698 --> 05:01:25,425
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so proud of this campaign, because we are the first campaign that is really fighting to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for their crimes and do that in a way that keeps our communities safe.

4016
05:01:26,346 --> 05:01:27,927
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that connection of

4017
05:01:28,991 --> 05:01:33,617
[SPEAKER_28]: Creating funding in a way that allows our communities to thrive is so important.

4018
05:01:34,177 --> 05:01:42,828
[SPEAKER_28]: And so as we look at Medford, as we look at the rivers and the ponds and the waterways and the urban heat islands and all of the impacts that we know are going to hit right here,

4019
05:01:43,749 --> 05:02:01,871
[SPEAKER_28]: Think about what this money could do in terms of creating basins that can absorb that water and prevent it from damaging homes and families, in terms of preventing elders from being hit by extreme heat, in terms of protecting environmental justice communities from poor air quality that causes disproportionate asthma rates.

4020
05:02:04,568 --> 05:02:16,595
[SPEAKER_28]: municipal resolutions like this are really important for us to build power and show the legislature how many people support this need for funding, want to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable and make them pay the cost for what they've caused.

4021
05:02:17,036 --> 05:02:18,596
[SPEAKER_28]: So I really hope you take that in mind.

4022
05:02:18,637 --> 05:02:23,399
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much for giving me and our whole network time to speak to you tonight and for bringing this forward.

4023
05:02:23,880 --> 05:02:24,160
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

4024
05:02:24,440 --> 05:02:25,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

4025
05:02:25,761 --> 05:02:27,282
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion on the motion?

4026
05:02:29,130 --> 05:02:34,354
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion on the motion of Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor saying all those in favor.

4027
05:02:35,054 --> 05:02:40,618
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed motion passes to 4.071 resolution request Mayor Superintendent and NPS finance team.

4028
05:02:41,218 --> 05:02:50,224
[SPEAKER_46]: Meet with the city council to discuss financial shortfalls be resolved that the mayor superintendent of schools and the NPS finance team even the city council to discuss financial shortfalls and request a letter from the superintendent.

4029
05:02:50,865 --> 05:02:53,346
[SPEAKER_46]: I do have a letter from the.

4030
05:02:55,897 --> 05:03:00,938
[SPEAKER_46]: that was forwarded to me from the finance director for Metropublic Schools.

4031
05:03:01,998 --> 05:03:06,559
[SPEAKER_46]: Report on the resolution of the FY 2024 budget shortfall.

4032
05:03:07,299 --> 05:03:11,580
[SPEAKER_46]: I appeared before the school committee on February 12th to report on the potential shortfall of 2.5 million.

4033
05:03:11,620 --> 05:03:17,201
[SPEAKER_46]: This is based on my first projection of what spending would be versus budget would be by year end.

4034
05:03:17,241 --> 05:03:23,122
[SPEAKER_46]: We began a process of reviewing spending, reviewing unencumbered funds, and identifying resource that could be utilized to ensure a balanced budget by year end.

4035
05:03:23,162 --> 05:03:24,622
[SPEAKER_46]: The CEO, Drew, identified the following.

4036
05:03:26,073 --> 05:03:41,383
[SPEAKER_46]: One in count was account was over encumbered by 265,000 due to a contract that cross fiscal years we identified spending that could be postponed to fiscal 25 the city identified a balance in the fiscal 23 school budget that could be used for any fiscal 24 expense that was charged to fiscal 23.

4037
05:03:42,004 --> 05:03:49,369
[SPEAKER_46]: We have $173,000 balance in the account the whole state reimbursement funds, we have a balance of 291,000 state funded circuit breaker account.

4038
05:03:50,129 --> 05:03:56,453
[SPEAKER_46]: We were projecting a balance in our final year of ESSER funds of $200,000, which can be used for eligible expenses currently being charged to the general fund.

4039
05:03:56,993 --> 05:04:04,018
[SPEAKER_46]: There is a balance in the vocational tuition revolving fund, and I targeted $200,000 from this fund to pay for vocational program teachers being charged to the general fund.

4040
05:04:04,598 --> 05:04:11,323
[SPEAKER_46]: I created a charge back to our school lunch program, $57,000, to recover the proportional share of natural gas and electricity used by the program.

4041
05:04:11,763 --> 05:04:18,287
[SPEAKER_46]: In addition, with the assistance of the city's finance director, an error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit to be overestimated.

4042
05:04:18,792 --> 05:04:41,110
[SPEAKER_46]: After correcting this error corrected the account all the other things that were just listed the projected deficit now stands at 216,000, we will use the extra balance and other budget management initiatives to ensure we finish the year with a balanced budget, any of the identified resources that are not needed for deficit reduction and fiscal 24 are eligible to be carried forward into fiscal 25 will be carried forward attached, please find reconciliation of the identified resolution.

4043
05:04:41,130 --> 05:04:43,352
[SPEAKER_46]: And with that I will go to Councilor Scarbelli.

4044
05:04:43,834 --> 05:04:44,215
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

4045
05:04:44,255 --> 05:04:45,378
[SPEAKER_38]: And I apologize for you.

4046
05:04:45,398 --> 05:04:46,781
[SPEAKER_38]: Just give me a minute.

4047
05:04:46,801 --> 05:04:53,938
[SPEAKER_38]: I appreciate that teaches waiting because I know tomorrow is a very big meeting with the superintendent, but, um.

4048
05:04:55,540 --> 05:04:59,482
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want my council members to understand a few things.

4049
05:04:59,622 --> 05:05:05,004
[SPEAKER_38]: One, for my friend Maria, though, you don't have to apologize for anybody that came out tonight to speak.

4050
05:05:05,564 --> 05:05:06,525
[SPEAKER_38]: They have their right to.

4051
05:05:06,985 --> 05:05:12,568
[SPEAKER_38]: And to sit there at 12.30 to mention something like that is disingenuine.

4052
05:05:12,628 --> 05:05:14,729
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think that's a shame.

4053
05:05:14,769 --> 05:05:21,912
[SPEAKER_38]: But on this situation, we're talking about with, I want us all to take a minute to think back.

4054
05:05:22,998 --> 05:05:29,760
[SPEAKER_38]: I want you to take a minute to think back to last year's budget meeting, where this council stood strong against what the mayor was pushing for.

4055
05:05:31,440 --> 05:05:36,161
[SPEAKER_38]: And I don't bring this up to hurt anybody, I just want the timeline to understand something.

4056
05:05:37,662 --> 05:05:43,583
[SPEAKER_38]: We're all in favor of the budget being pitiful, and the idea that we had no support from the mayor.

4057
05:05:45,644 --> 05:05:49,785
[SPEAKER_38]: Our council leadership met with the mayor behind closed doors, came out,

4058
05:05:50,652 --> 05:05:53,172
[SPEAKER_38]: and told us they're going to vote for the budget.

4059
05:05:54,073 --> 05:05:56,013
[SPEAKER_38]: We stressed, please understand what?

4060
05:05:57,393 --> 05:06:00,254
[SPEAKER_38]: You're going to balance the budget on ESSER or ARPA money.

4061
05:06:00,814 --> 05:06:01,754
[SPEAKER_38]: Please don't do this.

4062
05:06:02,154 --> 05:06:05,455
[SPEAKER_38]: It's gonna put us in dire straits in the future, especially next year.

4063
05:06:07,075 --> 05:06:08,075
[SPEAKER_38]: It fell on deaf ears.

4064
05:06:10,216 --> 05:06:11,136
[SPEAKER_38]: It fell on deaf ears.

4065
05:06:13,076 --> 05:06:16,697
[SPEAKER_38]: And budget gets passed, we move forward.

4066
05:06:17,961 --> 05:06:22,165
[SPEAKER_38]: We move forward without any knowledge of what's going on financially in the city, even though we've asked.

4067
05:06:23,206 --> 05:06:28,050
[SPEAKER_38]: We've asked, right before the budget, we got three reports for three separate months, and then they stopped.

4068
05:06:29,151 --> 05:06:31,573
[SPEAKER_38]: I started talking about it again, because it's budget time, right?

4069
05:06:32,313 --> 05:06:37,017
[SPEAKER_38]: Why we haven't seen these actuals, or why we haven't seen any financial documentation.

4070
05:06:37,058 --> 05:06:37,958
[SPEAKER_38]: What did we get the other day?

4071
05:06:37,978 --> 05:06:38,719
[SPEAKER_38]: We got Decembers.

4072
05:06:39,840 --> 05:06:42,162
[SPEAKER_38]: Council Bears' leadership is asking for quarterlies.

4073
05:06:42,182 --> 05:06:42,903
[SPEAKER_38]: I appreciate that.

4074
05:06:44,384 --> 05:06:45,124
[SPEAKER_38]: But here we are.

4075
05:06:46,280 --> 05:06:49,521
[SPEAKER_38]: on the verge of starting probably the worst budget we'll ever see here.

4076
05:06:53,062 --> 05:06:54,222
[SPEAKER_38]: We talk about trust.

4077
05:06:54,663 --> 05:06:56,003
[SPEAKER_38]: We talk about gaining trust.

4078
05:06:57,083 --> 05:06:57,823
[SPEAKER_38]: And what do we see?

4079
05:06:58,384 --> 05:07:09,367
[SPEAKER_38]: We see the mayor come out of nowhere and put forth a task force to develop a plan, a plan to investments in the city and the school budget operations.

4080
05:07:10,067 --> 05:07:15,409
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll just do no disrespect, Mayor Longo Kern, Nina Nazarian,

4081
05:07:16,311 --> 05:07:24,294
[SPEAKER_38]: Council President Beers, Vice Chair Jenny Graham, Vice President Kit Collins.

4082
05:07:25,535 --> 05:07:28,976
[SPEAKER_38]: No disrespect to any of you, but you're not financial wizards.

4083
05:07:30,097 --> 05:07:31,377
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't know anything about a budget.

4084
05:07:31,637 --> 05:07:34,959
[SPEAKER_46]: We have been joined to ex officio capacity by the finance directors.

4085
05:07:35,059 --> 05:07:36,960
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no finance director on this committee.

4086
05:07:37,180 --> 05:07:38,120
[SPEAKER_46]: Do you have minutes by the way?

4087
05:07:38,300 --> 05:07:39,101
[SPEAKER_46]: He joins the meetings.

4088
05:07:39,121 --> 05:07:40,221
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you have minutes of these meetings?

4089
05:07:40,481 --> 05:07:41,442
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't take minutes of the meetings.

4090
05:07:41,482 --> 05:07:42,282
[SPEAKER_38]: No minutes of the meetings.

4091
05:07:44,042 --> 05:07:48,043
[SPEAKER_38]: So here we are, this comes out now, a few weeks before we start our budget.

4092
05:07:50,544 --> 05:07:52,985
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's go back a couple of weeks, and what did the mayor ask for?

4093
05:07:53,585 --> 05:07:54,745
[SPEAKER_38]: A rainy day account.

4094
05:07:56,846 --> 05:08:00,247
[SPEAKER_38]: Because we have 20 some odd million dollars in free cash.

4095
05:08:01,207 --> 05:08:03,688
[SPEAKER_38]: So we all see what's coming, we all see what happened, we're not stupid, right?

4096
05:08:04,708 --> 05:08:06,448
[SPEAKER_38]: This is how she's gonna save the budget.

4097
05:08:07,609 --> 05:08:11,470
[SPEAKER_38]: So now, let's follow up the next week, the school committee

4098
05:08:12,363 --> 05:08:17,384
[SPEAKER_38]: put a resolution in supporting the City Council's resolution on the rainy day account.

4099
05:08:17,444 --> 05:08:17,724
[SPEAKER_38]: Why?

4100
05:08:17,744 --> 05:08:19,704
[SPEAKER_38]: Because that's how we're going to bail her out.

4101
05:08:21,485 --> 05:08:22,845
[SPEAKER_38]: Now I want you to look at the bigger picture.

4102
05:08:22,865 --> 05:08:27,066
[SPEAKER_38]: Because I asked and no one showed up tonight, but I asked.

4103
05:08:29,446 --> 05:08:29,947
[SPEAKER_38]: New growth.

4104
05:08:32,047 --> 05:08:32,447
[SPEAKER_38]: Zero.

4105
05:08:33,147 --> 05:08:34,487
[SPEAKER_38]: If the mayor was here, I would ask her.

4106
05:08:35,228 --> 05:08:41,469
[SPEAKER_38]: At the debate she had with Councilor Carviello, she talked about new growth and these developers that are starting to bring money in.

4107
05:08:43,726 --> 05:08:46,827
[SPEAKER_38]: I know for sure we had 340B projects.

4108
05:08:48,708 --> 05:08:56,932
[SPEAKER_38]: We had development in the city that was bringing in real tax dollars, permit fees to bring us to a level that it's the least we can fight for our schools.

4109
05:08:59,333 --> 05:09:00,033
[SPEAKER_38]: 340B projects.

4110
05:09:01,194 --> 05:09:02,474
[SPEAKER_38]: One, the Gold's Gym site.

4111
05:09:04,315 --> 05:09:05,215
[SPEAKER_38]: They've lost their funding.

4112
05:09:06,576 --> 05:09:08,437
[SPEAKER_38]: The Bertucci site that she fought in court.

4113
05:09:09,841 --> 05:09:11,702
[SPEAKER_38]: which you shouldn't fight 40 Bs, but she did.

4114
05:09:11,822 --> 05:09:13,722
[SPEAKER_38]: By the way, what'd we talk about?

4115
05:09:13,742 --> 05:09:18,003
[SPEAKER_38]: 600 possible units of affordable housing for my friends that are looking for affordable housing.

4116
05:09:18,263 --> 05:09:20,064
[SPEAKER_38]: Bertucci's was a science lab.

4117
05:09:20,104 --> 05:09:23,185
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so I apologize, but it was the RISE building.

4118
05:09:23,605 --> 05:09:25,905
[SPEAKER_38]: The RISE development, they went out of business.

4119
05:09:27,646 --> 05:09:28,246
[SPEAKER_38]: We lost them.

4120
05:09:29,606 --> 05:09:32,307
[SPEAKER_38]: We have groups that wanted to come into GE, but saw what happened.

4121
05:09:32,347 --> 05:09:32,967
[SPEAKER_38]: So what did they do?

4122
05:09:33,968 --> 05:09:34,668
[SPEAKER_38]: They didn't even ask.

4123
05:09:36,175 --> 05:09:43,462
[SPEAKER_38]: You have Boston Ave that I'm hearing maybe, possibly, they're talking about maybe another church going there.

4124
05:09:43,702 --> 05:09:44,743
[SPEAKER_38]: We lose total revenue.

4125
05:09:45,964 --> 05:09:49,587
[SPEAKER_38]: We have Medford Square that she said we're on the verge of presenting something to us.

4126
05:09:50,188 --> 05:09:51,489
[SPEAKER_38]: Nothing, zero.

4127
05:09:53,030 --> 05:09:56,553
[SPEAKER_38]: Mystic Ave, the hottest spot in the country right now.

4128
05:09:57,254 --> 05:09:59,116
[SPEAKER_38]: The last land close to Boston, that's it.

4129
05:10:01,414 --> 05:10:05,235
[SPEAKER_38]: shovels in the ground, permit fees pulled, zero.

4130
05:10:06,236 --> 05:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_38]: Hundreds of millions of dollars on permits, on fees, and in tax revenue.

4131
05:10:15,439 --> 05:10:20,741
[SPEAKER_38]: So I bring this up for a point because the teachers are gonna come up and talk about a dire situation.

4132
05:10:21,322 --> 05:10:26,284
[SPEAKER_38]: And this council's number one initiative, mine as well, is making sure we fund our school system.

4133
05:10:26,724 --> 05:10:27,644
[SPEAKER_38]: At what cost though?

4134
05:10:29,065 --> 05:10:29,725
[SPEAKER_38]: At what cost?

4135
05:10:31,650 --> 05:10:40,259
[SPEAKER_38]: When we have a school committee issue that they lose $2.5 million were in their deficit, then all of a sudden they find it.

4136
05:10:41,039 --> 05:10:44,403
[SPEAKER_38]: And what I heard doesn't appease me.

4137
05:10:45,103 --> 05:10:45,724
[SPEAKER_38]: That's not good.

4138
05:10:45,744 --> 05:10:47,186
[SPEAKER_38]: In the real world, someone goes down.

4139
05:10:47,866 --> 05:10:49,188
[SPEAKER_38]: In the real world, someone's going to hurt.

4140
05:10:49,508 --> 05:10:49,988
[SPEAKER_38]: That's bad.

4141
05:10:50,549 --> 05:10:51,410
[SPEAKER_38]: That's bad business.

4142
05:10:51,970 --> 05:10:53,452
[SPEAKER_38]: This is tax dollars that they lost.

4143
05:10:53,832 --> 05:10:55,234
[SPEAKER_38]: Then they found on a Friday.

4144
05:10:57,628 --> 05:11:06,853
[SPEAKER_38]: So we talked about I know she talked about we talked about over proposition to an F override, we're talking about probably $250 million new high school, which we all want.

4145
05:11:10,855 --> 05:11:12,175
[SPEAKER_38]: But careful what you wish for.

4146
05:11:13,176 --> 05:11:18,639
[SPEAKER_38]: Because all she's using you all she's using us as as scapegoats.

4147
05:11:20,697 --> 05:11:25,098
[SPEAKER_38]: So I believe the words she told a friend of mine that's told somebody that, you have to give a little to get a little.

4148
05:11:25,759 --> 05:11:28,720
[SPEAKER_38]: So maybe they'll get the proposition due in a half, she'll support it.

4149
05:11:29,180 --> 05:11:30,100
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe she wouldn't fight it.

4150
05:11:30,840 --> 05:11:31,861
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe she wouldn't veto it.

4151
05:11:34,001 --> 05:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_38]: This is where truth comes in.

4152
05:11:37,103 --> 05:11:38,243
[SPEAKER_38]: This is where trust comes in.

4153
05:11:40,944 --> 05:11:44,125
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is gonna be very difficult, because I know the story the teachers are gonna tell us.

4154
05:11:45,270 --> 05:11:48,892
[SPEAKER_38]: And what that letter went out, that letter went out to the community.

4155
05:11:48,952 --> 05:11:52,993
[SPEAKER_38]: She, superintendent sent me an email today, it was only sent to the leadership team.

4156
05:11:55,074 --> 05:11:56,415
[SPEAKER_38]: That went out like wildfire.

4157
05:11:56,955 --> 05:11:59,656
[SPEAKER_38]: I had parents call me tell me they should they leave the school system.

4158
05:12:00,096 --> 05:12:02,597
[SPEAKER_38]: I had teachers call me tell me they're applying elsewhere.

4159
05:12:02,617 --> 05:12:04,738
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm saying no, no, you're tenured.

4160
05:12:05,819 --> 05:12:06,519
[SPEAKER_38]: No, I'm gone.

4161
05:12:08,920 --> 05:12:11,481
[SPEAKER_38]: So I want us to prepare and understand this.

4162
05:12:12,582 --> 05:12:13,042
[SPEAKER_38]: Make sure

4163
05:12:14,329 --> 05:12:22,835
[SPEAKER_38]: When it comes to the budget season, and we're gonna have to vote on it, make sure you understand what you're gonna vote on this time, because last year, she suckered you.

4164
05:12:25,337 --> 05:12:27,959
[SPEAKER_38]: We got nothing that we asked for, zero.

4165
05:12:29,199 --> 05:12:38,826
[SPEAKER_38]: And in the meantime, all of a sudden they put this committee, she announces this committee, maybe even working since the fall, she announces this committee, when?

4166
05:12:39,667 --> 05:12:40,828
[SPEAKER_38]: Right after this letter comes out.

4167
05:12:42,025 --> 05:12:42,885
[SPEAKER_38]: big press release.

4168
05:12:43,265 --> 05:12:45,186
[SPEAKER_38]: We're finally looking at the schools.

4169
05:12:45,546 --> 05:12:46,406
[SPEAKER_38]: Are you kidding me?

4170
05:12:46,966 --> 05:12:50,287
[SPEAKER_38]: She's been in office four and a half years now, four and a half years.

4171
05:12:50,307 --> 05:13:02,610
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you know the only new growth we have in our community of substance was off of traffic and parking, by taxing and fees to our residents for parking.

4172
05:13:06,431 --> 05:13:09,012
[SPEAKER_38]: Imagine in five years, our new growth

4173
05:13:10,902 --> 05:13:15,244
[SPEAKER_38]: is to Cuba and a beer hall on Mystic Ave.

4174
05:13:16,785 --> 05:13:18,426
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm going to tell you this is going to be shocking.

4175
05:13:18,987 --> 05:13:22,909
[SPEAKER_38]: But guess what, everyone, we're going to be in some serious crap in a few weeks.

4176
05:13:23,829 --> 05:13:25,690
[SPEAKER_38]: What we're going to hear is going to be terrible.

4177
05:13:25,710 --> 05:13:26,551
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to tell you something.

4178
05:13:27,311 --> 05:13:30,133
[SPEAKER_38]: She's going to sit in her office and she's going to tell us to make the decisions.

4179
05:13:31,465 --> 05:13:33,006
[SPEAKER_38]: So I apologize.

4180
05:13:34,288 --> 05:13:41,194
[SPEAKER_38]: I wish the Alicia Hunt was here because we don't see true growth at all.

4181
05:13:41,254 --> 05:13:42,155
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't see any movement.

4182
05:13:42,175 --> 05:13:44,757
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't see any new growth coming in with development.

4183
05:13:45,678 --> 05:13:48,701
[SPEAKER_38]: And the development that we lost, they weren't in neighborhoods.

4184
05:13:49,041 --> 05:13:50,142
[SPEAKER_38]: They weren't changing neighborhoods.

4185
05:13:51,624 --> 05:13:52,725
[SPEAKER_38]: They weren't commercial areas.

4186
05:13:55,868 --> 05:13:57,329
[SPEAKER_38]: And we still have heard nothing.

4187
05:13:58,772 --> 05:14:00,973
[SPEAKER_38]: So I apologize for you for waiting.

4188
05:14:01,033 --> 05:14:04,055
[SPEAKER_38]: I know you have a big tomorrow, MCAS, I guess, tomorrow.

4189
05:14:04,495 --> 05:14:06,917
[SPEAKER_38]: You have a big meeting tomorrow with the superintendent.

4190
05:14:06,957 --> 05:14:08,898
[SPEAKER_38]: She told me, by the way, everybody's invited.

4191
05:14:09,258 --> 05:14:10,299
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a Zoom meeting.

4192
05:14:11,179 --> 05:14:12,240
[SPEAKER_38]: Very important meeting.

4193
05:14:12,260 --> 05:14:15,141
[SPEAKER_38]: Probably the biggest meeting they'll have in the school department.

4194
05:14:16,382 --> 05:14:17,683
[SPEAKER_38]: The biggest meeting of the year.

4195
05:14:18,083 --> 05:14:19,564
[SPEAKER_38]: And they won't even sit face to face.

4196
05:14:20,204 --> 05:14:21,825
[SPEAKER_38]: They're having a Zoom meeting tomorrow.

4197
05:14:23,466 --> 05:14:24,807
[SPEAKER_38]: But everybody's welcome, she said.

4198
05:14:26,656 --> 05:14:32,057
[SPEAKER_38]: So at five o'clock, by the way, I'll be getting out of work running to awake and I'll jump on as quickly as I can.

4199
05:14:32,777 --> 05:14:37,738
[SPEAKER_38]: But I apologize for waiting, but I know this is important and I appreciate your patience.

4200
05:14:37,898 --> 05:14:38,339
[SPEAKER_38]: So thank you.

4201
05:14:38,619 --> 05:14:40,359
[SPEAKER_46]: I just need to clarify a couple of things.

4202
05:14:41,859 --> 05:14:47,401
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, I agree with Councillor Scarpelli that it is disappointing that a number of significant developments did not move forward.

4203
05:14:47,441 --> 05:14:52,662
[SPEAKER_46]: And I disagreed with the decision to spend two years in land court fighting the glam calculation for the 40 Bs.

4204
05:14:52,682 --> 05:14:53,662
[SPEAKER_46]: I completely agree on that.

4205
05:14:54,783 --> 05:14:57,166
[SPEAKER_46]: There are a few things we have had some new growth it's not enough.

4206
05:14:58,087 --> 05:15:06,396
[SPEAKER_46]: I was talking to the assessor yesterday and he believes that the new growth in the fiscal 25 budget is going to be significant, whether it's significant enough to address the issues outlined.

4207
05:15:07,337 --> 05:15:12,943
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll see when we get the data and information, but when it comes to collaboration and quote unquote getting suckered.

4208
05:15:13,604 --> 05:15:21,054
[SPEAKER_46]: The financial task force was announced the day of the last budget, along with commitment to advance the budget ordinance and improve the process.

4209
05:15:22,316 --> 05:15:30,907
[SPEAKER_46]: There have been some, some missteps in terms of getting information, but we got the financial task force we've been meeting, and we've announced a plan for the first time ever to actually seriously consider

4210
05:15:32,369 --> 05:15:36,572
[SPEAKER_46]: having the voters contribute the additional funding needed to fund our schools.

4211
05:15:36,792 --> 05:15:38,433
[SPEAKER_46]: And that was not getting suckered.

4212
05:15:38,473 --> 05:15:47,940
[SPEAKER_46]: That's actually collaborative work that I was surprised and honestly pleasantly surprised to see come from the administration after what was a really difficult year and two years of budgets.

4213
05:15:48,060 --> 05:15:51,443
[SPEAKER_46]: But yeah, we have been meeting in the financial task force.

4214
05:15:51,483 --> 05:15:52,564
[SPEAKER_46]: It was announced last June.

4215
05:15:53,024 --> 05:15:54,065
[SPEAKER_46]: We began meeting in the fall.

4216
05:15:54,085 --> 05:15:55,105
[SPEAKER_46]: We've had several meetings.

4217
05:15:57,347 --> 05:16:02,068
[SPEAKER_46]: the release that we just put out because we finally agreed on a path forward coming around the budget.

4218
05:16:02,188 --> 05:16:14,871
[SPEAKER_46]: And you're going to see us going collectively and collaboratively from all branches of government to ask the voters to address the 30 years of disinvestment and financial mistakes that have led the city to this point.

4219
05:16:15,131 --> 05:16:15,851
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information.

4220
05:16:16,491 --> 05:16:17,431
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information with that.

4221
05:16:17,931 --> 05:16:19,172
[SPEAKER_38]: This is exactly what I'm saying.

4222
05:16:20,752 --> 05:16:24,913
[SPEAKER_38]: This leads exactly to the dialogue that you presented, Council President, for years.

4223
05:16:26,124 --> 05:16:31,309
[SPEAKER_38]: What I'm saying to you is, understand, she's run the city for five years.

4224
05:16:32,570 --> 05:16:35,072
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't see the financial picture at all.

4225
05:16:35,472 --> 05:16:45,141
[SPEAKER_38]: So until we know the financial picture of what she's done, because maybe 2025 looks great, but she had four years and she's done nothing.

4226
05:16:45,581 --> 05:16:46,862
[SPEAKER_38]: That's why we are where we are.

4227
05:16:47,203 --> 05:16:51,326
[SPEAKER_38]: And to give her more money, so she can throw more away?

4228
05:16:52,227 --> 05:16:52,487
[SPEAKER_47]: At what?

4229
05:16:55,984 --> 05:16:59,147
[SPEAKER_38]: We keep funding her, keep saving her with money, right?

4230
05:16:59,868 --> 05:17:03,332
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no guarantees that she'll do anything that you think she'll do.

4231
05:17:04,233 --> 05:17:05,214
[SPEAKER_38]: Remember, we wanted what?

4232
05:17:05,234 --> 05:17:05,775
[SPEAKER_38]: A city solicitor?

4233
05:17:07,785 --> 05:17:08,386
[SPEAKER_46]: The money's there.

4234
05:17:08,846 --> 05:17:09,466
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not there.

4235
05:17:10,127 --> 05:17:14,210
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'm just gonna again say, you were right that the first three years we didn't get anything.

4236
05:17:14,250 --> 05:17:15,391
[SPEAKER_46]: We had an agreement last year.

4237
05:17:15,411 --> 05:17:16,692
[SPEAKER_46]: She did not the first four years.

4238
05:17:16,952 --> 05:17:18,133
[SPEAKER_46]: He's still done the fourth budget.

4239
05:17:18,153 --> 05:17:19,434
[SPEAKER_46]: We made agreements.

4240
05:17:19,695 --> 05:17:20,635
[SPEAKER_46]: And we have the budget ordinance.

4241
05:17:20,655 --> 05:17:22,737
[SPEAKER_38]: We're still talking about a huge shortfall.

4242
05:17:22,757 --> 05:17:24,519
[SPEAKER_46]: We haven't done nothing talked.

4243
05:17:24,979 --> 05:17:27,581
[SPEAKER_38]: We have exactly done enough actually.

4244
05:17:27,981 --> 05:17:29,723
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a law show me there's a lot of money.

4245
05:17:32,685 --> 05:17:33,466
[SPEAKER_38]: There is no money.

4246
05:17:33,606 --> 05:17:34,026
[SPEAKER_38]: Show me.

4247
05:17:34,266 --> 05:17:34,647
[SPEAKER_38]: You're right.

4248
05:17:34,707 --> 05:17:35,848
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's nothing.

4249
05:17:35,908 --> 05:17:37,569
[SPEAKER_38]: Nothing.

4250
05:17:37,629 --> 05:17:42,734
[SPEAKER_38]: This council that mayor has done nothing.

4251
05:17:42,794 --> 05:17:46,557
[SPEAKER_38]: Nothing to grow the school department and the teachers.

4252
05:17:47,378 --> 05:17:48,318
[SPEAKER_38]: But you can go along.

4253
05:17:48,338 --> 05:17:51,261
[SPEAKER_38]: Trust counselor Scarpelli trust.

4254
05:17:51,321 --> 05:17:53,383
[SPEAKER_38]: Remember we talked about collaboration.

4255
05:17:53,683 --> 05:17:55,425
[SPEAKER_38]: Nothing.

4256
05:17:55,525 --> 05:17:59,068
[SPEAKER_38]: I've been telling you that I've been collaborate with you in her.

4257
05:17:59,568 --> 05:18:01,810
[SPEAKER_38]: the revolution or her.

4258
05:18:01,870 --> 05:18:02,090
[SPEAKER_38]: Right?

4259
05:18:02,251 --> 05:18:04,393
[SPEAKER_38]: And where's that?

4260
05:18:04,593 --> 05:18:06,074
[SPEAKER_38]: And where's the need?

4261
05:18:06,334 --> 05:18:07,215
[SPEAKER_38]: Where's the divide coming?

4262
05:18:07,255 --> 05:18:10,078
[SPEAKER_38]: You keep having meetings?

4263
05:18:10,358 --> 05:18:11,459
[SPEAKER_38]: Please, please.

4264
05:18:11,979 --> 05:18:17,124
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, sounds a lot like Bob Penta a couple hours ago.

4265
05:18:18,185 --> 05:18:20,487
[SPEAKER_46]: public participation, name and address to the record, please.

4266
05:18:21,128 --> 05:18:22,189
[SPEAKER_46]: You should listen yourself tonight.

4267
05:18:24,807 --> 05:18:25,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

4268
05:18:26,168 --> 05:18:26,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

4269
05:18:26,749 --> 05:18:29,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Anthony Guillen, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Lemonster, Massachusetts.

4270
05:18:29,792 --> 05:18:32,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

4271
05:18:34,117 --> 05:19:00,054
[SPEAKER_12]: As Councilman Scarpelli said, there will be a meeting tomorrow of the Committee of the Whole, and I will reflect his sentiments that I am disappointed it is a Zoom meeting, as we were prepped for this meeting in a meeting held by the superintendent last week in which myself and the heads of the school-related unions were brought in and basically given a very short breakdown of

4272
05:19:00,874 --> 05:19:07,137
[SPEAKER_12]: the budgetary shortfalls and some unfinished plans to address them.

4273
05:19:08,538 --> 05:19:19,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll be providing that slideshow to y'all if y'all haven't gotten it already, along with the questions that the Medifid Teachers Association feels is important to have answered in this meeting and going forward.

4274
05:19:21,732 --> 05:19:24,974
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had sporadic messages of budget freezes.

4275
05:19:25,234 --> 05:19:30,838
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had schools that are told you can't get any more paper this this year and then all of a sudden the paper shows back up.

4276
05:19:31,958 --> 05:19:37,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Every school in this district no longer has water jugs for the teachers break rooms.

4277
05:19:40,284 --> 05:19:41,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can't get a clear answer on why.

4278
05:19:45,558 --> 05:19:49,221
[SPEAKER_12]: there was the letter that was sent to the staff from the superintendent that was quite alarming.

4279
05:19:49,561 --> 05:19:51,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was sent the day we had the meeting.

4280
05:19:52,784 --> 05:20:00,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sent a lot of our teachers and especially our new teachers who are already worried about their jobs because they're pre-professionals.

4281
05:20:01,251 --> 05:20:09,858
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they're looking at other districts saying, why am I going to try to hang in for three years in a place that's going to send me a letter that says, hey, you might not have a job come June.

4282
05:20:13,820 --> 05:20:21,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to address that there's, to me, been an alarming amount of spending on independent consultants to the school district, and I don't know that exact number.

4283
05:20:21,487 --> 05:20:35,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never been given to it, but I think it's important to address how much has been spent on independent consultants and outside investigatory parties, because obviously, as the president of the union, I've been privy to a lot of those, though I don't know the cost.

4284
05:20:37,830 --> 05:20:39,712
[SPEAKER_12]: the current financial officer is an interim.

4285
05:20:40,593 --> 05:20:44,337
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know who's going to be doing the school budget come June.

4286
05:20:44,377 --> 05:20:50,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if there's a plan or if there's a list of candidates or if the interim financial officer is going to be made the permanent financial officer.

4287
05:20:52,346 --> 05:20:53,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that needs to be answered.

4288
05:20:54,973 --> 05:21:02,057
[SPEAKER_12]: positions funded in the FY23 budget are listed as ESSER funds, but those were positions we previously had before we got any ESSER money.

4289
05:21:02,277 --> 05:21:04,618
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know where this money has been moved around to.

4290
05:21:05,799 --> 05:21:12,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a newcomers program for EL students that has been around long before we got ESSER money, but now it's listed as an ESSER budgetary item.

4291
05:21:12,343 --> 05:21:18,026
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the presentation, it was said that, well, a lot of these ESSER funded positions may be eliminated.

4292
05:21:18,426 --> 05:21:23,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a lot of questions about which ones those are, and what about positions we've had before ESSER funds?

4293
05:21:24,741 --> 05:21:28,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have ESSER funded positions that went unfilled.

4294
05:21:28,624 --> 05:21:30,885
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are listed, we have a list of those.

4295
05:21:31,165 --> 05:21:34,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't know where that money went, but we're being told there's no more ESSER funds, they're gone.

4296
05:21:35,708 --> 05:21:38,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet, money was set aside for positions that were never filled, so.

4297
05:21:40,631 --> 05:21:42,693
[SPEAKER_12]: I encourage you all to join the meeting tomorrow.

4298
05:21:43,094 --> 05:21:46,457
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be on zoom so people can come in from wherever they are.

4299
05:21:47,618 --> 05:21:52,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And just know that there's a lot of panic going on amongst our teachers, it's a high stress job anyway.

4300
05:21:52,983 --> 05:21:55,625
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's also an understanding that there is a teacher shortage.

4301
05:21:55,965 --> 05:22:00,570
[SPEAKER_12]: So if people want to leave Medford, they might not feel pressured that they can't find a job elsewhere.

4302
05:22:01,243 --> 05:22:09,027
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need stability, we need clear messaging, and we can't just be having emails sent to us on a Wednesday that says, oh, by the way, there's huge budget shortfalls.

4303
05:22:09,487 --> 05:22:10,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

4304
05:22:12,249 --> 05:22:12,949
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. Gahan.

4305
05:22:17,071 --> 05:22:19,632
[SPEAKER_46]: Ron or Marie, are you trying to speak on this item from Zoom?

4306
05:22:23,454 --> 05:22:23,674
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

4307
05:22:23,694 --> 05:22:23,734
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

4308
05:22:28,194 --> 05:22:29,514
[SPEAKER_46]: All right, thanks.

4309
05:22:29,654 --> 05:22:31,555
[SPEAKER_46]: I will go to the podium name and address for the record, please.

4310
05:22:31,575 --> 05:22:32,115
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

4311
05:22:32,535 --> 05:22:34,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Riley Jones.

4312
05:22:34,196 --> 05:22:36,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 138 Pleasant Street, Malden.

4313
05:22:36,856 --> 05:22:42,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a teacher and a member of the executive board of the union.

4314
05:22:42,058 --> 05:22:47,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have additional questions that were posed by members.

4315
05:22:48,260 --> 05:22:50,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add to consideration, again, and

4316
05:22:53,061 --> 05:22:56,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Scarpelli brought those things up also.

4317
05:22:56,223 --> 05:22:59,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things for you guys to think about as well.

4318
05:22:59,125 --> 05:23:06,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, based on the Division of Labor Services, Massachusetts Department of Revenue, Medford has $25,469,513.

4319
05:23:06,570 --> 05:23:09,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a math teacher.

4320
05:23:10,112 --> 05:23:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot for me.

4321
05:23:12,273 --> 05:23:16,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And a certified free cash account as of the end of FY23.

4322
05:23:17,436 --> 05:23:19,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to know, will this money be used?

4323
05:23:19,498 --> 05:23:20,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it not be used?

4324
05:23:21,759 --> 05:23:23,020
[SPEAKER_01]: What is our reasoning there?

4325
05:23:24,421 --> 05:23:28,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the school committee in the past requested access to these funds?

4326
05:23:28,525 --> 05:23:33,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I understand, it's been an available fund for quite some time, and it has been kind of

4327
05:23:35,975 --> 05:23:43,902
[SPEAKER_01]: you've underestimated the local receipts by an average of about $2.5 million each year over the last five years.

4328
05:23:45,163 --> 05:23:47,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your estimates for this year?

4329
05:23:48,426 --> 05:23:50,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the current receipts?

4330
05:23:51,028 --> 05:23:55,432
[SPEAKER_01]: If that money exceeds the estimates again, will you use that money for the schools?

4331
05:23:55,612 --> 05:23:57,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are just things we really want you to consider.

4332
05:23:57,674 --> 05:24:01,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And we again, like Mr

4333
05:24:02,719 --> 05:24:11,236
[SPEAKER_01]: We encourage you guys to show up tomorrow and then also Monday, there is another school committee meeting as well, which we will certainly be at.

4334
05:24:12,057 --> 05:24:12,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

4335
05:24:12,657 --> 05:24:13,638
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you to those questions.

4336
05:24:13,678 --> 05:24:14,978
[SPEAKER_46]: If you don't mind, I do have some answers.

4337
05:24:16,099 --> 05:24:21,122
[SPEAKER_46]: This the 225 million free cash balance is the free cash reserve right now.

4338
05:24:21,162 --> 05:24:24,304
[SPEAKER_46]: It hasn't been certified since the end of fiscal 23, so there isn't access to it.

4339
05:24:26,205 --> 05:24:34,711
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't know if the mayor intends to appropriate any of that money to serve as one time funds to fund the budget to replace one time funds such as SR and ARPA, which were a gap.

4340
05:24:35,551 --> 05:24:47,600
[SPEAKER_46]: this council has constantly raised with the mayor concern about the underestimating of local receipts and the goal for the use of that money, since if we were estimating it properly, we could have additional funding in the spending for the budget.

4341
05:24:49,221 --> 05:25:01,450
[SPEAKER_46]: The mayor has responded and her finance director has responded generally that underestimating that amount is a fiscally conservative and responsible decision in case the receipts do come under, and if they do come over, then that money goes to free cash.

4342
05:25:01,510 --> 05:25:03,612
[SPEAKER_46]: This council has generally disagreed with that assessment.

4343
05:25:03,992 --> 05:25:12,834
[SPEAKER_46]: we do not appropriate funds and only the mayor can allocate an appropriation from free cash reserves or any other one time fund reserve to support deficit issues in the budget.

4344
05:25:12,914 --> 05:25:26,177
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's one of the reasons that the financial task force has been exploring permanent stable funding through what two and a half override to go to our schools so that we're not looking at trying to use free cash reserves to plug holes.

4345
05:25:26,377 --> 05:25:26,717
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

4346
05:25:28,997 --> 05:25:31,378
[SPEAKER_46]: Seeing no one on zoom name and address for the record, please.

4347
05:25:31,418 --> 05:25:32,058
[SPEAKER_46]: You have five minutes.

4348
05:25:33,680 --> 05:25:34,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Joanne McKay.

4349
05:25:35,180 --> 05:25:37,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I live 90 Barbara D. Lane in Tewksbury.

4350
05:25:37,441 --> 05:25:41,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the financial secretary of the Teachers Union.

4351
05:25:41,322 --> 05:25:44,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just had some questions.

4352
05:25:44,703 --> 05:25:56,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the February 6th, when Mr. McHugh projected a shortfall, fall of over $2 million, and then roughly a week later, money was found.

4353
05:25:56,847 --> 05:25:59,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a little bit concerning to the union.

4354
05:26:00,028 --> 05:26:00,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that

4355
05:26:02,102 --> 05:26:04,243
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor did come and request money.

4356
05:26:04,263 --> 05:26:13,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I was looking through, I was at a school committee meeting and Jenny Graham said she would send me this paperwork because it wasn't projected for anyone to see.

4357
05:26:13,227 --> 05:26:14,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said it was public record.

4358
05:26:14,468 --> 05:26:16,809
[SPEAKER_09]: She sent it to me, which was great.

4359
05:26:16,909 --> 05:26:24,032
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's concerning to the union because the mayor did come and ask you all for money as a point of information.

4360
05:26:24,552 --> 05:26:26,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you ever get to see their books?

4361
05:26:26,234 --> 05:26:27,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone audit their books?

4362
05:26:27,676 --> 05:26:31,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone from the city council look at their budget?

4363
05:26:31,319 --> 05:26:32,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you just accept their budget?

4364
05:26:33,101 --> 05:26:35,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a question we have?

4365
05:26:35,924 --> 05:26:37,005
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, there's there's two things.

4366
05:26:37,065 --> 05:26:41,109
[SPEAKER_46]: If you're talking about the stabilization fund that the mayor came to request that we create

4367
05:26:41,556 --> 05:26:44,839
[SPEAKER_46]: She requested that we create the account, but not that we appropriate any funds to it.

4368
05:26:44,879 --> 05:26:46,120
[SPEAKER_46]: So no money was appropriated.

4369
05:26:46,140 --> 05:26:49,463
[SPEAKER_46]: It was the creation of an account that in the future could have money appropriated to it.

4370
05:26:49,883 --> 05:26:58,731
[SPEAKER_46]: That would actually allow that 25 million balance we were talking about to be used year round or some portion of it if it were added to the fund, whereas currently it can only be used after certification, which is usually.

4371
05:26:59,227 --> 05:27:01,969
[SPEAKER_46]: six to nine months into the fiscal year, so it's not available for use.

4372
05:27:03,531 --> 05:27:07,814
[SPEAKER_46]: To the second question, yes, everything is audited by an independent outside auditor.

4373
05:27:08,435 --> 05:27:09,816
[SPEAKER_46]: You can find that on the city website.

4374
05:27:09,836 --> 05:27:13,299
[SPEAKER_46]: It's called the ACFR Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.

4375
05:27:13,699 --> 05:27:18,923
[SPEAKER_46]: There's usually a 12 to 18 month process after the conclusion of a fiscal year where the audit occurs and then the report goes out.

4376
05:27:19,043 --> 05:27:21,025
[SPEAKER_46]: So that is how that works.

4377
05:27:21,755 --> 05:27:30,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a union, we're a little bit concerned that there might be mismanagement of funds because within a week, you briefly went over these, but one account that was over encumbered $265,000.

4378
05:27:31,017 --> 05:27:35,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were just able to find $265,000 in an account that that was able to be used.

4379
05:27:41,258 --> 05:27:53,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, spending that I think it was the teamsters in my in my notes that, uh, was supposed to be that happened in 24, but could be built to 23, which again says to us.

4380
05:27:54,722 --> 05:27:56,343
[SPEAKER_09]: There was over $200,000 on a 23 account that could suddenly be pulled.

4381
05:27:56,363 --> 05:27:56,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

4382
05:28:00,604 --> 05:28:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have balances, $173,000 balance in an account that holds state reimbursement funds for homeless transportation.

4383
05:28:08,215 --> 05:28:09,576
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's another $173,000 in an account.

4384
05:28:12,489 --> 05:28:16,992
[SPEAKER_09]: this is super concerning to the teachers that there's money available that's held in these accounts.

4385
05:28:17,872 --> 05:28:28,199
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a balance in the vocational tuition revolving fund that targeted $200,000 from this fund to pay for the vocational program teachers that's normally being charged to the general fund.

4386
05:28:28,699 --> 05:28:36,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, there's $200,000 in this revolving vocational fund that now, okay, now we can use and we'll take that away from

4387
05:28:37,881 --> 05:28:40,442
[SPEAKER_09]: the general fund and maybe we don't understand this.

4388
05:28:41,382 --> 05:28:53,925
[SPEAKER_09]: There was also one concern concerning thing that there was a balance of a state funded circuit breaker account of $291,000 that can be used for special education.

4389
05:28:54,165 --> 05:28:59,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That one confuses us how you can use circuit breaker and count money for special education.

4390
05:28:59,960 --> 05:29:01,481
[SPEAKER_46]: Circuit breaker is a technical term.

4391
05:29:01,541 --> 05:29:04,782
[SPEAKER_46]: There's a state circuit breaker law that's for funding special education.

4392
05:29:04,802 --> 05:29:05,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

4393
05:29:05,363 --> 05:29:06,623
[SPEAKER_46]: And similar with the vocation.

4394
05:29:06,643 --> 05:29:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: We thought it was like a circuit breaker.

4395
05:29:08,204 --> 05:29:11,026
[SPEAKER_46]: No, not like an electrical circuit breaker.

4396
05:29:11,066 --> 05:29:11,406
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah.

4397
05:29:11,426 --> 05:29:15,968
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's one of the, if you look at the, it's called the cherry sheet, but it's what we get from the state government every year.

4398
05:29:16,008 --> 05:29:17,389
[SPEAKER_46]: It's an allocation of state funds.

4399
05:29:17,449 --> 05:29:19,550
[SPEAKER_46]: One of the lines is the special education circuit breaker.

4400
05:29:20,170 --> 05:29:22,052
[SPEAKER_46]: And it's based on enrollment and other factors.

4401
05:29:22,132 --> 05:29:28,676
[SPEAKER_46]: And similarly, like vocational tuition revolving account, that's for people who are out of the city, who place their kids into the VOC.

4402
05:29:29,176 --> 05:29:31,498
[SPEAKER_46]: And then the other cities, when they're placed, they send tuition in.

4403
05:29:31,898 --> 05:29:40,984
[SPEAKER_46]: So if they underestimate that in the budget, for example, say there's 10, 20 more kids that are coming to the VOC than they thought from outside the city, then you may have a balance that was unbudgeted.

4404
05:29:41,004 --> 05:29:42,405
[SPEAKER_46]: And then that could be go back.

4405
05:29:42,585 --> 05:29:47,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of hidden money is the point that kind of needs to be going through because there's $291,000 in special education money.

4406
05:29:49,930 --> 05:29:53,891
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go through it, I went through and looked at like what we can use and whatever.

4407
05:29:54,031 --> 05:29:56,812
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

4408
05:29:58,052 --> 05:30:01,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And to us, you know, we have a meeting.

4409
05:30:01,473 --> 05:30:02,853
[SPEAKER_09]: We're told we're in dire straits.

4410
05:30:02,893 --> 05:30:03,933
[SPEAKER_09]: A letter went out to us.

4411
05:30:04,033 --> 05:30:11,635
[SPEAKER_09]: There is panic amongst the teachers, amongst the parents, teachers, young teachers, brand new, tenured teachers are all coming to us.

4412
05:30:11,895 --> 05:30:13,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I go try to find another job?

4413
05:30:13,215 --> 05:30:14,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I losing my job?

4414
05:30:14,155 --> 05:30:15,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I be worried about my job?

4415
05:30:15,776 --> 05:30:17,156
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's just

4416
05:30:18,365 --> 05:30:20,787
[SPEAKER_09]: A panic went out when we don't even know the budget yet.

4417
05:30:20,827 --> 05:30:27,391
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems, you know, I just want you to support his resolution.

4418
05:30:27,471 --> 05:30:32,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they need to be called in and heard from in front of you all.

4419
05:30:33,055 --> 05:30:33,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they'll come.

4420
05:30:34,276 --> 05:30:36,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope that they would come if they were called in to answer.

4421
05:30:37,238 --> 05:30:42,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a shame because if they're going to ask for money for you and you're calling him to ask them questions,

4422
05:30:43,598 --> 05:30:44,379
[SPEAKER_09]: That's concerning.

4423
05:30:44,759 --> 05:30:48,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, you're supposed to be working together for all of us.

4424
05:30:49,044 --> 05:30:50,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are just our concerns.

4425
05:30:51,006 --> 05:30:53,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that you all can go to the Zoom tomorrow.

4426
05:30:55,030 --> 05:30:57,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen in and hear what they have to say, because.

4427
05:30:58,487 --> 05:30:58,988
[SPEAKER_09]: We're worried.

4428
05:30:59,348 --> 05:31:00,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very worried.

4429
05:31:00,068 --> 05:31:00,789
[SPEAKER_46]: I hear you.

4430
05:31:00,989 --> 05:31:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not to mention the fact that they're the custodians.

4431
05:31:05,253 --> 05:31:08,036
[SPEAKER_09]: God bless the custodians and what they did during Covid.

4432
05:31:08,116 --> 05:31:11,278
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going over two years without their contract.

4433
05:31:11,999 --> 05:31:13,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand how this is acceptable.

4434
05:31:14,221 --> 05:31:29,760
[SPEAKER_09]: you know what they do for our schools and and secretaries and cafeteria workers and whoever else doesn't have contracts this is all going to play into the picture but it it we all we all intermingle so it's going to affect us all it's

4435
05:31:30,984 --> 05:31:37,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Scarbelli is not, you know, maybe you guys don't agree, but he's a voice of reason on this.

4436
05:31:37,105 --> 05:31:37,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to listen.

4437
05:31:38,206 --> 05:31:39,926
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very important, but thank you very much.

4438
05:31:39,986 --> 05:31:52,789
[SPEAKER_46]: Just on some of the questions, you know, in terms of the process, generally we hear from the school team during the budget season after the school committee has completed its process and made a recommendation to the mayor.

4439
05:31:53,209 --> 05:31:54,649
[SPEAKER_46]: So they will then come before us.

4440
05:31:54,669 --> 05:31:56,650
[SPEAKER_46]: We'll have time to answer questions until that point.

4441
05:31:57,230 --> 05:32:02,474
[SPEAKER_46]: they are the they create the school budget, our only authority on the school budget is actually even less than we have on the rest of the budget.

4442
05:32:03,014 --> 05:32:10,939
[SPEAKER_46]: On the rest of the budget we can approve or cut specific line items on the school budget, we can only approve or cut the total allocation of the schools, we can increase it.

4443
05:32:12,120 --> 05:32:19,745
[SPEAKER_46]: On some of the specific questions, I've spoken to former Superintendent Belson or heard him speak at public meetings, former school committee members, current school committee members,

4444
05:32:20,365 --> 05:32:31,935
[SPEAKER_46]: This process of scraping the revolving accounts and the circuit breaker funds and the state funds, you know everything needs to go into its different account revolving accounts when you have outside sending tuition or you have fees charged for programs that go into the revolving.

4445
05:32:31,955 --> 05:32:39,601
[SPEAKER_46]: I was in the schools in 2009 2010 when we were gutting programs during the recession, and the city wasn't.

4446
05:32:40,362 --> 05:32:42,702
[SPEAKER_46]: putting any money back in, revenues were declining.

4447
05:32:42,722 --> 05:32:45,443
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, I lost multiple programs and teachers at the time.

4448
05:32:46,203 --> 05:32:53,945
[SPEAKER_46]: It's really been standard practice for the Medford Public Schools going on 20 years to be scraping the bottom of the barrel of these funds and saying, oh, it's the end of the year.

4449
05:32:54,625 --> 05:32:55,385
[SPEAKER_46]: Maybe we're in a good place.

4450
05:32:55,405 --> 05:32:56,585
[SPEAKER_46]: We don't have to scrape them this year.

4451
05:32:57,125 --> 05:32:59,566
[SPEAKER_46]: Then they save the money for the next time they have to scrape the funds.

4452
05:32:59,666 --> 05:33:01,086
[SPEAKER_46]: And they go, it's not found money.

4453
05:33:01,406 --> 05:33:03,247
[SPEAKER_46]: It's $100,000 here, $50,000 there, $10,000 there that's in an account.

4454
05:33:06,568 --> 05:33:12,495
[SPEAKER_46]: And when things get bad, they go and they scrape it and try to keep as much as they can in there.

4455
05:33:13,316 --> 05:33:25,149
[SPEAKER_46]: I have generally considered this to be bad practice I don't think it's how we should fund a school system I don't think it doesn't show we value our public school system and that's why I think, personally, and why I've been working with my colleagues on this.

4456
05:33:25,709 --> 05:33:35,693
[SPEAKER_46]: We need to increase permanent funding for the schools so that we're not scraping the barrel of revolving funds and circuit breaker funds or trying to go to the free cash reserve to plug gaps with one time funding.

4457
05:33:36,133 --> 05:33:37,293
[SPEAKER_46]: So there's permanent funding there.

4458
05:33:37,874 --> 05:33:39,134
[SPEAKER_46]: To me that's what this looks like.

4459
05:33:39,674 --> 05:33:48,718
[SPEAKER_46]: They said oh we can identify this account, maybe there was some hundred thousand from the previous year, we can identify a contract across fiscal year so we'll charge it to the previous year rather than this year.

4460
05:33:49,318 --> 05:33:52,725
[SPEAKER_46]: We found a settlement we can book to fiscal 25 or fiscal 24.

4461
05:33:52,926 --> 05:33:53,808
[SPEAKER_46]: We're going to book it to that.

4462
05:33:53,828 --> 05:33:55,932
[SPEAKER_46]: To me, it's an indication of

4463
05:33:58,069 --> 05:34:08,997
[SPEAKER_46]: people, maybe not enough people, and maybe not enough resources, but people working very hard to try to make do with what is available, find every dollar that's in every account.

4464
05:34:09,597 --> 05:34:14,321
[SPEAKER_46]: And the sad part is that I've experienced this personally, and we've seen it in many years.

4465
05:34:14,801 --> 05:34:16,723
[SPEAKER_46]: The fiscal 2020 budget was one of the worst ones.

4466
05:34:16,763 --> 05:34:21,626
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we were looking at a three, $3.5 million hole, and we asked the mayor to put some free cash in.

4467
05:34:21,646 --> 05:34:24,528
[SPEAKER_46]: I think she put in a million, million five, so it wasn't enough.

4468
05:34:25,782 --> 05:34:29,926
[SPEAKER_46]: but that is there's not enough left at the end of the year, the systemic underfunding of the system.

4469
05:34:30,186 --> 05:34:42,176
[SPEAKER_46]: And even when the barrel is scraped and the funds are pulled from every nook and cranny that they can be pulled from rather than maybe being left there to be used for something new, we still can't fund the basics.

4470
05:34:42,416 --> 05:34:45,659
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's what I'm hoping we'll look at, a systemic solution.

4471
05:34:45,819 --> 05:34:49,162
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll go to Councilor Sang, Councilor Zaro, thank you.

4472
05:34:50,240 --> 05:34:55,146
[SPEAKER_29]: I know it's late I'll try to be brief but I'm passionate about this issue so my goal.

4473
05:34:55,566 --> 05:35:00,792
[SPEAKER_29]: I, I think I want to start by saying you know the reason why I ran in the first place.

4474
05:35:00,813 --> 05:35:09,342
[SPEAKER_29]: There are two reasons but one of one of the two is because of that fiscal 2020 budget that President bears talked about on that saw.

4475
05:35:09,983 --> 05:35:11,104
[SPEAKER_29]: cuts to education.

4476
05:35:11,945 --> 05:35:17,290
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanted to run and make sure that we had a seat here that would vote against any budget that cut schools.

4477
05:35:18,291 --> 05:35:20,453
[SPEAKER_29]: And my position remains the same.

4478
05:35:20,473 --> 05:35:26,559
[SPEAKER_29]: I would find it hard if not impossible to vote for a budget that cuts school funding.

4479
05:35:27,699 --> 05:35:31,801
[SPEAKER_29]: I communicate that to the mayor every single time we come around to budget season.

4480
05:35:31,901 --> 05:35:39,404
[SPEAKER_29]: I actually call her personally, and that's the first thing out of my mouth when we're talking about the budget, which is what those calls are about.

4481
05:35:40,605 --> 05:35:54,851
[SPEAKER_29]: And in the last two years, we've actually, because of the organizing that we've done in the city council, and this is where I would disagree with my fellow councilor, because of that organizing that we've done in the council and because of the phone calls that we've made,

4482
05:35:55,451 --> 05:35:56,032
[SPEAKER_29]: to the mayor.

4483
05:35:56,632 --> 05:36:05,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Um she has said to me, you know, this year we're adding two million three million and over the last two years, we've added about $6 million.

4484
05:36:05,659 --> 05:36:06,980
[SPEAKER_29]: Um to the school budget.

4485
05:36:07,481 --> 05:36:13,345
[SPEAKER_29]: Um and you know, in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough to fund everything we need, but it has carried us over.

4486
05:36:13,365 --> 05:36:16,568
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this budget we all know it's going to be difficult, but my.

4487
05:36:17,268 --> 05:36:19,009
[SPEAKER_29]: My fundamental position remains the same.

4488
05:36:19,650 --> 05:36:24,434
[SPEAKER_29]: Um I believe Mr Jones had some great questions about as, um.

4489
05:36:25,214 --> 05:36:27,695
[SPEAKER_29]: President Barrett said, we ask ourselves as well.

4490
05:36:29,316 --> 05:36:37,619
[SPEAKER_29]: And we'll be asking those questions this time as well, this budget season as well.

4491
05:36:38,619 --> 05:36:44,902
[SPEAKER_29]: I actually don't know where my fellow counselors stand on how things are budgeted, how the money is found and how things are budgeted.

4492
05:36:44,942 --> 05:36:50,424
[SPEAKER_29]: But for me, the most important thing at the end of the day is that the schools get that budget that they need and that it's not cuts.

4493
05:36:51,364 --> 05:36:59,229
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I know a number of us might have professional commitments, but it is thank you for the opportunity for inviting us to join the zoom.

4494
05:36:59,770 --> 05:37:05,633
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I believe I might have something, but please send over the zoom link to us as counselors as well.

4495
05:37:06,434 --> 05:37:18,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and one more thing that, you know, even if we can't attend, it would be really helpful for us to receive, you know, an update from the union about, um, how that meeting tomorrow goes.

4496
05:37:18,542 --> 05:37:18,782
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

4497
05:37:21,977 --> 05:37:23,038
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

4498
05:37:23,098 --> 05:37:25,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do my best to go to the meeting at five.

4499
05:37:25,299 --> 05:37:29,681
[SPEAKER_14]: My daughter has gymnastics, of course, it'll be tight, but I'll do my best to be there.

4500
05:37:29,901 --> 05:37:34,384
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the number one thing I ran on actually was funding the schools.

4501
05:37:34,424 --> 05:37:37,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to work for the superintendent and I worked closely with the school committee.

4502
05:37:37,625 --> 05:37:50,992
[SPEAKER_14]: My hesitation on the resolution is that I think that because of the specifics of how the school committee works with the superintendent and the mayor on the intricacies of their budget, we, and since our approval

4503
05:37:52,011 --> 05:37:52,391
[SPEAKER_14]: know that the.

4504
05:37:52,431 --> 05:37:54,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Procedure for it is really just about big picture.

4505
05:37:55,212 --> 05:37:58,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I knowing what I knew about how.

4506
05:37:59,974 --> 05:38:01,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Stark the budget was every year.

4507
05:38:01,354 --> 05:38:10,958
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew that I could do the most good by being able to make large structural changes that would bring in more revenue to the city, and that would then get funneled to the schools.

4508
05:38:11,338 --> 05:38:14,539
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know that for City Council, what we can do is stuff that

4509
05:38:19,696 --> 05:38:32,142
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's what's gonna carry us forward and make larger changes that will then allow the schools to have some permanent shifts that will mean that every year you're not dealing with this in the same way.

4510
05:38:35,083 --> 05:38:39,765
[SPEAKER_14]: That being said, it is like such a high priority for me.

4511
05:38:39,965 --> 05:38:47,869
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so important to me and I really look forward to that meeting and to hearing more about your concerns, please email me.

4512
05:38:48,328 --> 05:38:48,988
[SPEAKER_14]: to the mayor's office.

4513
05:38:49,008 --> 05:38:49,848
[SPEAKER_14]: You can reach me on the phone.

4514
05:38:49,868 --> 05:38:51,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you lose our at Medford dash and make dot org.

4515
05:38:52,309 --> 05:38:52,789
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

4516
05:38:53,129 --> 05:39:05,592
[SPEAKER_46]: I just do also want to read the we made three recommendations to the mayor for this budget under the new budget ordinance process, and the first line of the first recommendation was recommendation for a level service budget, including meeting the public school funding recommendation.

4517
05:39:05,873 --> 05:39:08,113
[SPEAKER_46]: So that was the first recommendation that we made to the mayor.

4518
05:39:16,018 --> 05:39:19,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for being here, especially for waiting such a long time.

4519
05:39:19,580 --> 05:39:25,362
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's really helpful to hear it straight from MTA representatives, people who work in the schools like yourself.

4520
05:39:25,382 --> 05:39:29,704
[SPEAKER_18]: So just thank you as always for being here, especially when it takes a really long time to take a turn.

4521
05:39:29,724 --> 05:39:39,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanna echo a lot of what my fellow counselors have said, and also just, you know, acknowledge, like I know it's been, I know it's always hard.

4522
05:39:39,468 --> 05:39:45,551
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's been an especially alarming couple of weeks with numbers coming out and then quickly saying,

4523
05:39:47,065 --> 05:39:48,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, there was an error.

4524
05:39:48,847 --> 05:39:52,070
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the number now, because that affects your day-to-day.

4525
05:39:52,210 --> 05:39:53,691
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to acknowledge that.

4526
05:39:54,532 --> 05:40:08,405
[SPEAKER_18]: My fellow counselors have spoken to our role in this process, which I know for folks pretty intimately familiar with the budget process, is already familiar.

4527
05:40:12,723 --> 05:40:21,350
[SPEAKER_18]: It is tough being so invested in the outcome in the school department budget specifically and having such an abstract role in the budget process at the same time.

4528
05:40:22,330 --> 05:40:33,399
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it really is important to state for the record that while I think, speaking only for myself, we never have as direct of a hand as we want to have in the school department budget or really any city department's budget.

4529
05:40:33,419 --> 05:40:37,322
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important to state for the record what

4530
05:40:42,486 --> 05:41:06,564
[SPEAKER_18]: we are trying to do within our city council jurisdiction year round and indeed over the past term into this term to try to lay the conditions where we can get away from this model where around every time this year, it's a scary time and it's an uncertain time and everybody is feeling concern or just feeling disappointment that we're not able to guarantee the things that we all know should be guaranteed.

4531
05:41:08,466 --> 05:41:11,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Really recently on the council side, we approved another PDD

4532
05:41:12,414 --> 05:41:19,060
[SPEAKER_18]: we're already doing on the zoning side to bring up that baseline in terms of our permitting, in terms of our commercial tax base.

4533
05:41:20,001 --> 05:41:28,988
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the three major projects that we're gonna be working on the city council this term is that total zoning reevaluation overhaul.

4534
05:41:29,389 --> 05:41:40,518
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like I bring this up all the time, but that undergirds everything that we can directly do to get to a city budget where we can reliably fund the things that students deserve, families deserve, teachers deserve,

4535
05:41:40,831 --> 05:41:47,736
[SPEAKER_18]: This is stuff that we have been working on as a council for advocating for that, fighting for that, for longer than I have been on the council.

4536
05:41:48,376 --> 05:41:59,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're at a stage where we are going to start actually making the literal amendments that will allow us to do what we can within our jurisdiction to increase that pie.

4537
05:42:00,064 --> 05:42:03,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's not to say that things are the way that they are and that's okay.

4538
05:42:04,747 --> 05:42:05,768
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not okay.

4539
05:42:06,068 --> 05:42:09,070
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I've made it really clear that I think it's not okay.

4540
05:42:09,390 --> 05:42:10,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody thinks that it's okay.

4541
05:42:13,553 --> 05:42:24,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I am also, I think that it is our responsibility to do everything we can with what's currently on the table to get the best outcomes this year and next year with the tools that we have.

4542
05:42:25,458 --> 05:42:39,624
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I voted for the budget last year after negotiating procedural improvements that would allow us to, this year, hit the ground running with the financial task force that we did announce last June so that we can have these conversations about

4543
05:42:40,279 --> 05:42:44,221
[SPEAKER_18]: stability measures for how we're going to get away from this kind of crisis model of budgeting.

4544
05:42:45,681 --> 05:43:07,610
[SPEAKER_18]: It's why I'll never hold potential funding opportunities hostage to administration change, because I think that our students deserve more than that, and our teachers deserve more than that, and I think that all of the budgeting improvements that we need to see are already so overdue, and I think that every single person agrees with that, but

4545
05:43:09,335 --> 05:43:12,798
[SPEAKER_18]: we just have to do everything that we can at every single opportunity.

4546
05:43:15,000 --> 05:43:17,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how we have to approach this year.

4547
05:43:17,462 --> 05:43:31,993
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really appreciate everybody from the MTA bringing their perspective to the city council and to the school committee, which of course is always able to answer these questions probably in more granular detail, though I think President Pierce does a great job for a non-school committee member.

4548
05:43:33,815 --> 05:43:37,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that it's up to this council to, in these meetings, talk the talk,

4549
05:43:38,493 --> 05:43:42,334
[SPEAKER_18]: and hold our administration to account, like we said, level service.

4550
05:43:42,714 --> 05:43:45,195
[SPEAKER_18]: That's got to be the floor every year that we have to improve from there.

4551
05:43:46,095 --> 05:43:51,117
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have to walk the walk in terms of doing what's within our power to increase the pie.

4552
05:43:51,817 --> 05:43:52,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

4553
05:43:53,377 --> 05:43:53,838
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

4554
05:43:54,018 --> 05:43:58,379
[SPEAKER_46]: iPad5, if you could change your name or start your video, I'll let you speak.

4555
05:44:04,403 --> 05:44:06,263
[SPEAKER_46]: All right, just wanted to make sure you were a real person.

4556
05:44:06,444 --> 05:44:09,384
[SPEAKER_46]: iPad five, name and address for the record.

4557
05:44:09,984 --> 05:44:10,885
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, it's Charlene.

4558
05:44:10,945 --> 05:44:11,445
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, Charlene.

4559
05:44:11,705 --> 05:44:15,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I know you couldn't see me and it was, I'm sorry.

4560
05:44:15,886 --> 05:44:17,947
[SPEAKER_46]: Name and address for the record, please.

4561
05:44:18,147 --> 05:44:19,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Charlene Douglas.

4562
05:44:19,787 --> 05:44:24,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm homesick and I'm listening to this meeting and been here since the beginning.

4563
05:44:25,468 --> 05:44:31,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So I listened to my former fellow colleagues and various things.

4564
05:44:31,730 --> 05:44:47,450
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things that I want to address is that I do not want to relive a 2011 where we laid off 122 teachers and lost our best and our brightest to all too many districts and we never got them back.

4565
05:44:48,451 --> 05:45:13,942
[SPEAKER_02]: um and our all our diverse teachers we lost in 2011 because of the 122 cuts so let's hope we don't relive that i'm asking you i'm employing you and i know that you all care about the schools and how important it is but i really would like you to look at this budget we have things in the budget that just don't make sense why in the world would we use take

4566
05:45:14,682 --> 05:45:22,506
[SPEAKER_02]: opera funds to pay for a newcomer's program that has been in existence since EL students have been around.

4567
05:45:23,527 --> 05:45:28,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the frustration, that is the things that really frustrate teachers.

4568
05:45:28,509 --> 05:45:35,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got young teachers that panic, they're looking, don't think they're not, and they will be grabbed like that.

4569
05:45:35,813 --> 05:45:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we always want to

4570
05:45:39,335 --> 05:45:41,216
[SPEAKER_02]: balance things on the back of the schools.

4571
05:45:41,796 --> 05:45:42,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what what happens.

4572
05:45:43,176 --> 05:45:47,478
[SPEAKER_02]: These revolving accounts, you know, there are things in the budget that are never there.

4573
05:45:47,798 --> 05:45:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that I've gone through this budget.

4574
05:45:49,718 --> 05:45:52,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen custodians listed four times.

4575
05:45:52,699 --> 05:45:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answers we received and you will all remember this was we do that.

4576
05:45:58,021 --> 05:46:04,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that to protect and because maybe we'll have a $400,000 shortfall.

4577
05:46:04,883 --> 05:46:08,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we put in that extra money, and we hide it there, that's what we do.

4578
05:46:08,664 --> 05:46:12,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not sound funding or fiscal budgets.

4579
05:46:12,467 --> 05:46:19,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee you, when I get the new budget and I go through it, I will be able to find those same types of errors.

4580
05:46:20,032 --> 05:46:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The last thing I want to say is the increase in administration and the increase in consultants in this district is at an all time high.

4581
05:46:31,676 --> 05:46:33,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, substitutes.

4582
05:46:34,279 --> 05:46:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay the substitutes.

4583
05:46:36,302 --> 05:46:41,328
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying the substitutes $100 a day, you can't get them, yet you're paying my teachers.

4584
05:46:41,748 --> 05:46:48,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The teachers in this district to cover for substitutes, $40 a period, that's five periods a day.

4585
05:46:48,716 --> 05:46:49,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Five times four is $200.

4586
05:46:51,940 --> 05:46:53,802
[SPEAKER_02]: do the math, do the math.

4587
05:46:54,462 --> 05:46:56,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am beyond frustrated.

4588
05:46:56,944 --> 05:46:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I waited.

4589
05:46:57,845 --> 05:46:59,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so sick.

4590
05:46:59,126 --> 05:46:59,987
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.

4591
05:47:00,487 --> 05:47:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And I probably look I can imagine just how I look.

4592
05:47:04,070 --> 05:47:04,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So

4593
05:47:06,428 --> 05:47:10,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that we all understand how important this is.

4594
05:47:10,833 --> 05:47:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you don't want to have them come in front of you, whatever it may be.

4595
05:47:15,739 --> 05:47:19,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand the school committee has their part in it, and I understand the budget.

4596
05:47:19,944 --> 05:47:23,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be at tomorrow's budget hearing without a doubt.

4597
05:47:23,649 --> 05:47:25,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is so important.

4598
05:47:25,811 --> 05:47:30,513
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, that we hold them accountable and we ask them to explain this budget.

4599
05:47:31,074 --> 05:47:38,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will gladly, when you get the budget, you can call me, I will sit with you personally and go through it with you line by line.

4600
05:47:38,737 --> 05:47:40,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that budget better than anyone else.

4601
05:47:40,878 --> 05:47:47,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking at it since I started the schools and that was in 1990.

4602
05:47:47,541 --> 05:47:48,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

4603
05:47:51,263 --> 05:47:53,124
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Charlene.

4604
05:47:54,402 --> 05:47:55,883
[SPEAKER_46]: and discussion on the motion.

4605
05:47:55,903 --> 05:47:57,803
[SPEAKER_36]: Council President.

4606
05:47:58,764 --> 05:48:01,024
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Lemming, sorry.

4607
05:48:02,705 --> 05:48:03,405
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, one second.

4608
05:48:04,645 --> 05:48:05,406
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Lemming.

4609
05:48:06,026 --> 05:48:18,630
[SPEAKER_31]: Just a point of clarification from Councilor Scarpelli, through the chair, the resolution doesn't specify, is the intention to come before a regular meeting, a committee of the whole, private meeting?

4610
05:48:18,930 --> 05:48:21,651
[SPEAKER_31]: Just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.

4611
05:48:22,827 --> 05:48:26,088
[SPEAKER_38]: We were hoping that someone would be here tonight before the big meeting tomorrow.

4612
05:48:26,929 --> 05:48:31,031
[SPEAKER_38]: So a representative, so she emailed us, let us know she couldn't come.

4613
05:48:31,331 --> 05:48:35,853
[SPEAKER_38]: So I wanted to make sure that the teachers had a voice tonight before tomorrow's meeting.

4614
05:48:36,273 --> 05:48:36,953
[SPEAKER_38]: That was the hope.

4615
05:48:37,073 --> 05:48:49,959
[SPEAKER_38]: So the superintendent, we would have rather had the superintendent here and her financial team to answer some of these questions that I think are a huge burden, but obviously that's not,

4616
05:48:51,175 --> 05:48:52,757
[SPEAKER_38]: about what we have.

4617
05:48:52,777 --> 05:49:00,508
[SPEAKER_31]: So well, so is the is the current intention behind this to if we pass this, that they'll meet with us and receive a place on file.

4618
05:49:00,648 --> 05:49:05,755
[SPEAKER_46]: So on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, I can't thank you.

4619
05:49:09,591 --> 05:49:25,209
[SPEAKER_38]: Sometimes emotions get the better of me, but I will tell you that the problem we're seeing, and I think that this is what's frustrating, is that although we all identify that the schools are not one priority, we're still the financial stewards of this whole community, the whole city.

4620
05:49:25,229 --> 05:49:29,273
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, we talked about, we talked about our

4621
05:49:31,462 --> 05:49:33,143
[SPEAKER_38]: what's going on with the custodians.

4622
05:49:33,763 --> 05:49:46,010
[SPEAKER_38]: We haven't talked about the police that don't have contracts, the 911 operators that don't have contracts, that the COLA, I think the COLA, I don't know what the COLA is right now, but that's not looking good.

4623
05:49:46,829 --> 05:50:01,836
[SPEAKER_38]: So, I mean, there's so much, but I think my frustration with Councilor Bears now, we joke about his initiatives and we, you know, and I understand that this is where, maybe it is, maybe you'll get a vote from me one day for that.

4624
05:50:01,937 --> 05:50:10,781
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe it will be, but again, in a more calming fashion, understanding the waste that we're seeing and hearing.

4625
05:50:13,083 --> 05:50:22,647
[SPEAKER_38]: the investigations, the lawsuits, the settlements, the consultants, on and on.

4626
05:50:22,747 --> 05:50:28,289
[SPEAKER_38]: This is dead empty money that we could have used this year.

4627
05:50:28,389 --> 05:50:39,534
[SPEAKER_38]: So when you say you've done your work, I apologize for disrespecting you because I'm sure you did some work, but the questions that need to be answered aren't being asked for some reason.

4628
05:50:40,646 --> 05:50:46,947
[SPEAKER_38]: So if you're, as our leadership team, you're with there, find out what we paid KP Law.

4629
05:50:47,648 --> 05:50:52,069
[SPEAKER_38]: Find out what we paid out for all these lawsuits that we lost.

4630
05:50:52,889 --> 05:50:58,470
[SPEAKER_38]: Find out what it costs to take all these 40 Bs to task in court and then appeal it.

4631
05:50:59,530 --> 05:51:03,071
[SPEAKER_38]: This is money that we lost, money that we should, so were there shortfalls?

4632
05:51:03,091 --> 05:51:05,612
[SPEAKER_38]: I guarantee there was shortfalls, I'm sure there's shortfalls.

4633
05:51:06,647 --> 05:51:19,433
[SPEAKER_38]: But as the stewards of our financial budget here in this city, all of it, because when we're talking about, listen, we're gonna, I hope we don't lose teachers, but we're gonna lose firefighters.

4634
05:51:20,013 --> 05:51:22,374
[SPEAKER_38]: We're gonna lose police officers.

4635
05:51:22,915 --> 05:51:24,735
[SPEAKER_38]: We're gonna lose 911 operators.

4636
05:51:24,755 --> 05:51:25,996
[SPEAKER_38]: We're gonna lose custodians.

4637
05:51:27,277 --> 05:51:29,318
[SPEAKER_38]: We're gonna be in a mess.

4638
05:51:30,418 --> 05:51:34,040
[SPEAKER_38]: At least that's what I was told from what I'm hearing.

4639
05:51:35,285 --> 05:51:47,290
[SPEAKER_38]: But I haven't, I know you've had talks with them, but you haven't shared anything with this counselor about the outlook or the financial outlook that you're hearing from these meetings, or if you're even giving those meetings.

4640
05:51:47,610 --> 05:51:48,970
[SPEAKER_38]: That's where my frustration comes in.

4641
05:51:49,510 --> 05:51:50,691
[SPEAKER_38]: So you might be meeting with them.

4642
05:51:50,911 --> 05:51:54,252
[SPEAKER_38]: And when you say you've talked to your, I haven't heard one thing.

4643
05:51:55,253 --> 05:52:00,575
[SPEAKER_38]: The only thing I've heard is what I've asked for, for the city, for the administration to pass on.

4644
05:52:01,395 --> 05:52:03,696
[SPEAKER_38]: So we got December, what did December tell us?

4645
05:52:05,083 --> 05:52:06,304
[SPEAKER_38]: You saw them, right?

4646
05:52:06,424 --> 05:52:07,384
[SPEAKER_38]: What did December tell us?

4647
05:52:07,404 --> 05:52:13,227
[SPEAKER_38]: $78,000 between the schools in the city for KP law.

4648
05:52:14,248 --> 05:52:15,088
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's December.

4649
05:52:16,569 --> 05:52:17,469
[SPEAKER_38]: That's a holiday month.

4650
05:52:19,050 --> 05:52:31,837
[SPEAKER_38]: So just imagine, this is what I'm saying about, before, listen, if we could show data that shows, listen, that, hey, everything's on the up and up, and it's not mismanaged, and all this money that we've lost,

4651
05:52:32,694 --> 05:52:46,199
[SPEAKER_38]: that if it's funneled in the correct way and managed the correct way, then maybe we just need an override, or maybe we need something different, a debt exclusion to help some things, or maybe we can take some free cash.

4652
05:52:46,659 --> 05:52:49,680
[SPEAKER_38]: But we don't know the true financial picture, because no one's telling us.

4653
05:52:50,841 --> 05:52:52,301
[SPEAKER_38]: And I believe they're not telling you either.

4654
05:52:52,321 --> 05:52:54,662
[SPEAKER_38]: I would assume they haven't.

4655
05:52:55,802 --> 05:52:58,003
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think this is where my frustration comes in, everyone.

4656
05:52:58,063 --> 05:52:59,624
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that this is why

4657
05:53:00,891 --> 05:53:05,114
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm at a loss because I was part of the negotiating team when I was a teacher.

4658
05:53:05,734 --> 05:53:15,400
[SPEAKER_38]: And then as a school kid member, we sat there and listen, I sat there with John Falco and Billy O'Keefe and we told the mayor, this is what we want.

4659
05:53:15,420 --> 05:53:16,781
[SPEAKER_38]: Mike McGlynn didn't give you a thing.

4660
05:53:18,562 --> 05:53:26,246
[SPEAKER_38]: But he came back the next meeting, an emergency meeting, found $600,000 to make sure we can get what we needed for our kids.

4661
05:53:26,807 --> 05:53:28,508
[SPEAKER_38]: So as we're moving forward to this week,

4662
05:53:29,437 --> 05:53:31,378
[SPEAKER_38]: and these, especially tomorrow.

4663
05:53:33,499 --> 05:53:36,760
[SPEAKER_38]: The way that it was all presented, it was a scared tactic for our teachers.

4664
05:53:38,420 --> 05:53:41,301
[SPEAKER_38]: And what got me more fired up is I talked to parents are taking their kids.

4665
05:53:41,582 --> 05:53:42,702
[SPEAKER_38]: How many times we had tonight?

4666
05:53:43,402 --> 05:53:46,543
[SPEAKER_38]: How many times did we hear tonight the parents are taking kids out of the public schools?

4667
05:53:48,724 --> 05:53:49,725
[SPEAKER_38]: By the way, that hurts us.

4668
05:53:50,625 --> 05:53:53,766
[SPEAKER_38]: Because we get reimbursed, it goes by number of pupils.

4669
05:53:55,327 --> 05:53:56,047
[SPEAKER_38]: So we lose them.

4670
05:53:57,788 --> 05:53:57,908
[SPEAKER_38]: So

4671
05:53:59,281 --> 05:54:00,402
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a lot of frustration.

4672
05:54:00,422 --> 05:54:04,105
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for listening.

4673
05:54:04,145 --> 05:54:09,149
[SPEAKER_46]: I also appreciate what your remarks are also apologize for getting into a heated argument with you.

4674
05:54:13,524 --> 05:54:21,890
[SPEAKER_46]: There's the big picture of things, going back to the presentation I made two years ago that made me the 18-month enemy of the administration.

4675
05:54:22,250 --> 05:54:29,776
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that that structural reality exists when it comes to what's happened this year, what's the accounting, where are we budget to actual, and the law department.

4676
05:54:30,637 --> 05:54:35,620
[SPEAKER_46]: I have asked, and my expectation is we will receive the data that shows us that, law department, everything else.

4677
05:54:36,861 --> 05:54:41,385
[SPEAKER_46]: And I can understand the frustration with, and I've said this many times to the administration,

4678
05:54:42,577 --> 05:54:46,399
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we can all see the big picture of the issues in the city.

4679
05:54:46,419 --> 05:54:50,501
[SPEAKER_46]: In the long run, the structural issues, the underfunded capital gains, et cetera.

4680
05:54:51,362 --> 05:54:57,105
[SPEAKER_46]: Why make it hard for us to have those conversations by not giving us the little easy things that I know you can generate?

4681
05:54:58,430 --> 05:55:01,271
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's the piece of it where I ask for more.

4682
05:55:01,752 --> 05:55:03,132
[SPEAKER_46]: But I am hopeful.

4683
05:55:03,292 --> 05:55:08,875
[SPEAKER_46]: I have not been hopeful at the level that I am that we will have information that we have not had in four years.

4684
05:55:09,615 --> 05:55:17,659
[SPEAKER_46]: I can respect you sitting here for four years plus another four before that and feeling hopeless that we will not receive it.

4685
05:55:19,000 --> 05:55:22,001
[SPEAKER_46]: And the next two months will play out what will be seen.

4686
05:55:22,041 --> 05:55:24,563
[SPEAKER_46]: And I hope that I'm right.

4687
05:55:24,743 --> 05:55:26,724
[SPEAKER_46]: And if you're right, I've come up.

4688
05:55:26,744 --> 05:55:27,064
[SPEAKER_46]: I hope I'm not.

4689
05:55:27,424 --> 05:55:32,928
[SPEAKER_46]: I hope you're not, and I have sat mostly in that chair, but I'll be saying it here now that I was wrong.

4690
05:55:33,589 --> 05:55:35,130
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's, to me, what trust is about.

4691
05:55:37,511 --> 05:55:38,492
[SPEAKER_46]: When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

4692
05:55:38,952 --> 05:55:39,653
[SPEAKER_46]: And I hope I'm not.

4693
05:55:40,373 --> 05:55:42,715
[SPEAKER_46]: And I hope you aren't right, but we'll see.

4694
05:55:44,236 --> 05:55:44,917
[SPEAKER_39]: Cross our fingers.

4695
05:55:45,497 --> 05:55:51,942
[SPEAKER_46]: Any further discussion on the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang?

4696
05:55:51,962 --> 05:55:53,623
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

4697
05:55:54,364 --> 05:55:54,704
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

4698
05:55:54,744 --> 05:55:55,384
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

4699
05:56:04,722 --> 05:56:05,322
[SPEAKER_46]: We withdraw?

4700
05:56:05,342 --> 05:56:05,382
[SPEAKER_46]: OK.

4701
05:56:06,623 --> 05:56:07,023
[SPEAKER_46]: Withdraw 24072.

4702
05:56:07,063 --> 05:56:11,746
[SPEAKER_46]: Mine are really quick, if you guys don't mind me, for six minutes.

4703
05:56:15,527 --> 05:56:17,208
[SPEAKER_46]: Council Vice President Collins, if you could.

4704
05:56:19,790 --> 05:56:20,910
[SPEAKER_46]: These are get thing out the doors.

4705
05:56:21,370 --> 05:56:22,451
[SPEAKER_46]: Get things out the door type thing.

4706
05:56:36,434 --> 05:56:37,816
[SPEAKER_46]: Can we take the Cherish Act?

4707
05:56:38,937 --> 05:56:43,842
[SPEAKER_40]: Yep.

4708
05:56:43,862 --> 05:56:44,663
[SPEAKER_46]: Actually, just take it in order.

4709
05:56:44,683 --> 05:56:45,403
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't know what I'm saying.

4710
05:56:45,784 --> 05:56:46,064
[SPEAKER_46]: Sorry.

4711
05:56:48,827 --> 05:56:49,608
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, I took it from you.

4712
05:56:51,890 --> 05:56:52,831
[SPEAKER_46]: It's 2406 on page 26, MWRA water supply.

4713
05:56:52,851 --> 05:56:53,011
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

4714
05:57:04,995 --> 05:57:11,497
[SPEAKER_18]: 24061 resolution to oppose landfill that endangers MWRA water supply.

4715
05:57:12,317 --> 05:57:28,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we join with neighboring communities, environmental protection activists, and the residents of Hardwick MA in opposing the proposed construction of a landfill by Casella Corporation near the Quabbin Reservoir watershed due to the incredible danger it poses to our regional water supply.

4716
05:57:28,562 --> 05:57:29,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved

4717
05:57:29,994 --> 05:57:36,876
[SPEAKER_18]: that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority leadership and the Medford State Legislative Delegation.

4718
05:57:36,996 --> 05:57:37,537
[SPEAKER_18]: President Behrs.

4719
05:57:37,837 --> 05:57:38,837
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam President.

4720
05:57:41,018 --> 05:57:49,641
[SPEAKER_46]: Relatively self-explanatory, but the Casella Corporation, a large waste removal corporation, is proposing building a major landfill within two miles of the Quabbin River watershed.

4721
05:57:50,248 --> 05:57:59,467
[SPEAKER_46]: folks who don't know, when we talk about climate change, when we talk about access to fresh drinking water, we in the state are incredibly privileged to have the Guabin Reservoir, a multi-billion gallon

4722
05:58:01,552 --> 05:58:22,689
[SPEAKER_46]: water reserve, it is entirely naturally filtered, which means that if this landfill were to be an issue, or if trucks which would actually be moving through the watershed zone were to crash on a bridge or something like that, it would endanger and potentially pollute the Quabbin Reservoir, which is the main source of fresh water for this entire region for the millions of people who live here.

4723
05:58:24,210 --> 05:58:32,273
[SPEAKER_46]: I did see Fred Lasky, who is the MWRA executive director at CVS the other day, but I was too far away to catch him.

4724
05:58:32,293 --> 05:58:33,433
[SPEAKER_46]: He is a Medford resident.

4725
05:58:35,434 --> 05:58:50,360
[SPEAKER_46]: In any case, really, there's a number, basically all the MWRA towns, the MWRA itself, and a lot of people at Hardwick are organizing against this landfill because we don't want it to be built and we don't want any danger to come to the wonderful, amazing,

4726
05:58:51,820 --> 05:58:56,442
[SPEAKER_46]: infrastructure that we have built here to make sure that everyone has fresh water in their homes.

4727
05:58:56,522 --> 05:59:06,607
[SPEAKER_46]: So I would ask my colleagues to move approval, ask my colleagues to support it, and we can get this out to Fred and to our state delegation to make sure this doesn't happen.

4728
05:59:07,607 --> 05:59:08,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

4729
05:59:08,948 --> 05:59:10,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comment by members of Council?

4730
05:59:13,410 --> 05:59:16,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Any members of the public who would like to speak?

4731
05:59:21,138 --> 05:59:27,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing none, on the motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

4732
05:59:27,642 --> 05:59:28,323
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

4733
05:59:28,343 --> 05:59:29,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

4734
05:59:29,383 --> 05:59:29,924
[SPEAKER_18]: All opposed?

4735
05:59:30,684 --> 05:59:31,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

4736
05:59:33,806 --> 05:59:39,110
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion to suspend the reading in favor of a summary by the proponent.

4737
05:59:39,130 --> 05:59:39,410
[SPEAKER_46]: 2-4-0-6-5.

4738
05:59:39,930 --> 05:59:45,094
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of President Behrs to suspend the reading of 2-4-0-6-5 in favor of summary.

4739
05:59:45,134 --> 05:59:45,894
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

4740
05:59:45,914 --> 05:59:47,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

4741
05:59:47,235 --> 05:59:48,076
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

4742
05:59:48,786 --> 05:59:52,148
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the resolution to support the CHERISH Act and our public colleges.

4743
05:59:52,228 --> 05:59:52,728
[SPEAKER_18]: President Behrs.

4744
05:59:52,908 --> 05:59:54,449
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam President.

4745
05:59:54,789 --> 05:59:58,912
[SPEAKER_46]: As folks know, this is an issue of passion area for me when I first ran for the City Council.

4746
05:59:58,932 --> 06:00:12,880
[SPEAKER_46]: I also ran an organization called PHENOM, the Public Higher Education Network of Massachusetts, and I am lucky enough to have worked with Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page and many others to come up with a seven word acronym for the CHERISH Act.

4747
06:00:13,480 --> 06:00:16,383
[SPEAKER_46]: one more word than the six word acronym for phenom.

4748
06:00:17,283 --> 06:00:19,705
[SPEAKER_46]: So you know how we can be in higher education.

4749
06:00:20,206 --> 06:00:25,230
[SPEAKER_46]: But this is an act that has been now on the books for about six years.

4750
06:00:26,110 --> 06:00:29,753
[SPEAKER_46]: It has over 100 co-sponsors in the legislature.

4751
06:00:30,234 --> 06:00:36,259
[SPEAKER_46]: And to me, when you have over 100 co-sponsors, that's a 50% majority, and that should be enough to pass a law, I would think.

4752
06:00:36,579 --> 06:00:39,661
[SPEAKER_46]: But sadly, that's not how things work these days in the Massachusetts legislature.

4753
06:00:40,382 --> 06:00:41,583
[SPEAKER_46]: And therefore, even though

4754
06:00:42,243 --> 06:00:48,126
[SPEAKER_46]: Representative Garber is the lead sponsor, Senator Jalen, Representative Barber, and Representative Dodato are all co-sponsors.

4755
06:00:48,726 --> 06:00:51,927
[SPEAKER_46]: We still need to ask them to push their leadership.

4756
06:00:52,107 --> 06:01:01,331
[SPEAKER_46]: This was extended to be passed, but it would use revenue from the fair share amendment to address 30 years of underfunding at our public colleges, which has caused a student debt crisis.

4757
06:01:02,011 --> 06:01:03,753
[SPEAKER_46]: You've got someone at Bridgewater right now.

4758
06:01:03,853 --> 06:01:08,677
[SPEAKER_46]: So you're, you're living it, you know, used to be a little bit more affordable to go to a state school.

4759
06:01:09,297 --> 06:01:11,479
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, I'm paying off my UMass loans.

4760
06:01:12,120 --> 06:01:13,801
[SPEAKER_46]: We won't talk about where Justin went to college.

4761
06:01:14,341 --> 06:01:25,331
[SPEAKER_46]: And, uh, um, I don't know how much it costs, but I think, you know, if you go into any other field, you probably make it up on the backend, except this one.

4762
06:01:26,272 --> 06:01:26,372
[SPEAKER_46]: Um,

4763
06:01:30,726 --> 06:01:47,616
[SPEAKER_46]: So I would ask my colleagues to support this resolution and move it forward as we send it up and hope that the legislature considers this reinvestment in our public college and university system, which is really the economic engine for our teachers and so many others.

4764
06:02:05,575 --> 06:02:07,081
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, Julie Roberto, 89 Central Ave.

4765
06:02:09,324 --> 06:02:14,587
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, I, this is my, my first meeting, so boy, I'm learning that they really go on.

4766
06:02:14,607 --> 06:02:31,736
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, I wanted to just join today and really, you know, encourage everyone to pass this resolution to support the church act, um, and our public colleges and just higher ed for all, um, just this vision for high quality debt-free, uh, public higher ed is really important to me.

4767
06:02:32,016 --> 06:02:35,578
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, I am an adjunct faculty at, uh, Bunker Hill community college.

4768
06:02:36,458 --> 06:02:50,983
[SPEAKER_34]: So I know firsthand that more money being budgeted to this high quality public higher ed will be a benefit to my students who are affected by the rising cost of tuition and fees, living expenses, even just the cost to get to class on the T sometimes.

4769
06:02:51,403 --> 06:02:54,084
[SPEAKER_34]: It can really benefit from this resolution.

4770
06:02:55,084 --> 06:02:56,585
[SPEAKER_34]: I know that they'd also benefit from

4771
06:02:58,058 --> 06:03:00,720
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, having our classrooms have more resource to support them.

4772
06:03:00,800 --> 06:03:01,821
[SPEAKER_34]: They're learning differences.

4773
06:03:01,881 --> 06:03:06,965
[SPEAKER_34]: We have such a diverse population at our public higher ed institutions.

4774
06:03:07,446 --> 06:03:10,368
[SPEAKER_34]: And so being able to accommodate all of our students is super important.

4775
06:03:12,509 --> 06:03:14,389
[SPEAKER_34]: It will also boost our local economy.

4776
06:03:14,469 --> 06:03:23,451
[SPEAKER_34]: We know that graduates from our public colleges who are employed stay in Massachusetts to create their futures in Massachusetts.

4777
06:03:23,511 --> 06:03:29,372
[SPEAKER_34]: And I just think it's really important that we ensure that they are able to build solid foundations for their futures here.

4778
06:03:29,392 --> 06:03:31,653
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, thank you.

4779
06:03:33,653 --> 06:03:35,594
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you so much for sticking with us, Julia.

4780
06:03:38,714 --> 06:03:42,135
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

4781
06:03:42,839 --> 06:03:43,539
[SPEAKER_18]: All in favor?

4782
06:03:44,359 --> 06:03:44,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

4783
06:03:44,959 --> 06:03:45,460
[SPEAKER_18]: All opposed?

4784
06:03:46,480 --> 06:03:47,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

4785
06:04:02,263 --> 06:04:03,343
[SPEAKER_46]: These are both going to committee, right?

4786
06:04:03,824 --> 06:04:03,964
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

4787
06:04:04,244 --> 06:04:05,004
[SPEAKER_46]: All right, let's do it.

4788
06:04:07,024 --> 06:04:10,325
[SPEAKER_46]: 24069, resolution to discuss a modernization of the Human Rights Enabling Ordinance.

4789
06:04:13,403 --> 06:04:21,079
[SPEAKER_46]: be resolved that the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement need to discuss a modernization of the Human Rights Commission Enabling Ordinance and invite current and former Commissioners to provide input.

4790
06:04:21,099 --> 06:04:21,760
[SPEAKER_46]: Councillor Sang.

4791
06:04:21,880 --> 06:04:22,181
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

4792
06:04:23,683 --> 06:04:28,967
[SPEAKER_29]: Commissioners have reached out to me, they find that the language currently inhibits basic functions.

4793
06:04:29,047 --> 06:04:33,911
[SPEAKER_29]: They want us to open up input process to get feedback to modernize the ordinance.

4794
06:04:34,371 --> 06:04:37,513
[SPEAKER_46]: On the motion of councilor saying to refer to the committee on resident services and public engagement.

4795
06:04:37,533 --> 06:04:39,395
[SPEAKER_46]: Seconded by council vice president Collins.

4796
06:04:39,415 --> 06:04:40,055
[SPEAKER_46]: All those in favor?

4797
06:04:40,075 --> 06:04:40,275
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

4798
06:04:40,756 --> 06:04:41,196
[SPEAKER_46]: Opposed?

4799
06:04:41,256 --> 06:04:42,037
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion passes.

4800
06:04:43,476 --> 06:04:51,137
[SPEAKER_46]: We've withdrawn to 4072 or do we want to postpone or withdraw withdrawn to 4073 resolution and provide established city council listening sessions.

4801
06:04:51,838 --> 06:05:10,881
[SPEAKER_46]: Whereas many studies have shown local governments primarily here from a small portion of residents additional corporate interests and those residents who do reach out to be more affluent be resolved at the committee on resident services and public engagement reach out to city staff residents and community groups to develop a bonus series of listening sessions for counselors listen to residents to extend the council outreach to residents, particularly a various underrepresented or underserved neighborhoods and backgrounds.

4802
06:05:11,562 --> 06:05:16,172
[SPEAKER_46]: And the short summary is we're sending this to the resident services and public engagement to establish a series of listening sessions.

4803
06:05:20,964 --> 06:05:21,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

4804
06:05:21,944 --> 06:05:23,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, I think it says it all.

4805
06:05:24,005 --> 06:05:26,606
[SPEAKER_15]: We are really just sending this into committee to discuss.

4806
06:05:27,186 --> 06:05:33,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully it will be a way for us to reach out to people who rarely or never come to these meetings.

4807
06:05:34,329 --> 06:05:35,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Those 70% of people.

4808
06:05:36,150 --> 06:05:41,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the 50% of people who never vote in city elections, 70% who didn't vote in this particular city election.

4809
06:05:41,332 --> 06:05:43,453
[SPEAKER_15]: 70% who didn't vote for me.

4810
06:05:46,694 --> 06:05:53,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Those folks who are not engaged politically, we want to be able to hear what their lives are like, and that's what this is about.

4811
06:05:54,329 --> 06:05:54,969
[SPEAKER_29]: very quickly.

4812
06:05:55,129 --> 06:05:56,450
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor saying then Councilor Zara.

4813
06:05:56,630 --> 06:05:59,992
[SPEAKER_29]: This is something that a number of us have already started to reach out to people about.

4814
06:06:01,472 --> 06:06:03,814
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Zara and I have reached out to the senior center about this.

4815
06:06:03,874 --> 06:06:04,814
[SPEAKER_29]: They're very keen on it.

4816
06:06:05,094 --> 06:06:08,396
[SPEAKER_29]: I've talked to community liaisons about this, and they're very keen on it as well.

4817
06:06:09,156 --> 06:06:10,016
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of outreach.

4818
06:06:10,157 --> 06:06:23,583
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we see from our meetings that, you know, we need to introduce ourselves to residents, explain how things go, but we also need to listen, and we need to take criticism, and this is a way to restructure public feedback.

4819
06:06:24,321 --> 06:06:25,762
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

4820
06:06:26,543 --> 06:06:34,448
[SPEAKER_14]: In my dreams, this is something that we would have ongoing as an ongoing thing into the future.

4821
06:06:34,708 --> 06:06:48,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is just a starting point, as we've talked about, just generating ideas and things we can discuss going forward, but meeting people where they are and hoping to get feedback before

4822
06:06:50,484 --> 06:06:51,024
[SPEAKER_14]: to make sure that.

4823
06:06:51,044 --> 06:06:58,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Items go to regular meetings so that we're not playing catch up, and we're generating some trust and connection with the community.

4824
06:06:59,289 --> 06:07:07,634
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Council is R O. On the motion to refer to the resident services of public engagement committee by Councilor saying seconded by Councilor Callahan.

4833
06:07:39,457 --> 06:07:57,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm shocked and highly disappointed that during a discussion on an evening where the council proclaimed how well they listened to residents, I was denied access to participate in the discussion prior to the vote on, of all things, public participation.

4834
06:07:58,545 --> 06:07:59,065

4844
06:08:24,427 --> 06:08:25,367
