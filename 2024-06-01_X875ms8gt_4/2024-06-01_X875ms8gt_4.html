    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=56.586s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=57.046s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=58.126s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=59.167s">This</a>  is <a href="../resolutions/24-062.pdf"><font color="green">24-062</font></a> be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=61.708s">by</a>  the Medford City Council that we honor and commemorate the dedicated service of former Medford Mayor and State Representative John J. Jack McGlynn and the United States Army and the 3132 Signal Service Company, part of the World War II Ghost Army, upon posthumous receipt of the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=76.615s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in honor of all of those who served in the Ghost Army to defend democracy, the people of the United States, and all humankind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=85.459s">And</a>  we have <a href="../resolutions/24-070.pdf"><font color="green">24-070</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=88.066s">by</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and thank former Mayor Jack McGlynn for his service to our great country, and finally being recognized for his heroism in being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service as a member of the Secret Ghost Army during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=102.329s">I'll</a>  be brief and I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, but my favorite anecdote in the news stories that have come out about this was <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=111.511s">former</a>  Mayor Mike McGlynn talking about how he got a phone call when he was mayor from a news source in the 90s, and it was about, they were saying, oh, well, we've learned about the Ghost Army, we learned your father, former Mayor Jack McGlynn, was in the Ghost Army, and he called his dad, and his dad's response was, who told you that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=130.523s">I</a>  need to track that down, because it was that much of a secret, and even 50 years later, he wanted to know how that information had gotten out there, and I think that just shows the dedication and service that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=140.444s">he</a>  gave to the city and the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=142.446s">And</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=144.367s">Thank</a>  you, President Beasley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=146.389s">Again,</a>  a great man, a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=149.772s">And</a>  these are the things when you know someone's a true hero, when you realize when no one's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=158.359s">And</a>  Jack McGlynn did this for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=164.385s">He</a>  tried to stay under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=166.867s">And</a>  it's about time that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=168.803s">He</a>  could be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=170.184s">Unfortunately,</a>  he wasn't here, but his family was. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=173.245s">I</a>  know that his children went out to Washington to receive the honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=180.189s">And</a>  I think that we as a city should really praise and honor people like Jack McGlynn, not for just the service here in the city, in the state, but for also what he did when nobody was watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=196.357s">And</a>  that's a true sign of a true hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=198.45s">So</a>  this is where, hopefully, there are history books written where Medford students can learn about how important Jack McGlynn was to our community and to our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=213.433s">So</a>  I think that I'd like to dedicate this meeting to Mr. Jack McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=218.574s">And</a>  hopefully, I would recommend that this city finds it within themselves to erect a statue in my eyes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=228.76s">for</a>  that person who did so much for this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=231.882s">So</a>  he's what Medford's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=235.163s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=236.164s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=237.164s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=239.085s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=240.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=241.126s">I</a>  grew up in Medford where Mr. McGlynn was mayor and his father was around and a very active member of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=250.291s">And</a>  it was always a joy to talk to them and hang with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=254.48s">and</a>  hear their stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=255.902s">And</a>  I think, I can't say more, that would be more eloquent than what my fellow councillors said, but they're, you know, I'm glad that we're recognizing Jack McGlynn's service to our city and to our country.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=270.731s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=271.411s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=272.792s">And</a>  if you don't know about the Ghost Army, I really recommend taking a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=275.713s">There's</a>  been some really great articles, NPR, a few other ones that are free, no paywall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=280.214s">There's</a>  about 2,000 people who, with signals intelligence and inflatable tanks, tricked the Nazis into thinking they were 50,000 people and saved a lot of lives while doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=291.438s">Any</a>  public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=292.619s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=294.779s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=297.173s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=301.527s">Sorry</a>  I'm late, talking about Mr. McGlynn, Sr.? ? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=305.024s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=306.165s">I</a>  wanted to say the man was, he's a great man and a great neighbor across the street from me on Cushman Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=311.709s">And</a>  when I first moved there, I knocked on the door in 1980, introduced myself, because my sister worked for the Attorney General, Francis X. Bilotti, and I know he knew of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=323.177s">So</a>  he started speaking in Italian, I mean, fluent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=328.959s">I</a>  said, I thought you were an Irishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=331.06s">He</a>  says, I grew up speaking Italian just like I did in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=334.941s">And</a>  I didn't understand half of what he said, because he spoke Southern Italian, but he was very fluent in his Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=341.984s">And</a>  he spoke Latin also, and he told me that whenever his grandkids got an A in Latin, he would give them a hundred dollar bill back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=350.046s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=353.588s">He's</a>  one of the last of the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=357.995s">obviously,</a>  and he is a consummate gentleman and a consummate politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=362.897s">I</a>  miss him a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=364.977s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=366.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=368.118s">On</a>  the motion by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.24s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.701s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-063.pdf"><font color="green">24-063</font></a>, offered by Vice President Collins and Councilor Tseng, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the holy month of Ramadan

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=390.116s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=391.297s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Tseng for co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=394.158s">Just</a>  wanted to take a quick moment during this special time of the year for many people in Medford to acknowledge our Muslim community and wish all celebrants a happy Ramadan during this special time for their faiths. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=406.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=716.168s">Thank</a>  you, Council President, and I thank Raising Canes and their representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=725.623s">I</a>  think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=726.003s">We're</a>  going through the due diligence of making sure that our neighborhood is, um, is involved in all of the signage concerns, and I think that we had a subcommittee that that broke it down, and I think that we made some concessions and. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=746.759s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=755.711s">We're</a>  pretty happy with decisions we made and removing a few signs and then keeping signs that are vital to their operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=764.218s">And</a>  I think the biggest ones were the signs that had the menus on it that were hidden by bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=774.327s">So</a>  that was a big piece that would question, but the landscaping that's set up <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=780.444s">it's</a>  really going to assist with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=783.385s">And</a>  I think all the lighting that you'll see on the building is really reflecting on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=788.707s">It's</a>  really nothing that's illuminating the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=791.288s">So</a>  I think we can listen to the petitioner and then we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=796.09s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=798.231s">Kathy,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=799.812s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=801.584s">Councilor</a>  be at present Councilor Bears and board members, Kathleen a Desmond of five of 580 Main Street units for reading is where my office is located. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=811.973s">I'm</a>  here today with Sarah homes, senior property development manager for raising canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=817.384s">Um,</a>  as Miss as council member Scarpelli indicated, we did make some concessions with respect to the signage that we were originally requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=826.911s">We</a>  withdrew the painted arrow sign, which is marked exhibit C of your materials that were provided with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=835.737s">The</a>  one love canopy sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=837.594s">marked</a>  as Exhibit E has been withdrawn and the monument sign marked as Exhibit B. What remains in terms of signage are the two additional wall signs that aid with vehicular queuing as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=854.193s">The</a>  site is very large, it's over 670,000 square feet, the Felsway Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=859.778s">The</a>  two additional signs will provide direction to customers which are within the parking area, coming from where the Dunkin Donuts is, and around that area where the Stop and Shop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=869.608s">So</a>  that's why those two additional signs were requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=873.411s">They</a>  are small in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=874.512s">The</a>  permitted size for a primary wall sign is 100 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=878.697s">The</a>  four combined is only 120 square feet so the signage is not out of character with the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=885.846s">In</a>  addition to the wall signs, there are two to mural signs, a one love heart design that's not lighted, it's, it's lighted by virtue of the lighting on the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=897.561s">It</a>  helps provide some design to the building so you're not just looking at a brick square building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=902.342s">That</a>  is also the case with the proposed digital sign, which is the dog sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=907.403s">Again,</a>  that's not a lighted sign, but it's naturally lighted by what's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=911.424s">And</a>  then the menu and the pre-sale boards, which as Councilman Scarpelli indicated, is screened from the landscaping and is also integral to the business of a takeout restaurant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=923.047s">Thank</a>  you, Cathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=924.507s">Any</a>  questions or comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=928.106s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to reopen the public hearing to anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise has a comment on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=937.653s">The</a>  public hearing is reopened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=939.994s">Would</a>  you like to speak in favor?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.436s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.936s">Again,</a>  in terms of what we're looking for, I can let the petitioner speak in favor of Sarah Holmes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.522s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.682s">My</a>  name is Sarah Holmes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=953.323s">I'm</a>  with HT Group on behalf of Raising Canes as their senior <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=957.858s">property</a>  development manager, and just speaking in favor of raising canes, these signs are crucial to the operations, and I really believe that they lend to allowing safe vehicular access from the shopping center, as well as with the many boards providing a crucial function for having a drive-through business.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=987.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=988.594s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public on the special permit for additional on-premises signage for raising canes, you can come to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=997.281s">Let</a>  me give it just another minute here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1016.71s">name</a>  and address for the record please.</p>

    <p>[Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1018.371s">Good</a>  evening President Bears and members of the council, Sharon DSL Mass Avenue circuit road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1024.516s">I</a>  think it's wonderful to have some larger size commerce, coming to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1030.481s">It's</a>  sad in a way that stop and shop is has, you know, started the anchor, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1039.449s">I</a>  like the whole idea what I don't like that entrance, I did not know about any public hearings in the beginning of this placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1047.757s">And</a>  I've looked into the, the, the company very fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1051.661s">I</a>  was wondering if it's there's any way on that side street that comes behind ocean job lot in the freight tools company. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1061.852s">the</a>  Raising Cane Company would be willing to put a smaller sign on that street next to Dunkin' Donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1070.359s">That</a>  entrance, as you know, goes to Eastern Bank, it goes to Panera's, it goes to Smashburger's, and it goes to that small, I'm sorry, Chinese spot on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1086.172s">And</a>  now Raising Cane's. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1088.274s">I</a>  have to wait five and 10 minutes to get in and out of there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1092.296s">So</a>  I'm wondering if they might want to also promote more people going in if they get a little bit discouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1100.459s">If</a>  on that street right by Dunkin Donuts, I forget the name of that street, that there could also be additional small signage entrance to Raising Cane's here also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1110.903s">I</a>  don't know how that works with zoning or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1115.565s">is</a>  a suggestion because I think especially in the beginning with the fine product like that, especially with families and inflation on higher restaurants right now, it's going to be busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1124.867s">I</a>  wish them success. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1126.688s">I'm</a>  just wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1127.848s">I</a>  think it's a really good idea.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1129.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1130.109s">Yes,</a>  this is just about the signs and we did the special permit on other items already, but I do believe Raising Cane's is making improvements at the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1138.051s">Kathy,</a>  if you want to speak on it.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1141.411s">I</a>  can address that briefly as part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1145.143s">that</a>  we put some kind of signage so that when you get to the end of Riverside have where the light is that they don't block the box, and that's going to be somehow tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1155.592s">To</a>  a light right before the block the box so that cars and coming going down Riverside have to the fouls way will be aware that they can't block the box and that there's going to be a change in light. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1166.942s">In</a>  addition to that, I believe we also discussed the. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1172.349s">putting</a>  some kind of signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1174.351s">I</a>  don't recall who is specifically responsible for it, but that other entrance was addressed as something that should be made known to Raisin Cane customers that they can also exit out of that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1187.982s">So</a>  those were discussed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1188.683s">I</a>  believe there were new paint marks as well were?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1190.805s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1192.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1194.107s">Any</a>  further comment on the special permit for signage for Raisin Canes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1201.013s">Seeing</a>  none in the chamber and none on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1205.402s">Are</a>  there any motions?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1210.592s">I</a>  would, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1213.172s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1214.712s">I'll</a>  defer to that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1215.373s">Well,</a>  I'm just gonna move forward.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1217.413s">I'll</a>  second your motion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1218.333s">Okay,</a>  so I think that with the concessions for the neighbors and for the business that's moving in, I think that we've been pretty thorough with our meetings and informing the neighbors, so I would move forward with the changes as instructed and approve.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1472.204s">Whereas</a>  the city of Medford has climate sustainability, affordable housing and other goals that would be easier to accomplish if we could reach either renters or landlords or both in our city, and whereas a lack of a registry of rental properties means that we currently miss opportunities to reach either our renters or our landlords or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1489.257s">Be</a>  it so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1494.059s">with</a>  energy efficiency standards as described in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, Section 2.2.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1501.583s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this ordinance be referred to committee for further discussion in the Planning and Permitting Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1507.606s">Be</a>  it further resolved that members of the Planning and Permitting Committee submit questions to the chair, clerk, and city staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1516.499s">and</a>  be it further resolved that the council work with the building department and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on the drafting of this ordinance to ensure that it best serves the city of Medford and our climate and affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1529.104s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1530.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1532.02s">So</a>  one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1545.311s">I</a>  know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1556.319s">And</a>  tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1564.306s">There</a>  are also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1566.667s">you</a>  know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1578.234s">That</a>  would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1587.719s">And</a>  there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1591.541s">I</a>  know in the climate adaptation and action plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1595.844s">it</a>  has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1597.645s">There</a>  are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1611.216s">I</a>  know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1622.765s">know,</a>  junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1641.162s">being</a>  able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1647.206s">And</a>  really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1664.037s">So</a>  that's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1665.638s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1667.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.511s">I</a>  would really like to thank Councilor Callahan for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1674.074s">I</a>  think this is an idea that most residents assume we already do as a city, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1679.639s">And</a>  it is something that, you know, it's information that the city should really have in order to communicate its message better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1686.084s">And</a>  I think that kind of touches at two of the arcs that we're trying to work on this term in the city of Medford with the city government communication modernization. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1697.644s">we're</a>  ambitious as a city council and as a city when it comes to our climate goals, housing goals, but also the very basis of just having our existing laws be carried out and enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1709.991s">And</a>  this registry would allow us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1712.693s">It</a>  would allow us to be more responsive to a lot of constituent concerns and a lot of resident concerns like what you mentioned about absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1720.757s">and</a>  it would help us restructure some of the ideas that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1725.939s">For</a>  example, with the good landlord tax credit, which I know a lot of people are really excited about, this idea allows us to reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1735.041s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1741.197s">This</a>  sounds really interesting I'm curious about if this is common practice and other cities in the area I'm not I'm not familiar with this as a concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1749.64s">I</a>  would be curious to hear if other cities practices commonly and another thought I have and I don't think this necessarily is a deal breaker but if it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1759.005s">I</a>  don't know what that would mean for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1760.006s">Prohibitive</a>  administratively for City Hall staff and what that would mean for requirements for maybe additional hiring or restructuring, or if that's just something to discuss in committee because I know the resolution says, you know, talk about it and planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1775.215s">Obviously</a>  that would be the time to talk to City Hall staff, but that those are just things that come up and also things being</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1789.77s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1791.271s">I</a>  would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1802.477s">For</a>  example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1813.064s">They</a>  just don't have access to who those people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1815.995s">So</a>  I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1828.24s">We're</a>  gonna go to President Bears, Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1831.721s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1833.222s">Yeah,</a>  having spoken with not just the planning department, but also code enforcement, building inspectors, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1841.365s">And</a>  also, this is a policy that's in effect in Boston, Worcester, other communities around the city, around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1847.952s">There's</a>  a huge issue with being able to identify what's an owner-occupied home, what is a rental unit, what's an illegal rental unit, and this would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1857.521s">I</a>  think I was listening to Councilor Tseng talk a bit about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1863.643s">Building</a>  code, health and safety, you know, there's a lot of difficulty with reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1871.49s">We</a>  send it out in the tax bill, absentee landlord, absentee property owner, maybe they never open the envelope and maybe they never see it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1879.318s">So</a>  there's a number of things when it comes to quality of life here in a community where this would be a huge benefit for the city to be able to identify this and I think the good and important thing to recognize is that most of the people who are renting property owners or renting properties in the city are <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1895.52s">the</a>  right thing, following the rules, you know, and this is a way for the city to provide access to the different programs and benefits available and be in contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1905.303s">And</a>  then for the folks who are problem properties, and we know of them, and we know many of them are in the hillside neighborhood and over-renting to tough students, and we have overgrowth, and we've had petitions coming in here before, this is a way for the city to actually keep track of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1918.587s">And</a>  that's been a huge note from code enforcement and building, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1924.013s">It's</a>  just hard to say, here's the file on this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1926.535s">And</a>  this property may be violating snow and ice removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1928.776s">They</a>  may have overgrowth under the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1930.277s">They</a>  may have trash on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1931.798s">They</a>  may have noise nuisance complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1933.72s">They</a>  may have a whole plethora list of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1936.201s">But</a>  because there's no registry, there's nothing to attach any of that to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1940.104s">And</a>  they get away with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1941.745s">So</a>  this really is a way for us to have that list, know what's going on in the city, and make sure that while most folks are doing the right thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1952.753s">address</a>  the issues with those who are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1954.556s">And</a>  I think that's something that all of us can acknowledge is an issue that we all experience here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1960.147s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1961.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1963.012s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1964.48s">just</a>  a question for Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1967.902s">So</a>  it says here the building department, the office and the PBS. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1971.745s">Do</a>  you have a good idea of where this project once it is implemented would primarily be maintained? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1978.57s">Would</a>  it be the building department or PBS? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1980.531s">And</a>  what's do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1982.053s">Can</a>  you just, like, give us an idea of the amount of staff time that it would take to get this off the ground and maintain a longer term? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1987.897s">If</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1992.844s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, if you have a direct response.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1994.664s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1995.705s">I</a>  mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2001.626s">So</a>  the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2011.768s">So</a>  really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2015.309s">But</a>  as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2018.888s">who</a>  will implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2020.19s">I</a>  think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.995s">I</a>  can also speak to some of Councilor Lazzaro and Councilor Leming's questions, because I happened to hold a meeting on this a few weeks ago with some city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2050.561s">It</a>  seems like most of the work would fall within the purview of the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2055.623s">Actually,</a>  the new building commissioner that we have here in Medford set up the rental registry system for their last municipality, and so they're very well-versed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2064.487s">how</a>  to create the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2067.391s">They've</a>  created an online system that really maintains itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2070.415s">And</a>  so it wouldn't, you know, the setup would take time for the staff to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2075.521s">But</a>  once the system is in place, they expect the system to be quite self-containing.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.183s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.963s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2085.184s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.084s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.284s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.344s">If</a>  I can't do the chair to Council Kalyan or any other councils that can what documents were we asking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2092.865s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.166s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.886s">This</a>  is an intrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2095.946s">Um</a>  process and what we're asking for for renters information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2100.287s">Landlords</a>  information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2102.008s">Can</a>  anybody share what we</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2111.423s">Again,</a>  this is the beginning of the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2114.086s">Excuse</a>  me, we're not going to interrupt people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2122.575s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, please go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2127.515s">So</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2135.158s">Yes,</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2146.181s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2149.238s">My</a>  understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2162.961s">There</a>  will be a chance for everybody to participate on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2171.122s">Please</a>  do not interrupt speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2172.643s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, are you finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2175.594s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2176.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2177.196s">And</a>  I think that's what the big concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2179.72s">I</a>  think that we're doing something that sounds like it doesn't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2185.148s">We've</a>  been we've been <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2190.538s">Based</a>  on interrupt speakers, I'm gonna ask the room to be silent, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2195.799s">I'm</a>  hearing dialogue back and forth from fellow councils that we're here to do people's business and we should do some things later on that we'll talk about that we need to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2206.581s">We</a>  keep doing business and keep throwing more work onto people that we already know don't have the capability to do what you're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2214.703s">You're</a>  asking for something that's already done <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2216.983s">through</a>  the city in every way possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2221.646s">If</a>  the biggest thing is just to get the information out to people, there's other ways to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2226.889s">But</a>  to be intrusive and then really take all these unnecessary documents, it makes people very uneasy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2235.133s">And</a>  I'll be honest with you, for a council that's very, very astute in understanding about people that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2241.96s">I</a>  probably most difficult people that are going through a very difficult time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2245.661s">I</a>  was getting phone calls from landlords saying, George, what do we do hypothetically? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2250.703s">Hypothetically?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.024s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.584s">Because</a>  the conversation scares our residents, that our landlords allow to give them a place to live, but are afraid to give documentation, because maybe they're undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2266.948s">And</a>  they're petrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2268.854s">This</a>  is a fear that you should wait when we get to this point, but also understand we're trying to do something over and over again with different issues on this council lately that's redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2280.723s">And</a>  it's putting more work to departments that need to do their work, not to do this additional stuff that we want to get people to know that there is some sort of rebate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2292.964s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2294.487s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2299.899s">But</a>  to keep bringing resolutions through. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2304.286s">I</a>  think it's hurting this community and it's driving more wedges through this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2312.729s">So</a>  I would request that we deny this process and not put more work on more departments that don't need it right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2323.673s">I</a>  would just note that the departments themselves have requested it and it's part of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2330.959s">It</a>  is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2331.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2333.32s">I'm</a>  not going to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2335.641s">Seriously,</a>  my role is to just state facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2340.242s">Okay,</a>  please stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.103s">Please</a>  stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.983s">You</a>  have to be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2346.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2348.065s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2352.166s">Seeing</a>  none, name and address for the record, please, for public participation.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2356.027s">Robert</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2357.348s">Mary</a>  Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2360.126s">Again,</a>  I really don't know where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2363.449s">The</a>  people that own the houses pay their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2367.752s">We</a>  know how to contact them when we're looking for their money, correct?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2372.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2373.277s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2375.178s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2377.76s">So</a>  you have a mechanism to contact every homeowner in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2382.844s">It's</a>  a current system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2384.065s">Who</a>  is going to be processing and administering all this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2388.84s">rental</a>  registry, we're going to have a rental registry department here, because we barely have enough staff to provide the basic city services that we have right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2398.444s">Thank</a>  you, as was as was noted, and please do not if you're going to shout, I'm going to ask you to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2403.886s">Thank</a>  you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2405.106s">I</a>  just want to if you I can answer your question, which is that the people who are responsible for enforcing the building code have said that this would make their jobs easier.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2412.073s">Can</a>  you name them?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2413.194s">Yes,</a>  the people who work in the building department, the building commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.515s">Are</a>  they here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.835s">It</a>  was just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2417.136s">Well,</a>  we're not, we haven't had them, we're just referring to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2419.457s">So</a>  we're going to have the discussion as members of the public have noted, we're going to have a long discussion just on this topic so that everyone can have their points concerned, so that points like Councilor Scarpelli's can be raised and so that we can craft an ordinance that works for the community.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.925s">It</a>  would be nice if the people that you talked to would be here to verify that you had talked to them.</p>
