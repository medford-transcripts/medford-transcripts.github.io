    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=56.586s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=57.046s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=58.126s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=59.167s">This</a>  is <a href="../resolutions/24-062.pdf"><font color="green">24-062</font></a> be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=61.708s">by</a>  the Medford City Council that we honor and commemorate the dedicated service of former Medford Mayor and State Representative John J. Jack McGlynn and the United States Army and the 3132 Signal Service Company, part of the World War II Ghost Army, upon posthumous receipt of the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=76.615s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in honor of all of those who served in the Ghost Army to defend democracy, the people of the United States, and all humankind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=85.459s">And</a>  we have <a href="../resolutions/24-070.pdf"><font color="green">24-070</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=88.066s">by</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and thank former Mayor Jack McGlynn for his service to our great country, and finally being recognized for his heroism in being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service as a member of the Secret Ghost Army during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=102.329s">I'll</a>  be brief and I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, but my favorite anecdote in the news stories that have come out about this was <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=111.511s">former</a>  Mayor Mike McGlynn talking about how he got a phone call when he was mayor from a news source in the 90s, and it was about, they were saying, oh, well, we've learned about the Ghost Army, we learned your father, former Mayor Jack McGlynn, was in the Ghost Army, and he called his dad, and his dad's response was, who told you that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=130.523s">I</a>  need to track that down, because it was that much of a secret, and even 50 years later, he wanted to know how that information had gotten out there, and I think that just shows the dedication and service that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=140.444s">he</a>  gave to the city and the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=142.446s">And</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=144.367s">Thank</a>  you, President Beasley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=146.389s">Again,</a>  a great man, a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=149.772s">And</a>  these are the things when you know someone's a true hero, when you realize when no one's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=158.359s">And</a>  Jack McGlynn did this for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=164.385s">He</a>  tried to stay under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=166.867s">And</a>  it's about time that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=168.803s">He</a>  could be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=170.184s">Unfortunately,</a>  he wasn't here, but his family was. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=173.245s">I</a>  know that his children went out to Washington to receive the honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=180.189s">And</a>  I think that we as a city should really praise and honor people like Jack McGlynn, not for just the service here in the city, in the state, but for also what he did when nobody was watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=196.357s">And</a>  that's a true sign of a true hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=198.45s">So</a>  this is where, hopefully, there are history books written where Medford students can learn about how important Jack McGlynn was to our community and to our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=213.433s">So</a>  I think that I'd like to dedicate this meeting to Mr. Jack McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=218.574s">And</a>  hopefully, I would recommend that this city finds it within themselves to erect a statue in my eyes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=228.76s">for</a>  that person who did so much for this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=231.882s">So</a>  he's what Medford's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=235.163s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=236.164s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=237.164s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=239.085s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=240.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=241.126s">I</a>  grew up in Medford where Mr. McGlynn was mayor and his father was around and a very active member of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=250.291s">And</a>  it was always a joy to talk to them and hang with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=254.48s">and</a>  hear their stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=255.902s">And</a>  I think, I can't say more, that would be more eloquent than what my fellow councillors said, but they're, you know, I'm glad that we're recognizing Jack McGlynn's service to our city and to our country.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=270.731s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=271.411s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=272.792s">And</a>  if you don't know about the Ghost Army, I really recommend taking a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=275.713s">There's</a>  been some really great articles, NPR, a few other ones that are free, no paywall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=280.214s">There's</a>  about 2,000 people who, with signals intelligence and inflatable tanks, tricked the Nazis into thinking they were 50,000 people and saved a lot of lives while doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=291.438s">Any</a>  public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=292.619s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=294.779s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=297.173s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=301.527s">Sorry</a>  I'm late, talking about Mr. McGlynn, Sr.? ? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=305.024s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=306.165s">I</a>  wanted to say the man was, he's a great man and a great neighbor across the street from me on Cushman Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=311.709s">And</a>  when I first moved there, I knocked on the door in 1980, introduced myself, because my sister worked for the Attorney General, Francis X. Bilotti, and I know he knew of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=323.177s">So</a>  he started speaking in Italian, I mean, fluent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=328.959s">I</a>  said, I thought you were an Irishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=331.06s">He</a>  says, I grew up speaking Italian just like I did in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=334.941s">And</a>  I didn't understand half of what he said, because he spoke Southern Italian, but he was very fluent in his Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=341.984s">And</a>  he spoke Latin also, and he told me that whenever his grandkids got an A in Latin, he would give them a hundred dollar bill back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=350.046s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=353.588s">He's</a>  one of the last of the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=357.995s">obviously,</a>  and he is a consummate gentleman and a consummate politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=362.897s">I</a>  miss him a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=364.977s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=366.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=368.118s">On</a>  the motion by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.24s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.701s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-063.pdf"><font color="green">24-063</font></a>, offered by Vice President Collins and Councilor Tseng, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the holy month of Ramadan

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=390.116s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=391.297s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Tseng for co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=394.158s">Just</a>  wanted to take a quick moment during this special time of the year for many people in Medford to acknowledge our Muslim community and wish all celebrants a happy Ramadan during this special time for their faiths. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=406.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=716.168s">Thank</a>  you, Council President, and I thank Raising Canes and their representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=725.623s">I</a>  think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=726.003s">We're</a>  going through the due diligence of making sure that our neighborhood is, um, is involved in all of the signage concerns, and I think that we had a subcommittee that that broke it down, and I think that we made some concessions and. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=746.759s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=755.711s">We're</a>  pretty happy with decisions we made and removing a few signs and then keeping signs that are vital to their operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=764.218s">And</a>  I think the biggest ones were the signs that had the menus on it that were hidden by bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=774.327s">So</a>  that was a big piece that would question, but the landscaping that's set up <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=780.444s">it's</a>  really going to assist with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=783.385s">And</a>  I think all the lighting that you'll see on the building is really reflecting on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=788.707s">It's</a>  really nothing that's illuminating the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=791.288s">So</a>  I think we can listen to the petitioner and then we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=796.09s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=798.231s">Kathy,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=799.812s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=801.584s">Councilor</a>  be at present Councilor Bears and board members, Kathleen a Desmond of five of 580 Main Street units for reading is where my office is located. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=811.973s">I'm</a>  here today with Sarah homes, senior property development manager for raising canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=817.384s">Um,</a>  as Miss as council member Scarpelli indicated, we did make some concessions with respect to the signage that we were originally requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=826.911s">We</a>  withdrew the painted arrow sign, which is marked exhibit C of your materials that were provided with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=835.737s">The</a>  one love canopy sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=837.594s">marked</a>  as Exhibit E has been withdrawn and the monument sign marked as Exhibit B. What remains in terms of signage are the two additional wall signs that aid with vehicular queuing as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=854.193s">The</a>  site is very large, it's over 670,000 square feet, the Felsway Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=859.778s">The</a>  two additional signs will provide direction to customers which are within the parking area, coming from where the Dunkin Donuts is, and around that area where the Stop and Shop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=869.608s">So</a>  that's why those two additional signs were requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=873.411s">They</a>  are small in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=874.512s">The</a>  permitted size for a primary wall sign is 100 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=878.697s">The</a>  four combined is only 120 square feet so the signage is not out of character with the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=885.846s">In</a>  addition to the wall signs, there are two to mural signs, a one love heart design that's not lighted, it's, it's lighted by virtue of the lighting on the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=897.561s">It</a>  helps provide some design to the building so you're not just looking at a brick square building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=902.342s">That</a>  is also the case with the proposed digital sign, which is the dog sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=907.403s">Again,</a>  that's not a lighted sign, but it's naturally lighted by what's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=911.424s">And</a>  then the menu and the pre-sale boards, which as Councilman Scarpelli indicated, is screened from the landscaping and is also integral to the business of a takeout restaurant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=923.047s">Thank</a>  you, Cathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=924.507s">Any</a>  questions or comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=928.106s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to reopen the public hearing to anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise has a comment on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=937.653s">The</a>  public hearing is reopened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=939.994s">Would</a>  you like to speak in favor?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.436s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.936s">Again,</a>  in terms of what we're looking for, I can let the petitioner speak in favor of Sarah Holmes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.522s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.682s">My</a>  name is Sarah Holmes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=953.323s">I'm</a>  with HT Group on behalf of Raising Canes as their senior <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=957.858s">property</a>  development manager, and just speaking in favor of raising canes, these signs are crucial to the operations, and I really believe that they lend to allowing safe vehicular access from the shopping center, as well as with the many boards providing a crucial function for having a drive-through business.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=987.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=988.594s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public on the special permit for additional on-premises signage for raising canes, you can come to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=997.281s">Let</a>  me give it just another minute here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1016.71s">name</a>  and address for the record please.</p>

    <p>[Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1018.371s">Good</a>  evening President Bears and members of the council, Sharon DSL Mass Avenue circuit road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1024.516s">I</a>  think it's wonderful to have some larger size commerce, coming to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1030.481s">It's</a>  sad in a way that stop and shop is has, you know, started the anchor, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1039.449s">I</a>  like the whole idea what I don't like that entrance, I did not know about any public hearings in the beginning of this placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1047.757s">And</a>  I've looked into the, the, the company very fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1051.661s">I</a>  was wondering if it's there's any way on that side street that comes behind ocean job lot in the freight tools company. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1061.852s">the</a>  Raising Cane Company would be willing to put a smaller sign on that street next to Dunkin' Donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1070.359s">That</a>  entrance, as you know, goes to Eastern Bank, it goes to Panera's, it goes to Smashburger's, and it goes to that small, I'm sorry, Chinese spot on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1086.172s">And</a>  now Raising Cane's. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1088.274s">I</a>  have to wait five and 10 minutes to get in and out of there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1092.296s">So</a>  I'm wondering if they might want to also promote more people going in if they get a little bit discouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1100.459s">If</a>  on that street right by Dunkin Donuts, I forget the name of that street, that there could also be additional small signage entrance to Raising Cane's here also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1110.903s">I</a>  don't know how that works with zoning or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1115.565s">is</a>  a suggestion because I think especially in the beginning with the fine product like that, especially with families and inflation on higher restaurants right now, it's going to be busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1124.867s">I</a>  wish them success. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1126.688s">I'm</a>  just wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1127.848s">I</a>  think it's a really good idea.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1129.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1130.109s">Yes,</a>  this is just about the signs and we did the special permit on other items already, but I do believe Raising Cane's is making improvements at the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1138.051s">Kathy,</a>  if you want to speak on it.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1141.411s">I</a>  can address that briefly as part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1145.143s">that</a>  we put some kind of signage so that when you get to the end of Riverside have where the light is that they don't block the box, and that's going to be somehow tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1155.592s">To</a>  a light right before the block the box so that cars and coming going down Riverside have to the fouls way will be aware that they can't block the box and that there's going to be a change in light. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1166.942s">In</a>  addition to that, I believe we also discussed the. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1172.349s">putting</a>  some kind of signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1174.351s">I</a>  don't recall who is specifically responsible for it, but that other entrance was addressed as something that should be made known to Raisin Cane customers that they can also exit out of that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1187.982s">So</a>  those were discussed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1188.683s">I</a>  believe there were new paint marks as well were?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1190.805s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1192.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1194.107s">Any</a>  further comment on the special permit for signage for Raisin Canes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1201.013s">Seeing</a>  none in the chamber and none on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1205.402s">Are</a>  there any motions?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1210.592s">I</a>  would, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1213.172s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1214.712s">I'll</a>  defer to that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1215.373s">Well,</a>  I'm just gonna move forward.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1217.413s">I'll</a>  second your motion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1218.333s">Okay,</a>  so I think that with the concessions for the neighbors and for the business that's moving in, I think that we've been pretty thorough with our meetings and informing the neighbors, so I would move forward with the changes as instructed and approve.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1472.204s">Whereas</a>  the city of Medford has climate sustainability, affordable housing and other goals that would be easier to accomplish if we could reach either renters or landlords or both in our city, and whereas a lack of a registry of rental properties means that we currently miss opportunities to reach either our renters or our landlords or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1489.257s">Be</a>  it so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1494.059s">with</a>  energy efficiency standards as described in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, Section 2.2.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1501.583s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this ordinance be referred to committee for further discussion in the Planning and Permitting Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1507.606s">Be</a>  it further resolved that members of the Planning and Permitting Committee submit questions to the chair, clerk, and city staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1516.499s">and</a>  be it further resolved that the council work with the building department and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on the drafting of this ordinance to ensure that it best serves the city of Medford and our climate and affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1529.104s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1530.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1532.02s">So</a>  one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1545.311s">I</a>  know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1556.319s">And</a>  tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1564.306s">There</a>  are also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1566.667s">you</a>  know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1578.234s">That</a>  would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1587.719s">And</a>  there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1591.541s">I</a>  know in the climate adaptation and action plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1595.844s">it</a>  has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1597.645s">There</a>  are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1611.216s">I</a>  know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1622.765s">know,</a>  junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1641.162s">being</a>  able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1647.206s">And</a>  really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1664.037s">So</a>  that's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1665.638s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1667.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.511s">I</a>  would really like to thank Councilor Callahan for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1674.074s">I</a>  think this is an idea that most residents assume we already do as a city, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1679.639s">And</a>  it is something that, you know, it's information that the city should really have in order to communicate its message better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1686.084s">And</a>  I think that kind of touches at two of the arcs that we're trying to work on this term in the city of Medford with the city government communication modernization. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1697.644s">we're</a>  ambitious as a city council and as a city when it comes to our climate goals, housing goals, but also the very basis of just having our existing laws be carried out and enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1709.991s">And</a>  this registry would allow us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1712.693s">It</a>  would allow us to be more responsive to a lot of constituent concerns and a lot of resident concerns like what you mentioned about absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1720.757s">and</a>  it would help us restructure some of the ideas that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1725.939s">For</a>  example, with the good landlord tax credit, which I know a lot of people are really excited about, this idea allows us to reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1735.041s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1741.197s">This</a>  sounds really interesting I'm curious about if this is common practice and other cities in the area I'm not I'm not familiar with this as a concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1749.64s">I</a>  would be curious to hear if other cities practices commonly and another thought I have and I don't think this necessarily is a deal breaker but if it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1759.005s">I</a>  don't know what that would mean for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1760.006s">Prohibitive</a>  administratively for City Hall staff and what that would mean for requirements for maybe additional hiring or restructuring, or if that's just something to discuss in committee because I know the resolution says, you know, talk about it and planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1775.215s">Obviously</a>  that would be the time to talk to City Hall staff, but that those are just things that come up and also things being</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1789.77s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1791.271s">I</a>  would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1802.477s">For</a>  example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1813.064s">They</a>  just don't have access to who those people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1815.995s">So</a>  I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1828.24s">We're</a>  gonna go to President Bears, Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1831.721s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1833.222s">Yeah,</a>  having spoken with not just the planning department, but also code enforcement, building inspectors, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1841.365s">And</a>  also, this is a policy that's in effect in Boston, Worcester, other communities around the city, around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1847.952s">There's</a>  a huge issue with being able to identify what's an owner-occupied home, what is a rental unit, what's an illegal rental unit, and this would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1857.521s">I</a>  think I was listening to Councilor Tseng talk a bit about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1863.643s">Building</a>  code, health and safety, you know, there's a lot of difficulty with reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1871.49s">We</a>  send it out in the tax bill, absentee landlord, absentee property owner, maybe they never open the envelope and maybe they never see it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1879.318s">So</a>  there's a number of things when it comes to quality of life here in a community where this would be a huge benefit for the city to be able to identify this and I think the good and important thing to recognize is that most of the people who are renting property owners or renting properties in the city are <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1895.52s">the</a>  right thing, following the rules, you know, and this is a way for the city to provide access to the different programs and benefits available and be in contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1905.303s">And</a>  then for the folks who are problem properties, and we know of them, and we know many of them are in the hillside neighborhood and over-renting to tough students, and we have overgrowth, and we've had petitions coming in here before, this is a way for the city to actually keep track of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1918.587s">And</a>  that's been a huge note from code enforcement and building, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1924.013s">It's</a>  just hard to say, here's the file on this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1926.535s">And</a>  this property may be violating snow and ice removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1928.776s">They</a>  may have overgrowth under the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1930.277s">They</a>  may have trash on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1931.798s">They</a>  may have noise nuisance complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1933.72s">They</a>  may have a whole plethora list of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1936.201s">But</a>  because there's no registry, there's nothing to attach any of that to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1940.104s">And</a>  they get away with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1941.745s">So</a>  this really is a way for us to have that list, know what's going on in the city, and make sure that while most folks are doing the right thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1952.753s">address</a>  the issues with those who are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1954.556s">And</a>  I think that's something that all of us can acknowledge is an issue that we all experience here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1960.147s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1961.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1963.012s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1964.48s">just</a>  a question for Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1967.902s">So</a>  it says here the building department, the office and the PBS. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1971.745s">Do</a>  you have a good idea of where this project once it is implemented would primarily be maintained? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1978.57s">Would</a>  it be the building department or PBS? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1980.531s">And</a>  what's do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1982.053s">Can</a>  you just, like, give us an idea of the amount of staff time that it would take to get this off the ground and maintain a longer term? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1987.897s">If</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1992.844s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, if you have a direct response.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1994.664s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1995.705s">I</a>  mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2001.626s">So</a>  the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2011.768s">So</a>  really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2015.309s">But</a>  as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2018.888s">who</a>  will implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2020.19s">I</a>  think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.995s">I</a>  can also speak to some of Councilor Lazzaro and Councilor Leming's questions, because I happened to hold a meeting on this a few weeks ago with some city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2050.561s">It</a>  seems like most of the work would fall within the purview of the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2055.623s">Actually,</a>  the new building commissioner that we have here in Medford set up the rental registry system for their last municipality, and so they're very well-versed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2064.487s">how</a>  to create the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2067.391s">They've</a>  created an online system that really maintains itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2070.415s">And</a>  so it wouldn't, you know, the setup would take time for the staff to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2075.521s">But</a>  once the system is in place, they expect the system to be quite self-containing.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.183s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.963s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2085.184s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.084s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.284s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.344s">If</a>  I can't do the chair to Council Kalyan or any other councils that can what documents were we asking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2092.865s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.166s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.886s">This</a>  is an intrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2095.946s">Um</a>  process and what we're asking for for renters information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2100.287s">Landlords</a>  information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2102.008s">Can</a>  anybody share what we</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2111.423s">Again,</a>  this is the beginning of the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2114.086s">Excuse</a>  me, we're not going to interrupt people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2122.575s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, please go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2127.515s">So</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2135.158s">Yes,</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2146.181s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2149.238s">My</a>  understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2162.961s">There</a>  will be a chance for everybody to participate on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2171.122s">Please</a>  do not interrupt speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2172.643s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, are you finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2175.594s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2176.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2177.196s">And</a>  I think that's what the big concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2179.72s">I</a>  think that we're doing something that sounds like it doesn't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2185.148s">We've</a>  been we've been <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2190.538s">Based</a>  on interrupt speakers, I'm gonna ask the room to be silent, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2195.799s">I'm</a>  hearing dialogue back and forth from fellow councils that we're here to do people's business and we should do some things later on that we'll talk about that we need to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2206.581s">We</a>  keep doing business and keep throwing more work onto people that we already know don't have the capability to do what you're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2214.703s">You're</a>  asking for something that's already done <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2216.983s">through</a>  the city in every way possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2221.646s">If</a>  the biggest thing is just to get the information out to people, there's other ways to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2226.889s">But</a>  to be intrusive and then really take all these unnecessary documents, it makes people very uneasy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2235.133s">And</a>  I'll be honest with you, for a council that's very, very astute in understanding about people that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2241.96s">I</a>  probably most difficult people that are going through a very difficult time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2245.661s">I</a>  was getting phone calls from landlords saying, George, what do we do hypothetically? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2250.703s">Hypothetically?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.024s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.584s">Because</a>  the conversation scares our residents, that our landlords allow to give them a place to live, but are afraid to give documentation, because maybe they're undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2266.948s">And</a>  they're petrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2268.854s">This</a>  is a fear that you should wait when we get to this point, but also understand we're trying to do something over and over again with different issues on this council lately that's redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2280.723s">And</a>  it's putting more work to departments that need to do their work, not to do this additional stuff that we want to get people to know that there is some sort of rebate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2292.964s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2294.487s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2299.899s">But</a>  to keep bringing resolutions through. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2304.286s">I</a>  think it's hurting this community and it's driving more wedges through this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2312.729s">So</a>  I would request that we deny this process and not put more work on more departments that don't need it right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2323.673s">I</a>  would just note that the departments themselves have requested it and it's part of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2330.959s">It</a>  is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2331.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2333.32s">I'm</a>  not going to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2335.641s">Seriously,</a>  my role is to just state facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2340.242s">Okay,</a>  please stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.103s">Please</a>  stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.983s">You</a>  have to be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2346.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2348.065s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2352.166s">Seeing</a>  none, name and address for the record, please, for public participation.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2356.027s">Robert</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2357.348s">Mary</a>  Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2360.126s">Again,</a>  I really don't know where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2363.449s">The</a>  people that own the houses pay their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2367.752s">We</a>  know how to contact them when we're looking for their money, correct?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2372.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2373.277s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2375.178s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2377.76s">So</a>  you have a mechanism to contact every homeowner in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2382.844s">It's</a>  a current system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2384.065s">Who</a>  is going to be processing and administering all this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2388.84s">rental</a>  registry, we're going to have a rental registry department here, because we barely have enough staff to provide the basic city services that we have right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2398.444s">Thank</a>  you, as was as was noted, and please do not if you're going to shout, I'm going to ask you to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2403.886s">Thank</a>  you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2405.106s">I</a>  just want to if you I can answer your question, which is that the people who are responsible for enforcing the building code have said that this would make their jobs easier.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2412.073s">Can</a>  you name them?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2413.194s">Yes,</a>  the people who work in the building department, the building commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.515s">Are</a>  they here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.835s">It</a>  was just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2417.136s">Well,</a>  we're not, we haven't had them, we're just referring to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2419.457s">So</a>  we're going to have the discussion as members of the public have noted, we're going to have a long discussion just on this topic so that everyone can have their points concerned, so that points like Councilor Scarpelli's can be raised and so that we can craft an ordinance that works for the community.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.925s">It</a>  would be nice if the people that you talked to would be here to verify that you had talked to them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2437.233s">We're</a>  going, okay, I don't think we need to be verifying anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2440.194s">We're</a>  gonna have a discussion.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2441.494s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2441.794s">Read</a>  the room, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2443.314s">I</a>  have, and I'm disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2445.395s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2446.115s">And</a>  I think that you guys are way overstepping your boundaries here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2449.815s">I</a>  think you're beyond the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2453.576s">I'm</a>  gonna let you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2454.856s">You</a>  got three minutes, 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2458.857s">That's</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2459.797s">I'm</a>  not a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2460.837s">I'd</a>  love to ask a city solicitor, but obviously we don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2465.228s">Another</a>  point that I'd like to make with all the, what I consider drastic and radical changes that you're trying to push through in the city, I think they should be put on a ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2477.437s">And</a>  if they're truly...</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2481.277s">Just</a>  a reminder that the disruption does take away from the speaker's time.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2484.158s">Oh,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2485.538s">Well,</a>  the police are here so they can drag me from the podium if you so desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2489.62s">If</a>  needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2490.48s">If</a>  needed, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2491.701s">I'll</a>  stay here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2494.241s">The</a>  other thing was, through the chair to the city clerk, what is our next municipal election? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2501.264s">How</a>  about September 3rd? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2502.324s">There's</a>  no election on September 3rd?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2504.932s">That's</a>  not a municipal election, that's a state primary.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2506.914s">Oh,</a>  sorry, I misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2508.014s">The</a>  next election in the city of Medfordwood will be September 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2511.917s">So</a>  why don't we craft all the ordinances and the registries, whatever that may be, and put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2517.962s">And</a>  if it's truly the will of the people, we'll see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2520.984s">And</a>  people will be able to vote at the ballot box, not down here with a two minute limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2532.344s">Every</a>  week, it's something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2534.125s">And</a>  it's overstepping the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2536.845s">You're</a>  doing charter review here on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2540.406s">And</a>  if we had a city solicitor, maybe they could weigh in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2544.608s">I</a>  guess that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2547.649s">What</a>  is the impetus of this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2550.329s">Because</a>  it doesn't sound like <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2552.418s">The</a>  problem landlords are not going to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2555.419s">You</a>  understand that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2557.239s">The</a>  people that you're talking about enforcing are not going to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2560.8s">And</a>  we know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2562.08s">You</a>  know how to get in touch with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2563.54s">So</a>  I question why this registry is even being put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2568.301s">Is</a>  it to mimic the one that they have in Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2571.402s">Lynn</a>  has a rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2573.542s">Is</a>  that where you got the information from, Mr. Chair?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2576.909s">I'm</a>  not going to engage in the back and forth, but as I noted, this is in the city's comprehensive plan and was requested by several departments in the city as a way to... Okay, well, I'd like to know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2586.593s">I</a>  just told you it's the building department and the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2589.094s">I</a>  don't believe you, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2591.135s">Okay,</a>  well, I'm sorry that you don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2592.936s">You</a>  can continue your comment, but I'm not going to engage in the back and forth.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2595.817s">Okay,</a>  well, I thought we were here to ask questions and you would answer them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2600.679s">No,</a>  you're here to make comments and we will hear them.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2603.52s">I'm</a>  asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2608.317s">You</a>  have 55 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2609.438s">OK,</a>  we have somebody else ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2611.06s">So</a>  my question is, what is the impetus, the end game for this rental registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2616.886s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2617.987s">Number</a>  two, who in the building department asked for this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2622.839s">And</a>  I have plenty of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2624.28s">And</a>  if this registry and some of the other things that we have rise above the charter of the city, and if they're legal, I'd like to have that legal opinion by a city solicitor or KP Law, whoever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2637.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2638.049s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2650.477s">No,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2650.757s">I'm</a>  going to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2651.497s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2652.87s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2653.812s">Hi,</a>  it's Kathleen Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2655.554s">I</a>  have a couple thoughts or questions about this rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2661.624s">I</a>  don't own a two family home, so I don't really have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2666.991s">I</a>  can't comment, but I do have some thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2671.194s">One</a>  is that all this information, like Mr. Jones said earlier, all this information should be somewhere in some sort of city database that we have with our names and addresses, that we pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2688.632s">You</a>  know, so either someone's not doing their job correctly, or someone is not using the technology that we have to do their job, or we're missing some piece of technology to gather that information to be able to utilize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2706.248s">Because</a>  if we have some sort of computer system, we have some sort of database that has all this information in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2715.666s">And</a>  then my other thought was about how do you get around people who rent illegally or like, I mean, I can only assume, because I have seen college students before, you know, you have an apartment in Hillside that's supposed to rent to four people, but there's eight people living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2734.002s">How</a>  do you get around that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2735.203s">Like,</a>  how do you, I just, I think that there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2740.185s">I</a>  think it's a nice idea, but I think we have that information and we should utilize what we have before we start creating something new.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3096.367s">I</a>  didn't quite say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3097.208s">I</a>  said we know that there's a small percentage of people who are problem landlords, but code enforcement has said because there's no registry, it can be difficult to track them down and we are well aware that there are a lot of corporate owners using shell corporations and they're almost impossible for the city to get in touch with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3110.245s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3111.451s">Okay,</a>  all right, so I didn't hear anything about single families. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3114.793s">There's</a>  tons of single family homes that don't enforce their codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3117.994s">I</a>  walk the streets of Medford all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3120.275s">There's</a>  no code enforcement for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3123.317s">There's</a>  trash thrown in front of their businesses, overgrowth, things are not taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3127.859s">What</a>  are you doing about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3129.52s">Are</a>  they registered? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3130.2s">Do</a>  you reach out to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3131.901s">How</a>  are you gonna reach out? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3132.882s">You</a>  talk about tax programs that you wanna reach out to us for tax programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3135.703s">There's</a>  other ways to reach out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3138.084s">do</a>  you what about the tax incentives for single family homebuyers how are you going to reach out to them are you going to have them register there's ways to reach out to these people without having to and again the people that end up getting burned with these types of things are the small property owners who actually the majority of them are pretty good landlords and they're the ones who end up bearing the brunt of these these laws that's all i have to say thank you</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3164.517s">Thank</a>  you, and I will note we do have a business license program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3167.698s">All</a>  businesses are licensed, and this council on multiple budgets has requested additional funding for code enforcement, including in the most recent budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3175.679s">We</a>  currently only have two code enforcement officers.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3178.4s">Well,</a>  then maybe we should start there first.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3180.861s">We're</a>  doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3183.981s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3185.022s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">It's</a>  been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">And</a>  I feel like there's something wrong with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">You're</a>  going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">Also,</a>  my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">by</a>  going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">And</a>  it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">And</a>  in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">you</a>  indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">Well,</a>  let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">Because</a>  if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">not</a>  renting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">So</a>  what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">These</a>  are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">In</a>  fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3303.712s">There's</a>  nothing in the ordinance that would suggest that whatsoever.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">city</a>  of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">And</a>  if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">Now,</a>  if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">MCAD</a>  in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">And</a>  you can also go to the public health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">Right</a>  now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">But</a>  every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">Because</a>  that unfortunately, is where this is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">Because</a>  once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">Let</a>  me see your references. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">And</a>  where were you renting last? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">That's</a>  not what this council's job is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">What</a>  an answer!</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3383.677s">I</a>  would just note again that this doesn't say anything like that.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.78s">This</a>  doesn't say anything.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">You</a>  don't know you haven't gotten there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">You</a>  just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3397.528s">I</a>  have said point Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3399.33s">I</a>  have the authority to respond with facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3400.991s">These</a>  are not factual facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3403.774s">You</a>  would please tell me where this says that we're going to discriminate ethnically against.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">I</a>  didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3410.599s">What's</a> </p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">Mr.</a>  President, what's the registry going to include? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">Ask</a>  the maker of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">You</a>  cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">Then</a>  you don't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">Go</a>  someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3436.542s">Yeah,</a>  54 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3438.544s">50</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">I'm</a>  just frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">And</a>  probably taking it out on all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">But</a>  I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">I'm</a>  going to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">I</a>  have a bad habit of repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">Please</a>  just do what you were elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">Well,</a>  you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">Did</a>  you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3466.122s">So</a>  let me just... All right, if we're gonna shout again, I'm gonna ask you to leave.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">Let</a>  me just conclude by saying the following.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3474.404s">You</a>  have 30 seconds, you have 15 seconds actually.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">Well,</a>  you know something, just relax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">You</a>  had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">You</a>  took my time up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">I'm</a>  gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">and</a>  think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">So</a>  you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">Maybe</a>  there is something that can work its way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">Maybe</a>  if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">And</a>  the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">And</a>  at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">that</a>  revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">No,</a>  wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3798.822s">Hi,</a>  my name is Longway Su, 250 Spring Street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3804.363s">You</a>  may speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3805.083s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3805.984s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank you for the city council for opportunity to express my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3815.338s">First,</a>  I want to thank the Council for giving us the chance to express our thoughts and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3821.984s">For</a>  me, I basically have three things I want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3826.208s">First</a>  is privacy, second is fairness, and third is efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3832.453s">and</a>  actually said I have to come today to express those points because I think a lot of good folks already expressed those comments, but probably I need to rehash them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3845.016s">First</a>  is the privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3847.076s">I</a>  think it is unfair to put in this kind of burden for the landlord to collect, validate, and reporting those private informations to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3860.527s">You</a>  may think that would be helpful, you may think it would be helpful, like a government body, but for us regular folks, it's just not a big brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3871.573s">We</a>  just want to pay our tax and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3873.413s">We</a>  have a job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3876.115s">And</a>  collecting those private information really violates the right of the landlord and also the tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3884.192s">I</a>  mean, how can write it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3885.432s">This</a>  is a whole of a body of work involving for the registration, both on the city and on the citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3894.135s">So</a>  this is privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3896.035s">Second</a>  is fairness. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3898.356s">Me,</a>  I'm not evil. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3900.316s">I</a>  live my property for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3903.317s">I</a>  work my bone to earn that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3905.898s">I</a>  literally got a machine all myself because it cost 500 to get plumber. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3911.71s">I</a>  literally, like I work so hard for their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3915.393s">I</a>  just share the same responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3918.175s">I</a>  paid exactly what I own in terms of tax for like other single resident in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3927.141s">It</a>  is unfair to discriminate small owner like me just because I have a property, I rent it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3936.128s">I</a>  already did my fair part. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3938.069s">I</a>  pay my tax, just leave me alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3950.368s">Third</a>  is efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3952.75s">I</a>  just couldn't notice that one of the reason that the objective is to be affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3962.095s">I'm</a>  not a scientist or economic scientist. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3965.657s">I</a>  just couldn't make the connection of affordable housing versus more fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3971.621s">Really,</a>  how that will even help in terms of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3976.338s">it</a>  will make metaphor even more expensive for renter, because every penny you extract from landlord will eventually triple down to all resident here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3989.181s">So</a>  my suggestion to the city council is actually try to more efficiently use the tax money you already have towards the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3998.033s">They</a>  are other people's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3999.635s">They</a>  are the money from, like, pulling from the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4003.42s">Those</a>  should be, you already have those money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4006.604s">that</a>  we probably should have more proposal, we should working on using that existing tax money more efficiently, rather try to expand the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4017.068s">And</a>  if it does, please do it properly, just raise the tax rate, do it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4024.13s">And</a>  that's all my comments, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4025.69s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4033.493s">No</a>  hands on Zoom, go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4037.901s">I</a>  just want to say that I strongly oppose this rental licensing ordinance, and I just want to make a general appreciation of why I only own my house, I don't have rental property, and some other people have made great points about the specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4056.283s">I</a>  just think that the rental licensing ordinance is a clear example, in fact, of government overreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4062.729s">When</a>  the government imposes such licenses, it typically aims to regulate for the sake of regulation and nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4069.796s">In</a>  this case, under the guise of climate sustainability and affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4074.64s">However,</a>  what actually occurs is a limitation on the freedom of property owners to engage freely in the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4081.805s">This</a>  not only introduces unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, but also inflates costs for both landlords and tenants, for both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4093.493s">reflecting</a>  a misguided approach to solving housing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4096.677s">A</a>  much more effective method would be to encourage free market competition and innovation, which naturally elevates housing standards, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4103.884s">sustainability</a>  goals, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4106.454s">and</a>  affordability without imposing burdensome regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4109.135s">And</a>  I would just like to add, based on the comment on the previous person, which I applaud, is that, yes, I would try to focus on efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4118.02s">And</a>  I understand that by definition, the government is inefficient because the government uses somebody else's money on someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4124.723s">And</a>  as such, the government thinks that resources are unlimited, but they're not unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4129.145s">We</a>  work as hard as we can to basically pay our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4133.747s">And</a>  then we're not getting anything out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4136.497s">You</a>  can't even drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4137.837s">I</a>  had to change two bearings in my car already because you basically drive like it's a landmine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4143.679s">You're</a>  trying to avoid potholes everywhere you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4146.54s">So</a>  I please request that the city council, please use the resources that you already have efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4154.403s">Property</a>  prices go up every year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4157.384s">I</a>  keep paying more taxes, so please, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4160.345s">Please</a>  use as efficiently as you can with the limitation that I have stated that it's always going to be more inefficient than the free market. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4168.208s">Please</a>  use what you have as efficiently as you can and leave us alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4173.469s">We</a>  already do our part, we work as hard as we can, and we don't want to contribute anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4178.691s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4179.991s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4431.471s">Okay,</a>  but I'll tell you something that could be wrong in that too as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4435.412s">We</a>  know that maybe some of this you're looking for the fall points as they call it, you know, maybe somebody's there who's destructive of property or maybe a landowner is having a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4446.156s">You</a>  have a better way of contacting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4448.137s">I</a>  know sometimes it's very hard to contact someone even if you go by their tax <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4454.019s">bill</a>  if they live out of state or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4456.242s">I've</a>  gone through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4457.183s">I</a>  helped a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4458.264s">I</a>  still do with his business besides teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4460.786s">He</a>  owns a small real estate brokerage firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4464.03s">Sometimes</a>  we get the envelope back three times in four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4467.714s">We</a>  say we give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4469.015s">So</a>  that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4470.537s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4471.698s">But</a>  we pay a lot of money for printing census forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4474.919s">We</a>  have the postage, probably free. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4477.88s">But</a>  we have people who are very responsible, I'm hoping, who process all those forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4482.981s">And</a>  that's a good base. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4484.201s">We</a>  also have the registration of voters in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4490.303s">ways</a>  during, excuse me, during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4494.446s">But</a>  if you're an example, my niece, who was going through different internships, had to come and live with me after I lost my brother suddenly a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4503.291s">She</a>  was in and out of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4505.953s">Fine,</a>  I welcome her anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4507.754s">She</a>  just left, as a matter of fact, again this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4510.936s">Every</a>  time I filled out the census, I didn't know whether to put her name down because I didn't know if she was going to leave in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4516.419s">Now,</a>  it could have been she maybe took a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4519.74s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4520.221s">I'm</a>  just making these as examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4522.102s">If</a>  someone had to bring her up and she wasn't living there anymore, what would something like this do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4526.564s">Accuse</a>  me, the homeowner, of fraud? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4528.725s">You</a>  know, if she was going off someplace else to live for a few months? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4533.027s">To</a>  me, I want you to take this that you didn't put <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4537.089s">some</a>  other intention and besides, I think it's going to come to something bigger too, and not better but worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4544.452s">People</a>  don't watch these meetings anymore and I know it's a motion tonight President Pierce, that you're going to look into speaking time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4552.435s">Well</a>  there's a lot of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4554.036s">Come</a>  to me and say we're not watching it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4556.697s">We're</a>  sick of issues coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4558.598s">We're</a>  bored We have no idea where they're going with some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4561.419s">They're</a>  meaningless to us We don't want to watch anymore and you know what happens in a year or two They don't vote because they just don't want to be bothered anymore and they feel like they don't have a voice So I hope I helped in some way to um, just direct <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4577.585s">I</a>  wouldn't say meaningless, but some motions that really can cause a lot of meaningless commotion for yourselves and that your time can be better spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4586.77s">And</a>  another example of this is some people, including myself, I had company watching a meeting one night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4592.433s">And</a>  some people on the council were directing questions to the people who put these ordinances together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4599.479s">You're</a>  supposed to know all that information when you come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4602.642s">If</a>  we have a question, you should be able to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4607.206s">You</a>  shouldn't be asking each other questions behind your own motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4610.989s">That</a>  should be in a discussion, including in your salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4614.132s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.214s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.594s">Diaz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.974s">I'm</a>  going to go to Jennifer Fiore on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4622.705s">Give</a>  me one second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4626.628s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4627.629s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4629.41s">Hi,</a>  Jennifer Fiore, 61 Stickney Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4633.293s">I</a>  just had one quick comment or clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4636.596s">My</a>  understanding is that it would be the landlords and the renters who would be on this registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4641.099s">And</a>  I think it's actually also pretty concerning for the renters to have their privacy invaded like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4650.627s">You</a>  know, renters might be of all different income levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4654.871s">They</a>  may potentially be receiving other government services. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4658.975s">And,</a>  you know, depending on where administrations head, you know, privacy and governments being aware of their whereabouts might be concerning for people and might disincentivize them from moving to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4675.782s">My</a>  second point is that just in observing these last few meetings, I just see such an immense amount of pain that is being caused in this community by the way the city council is conducting affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4688.912s">And</a>  I just think you all really should go home and reflect on what you're doing, what your goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4701.167s">and</a>  what your role really is as leadership for a city because you're causing pain and it's going to come back and haunt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4711.776s">And</a>  so I think collectively it's an opportunity to just think about where you want to see this community head and how the most productive way would be to go about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4724.888s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4726.929s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4739.76s">Councilor</a>  Callahan just to a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4741.402s">Renters</a>  are not on the registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4744.205s">There's</a>  rental properties that are on the right, so just be property owners and renters themselves are not on registry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4749.451s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4750.171s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4751.433s">You</a>  have five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4753.686s">Yeah,</a>  I think...

Sorry, could you provide your name and address for the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4770.515s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4771.315s">My</a>  name is Li Junhui. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4772.596s">I'm</a>  27 Hancock Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4774.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4774.558s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4775.738s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4776.159s">The</a>  first one, I think I watched the metaphor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4778.981s">I</a>  like metaphor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4780.202s">Now</a>  it's beautiful and beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4782.283s">I</a>  think I bought a house here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4784.285s">Beginning</a>  my tax is 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4785.666s">I</a>  did a very good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4787.327s">So</a>  make my house beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4788.848s">So</a>  now increase the tax to the 12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4792.831s">I'm</a>  OK, because I like to contribute to the metaphor, make the metaphor beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4799.534s">And</a>  also, it's a work of art. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4801.575s">But</a>  another thing, for this one, I think it definitely will be hurting the privacy of the landlord and also the renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4808.618s">I</a>  know the purpose, our goal, is to make the metaphor beautiful and also <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4815.541s">is</a>  a good business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4817.101s">So</a>  I think this is our all the resident resident ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4820.862s">So</a>  my point, I just like concern about this, this, this new policy will be heard our, our economics of the Medford will be not only heard a lot of privacy part and also for the renter to will be hesitated to run here if they have so many burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4839.066s">And</a>  also, this is like a <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4843.233s">their</a>  privacy, this is only my thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4845.755s">I</a>  think I want Medford to have a good business and also good future. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4850.197s">So</a>  I definitely ask you guys can reconsider this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4855.0s">Yeah.</a> </p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5191.81s">I</a>  bought a house and I have very good renters in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5197.472s">And</a>  as the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5200.071s">landlord</a>  that I don't know what to set up and what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5204.055s">And</a>  two months later, the water bill show up in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5207.298s">And</a>  you guys really know how to find us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5210.541s">And</a>  if you want to send those information along with the water bill, I'm okay to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5216.226s">Like</a>  if you have a rebate, send it with the water bill and I can get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5220.49s">There's</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5224.781s">I</a>  think there's like a really advanced technologies, a lot of things happening around the world, machine learning and different kind of tech, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5233.624s">And</a>  some of them is even open source is free. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5235.944s">So</a>  do leverage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5238.545s">And</a>  I'm pretty sure that you have a way to find the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5242.486s">And</a>  even if it's not in Massachusetts, it's in other states, it's in other countries, I'm pretty sure you have a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5247.067s">And</a>  that's my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5249.188s">And</a>  second point, it's the human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5253.337s">and</a>  listening to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5255.499s">So</a>  I live in another city in Massachusetts and I've never seen like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5262.684s">So</a>  this is the first time I have been in city council that like the audience is this kind of reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5269.129s">And</a>  I think what we should do is we should really listen to people and we should really focus on people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5276.215s">That's</a>  what the city council should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5279.297s">And</a>  I feel <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5281.681s">And</a>  a lot of gentlemen and ladies, they have already talked a lot about the efficiency, the rights, and then what the city council should focus on now, all reaching to this area, that I think all the landlords, they have their own rights, and then they have their own power to manage this property without a rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5302.553s">So</a>  I think, at last, I really want to suggest the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5307.788s">listen</a>  to people, and follow with people, and what you just hear, not just me, everyone else, it's just what people want to express and what to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5316.411s">And</a>  if this is the beginning of the conversation, let's end it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.113s">That's</a>  everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.753s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5324.554s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Leong, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6444.793s">I've</a>  been here in December when you set the tax rate, what the city assesses for at least 19 Decembers in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6453.436s">I</a>  missed once on purpose to see what you would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6456.757s">Still</a>  the same results, seven to zero, they voted against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6460.538s">Maybe</a>  it's about high noon time to adopt what they did in Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Chelsea, Cambridge, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6473.959s">to</a>  adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6479.782s">And</a>  that is the real estate owner occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6484.684s">If</a>  you live in the house, doesn't matter how many units, because it's only going to apply to your one unit, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6495.546s">you</a>  would receive the owner occupied exemption, about 85% of owner occupied would receive a savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6505.355s">Instead</a>  of the usual, I'm getting $300, $400 every effing year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6510.24s">It's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6511.221s">So</a>  you, Councilor Bears, even said to the commissioner, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6518.055s">of</a>  the real estate downstairs that we have to look at this in advance, like six months before, which is like May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6525.542s">So</a>  this is the time, as you said, we should investigate whether we should adopt this or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6532.227s">At</a>  the full 35% exemption, or else don't even bother. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6536.391s">There's</a>  a lot of people that are business people behind me, actually, that does not want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6544.554s">because</a>  they're absentee owners, maybe not slumlords, but they know on Christian Street, there's two or three, Winchester, Wellesley, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6555.621s">They're</a>  just collecting rents, two, three, $4,000 a month, depending on how many bedrooms there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6561.544s">Every</a>  month it changes, and different cars come, no one knows where to park, not enough parking anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6570.75s">They</a>  don't know what color barrels to put out, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6573.777s">I</a>  don't know, do I make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6576.358s">Or</a>  is it you people with the problems?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6578.698s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6579.598s">We</a>  definitely have had a lot of conversations about owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6582.339s">I</a>  think you'd actually find that if we were to implement it, it would increase, it shifts the burden within the property tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6587.62s">It</a>  would actually increase the taxes on a lot of small multifamily homes.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6592.841s">What</a>  I just said was 85%, is my guesstimate, would save if they live in the house, period.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6600.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6601.002s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Jessica Healy on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6605.168s">name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6606.148s">You</a>  have five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6610.689s">I</a>  just want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6613.83s">I</a>  keep hearing that this is the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6615.43s">This</a>  is getting stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6616.71s">It's</a>  beginning phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6618.591s">I</a>  want to know, and I'm sure everyone else would like to know what the end goal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6623.512s">Everything</a>  that has beginning has an ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6626.192s">So</a>  there's some reason that you're putting all these different motions into play because there's some <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6634.392s">and</a>  goal you have, and I'm not sure what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6639.156s">If</a>  anyone could explain that to me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6642.658s">Many</a>  of the policies we've been discussing are part of the city's comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing plan, which are available on the city website, and they include recommendations for council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6652.345s">This</a>  is one of them.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6654.286s">Okay,</a>  so the housing and climate plan, okay.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6657.849s">And</a>  comprehensive plan as well, the citywide comprehensive.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6661.052s">All</a>  right, well, I'll have to look into those plans that you guys have set up, because apparently, from the different meetings I've been watching, not many people love these plans that you're putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6672.057s">I</a>  also just have to state that, like another gentleman stated that was just up there, watching this meeting and the snickering and the remarks that are stated back to people and the laughing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6687.435s">It</a>  comes off very condescending and very arrogant And that is not what we elected you guys to be and to act And I don't know if you notice you're getting this negative feedback Due to the way that you behave in your mannerisms the way you speak to others The looks you give it's just No one wants to hear that when they're expressing <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6717.324s">issues</a>  that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6718.765s">And</a>  I'm understanding, because I know, like they said, the vote's gonna be 6-1, it's gonna go through, and you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6730.072s">You're</a>  just basically sitting here listening to us because you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6733.815s">You</a>  have to have public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6736.496s">If</a>  you did not legally have to have it, you would be fine and you would pass everything through and you would not listen to us at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6745.222s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6747.679s">you</a>  need to show respect to gain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6752.562s">And</a>  I appreciate your time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6755.984s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6756.545s">And</a>  I would just, the clerk has noted to me that Massachusetts general does not require public body, step public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6763.289s">It</a>  is something that we choose to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6769.993s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6771.094s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6780.459s">So,</a>  I believe that you may have a you may feel that you have everyone's best interest, the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6792.981s">But</a>  I think your focus is maybe the other things are out of your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6798.246s">That's</a>  why you're focusing on these little things like getting the homeowners names and addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6804.391s">I</a>  mean, because you already have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6807.374s">And</a>  I mean, what would you try and do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6810.277s">Try</a>  and find out what we charge for rent because that's against the law and you can't do that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6817.223s">That</a>  is between me and the IRS. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6819.73s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6820.971s">It's</a>  like asking me how much I make. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6822.613s">That's</a>  none of your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6824.154s">You</a>  can request that, but you can't demand it from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6827.637s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6828.438s">So</a>  these are things that maybe you can request from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6831.14s">And</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6832.381s">If</a>  you want to send something out and request it and volunteer, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6837.264s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6838.065s">If</a>  people want to volunteer that information, that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6841.61s">But</a>  this is a democracy, and I stand by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6845.855s">We</a>  live in a democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6848.278s">And</a>  with a democracy, you can't dictate these things to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6852.583s">That's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6854.686s">And</a>  that becomes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6856.775s">communist,</a>  which I'm not accusing you of. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6860.238s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6861.379s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6861.819s">I'm</a>  not accusing you of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6864.081s">And</a>  it becomes a dictatorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6866.322s">That's</a>  against our democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6869.045s">And</a>  that's what the United States of America stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6872.287s">Okay,</a>  so now we get past that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6874.969s">There</a>  are other things in this city that you could really help us with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6879.704s">How</a>  about the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6881.365s">That's</a>  deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6883.106s">Those</a>  students are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6884.327s">My</a>  granddaughter goes to the high school at the daycare there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6888.649s">That</a>  place is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6890.85s">Even</a>  the street getting up the hill is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6893.792s">These</a>  students deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6895.873s">Why</a>  are you focusing on landlords and tenants when children are at stake? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6902.196s">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6903.657s">That's</a>  our focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6904.958s">These</a>  young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6905.898s">How</a>  about the elderly? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6907.677s">Why</a>  are we focusing on them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6908.878s">Those</a>  are the helpless. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6910.439s">I'm</a>  not helpless. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6911.679s">Tenants</a>  aren't helpless, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6914.081s">Because</a>  they have resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6916.462s">They</a>  do have resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6918.163s">In</a>  a mailing, as this other woman had suggested, send out a mailing, put it on, give the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6926.588s">I'm</a>  just beside myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6927.929s">I'm</a>  just flabbergasted with what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6931.531s">And</a>  I do believe <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6934.107s">Council</a>  has in best interest trying to get some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6939.971s">But</a>  maybe the high school is out of your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6943.213s">Maybe</a>  everything is out of your, and it's above you, and you don't know how to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6947.656s">So</a>  you're focusing on this minute stuff because that's exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6953.559s">Focus</a>  on the important stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6954.98s">That's</a>  what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6956.901s">That's</a>  what you're in charge of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6959.003s">Get</a>  our schools in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6961.98s">help</a>  our teachers, help our police department, help our firemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6967.824s">That's</a>  what you can do and you will be proud and you will have our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6974.208s">And</a>  let me tell you something, I will support you, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6977.73s">And</a>  I've lived here my entire life. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6981.772s">That's</a>  what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6982.713s">We</a>  need a council that's gonna be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6987.976s">This</a>  rental stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6990.253s">It's</a>  minor, it's minor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6992.954s">Our</a>  children and our city and bring in revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6997.477s">There's</a>  so much revenue you can bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7000.478s">That's</a>  what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7001.979s">And</a>  you will go down in history in the city of Medford as being a great city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7006.341s">But</a>  right now, people are mocking you and laughing at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7010.363s">I</a>  know people from other cities that are mocking us and making fun of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7015.342s">saying,</a>  who was running your city council?

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7132.177s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and city council members for allowing me to participate in this important discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7139.183s">I</a>  want to reiterate without <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7143.803s">going</a>  over old rope about everything that previous speakers have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7150.184s">But</a>  focus on a couple of points that they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7154.585s">Number</a>  one, a gentleman spoke about putting together a bill and putting on a ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7161.047s">And</a>  that's an excellent idea because there are six people representing the entire city of Medford, some of whom aren't homeowners, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7171.409s">some</a>  of whom haven't been long time residents and haven't made a huge investment in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7178.951s">So</a>  I think that's a democratic way to go, is to go ahead and put together something to put on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7188.413s">Second</a>  of all, touching upon the issue of being able to contact homeowners, I was personally <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7200.43s">As</a>  a resident and as an American citizen, Democrat, offended by a notification I received in the mail, I received two of them, the last one being a notification about changing water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7219.6s">Okay,</a>  and in that it said final notice, and if you do not comply with this ordinance, then we have the right to shut off your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7235.387s">Well,</a>  I don't know who navigated and orchestrated that letter, but if they were to look at state laws and take legal input, it is illegal in the state of Massachusetts for anyone to interrupt water services to a property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7260.524s">It's</a>  a health and safety law, and it's against health and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7266.194s">Every</a>  home in the state of Massachusetts is required to have water and sewer working. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7275.58s">So</a>  you cannot threaten residents that you will cut off their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7280.743s">If</a>  they're multiple dwelling residents, then you're not only cutting off the water to the home of the owner, you're cutting it off to the renter's properties as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7295.97s">The</a>  owner has to pay for that water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7298.832s">If</a>  you can't reach the owner, which is apparent that you can, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7304.585s">then</a>  it's against the law to threaten somebody you will cut off their water and sewage system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7311.752s">Again,</a>  I would love to support the current city council members, but again, I have to, you know, go back and support my fellow citizens and residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7323.723s">I've</a>  lived here for over 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7327.426s">I</a>  brought my son up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7329.447s">He</a>  went to Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7332.069s">He</a>  participated in all the Medford sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7336.051s">I</a>  worked on committees on these sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7339.053s">I</a>  was a primary fundraiser for the Medford Pop Warner and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7349.565s">North</a>  Medford Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7351.807s">And,</a>  you know, I love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7353.909s">There's</a>  a lot of people that love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7356.131s">And</a>  let's make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7358.713s">Let's</a>  talk about making America better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7361.515s">Let's</a>  make Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7363.977s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to participate.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7365.719s">Thank</a>  you, Maureen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7367.74s">Maureen,</a>  can we get your name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7371.103s">Say</a>  again, please.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7372.779s">get</a>  your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7374.501s">My</a>  name is Maureen Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7376.162s">I</a>  live at 55 Ellsworth Street, North Medford, and I've been a homeowner here for 34 years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7384.188s">Thank</a>  you very much, Maureen.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7392.035s">Any</a>  further comment on this agenda item? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7397.459s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7403.057s">I</a>  just wanted to make a statement about how I think that some of our intentions are to bring ideas to the floor in a regular meeting with the intention of then discussing them further in committee, which committee meetings are also public meetings open to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7422.895s">And</a>  the idea there is there's just one agenda item that we can talk about more fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7427.774s">I</a>  think that what may be happening is that it's breeding uncertainty and confusion, which then makes people worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7437.842s">And</a>  for that reason, I'm not comfortable moving forward with this agenda, with this item tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7451.187s">Since</a>  we're in an open meeting right now, I'm comfortable speaking with the whole committee about this because we're allowed to all meet together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7458.831s">We</a>  are not usually allowed to all speak together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7461.533s">So</a>  it's really difficult for us to kind of have these strategizing meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7465.195s">But</a>  something that we have spoken about is like, let's introduce something that we know would be something that maybe we've spoken about in our <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7473.649s">campaigns</a>  or it's something that's a priority of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7476.231s">And</a>  we will start the conversation and then we'll move it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7479.414s">And</a>  when we have committee meetings, it will be, we'll have more time to discuss things and we'll be able to hammer out the details without having private conversations that violate open meeting law, which is illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7493.465s">We</a>  don't wanna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7494.446s">So</a>  what I think is happening by accident is we're drumming up fear in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7504.554s">I</a>  think maybe what might be a better move for some things going forward would be to have a really clear objective that we can bring to regular meetings and then maybe amend on the floor or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7518.663s">Just</a>  a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7520.384s">I</a>  just don't feel comfortable moving this to committee personally.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7522.886s">Not</a>  per se.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7528.029s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7533.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7533.92s">I</a>  respect my colleagues viewpoint, I think that I think what you're saying actually is in a bigger scheme, you know, we have, we should rethink how we, you know, when we have items introduced on the agenda, we send them to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7550.747s">This</a>  is how other municipalities in the state do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7553.969s">If</a>  there are other avenues to just, you know, send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7557.15s">to</a>  committee have a developed proposal before we create, you know, before we introduce it bring us to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7563.216s">I</a>  think that would be appropriate but I think that's something for us to investigate down the line, I would disagree on the conclusion with my fellow Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7571.865s">Now,</a>  I have been listening and taking a lot of notes during this during the last few, the last <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7580.114s">comments.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7581.135s">And</a>  I think there are a few buckets of questions for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7584.236s">And</a>  I, you know, I think we do have the answers for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7587.238s">I</a>  think on the question of privacy, as Councilor Callahan has stated, as is done in municipalities around the state, we wouldn't ask for tenant information that's just not done in other states or in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7600.985s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7602.526s">Here's</a>  an example of what information is collected usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7607.228s">Contact</a>  information for the property owner, property manager, number of units you're registering, and number of units at the property, dates of buying property, because there are certain laws that exempt properties because of age, and the city wouldn't want to overcharge landlords, and some fire code related items. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7630.805s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7631.507s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7632.51s">That's</a>  what's usually collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7635.799s">And</a>  I think, you know... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7639.045s">There's</a>  there's some questions another bucket of questions is, why do we need to collect this information, why do we need to create this registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7646.99s">Right</a>  now, you know, given that we might have some information but I think that's the point is we only have some of this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7653.434s">There</a>  are a lot of their landlords in the city who they might own property but that property is registered under their spouse's name right because their spouse about that property or their spouse was was a primary sign on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7666.002s">And</a>  we wouldn't be able to tell if that's a primary residence or a secondary property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7672.704s">There</a>  are a lot of cases like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7673.924s">There</a>  are also just more generally cases where we can't tell based on the tax bill whether it's owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, whether it's a primary or secondary residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7685.106s">And</a>  this would help us identify a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7689.327s">I</a>  will say another... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7694.255s">Another</a>  reason that I think we need to, another question about the functionality, about the feasibility of this that we should correct the record on is whether this is legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7707.841s">This</a>  is very clearly legal, done in many municipalities around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7712.103s">And</a>  there are legal, we can create legal methods to have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7716.565s">people</a>  register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7717.946s">Now</a>  that answers the question of, you know, when you have these already, you have these landlords that aren't responding yet, how can we expect them to participate, we can use legal methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7728.891s">Now</a>  the last, I think the last bucket is less about the policy itself, and more about this idea of listening and sympathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7736.134s">And</a>  I actually do have sympathy for landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7738.035s">I</a>  mean, I close family members who are small landlords, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7742.077s">And</a>  when I put myself in their shoes, I want them to know about the rebates and the tax credits they can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7747.638s">And</a>  that's something that, given how they're registered on the tax bill right now, the city doesn't know that they're landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7754.459s">And</a>  they don't have a problem with the city knowing that they're a landlord, but because the city doesn't know that they're a landlord, they can't get that information about rebates and tax credits and subsidies. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7764.701s">And</a>  so I think for that reason, I would move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7767.481s">For</a>  all those reasons, I would move the question.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7770.882s">On</a>  the motion of councilor second refers the committee on planning and permitting seconded by seconded by council vice president cons Councilor Leming just Councilor Leming</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7781.308s">Just</a>  on another one of the points that was sort of brought up and some of the public discussion I would like to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7789.692s">We'll</a>  just talk a little bit about the back end of some of this stuff I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7794.754s">I</a>  know that people do tend to send a lot of emails to council members sometimes they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7801.417s">Sometimes</a>  I'm not able to reply to all of them, especially if they're on some of these <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7805.018s">hot</a>  button issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7806.739s">Some</a>  of them slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7808.34s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7809.781s">I've,</a>  excuse me, I've had, I had one experience recently in an email where a woman sent us an email about the transfer fee, and I asked if she wanted to talk on the phone about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7824.861s">You</a>  know, just I've never met her before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7826.642s">I</a>  didn't even know what she looked like, but I wanted to talk with her on the phone about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7830.845s">And</a>  she refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7832.627s">I</a>  don't know how to build bridges in a community when people refuse to even talk to me.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.28s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.941s">What</a>  I'm thinking, some of the things my fellow councils aren't understanding is <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7881.001s">The</a>  dialogue that started in January and the presentations that we've been putting forward is dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7890.663s">And</a>  what you're not listening, what you're not understanding is you have to win the trust of people for them to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7898.965s">Let</a>  me give you some hints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7903.626s">When</a>  my fellow Councilors mentioned that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7906.786s">There's</a>  7,500 people voted for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7909.368s">So</a>  that's what they're gonna support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7911.59s">That's</a>  wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7912.951s">The</a>  7,500 people, they got you elected, but you have to work for 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7919.477s">And</a>  so the dialogue that has been going on since we started here, and it's gonna continue with the next resolution, is that we're hurting our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7932.127s">We're</a>  dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7934.511s">Our</a>  city isn't good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7936.533s">Our</a>  city is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7938.995s">And</a>  the dialogue that we're spending is attacking who? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7942.578s">Homeowners.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7944.74s">Everything</a>  we've done so far, nothing of substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7948.203s">We</a>  could talk about having subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7950.385s">We</a>  could talk about all these meetings we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7952.527s">We've</a>  got nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7953.448s">We've</a>  had nothing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7955.683s">So</a>  I think what we're not understanding is what people are saying, maybe because they can't talk to me, maybe because people are reaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7961.184s">And</a>  here's the thing, it's now by the hundreds, and it's people that normally don't come to this podium, you see them tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7969.926s">Whatever</a>  you're trying to do, whatever agenda you're trying to pull out, you're hurting people, you're dividing the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7978.187s">And</a>  it's gonna go on, with everything else that we have tonight, we're gonna see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7983.956s">You're</a>  trying to justify, I respect you more than anything in the world, all of you, but you're trying to justify things, but you're not looking at the human factor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7993.201s">People</a>  aren't talking to you, because people don't trust you, Councilor Lemmie. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7997.423s">You</a>  haven't earned it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8007.991s">What</a>  I'm hearing is, what I'm hearing from a lot of people, I'm hearing a lot of hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8013.881s">People</a>  are hurting because you're attacking them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8018.564s">So</a>  what have we been talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8021.686s">What</a>  is it we've been working on? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8023.307s">What</a>  is the lesson so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8024.747s">We've</a>  talked about rent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8026.388s">We've</a>  talked about a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8027.929s">We've</a>  talked about a registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8030.19s">We've</a>  talked about how the firefighters are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8032.852s">We've</a>  done nothing yet for what the city needs, and the mayor's loving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8037.795s">The</a>  mayor has done nothing for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8040.296s">We're</a>  five years into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8043.035s">And</a>  no matter what happens, this council, I've been around the council 18 years now, whether it's school committee, city council, we've made sure we've at least been the voice so people can, they can come and talk to us because no one's listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8058.219s">That's</a>  what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8060.34s">That's</a>  what everybody's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8061.42s">The</a>  undertone here, is it really about a registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8065.462s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8067.406s">Please,</a>  it gets out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8070.548s">Listen,</a>  I don't like the fact that people yell out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8073.57s">I</a>  think it's just a poor way to get things through. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8076.272s">But</a>  here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8077.973s">Right</a>  now, that's how they feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8079.253s">They're</a>  angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8083.136s">And</a>  maybe some of you don't know, because I don't want to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8085.897s">It</a>  doesn't matter if you lived here a day or 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8088.599s">I</a>  hate to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8090.606s">Because</a>  everybody, everybody's a method Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8092.847s">Everybody's</a>  a family in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8094.688s">But</a>  right now we're doing nothing but dividing, trying to find a way to deceive and divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8101.311s">You</a>  don't even see it, but it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8102.832s">She's</a>  usually as a marionette. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8104.373s">She's</a>  like with puppets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8107.414s">With</a>  everything's going on in the city, the city's a mess and people aren't happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8110.336s">And</a>  we're talking about registries. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8113.217s">This</a>  is what we're saying, people are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8115.999s">This</a>  Mia doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8117.419s">And</a>  she's using us as pawns. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8123.137s">So</a>  believe me, publicly, I'm going to tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8128.56s">I</a>  despise the fact that it's George Scarpelli against the rest of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8133.903s">I</a>  hate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8134.803s">I</a>  don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8136.464s">I</a>  want the seven of us to do great things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8139.426s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8141.066s">And</a>  we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8142.631s">No,</a>  people can talk negatively about you, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8145.473s">We</a>  have done some great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8147.355s">We</a>  have done some great things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8149.596s">But</a>  it's all being overshadowed now by dividing, picking and choosing my group and your group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8156.462s">And</a>  things are going to come out tonight that's going to prove to that it's going to show to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8160.545s">Look</a>  what she's done to the fighting department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8162.647s">Look</a>  what she's done to this council with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8165.472s">So</a>  again, this is just another piece that's dividing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8169.493s">And</a>  Councilor Leming, you're an educated person, you're involved, appreciate that you ran, but you have to understand, people here are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8180.375s">This</a>  city is hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8181.295s">This</a>  city, whether you wanna believe it or not, is divided more than I've ever seen in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8186.035s">And</a>  we could put a dog and pony show and put lipstick on a pig, and we could do little parades and think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8191.916s">It's</a>  not hitting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8193.377s">We</a>  represent everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8196.001s">whether</a>  you like me or not, I'm still gonna fight for people that don't like me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8202.907s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8207.331s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8214.857s">I</a>  hear everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8219.021s">And</a>  I think what I'm struggling with is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8224.702s">My</a>  understanding of how we work on policies is we bring a suggestion for something that we might pass in a year or two years or six months or whatever, we bring it here to get it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8240.436s">Now,</a>  any policy, whatever policy that is, it is by definition, it is not totally worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8250.043s">Not</a>  all of the answers are there, because this is how we create policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8255.264s">We</a>  create policy by giving it a number, and then by sending it through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8259.466s">And</a>  that process, and tell me if I'm wrong, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8263.547s">That</a>  process involves three public hearings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8267.908s">It</a>  has to go through first reading, second reading, third, something like that, after it's been written.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8273.633s">after</a>  all the committee meetings.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8274.854s">After</a>  all of the committee meetings, it involves three times that it has to appear before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8280.677s">And</a>  that's when the answer, when all of the questions, when it's been worked through with the staff, with, you know, in committee with the public, with, you know, whatever sort of listening sessions and other things that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8295.104s">So</a>  what I'm struggling with is, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8298.206s">You</a>  know, we're bringing things here to give it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8303.188s">And</a>  what that does is it allows us to then begin the process of discussing it publicly where everyone is welcome for many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8312.993s">And</a>  I think for the, like the leaf blower ordinance, we had eight or nine, was it nine public meetings about it?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8321.317s">Leaf</a>  blower was five, budget was seven.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8324.844s">I</a>  thought that we had the eighth leaf blower like public swap but we had a lot of meetings.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8329.928s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8330.608s">So,</a>  I think what I'm trying to say is, this is the second time since I've been a city council which is like three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8340.97s">people</a>  come, dozens of people come to the meeting to prevent us from ever being able to discuss a policy and we're being accused of not knowing all of the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8354.381s">Well,</a>  the reason that we have this process is so that we can include the public in the entire discussion of every aspect of it and every detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8365.109s">So</a>  what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8370.06s">And</a>  I will say, I'm saddened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8372.941s">I'm</a>  very saddened that I now seem to be on the receiving end of something where, specifically for in-town landlords, I have for years talked about how in-town landlords are the people that we want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8393.071s">And</a>  there's video of me from years ago <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8397.89s">So,</a>  like, this is, I just want to know we're coming up on the 15 minute limit for the previous question today, you have about a minute, then I want to go a minute but that's what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the conversation, so that we can talk about it for many months in open public committee meetings, and then we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8416.795s">the</a>  three public hearings in the city council, all of which are designed to answer those detailed questions and for you to have input on those answers, those questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8426.781s">So</a>  that's what I'm struggling to get to is the point where we can actually discuss this rather than having it shut down before anyone is allowed to discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8435.947s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8437.267s">So</a>  we're at about two minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8439.068s">It's</a>  by the City Council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8440.368s">There's</a>  15 minutes to debate the call for the previous question of Councilor Tseng, and the discussion remains to Councilors only. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8446.529s">So</a>  we have one minute left on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8447.669s">Are</a>  there any other Councilors who'd like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8450.07s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8452.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8457.231s">Vice</a>  President Collins, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8458.512s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8459.512s">Thank</a>  you for letting me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8462.873s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion from my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8465.254s">I</a>  appreciate everybody who's come to the podium to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8467.754s">I</a>  am aware that hearing people tonight, people feel like they're not being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8474.316s">I'm</a>  also aware that there's probably not a lot that I can say that people believe, such as when I say that everything that people have spoken to, I'm listening to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8484.199s">I</a>  won't speak for my fellow Councilors, but I know it's true for them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8487.159s">We're</a>  listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8488.48s">I'm</a>  taking notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8490.438s">We</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8491.698s">I'll</a>  echo what Councilor Callahan said. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8493.419s">I</a>  think that engaging in every part of this process is important, taking note of things that really concern people with this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8501.36s">For</a>  example, people are wondering, does this include compromising information? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8505.661s">I</a>  don't think it does, but I think that's something for us to talk about in committee and make crystal clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8509.681s">People</a>  are saying, why is this necessary when I know that you have info about property owners already?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8514.842s">I</a>  think that's- I think Councilor Collins, you have about 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8516.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8517.523s">I</a>  think that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8518.843s">I</a>  think that's a great question and we should look at okay, what really needs to be added to augment already already have, I think the most salient thing for me, all the folks in this room that are property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8530.41s">I</a>  think Councilor Callahan made it really clear at the beginning, that's not who we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8534.633s">people</a>  said, we know that there are property owners in this community that are hurting neighbors as well as tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8540.915s">They're</a>  not the folks who are here talking about how much work they're putting into their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8544.556s">Those</a>  are the folks that we can't reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8546.257s">And</a>  those are the folks that we need to be able to reach that we make sure that they are contributing to the community the way that all of you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8553.679s">I</a>  think this is, I know we're coming up on my time limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8556.38s">That's</a>  why I think this is worth considering further so that we can get into the concerns that were raised tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8563.749s">and</a>  elucidate them and get that clarity and have those discussions with everybody who we already know is interested in this conversation and all the people that we didn't hear from tonight, because those perspectives need to be- Thank you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8573.796s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8574.536s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to call the previous question and debate and move to a final vote, seconded by Council Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8582.662s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8586.524s">This</a>  is to end debate for previous question.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.349s">Councilor</a>  Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.829s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8590.21s">This</a>  is a thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8591.43s">It's</a>  the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8591.911s">He</a>  called the question and that were initiates a period of 15 minutes of debate among the council, after which by majority vote, we will move to a final vote.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8778.647s">I</a>  am on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8779.468s">You</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8780.168s">I</a>  will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8784.272s">Oh,</a>  I'm not on Zoom anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8786.414s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8788.616s">Sorry,</a>  I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8790.537s">Nevermind.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8791.478s">I</a>  think Councilor Leming might have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8792.719s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8795.021s">Okay,</a>  well, we'll share it in a second.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8797.543s">There's</a>  an attachment to... Please take your conversations outside if you're gonna have private conversations in the chamber.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8804.462s">There's</a>  an attachment to this rule change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8805.963s">So</a>  I appreciate president bears reading the original rule because the thing that we changed is that we just changed the first sentence from five minutes to two minutes and added a sentence saying public participation shall not exceed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8823.893s">If</a>  folks could take their private conversations out into the, into the rotunda, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8835.575s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Zari. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8836.321s">You</a>  may continue.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8838.066s">public</a>  participation shall not exceed 90 minutes per agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8841.127s">So</a>  during a single meeting, and we added additionally that interested parties can also contribute written comment on agenda items via an online form, which would mean that we would have to create that, that would imply that we would be adding that to our, the way that we, our methods of communication with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8861.651s">And</a>  a paper form in the office of the city clerk would also be, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8867.012s">something</a>  that we would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8869.573s">There's</a>  been a spill in the chambers, so I'm distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8874.374s">So</a>  there are a lot of ways that people can contact the City Council right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8878.495s">This</a>  is not a strategy to limit public participation so much as it's a way for us to carry on the business of the City Council, hear from people in a way that does not <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8894.72s">That</a>  is more efficient, more democratic and allows more people to feel comfortable speaking with city Councilors and making sure their voices are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8905.389s">Something</a>  I wanted to mention at the beginning of my remarks is that the, the way that we operate in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8912.034s">as</a>  a city council is that we're representative democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8915.616s">Like</a>  we got voted in and we're supposed to be debating amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8918.817s">We're</a>  never meant to be debating with the public because we would never have time to debate with every resident in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8925.219s">There</a>  just isn't time for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8927.3s">We're</a>  not supposed to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8928.621s">We're</a>  supposed to hear a specific period of time of public comment, and then we are supposed to debate together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8936.844s">we're</a>  going to have to come to an agreement amongst ourselves and then land on a conclusion and take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8942.327s">So,</a>  uh, this the goal of this resolution is to get us closer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8947.35s">The</a>  reason I have this pulled up is because, uh, we did some research and we pulled up the cities surrounding our region <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8965.293s">One</a>  of the most permissive of the area for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8970.517s">Many</a>  cities just have one section when I say public comment I mean that's one section of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8977.242s">We</a>  would have an opportunity for the public to speak after every agenda item which only one other city has, which is revere and. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8986.638s">says</a>  a few minutes, it's like one to two minutes in the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8990.32s">But</a>  other all the other cities have one city, you have to be sponsored, many, you have to sign up in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8997.183s">So</a>  if something triggers you that you're sitting in the chambers, and you say, Oh, that's interesting, I would want to speak on that you and you stand up and you say, No, you can't you have to sign up by like the Friday beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9011.407s">and</a>  have prepared remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9013.129s">So</a>  a lot of that stuff is very different in Medford and that's something we don't want to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9018.514s">That's</a>  important to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9020.055s">And</a>  the other thing to keep in mind is that there are opportunities to communicate with city councilors and integrate opinions of the public prior to city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9036.246s">that</a>  I think are more effective at getting messages across that are not included in public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9045.028s">For</a>  instance, I actually would like to make a motion to amend this resolution to be three minutes instead of two minutes based on feedback that I've received.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9054.191s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9057.312s">And</a>  that's all I have to say for now, but I appreciate the support of Councilor Leming and Councilor Tseng as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9063.453s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9064.534s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9067.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9067.774s">So</a>  my reason for co sponsoring this is really just I mean, it's pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9072.778s">We've</a>  had a couple of meetings that have gone on till very late this term, it seems to be a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9079.803s">Last</a>  time on March 12, a lot of people who came up for public comment were saying rightfully so that they didn't want to have to wait so long to offer their public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9091.053s">Even</a>  now, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9092.874s">and</a>  a half hours into the meeting that we're that we're discussing this, and I would personally favor, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9101.201s">More</a>  efficient meetings to accommodate these agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9108.287s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9110.469s">And</a>  I look forward to continue to listen to continue</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9122.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9122.473s">Um,</a>  I really want to highlight again that there are three changes with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9128.098s">The</a>  first one is the switch to a three minute speaking period per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9134.964s">As</a>  you've amended on the floor, the resolution says two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9140.949s">We've</a>  heard feedback from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9142.591s">There's</a>  been extensive discussions about what is an appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9146.694s">And</a>  a lot of folks who have asked us, reached out to us and contacted us to ask us to consider lengthening it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9154.201s">And</a>  so I'm very happy that you've been open to changing it to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9159.565s">I</a>  think the second change is the 90 minute upper limit, which you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9164.689s">And</a>  the third change is creating a new channel for people to get their records entered into the public, the formal record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9172.835s">And</a>  so I think a lot of folks don't realize what they call us or email us before a meeting that's not entered into the official record on something, but unless they ask us to read that into record or enter that into the record, this would create an easier mechanism <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9187.606s">both</a>  in person and online to enter their comments into the formal record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9194.472s">And</a>  so we're creating an online form and an in-person form to be put into the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9202.279s">I</a>  think this idea of new channels is really important because it goes to the idea of restructuring. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9209.025s">There</a>  are some things that won't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9210.726s">We</a>  will still have the general public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9213.288s">We</a>  would still have the general public participation section at the end of the meetings where folks are free to say whatever they want and free to speak for the times they desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9229.815s">But</a>  we also recognize the need to restructure because of the need to democratize the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9235.758s">Now,</a>  I've done quite a lot of work for a professor at the Kennedy School who's working on democratizing local government and state governments and working on ideas of how to restructure public participation processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9252.708s">There's</a>  been a lot of formal critiques and research out there that shows that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9257.31s">The</a>  way that public participation is done, especially in Massachusetts, there's a very lengthy thesis about this, a very lengthy published paper from Harvard Law and from the American Bar Association that shows that how public participation is often done in Massachusetts disadvantages those who support ideas, who support the ideas put on the agenda, disadvantages those who aren't able to make a meeting time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9281.907s">who</a>  aren't able to come to a 7pm meeting on a Tuesday because they might be working or they need to wake up early, they have children to take care of and they can't participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9293.053s">The</a>  way that it's done right now also disadvantages folks who want to speak on an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9298.496s">but</a>  don't feel like they're empowered to because many folks in the room might oppose their viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9306.7s">Leading</a>  actually, in fact, to a limitation of their First Amendment right to free speech because it <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9312.88s">it</a>  limits their ability to speak up without feeling threatened by a member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9322.466s">We're</a>  empowered by numerous federal court cases to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9327.349s">The</a>  Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges versus Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9331.712s">There's</a>  a Chesterfield City Planning Commission court case as well, where the courts actually ask <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9338.416s">Um,</a>  and I would urge, um, city <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9343.926s">to</a>  be wise in designing their public participation processes and empower the city to do that and ask us to create alternative channels, which we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9354.472s">And</a>  I forgot to mention one really important alternative channel that we are creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9360.055s">Councilor</a>  Callahan and Lazzaro and I have been working on a resolution on this agenda to create listening sessions for the city council through the public engagement committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9370.76s">And</a>  so what we're saying is you can still speak up about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9375.203s">You</a>  can still get your comment entered on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9377.784s">We're</a>  going to restructure how that's done so that other folks who want to speak on an item can speak, and they don't have to wait till too too late in the night to speak.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9388.151s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9390.913s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9392.393s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9397.077s">I</a>  appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9399.538s">I</a>  also appreciate the motion on the floor to amend it from two minutes to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9402.959s">I</a>  think that's welcome change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9404.3s">Two</a>  minutes feels a bit too much of a cut right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9408.341s">I</a>  think three minutes is more reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9410.562s">I</a>  think that for myself is supportable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9413.163s">My</a>  reasons are the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9415.143s">I</a>  think that this is a tweak that will <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9418.113s">help</a>  more people to participate in our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9420.835s">I</a>  can hear the response in my head and also slightly from the chambers of another way of looking at this, which is, you know, gosh, those jerks are really tired of long meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9431.844s">We</a>  know the job that we signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9433.185s">Sorry,</a>  I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9434.567s">I</a>  know the job that I signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9436.188s">We</a>  have a lot of long nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9437.989s">I</a>  know how to prep for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9439.33s">I</a>  drink coffee in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9440.431s">I</a>  eat before the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9441.732s">I'm</a>  paid to listen to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9442.953s">I'm</a>  gonna do that if we have to be here till 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9445.035s">every</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9446.076s">That's</a>  the job, committed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9447.776s">What</a>  I think is not okay is we're experiencing a tension between wanting to optimize for the number for people being able to speak at the length that they choose and wanting to make it possible for more people to speak at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9462.365s">And</a>  I think for a lot of meetings in a row, we've experienced people not being able to say their piece, people showing up and tending to speak and having to leave early because they have to get up for work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9471.23s">They</a>  have to go put their child to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9473.3s">any</a>  other reason, they can't stay up until midnight with us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9476.762s">I</a>  just saw it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9477.582s">I</a>  know there are some folks here to speak on a later resolution who said, I could speak if it comes up before 9.30, it's 9.40, they can't be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9486.567s">And</a>  I think that that is, I think that that leaves people out of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9490.549s">I</a>  think that this is a way that we can make a small tweak to finesse this one avenue for participation that could have the result of allowing more people to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9502.679s">concurrently,</a>  I think that we can always do a better job of publicizing the various ways, other ways that residents can let their feelings be known with Councilors, which as Councilor Tseng noted, we still have the public participation section at the end of every agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9517.25s">Our</a>  information is public on the city website all the time, and I'm always really grateful to people who make use of that and always encourage more people to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9525.597s">People</a>  can submit comments to the president, to the city clerk to have them entered into the minutes or to be read aloud into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9533.375s">I</a>  also do want to note that like all of our other rules that are governing this body, this is enforced at the discretion of the chair, whoever that may be, which gives us the option to make exceptions where the need arises or where the space arises. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9547.825s">For</a>  example, when we have a short agenda and aren't under time pressures, we can give everybody a little bit more breathing room in the event of, you know, I've heard from other communities, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9559.497s">using</a>  that discretion to allow more time for people with speech disabilities who do need more time to say their piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9565.139s">And</a>  I think this gives us a tool to allow more people to come to the podium, if that's the avenue that they want to share their feelings with the council, while still giving us the flexibility and doubling down on our other ways for having residents communicate with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9579.805s">So</a>  I'll support the motion to move this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9583.927s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9585.347s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9587.728s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9589.687s">Wow.</a> </p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9626.677s">You've</a>  eliminated people, they've walked away. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9629.038s">Parents</a>  have left the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9631.359s">There's</a>  no voice there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9634.04s">You're</a>  saying this isn't limiting? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9635.341s">The</a>  more people are gonna talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9638.803s">You</a>  just saw what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9640.723s">Whether</a>  they liked it or not, they expressed themselves and people left. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9644.725s">At</a>  least they left fulfilled that they had a place to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9649.295s">but</a>  now we're gonna implement the three minute time limit and the 90 minute hired stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9656.139s">Come</a>  on, it's embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9660.481s">We</a>  were elected for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9662.642s">We're</a>  like for the people of city of Medford, just cause it's inconvenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9665.924s">You</a>  can make, you can say anything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9667.945s">A</a>  listening group, this is a listening group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9670.887s">We</a>  don't have to invent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9672.788s">This</a>  is a listening group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9674.869s">So</a>  you wanna talk about different, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9678.527s">You</a>  want to talk about different, we have so many other meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9681.329s">You've</a>  been to these subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9683.43s">It's</a>  packed, right?

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9731.62s">Let</a>  them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9733.142s">This</a>  is their forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9736.484s">They</a>  didn't make the choice to only go once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9739.719s">once,</a>  twice a month, that was this council's choice, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9745.901s">So</a>  when you put things up there, be honest, because those communities, they meet every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9752.063s">They</a>  have a forum every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9755.504s">All</a>  we did tonight, after you vote this in tonight, all you've done again is devalue what people want and what people are about in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9766.527s">So</a>  people reached out, told you three minutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9769.906s">I</a>  get 1,000 phone calls, people are disgusted about this, and they're not coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9774.33s">You're</a>  forcing them not to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9775.811s">Maybe</a>  that's what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9776.831s">You</a>  say that's not what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9780.534s">But</a>  that's exactly what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9785.338s">I'm</a>  disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9786.039s">It's</a>  the first time I feel ashamed of being part of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9790.002s">You're</a>  shutting people up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9792.584s">You're</a>  dismissing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9796.24s">You're</a>  going to keep coming back and forth with resolutions that you're putting forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9799.482s">And</a>  that's not business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9800.803s">That's</a>  your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9801.743s">That's</a>  your agenda business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9804.005s">Our</a>  city is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9805.025s">And</a>  I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9806.466s">We've</a>  done nothing to conquer anything in this community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9810.749s">We're</a>  going to go to budget season with the mayor that's dictated what's going on and what we're going to do with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9816.552s">And</a>  we don't even know what we're doing with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9819.434s">But</a>  I'm glad you put this working group together that was hidden. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9822.275s">I</a>  didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9828.203s">This</a>  is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9830.744s">Every</a>  single resolution's coming forward now is hurting people and dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9837.647s">I</a>  can only sit back and talk to people and say, hey, listen, these are good people, which you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9843.449s">They're</a>  my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9847.871s">So</a>  don't tell me you all haven't talked about it because you have, not illegally, but you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9853.666s">I</a>  haven't talked to the mayor about any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9855.126s">It's</a>  the first time I've heard every resolution you people are putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9859.767s">And</a>  it's doing nothing but dividing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9863.088s">So</a>  like I said, you can spin it any way you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9866.309s">The</a>  bottom line is people are gonna speak less time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9870.249s">People</a>  can only talk for 90 minutes instead of when they feel like they're content and they can walk away and go to sleep at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9881.452s">And</a>  for what, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9884.457s">All</a>  you're doing is hurting the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9887.321s">Keep</a>  following the mayor, you're hurting the city.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9898.045s">Oh,</a>  so I was, I'm not actually in favor of reducing the amount of time that people, so I would have done this differently, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9908.392s">I</a>  do think that having, and I've looked at some other cities, I have to say, I am so happy that we do something that I have not seen really anywhere else, I guess maybe Revere does it, but that we let people speak on every single agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9922.765s">Most</a>  cities, there's one public comment period that applies to like anything that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9929.748s">You</a>  have your two minutes during that public comment period and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9933.829s">And</a>  you don't get to be there when they're debating the whole rest of, while they're debating the body is debating that particular agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9940.812s">So</a>  I love that we do that and I think that we should keep that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9943.673s">I'm</a>  glad this doesn't in any way get rid of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9947.515s">I</a>  do think that meetings that go to one, two, three o'clock in the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9951.94s">the</a>  poor people who have to speak on a topic that doesn't come up until after midnight, like that's also, that's just not good democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9963.73s">The</a>  way I would have done it, and I don't know how much people are open to changes on the floor, but I think that we should have a limit on the end time of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9978.522s">And</a>  if we limit the end time of the meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9982.037s">So</a>  that nobody has to stay up until you know one o'clock in the morning to be heard on their on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9989.713s">Then,</a>  allowing the chair, which I think we already have as an option to before any public participation to declare hey like there's 100 people in the room for this item, we're going to leave it to and we and this is currently our policy anyway that we have done for this item, we're going to have two minutes per issue we did that you know a number of weeks ago for a different issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10014.153s">And</a>  that the chair can do that in order to meet the deadline of the midnight 1231 o'clock whatever it is that we decide is the final hour that this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10023.782s">that</a>  the city council meetings end on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10026.064s">So</a>  that's where I would go with it is have like a meeting end time so that nobody has to stay up till one o'clock in the morning just to speak on their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10035.189s">The</a>  other possibility is to let public comment happen at the beginning and then have it apply to all of the agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10041.172s">That's</a>  very common. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10042.853s">And</a>  then nobody, no members of the public have to stay until midnight, one o'clock in the morning in order to speak on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10052.261s">So</a>  I think there are other ways to go that would let people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10061.471s">I'm</a>  just not sure that this is the one that I, I'm not sure that I love this one.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10147.997s">And</a>  I didn't come up and say that certain people should be allowed to make decisions and other people shouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10152.179s">And</a>  I certainly didn't say that when people are elected to public office, that they should be forced and required and demanded to have the legitimacy of our government disrespected on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10167.347s">Now,</a>  when we talk about what this council has been doing for three months now, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10172.81s">We</a>  put forth a governing agenda in a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10175.631s">No</a>  council has ever done that before in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10178.052s">We</a>  put every item we wanted to work on for the next two years in that document and made it public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10181.794s">We</a>  talked about it at multiple meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10183.975s">We</a>  announced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10185.536s">We</a>  said, here's everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10186.516s">What</a>  was in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10187.056s">A</a>  rental registry was in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10189.215s">rent</a>  stabilization was in that transfer fee was in that prop two and a half was in that a new Medford High School was in that fixing the roads and sidewalks was in that everything that everyone has talked about tonight that we want to do was in that document and it passed this body unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10203.5s">And</a>  it was put out publicly I will speak Thank you and you can wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10208.394s">I'm</a>  not being rude, you're being rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10209.895s">You</a>  need to have basic respect and decency for your government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10214.379s">These</a>  people were elected, me and these six people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10217.422s">You</a>  don't see me sitting here and saying, George, shut up, and allowing people to yell. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10221.825s">Yes,</a>  please wait, thank you, please wait, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10225.028s">Now,</a>  we did that, never been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10227.951s">We</a>  said what we wanted to do, and that's after we've campaigned and we've talked to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10234.176s">We</a>  disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10236.363s">We</a>  could sit here for three days and never take a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10241.264s">And</a>  at the end of that, we could hear from everybody 50 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10244.705s">There</a>  are things we are going to disagree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10248.106s">That</a>  is what living in a society means. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10251.767s">And</a>  the way that we work through those disagreements is the democratic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10256.229s">We</a>  have a democratic process in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10258.669s">It's</a>  called an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10260.53s">People</a>  won an election and those people are doing what they believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10265.271s">I'm</a>  one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10266.472s">I</a>  know there are people who won an election in this room who disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10270.374s">And</a>  they say on some things, I don't know, maybe not all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10274.896s">We've</a>  disagreed at the podium before, I'll at least say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10277.337s">And</a>  George and I have had many a disagreement in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10280.278s">I</a>  hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10282.279s">I</a>  listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10282.92s">I</a>  try to take it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10284.02s">Sometimes</a>  I change what I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10285.441s">Sometimes</a>  I make an amendment to my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10287.802s">Sometimes</a>  we find a different answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10289.863s">Sometimes</a>  we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10291.758s">We</a>  were on the opposite ends of this for two years, where I was on the end of a lot of 5-2 votes, where I lost, and I didn't go out at the end of the day and say, oh, these people, they're bad Councilors, and I don't like serving with them, and I don't think they're my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10305.149s">How</a>  many times have I gone and defended George or Rick or John or Adam to people who think they're the worst person in the world? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10312.414s">And</a>  I say, no, I sat next to them, and they have their best intents at heart, and so do I. And sometimes we disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10320.922s">There</a>  are rules in place to allow the public business to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10324.664s">There</a>  are state laws that govern this process their city council rules, and quite frankly, cancer Collins is right, unless this council chooses, they want to remove me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10334.696s">State</a>  law gives me, as the chair of this body and the chair of the meeting, the ultimate authority on any public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10341.999s">If</a>  I really wanted to silence everybody, I could stand there and bully my minions, as people think they are, and say, I'll stand here and public participation's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10351.902s">And</a>  you vote me out of this chair if you don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10355.031s">And</a>  you know, my minions will do it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10356.932s">Because</a>  they just think the way that I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10359.154s">And</a>  everything I say, we sit here and we put our minds into telepathy and we connect us, the six of us, and we all vote the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10366.939s">We</a>  all believe the same thing because it's a cult of personality. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10371.283s">And</a>  that's what happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10373.244s">I</a>  could do that if I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10375.926s">I</a>  don't do that because I value the public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10379.268s">I</a>  may not support this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10381.89s">You</a>  don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10383.769s">What</a>  I can tell you is that in 2022, 6-0, the council voted on a final rules package that reduced public participation from 10 minutes to five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10395.354s">And</a>  where was the outrage in 2022 when this council reduced from 10 to five, and now we wanna go from five to three? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10400.936s">Because</a>  a lot of people wanna talk, and a lot of people get in touch with me and say, I'm not coming to a meeting, I can't wait till 10 p.m., I got things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10408.199s">There's</a>  a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10411.04s">Just</a>  because you show up here in this room, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10413.837s">even</a>  if it's 100 to one, it doesn't mean that you're representing all the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10418.981s">It</a>  just doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10421.823s">There</a>  was a night proposal in 2022 to create a public forum that's mentioned here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10427.387s">Some</a>  other cities and towns do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10428.568s">We</a>  didn't vote for it at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10430.229s">The</a>  more I think about it, the more I think it might be the fairest way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10432.991s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10434.032s">I</a>  like the idea of Councilor Callahan to entertain alternatives, but I'm also gonna respect if there's a vote tonight that I'm on the wrong end of, I lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10442.895s">Am</a>  I gonna get furious? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10443.836s">Am</a>  I gonna scream? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10444.536s">Am</a>  I gonna shout? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10445.197s">Am</a>  I gonna say that we should storm the castle and take the back of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10450.762s">And</a>  these people are just, where did they come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10454.304s">And</a>  they don't care about Medford, they don't love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10458.688s">We</a>  agree to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10461.35s">And</a>  what people call division is disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10465.354s">We</a>  can listen, we can hear, we can sit there for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10469.574s">And</a>  at the end of it, I know we've all experienced it in our families, with our friends, with our colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10476.138s">We</a>  may not agree at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10478.239s">What's</a>  important is that we respect the systems and structures that we have created to work through the difficulties of these decisions, the democratic process, the elections of representatives to take votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10490.936s">That</a>  is how this process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10492.998s">If</a>  you want to change that process, run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10496.12s">If</a>  you want to change that process, go tell the Charter Committee to change the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10500.443s">If</a>  you want to change that process, there are myriad ways to petition your government for the redress of your grievances, but it does not entitle anyone, anyone to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10511.164s">say</a>  that I can talk for as much as I want, and I can say whatever I want, and that I shouldn't have to respect, because it's actually the disrespect of the people and the institution that degrades community trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10523.349s">So</a>  when we can't talk to each other across our divisions and differences, there are plenty of people who I've talked to on the phone for an hour, and we were no closer at the end of that hour than we were at the beginning, and they said, you didn't hear me, you didn't listen to me, but I'll talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10537.924s">It</a>  doesn't mean I'm going to change my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10539.429s">And</a>  there's a lot of people in this room I don't think I'm ever going to get to agree with everything I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10542.879s">And</a>  I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10544.957s">But</a>  that's what this process is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10547.138s">And</a>  at the end of the day, maybe this isn't the right approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10550.381s">Maybe</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10551.141s">We'll</a>  see how I vote at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10553.483s">But</a>  that's the vision of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10555.564s">We</a>  are being as transparent as we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10558.446s">We</a>  are entertaining and engaging with residents in myriad ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10562.048s">We</a>  are having these public comment sessions on our issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10565.831s">The</a>  way that every legislative body in the history of the world works is that a proposal is initiated, it's sent to committee, and we have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10573.922s">We</a>  have a lot of people online said, hey, we should just have one topic meetings when there's a lot of people who are interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10578.669s">There</a>  are, they're called committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10580.712s">When</a>  this goes to committee, when what just went to committee rental registry, we'll have a meeting on the rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10585.54s">We'll</a>  have another four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10587.537s">and</a>  we'll talk about it, and maybe we'll disagree, and maybe at the end of this two years, so many people will disagree with six of us, that three of us will lose, and three more people will come on, and they'll repeal what we did, or they'll try, and I welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10599.962s">That</a>  is what democracy is, and I invite anyone to participate in good faith in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10605.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10610.327s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cassidy.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10612.808s">Any</a>  further comment from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10616.37s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10618.561s">I</a>  just want to be slightly more clear than what I said before, which is I would actually really like to discuss this, to be able to come up with some other ideas in committee rather than voting on this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10632.216s">So</a>  that'd be my preference.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10636.461s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10636.881s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10638.063s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Clark]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10643.564s">Patrick</a>  Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10646.466s">I</a>  actually like this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10648.608s">I</a>  thank the Councilors that put it forward for putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10654.133s">But</a>  I also think it's half the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10655.934s">So</a>  I do think that people tend to, not everyone, but a lot of people tend to bloviate and they tend to like a gas fill whatever space is given to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10665.923s">And</a>  I think that Medford is going through a tough time of transition and transformation right now, and that we're pretty dysfunctional. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10674.751s">And</a>  so I do think that it is important to have some measures like this in place to, to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10683.584s">rain</a>  people in a bit and I think in a functional city, you have the public and the governing bodies, holding each other accountable, as well as having some degree of self regulation but you can always rely on the self regulation so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10699.111s">I</a>  like what was put forward, and I like that Councilor Callahan suggested some alternatives to it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10707.193s">The</a>  other half of this, though, is that I think that the council should potentially consider, and the committee's address is part of this, but putting maybe less agenda items per agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10718.396s">And</a>  then the second thing, and I've mentioned this before, is staying within the realm of local issues, because bringing in national and global issues as well <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10727.978s">a</a>  couple weeks back, Gaza and the embargo in Cuba, tonight talking about some of the big oil company issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10739.444s">Those</a>  might touch on local issues to some extent, but I think that it also massively extends the conversation beyond the local purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10750.689s">And</a>  we'll, as time goes on, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10756.092s">very</a>  much track, like even if everything that was talked about here was put into effect, I think that it would still extend the conversation into the hours of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10765.854s">So</a>  something that I've been focusing on on the side is just filling the communications and information void in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10774.175s">And</a>  if outside of council, some of the councillors wanted to talk to me on how to better reach the public in certain ways, I'd be open to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10782.617s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10785.981s">We're</a>  gonna go to Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Clark]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10786.441s">We're</a>  gonna go- And that was two and a half minutes, by the way.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10788.283s">You</a>  did great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10788.783s">I</a>  clocked it at 2.20. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10792.226s">We're</a>  gonna go to, and if folks, you can see, there's a little timer in the top right of the screen when I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10799.231s">Gonna</a>  go to Haley Carr on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10801.312s">You</a>  have five minutes, Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10802.773s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10806.876s">Haley</a>  Carr, 68 Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10811.616s">President</a>  Bears I've known you probably since the early 2000s, let's say when we were kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10818.685s">I</a>  never saw you being president of this council on my bingo card for any time soon, but I respect you for the position and it's definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10831.71s">a</a>  difficult one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10833.231s">However,</a>  I the reason why I hopped on to zoom tonight is because a few hours ago now my father spoke, who has been a citizen of the city for about 60 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10848.405s">And</a>  it seems like it's a common theme for many of you on council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10855.393s">to</a>  smirk or think that some of these citizens with real grievances based on the proposals that you're bringing forward aren't to be taken seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10869.923s">And</a>  I think that this agenda item just further serves that idea that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10878.402s">You</a>  want you say you want to listen to the public and you say you want to you know in return be respected by the public and and limit their Ability to come up and talk because it can get out of hand and what have you but it's a total total oxymoron and It just shows <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10898.433s">You</a>  know You just sat here and gave this this this long monologue, uh president bears and you said that you do have the ultimate authority and if you wanted to Exercise that authority you very well could and to me as a citizen a tax paying Citizen, I own property here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10920.463s">That</a>  sounds like a threat and I don't know why you think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10928.988s">Not</a>  a divide in this city and why? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10931.992s">You</a>  many of you can't fathom that so many people are outraged about the things that you're all proposing And the division really comes from the way that you and other council members and school committee members ran your election I've been involved <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10949.312s">In</a>  politics since I was seven years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10952.353s">I</a>  was holding signs for my grandfather. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10954.194s">I</a>  was Participating in the recount when he got in for his second term So I have a i've watched my father run campaigns over the years for certain individuals I have an idea of what i'm talking about And when I tell you i've never seen a campaign run the way that your our revolution our revolution group did this past election term <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10977.063s">Whatever</a>  you sent out a pamphlet of however many individuals telling people go out and vote for the we all have the same ideas This is what we stand for go out our resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10989.347s">We</a>  follow this national agenda and That's where the division stemmed from And it's great that you said that you passed some sort of agenda for the the next two years about the high school and the the roads and <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11005.812s">Medford</a>  Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11007.675s">I</a>  don't know why those issues weren't on the forefront of this year starting in January when you all took an oath and got sworn in again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11016.55s">I</a>  don't know why the first <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11019.175s">Things</a>  on the agenda had to be things that absolutely outrage majority of the citizens in medford and property owners And you're shocked that they're outraged I don't know why you didn't come out the gate with these ideas you have about a new high school about you know <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11039.972s">Medford</a>  square like somebody said medford square add a few more restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11044.214s">That's</a>  where you'll get taxed You have one minute i'm aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11047.416s">I</a>  can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11047.996s">Thank</a>  you And i'm just kind of perplexed that you're perplexed that you you can't see how hypocritical this whole thing has become and <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11061.482s">People</a>  don't trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11063.722s">There</a>  seems to be a lack of transparency when it comes to, Councilor Scarpelli said he's not even aware of some of these things that are being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11072.084s">You</a>  talk amongst yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11074.504s">And</a>  I just hope in the future, and I really hope that you can level with me, Councilor Bears and whoever else here, because I'm your age, and I hope you can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11083.886s">There</a>  has to be more trust, transparency, and the people need to feel like they're not being made <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11091.067s">fools</a>  when they come up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11093.809s">And</a>  that's my take on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11096.55s">And</a>  you can do with it what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11098.011s">And</a>  I know I'm up on my time, but I do appreciate all your services.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11103.835s">Thank</a>  you, Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11105.656s">I</a>  generally wouldn't respond, but since that was pretty much about me, I'll entertain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11111.54s">I'm</a>  not perplexed that people disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11113.601s">I</a>  know a lot of people disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11117.835s">Well,</a>  that whole thing was about me, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11119.776s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11120.157s">So</a>  I'm taking quite a personal privilege to respond to a resident.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11126.4s">Well,</a>  you did ask me to level with you, so I'm going to level with you, Haley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11130.842s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11133.144s">In</a>  any case, yeah, I'm not perplexed that there's disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11138.307s">There's</a>  been disagreement for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11140.488s">There</a>  was a Boston Globe article about people almost throwing chairs at each other across this <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11146.687s">this</a>  stage about 15 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11150.411s">And</a>  yeah, there's disagreement in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11152.934s">And</a>  you can call it division, you can call it whatever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11155.336s">I</a>  can't actually remember all the things you want me to respond to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11157.478s">I</a>  know there are people in this community who don't trust me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11160.922s">I</a>  respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11162.383s">That's</a>  their right not to trust me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11165.326s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11167.714s">I</a>  appreciate you bringing up the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11169.375s">Yes,</a>  there was an electoral process, a campaign was run. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11172.538s">Maybe</a>  it was new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11173.259s">Maybe</a>  it was innovative. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11174.58s">Maybe</a>  people hadn't seen it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11175.821s">It</a>  was successful and people were elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11178.103s">We</a>  have been highly transparent as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11181.226s">And</a>  to be honest, I do, after these meetings, think about all the times that I have not held my composure when I have responded or made a face or <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11189.973s">said</a>  something when something that I feel in my heart and in my mind, ridiculous was said, and I can't hold it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11196.838s">So</a>  I'm working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11198.719s">And</a>  I appreciate that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11201.461s">There</a>  are people here in this city who disagree with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11205.004s">That</a>  is what the democratic process is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11207.285s">I</a>  never expect to win everybody's vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11209.427s">I</a>  never expect to win anybody's trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11211.828s">Everybody's</a>  trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11213.77s">Anybody,</a>  any politician who says they do is lying to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11217.801s">So</a>  I'm going to continue to do what I think is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11220.743s">I'm</a>  going to continue to do what I think means representing the people of the city, not just the people who show up and speak in public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11228.986s">And</a>  that's what you're going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11231.447s">And</a>  it's what I've said on every mailer and in every video and every debate and every council meeting for the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11238.691s">And</a>  if I'm lucky, I'll be able to continue to do that for many years more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11244.113s">We'll</a>  go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11248.54s">Nicholas</a>  Jorleo, Forty Robinson wrote, I'm speaking tonight in opposition to this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11256.408s">There's</a>  talk of efficiency, there's talk of, this is about making the process more open to other people, so they don't have to wait, because maybe people have to go to work tomorrow, or there's other reasons why they don't want to stay the whole night and wait for their turn to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11270.077s">To</a>  me, though, I just don't buy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11271.778s">I</a>  really do think this is pretextual. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11273.479s">I</a>  really do think this is an attempt to limit democracy in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11278.722s">And</a>  it's very sad, it's very troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11281.504s">This</a>  is a public forum here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11282.905s">This</a>  body of elected officials is supposed to be accountable to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11288.628s">We</a>  should have an opportunity to stand up here and tell you what we think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11292.87s">Now</a>  reflected in the previous debate here on the registry resolution, it's very clear here that this council doesn't really want to listen to the popular will. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11302.756s">Every</a>  single person who spoke here tonight was opposed to the registry resolution and it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11309.44s">Aside</a>  from one councilor who had a change of conscience and another who was opposed from the beginning, the resolution passed without any sort of consideration of the public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11319.372s">And</a>  it really reflects how detached from reality the city council is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11324.358s">It's</a>  sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11326.152s">They're</a>  not reflecting the popular will here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11329.074s">I'm</a>  a person, I have to wake up at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11330.776s">to</a>  go to work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11332.097s">I</a>  don't wanna stay here all night to speak here for a few minutes about an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11336.72s">I</a>  wanna go to bed, I wanna go home, spend time with my family, relax, read a book, do something normal after work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11344.326s">But</a>  I wait, I wait my turn, I wait patiently, I stand up here, I speak, I say what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11348.83s">It's</a>  part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11351.274s">We</a>  can't be limiting public availability here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11354.075s">We</a>  can't be limiting public participation in debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11358.137s">This</a>  resolution is really, it's despicable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11360.498s">Mr.</a>  Scarpelli was exactly correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11362.679s">Thank</a>  you, I'm opposed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11364.54s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11365.021s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Maureen on Zoom, but before I do that, when we talk about popular will, 25 individuals spoke against the rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11374.125s">Thousands</a>  of people voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11375.345s">I</a>  think we have an honest disagreement about what the definition of popular will is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11380.202s">Maureen,</a>  we're gonna go to you on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11382.142s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11383.203s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11387.283s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11390.244s">With</a>  all due respect to the entire city council, I voted for three out of the seven of you, and I voted for those three individuals because I had trust that they were gonna represent the entire city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11409.864s">just</a>  not a small number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11413.528s">And</a>  a lot of conversations tonight has been around, you know, the animosity between the residents of Medford and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11425.701s">Well,</a>  it does all come down to trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11429.164s">Okay,</a>  but trust isn't just <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11431.946s">You</a>  don't gain trust automatically because you've just voted in the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11437.852s">Trust</a>  is earned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11439.233s">I</a>  have been in the healthcare industry for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11445.549s">No,</a>  not everybody likes me, not everybody trusts me, but I treat all of the people that I care for the way I would care for a member of my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11458.96s">I</a>  respect them all despite race, despite religion, despite politics, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11466.946s">And</a>  I think the problem, the crux of the problem in the city of Medford is there is a lack of trust between the residents and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11476.57s">But</a>  again, you have to earn that trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11480.571s">And</a>  we, you're there because the populace did trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11487.213s">So</a>  earn that trust and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11493.05s">nurture</a>  that trust and then we can all become one and all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11499.352s">A</a>  lot of time is wasted in city council meetings on agendas that are not at the top of the City of Medford's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11510.675s">And</a>  I think my opinion is that all seven of you are there to support the agenda <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11519.776s">of</a>  the important agendas on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11524.538s">The</a>  infrastructure, the streets were a mess, the public school system, the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11531.48s">I</a>  won't say the entire public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11535.081s">My</a>  brother has lived in the city of Medford for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11538.882s">He</a>  and his wife have four sons, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11547.078s">18</a>  months ago, they took all four of their boys out of the Medford public school system because they no longer trusted that the teachers, that school committee, that the mayor and others would provide their children with the education that they deserved and that he worked hard to give them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11571.318s">I</a>  thank you for allowing me to speak and listen to me.</p>
