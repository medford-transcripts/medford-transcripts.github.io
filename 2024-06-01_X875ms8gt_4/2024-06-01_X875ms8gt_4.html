    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=56.586s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=57.046s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=58.126s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=59.167s">This</a>  is <a href="../resolutions/24-062.pdf"><font color="green">24-062</font></a> be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=61.708s">by</a>  the Medford City Council that we honor and commemorate the dedicated service of former Medford Mayor and State Representative John J. Jack McGlynn and the United States Army and the 3132 Signal Service Company, part of the World War II Ghost Army, upon posthumous receipt of the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=76.615s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in honor of all of those who served in the Ghost Army to defend democracy, the people of the United States, and all humankind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=85.459s">And</a>  we have <a href="../resolutions/24-070.pdf"><font color="green">24-070</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=88.066s">by</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and thank former Mayor Jack McGlynn for his service to our great country, and finally being recognized for his heroism in being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service as a member of the Secret Ghost Army during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=102.329s">I'll</a>  be brief and I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, but my favorite anecdote in the news stories that have come out about this was <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=111.511s">former</a>  Mayor Mike McGlynn talking about how he got a phone call when he was mayor from a news source in the 90s, and it was about, they were saying, oh, well, we've learned about the Ghost Army, we learned your father, former Mayor Jack McGlynn, was in the Ghost Army, and he called his dad, and his dad's response was, who told you that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=130.523s">I</a>  need to track that down, because it was that much of a secret, and even 50 years later, he wanted to know how that information had gotten out there, and I think that just shows the dedication and service that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=140.444s">he</a>  gave to the city and the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=142.446s">And</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=144.367s">Thank</a>  you, President Beasley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=146.389s">Again,</a>  a great man, a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=149.772s">And</a>  these are the things when you know someone's a true hero, when you realize when no one's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=158.359s">And</a>  Jack McGlynn did this for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=164.385s">He</a>  tried to stay under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=166.867s">And</a>  it's about time that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=168.803s">He</a>  could be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=170.184s">Unfortunately,</a>  he wasn't here, but his family was. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=173.245s">I</a>  know that his children went out to Washington to receive the honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=180.189s">And</a>  I think that we as a city should really praise and honor people like Jack McGlynn, not for just the service here in the city, in the state, but for also what he did when nobody was watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=196.357s">And</a>  that's a true sign of a true hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=198.45s">So</a>  this is where, hopefully, there are history books written where Medford students can learn about how important Jack McGlynn was to our community and to our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=213.433s">So</a>  I think that I'd like to dedicate this meeting to Mr. Jack McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=218.574s">And</a>  hopefully, I would recommend that this city finds it within themselves to erect a statue in my eyes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=228.76s">for</a>  that person who did so much for this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=231.882s">So</a>  he's what Medford's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=235.163s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=236.164s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=237.164s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=239.085s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=240.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=241.126s">I</a>  grew up in Medford where Mr. McGlynn was mayor and his father was around and a very active member of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=250.291s">And</a>  it was always a joy to talk to them and hang with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=254.48s">and</a>  hear their stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=255.902s">And</a>  I think, I can't say more, that would be more eloquent than what my fellow councillors said, but they're, you know, I'm glad that we're recognizing Jack McGlynn's service to our city and to our country.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=270.731s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=271.411s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=272.792s">And</a>  if you don't know about the Ghost Army, I really recommend taking a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=275.713s">There's</a>  been some really great articles, NPR, a few other ones that are free, no paywall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=280.214s">There's</a>  about 2,000 people who, with signals intelligence and inflatable tanks, tricked the Nazis into thinking they were 50,000 people and saved a lot of lives while doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=291.438s">Any</a>  public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=292.619s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=294.779s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=297.173s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=301.527s">Sorry</a>  I'm late, talking about Mr. McGlynn, Sr.? ? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=305.024s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=306.165s">I</a>  wanted to say the man was, he's a great man and a great neighbor across the street from me on Cushman Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=311.709s">And</a>  when I first moved there, I knocked on the door in 1980, introduced myself, because my sister worked for the Attorney General, Francis X. Bilotti, and I know he knew of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=323.177s">So</a>  he started speaking in Italian, I mean, fluent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=328.959s">I</a>  said, I thought you were an Irishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=331.06s">He</a>  says, I grew up speaking Italian just like I did in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=334.941s">And</a>  I didn't understand half of what he said, because he spoke Southern Italian, but he was very fluent in his Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=341.984s">And</a>  he spoke Latin also, and he told me that whenever his grandkids got an A in Latin, he would give them a hundred dollar bill back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=350.046s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=353.588s">He's</a>  one of the last of the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=357.995s">obviously,</a>  and he is a consummate gentleman and a consummate politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=362.897s">I</a>  miss him a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=364.977s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=366.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=368.118s">On</a>  the motion by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.24s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=374.701s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-063.pdf"><font color="green">24-063</font></a>, offered by Vice President Collins and Councilor Tseng, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the holy month of Ramadan

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=390.116s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=391.297s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Tseng for co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=394.158s">Just</a>  wanted to take a quick moment during this special time of the year for many people in Medford to acknowledge our Muslim community and wish all celebrants a happy Ramadan during this special time for their faiths. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=406.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=716.168s">Thank</a>  you, Council President, and I thank Raising Canes and their representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=725.623s">I</a>  think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=726.003s">We're</a>  going through the due diligence of making sure that our neighborhood is, um, is involved in all of the signage concerns, and I think that we had a subcommittee that that broke it down, and I think that we made some concessions and. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=746.759s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=755.711s">We're</a>  pretty happy with decisions we made and removing a few signs and then keeping signs that are vital to their operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=764.218s">And</a>  I think the biggest ones were the signs that had the menus on it that were hidden by bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=774.327s">So</a>  that was a big piece that would question, but the landscaping that's set up <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=780.444s">it's</a>  really going to assist with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=783.385s">And</a>  I think all the lighting that you'll see on the building is really reflecting on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=788.707s">It's</a>  really nothing that's illuminating the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=791.288s">So</a>  I think we can listen to the petitioner and then we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=796.09s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=798.231s">Kathy,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=799.812s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=801.584s">Councilor</a>  be at present Councilor Bears and board members, Kathleen a Desmond of five of 580 Main Street units for reading is where my office is located. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=811.973s">I'm</a>  here today with Sarah homes, senior property development manager for raising canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=817.384s">Um,</a>  as Miss as council member Scarpelli indicated, we did make some concessions with respect to the signage that we were originally requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=826.911s">We</a>  withdrew the painted arrow sign, which is marked exhibit C of your materials that were provided with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=835.737s">The</a>  one love canopy sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=837.594s">marked</a>  as Exhibit E has been withdrawn and the monument sign marked as Exhibit B. What remains in terms of signage are the two additional wall signs that aid with vehicular queuing as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=854.193s">The</a>  site is very large, it's over 670,000 square feet, the Felsway Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=859.778s">The</a>  two additional signs will provide direction to customers which are within the parking area, coming from where the Dunkin Donuts is, and around that area where the Stop and Shop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=869.608s">So</a>  that's why those two additional signs were requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=873.411s">They</a>  are small in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=874.512s">The</a>  permitted size for a primary wall sign is 100 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=878.697s">The</a>  four combined is only 120 square feet so the signage is not out of character with the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=885.846s">In</a>  addition to the wall signs, there are two to mural signs, a one love heart design that's not lighted, it's, it's lighted by virtue of the lighting on the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=897.561s">It</a>  helps provide some design to the building so you're not just looking at a brick square building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=902.342s">That</a>  is also the case with the proposed digital sign, which is the dog sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=907.403s">Again,</a>  that's not a lighted sign, but it's naturally lighted by what's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=911.424s">And</a>  then the menu and the pre-sale boards, which as Councilman Scarpelli indicated, is screened from the landscaping and is also integral to the business of a takeout restaurant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=923.047s">Thank</a>  you, Cathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=924.507s">Any</a>  questions or comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=928.106s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to reopen the public hearing to anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise has a comment on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=937.653s">The</a>  public hearing is reopened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=939.994s">Would</a>  you like to speak in favor?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.436s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=942.936s">Again,</a>  in terms of what we're looking for, I can let the petitioner speak in favor of Sarah Holmes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.522s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=951.682s">My</a>  name is Sarah Holmes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=953.323s">I'm</a>  with HT Group on behalf of Raising Canes as their senior <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=957.858s">property</a>  development manager, and just speaking in favor of raising canes, these signs are crucial to the operations, and I really believe that they lend to allowing safe vehicular access from the shopping center, as well as with the many boards providing a crucial function for having a drive-through business.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=987.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=988.594s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public on the special permit for additional on-premises signage for raising canes, you can come to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=997.281s">Let</a>  me give it just another minute here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1016.71s">name</a>  and address for the record please.</p>

    <p>[Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1018.371s">Good</a>  evening President Bears and members of the council, Sharon DSL Mass Avenue circuit road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1024.516s">I</a>  think it's wonderful to have some larger size commerce, coming to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1030.481s">It's</a>  sad in a way that stop and shop is has, you know, started the anchor, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1039.449s">I</a>  like the whole idea what I don't like that entrance, I did not know about any public hearings in the beginning of this placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1047.757s">And</a>  I've looked into the, the, the company very fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1051.661s">I</a>  was wondering if it's there's any way on that side street that comes behind ocean job lot in the freight tools company. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1061.852s">the</a>  Raising Cane Company would be willing to put a smaller sign on that street next to Dunkin' Donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1070.359s">That</a>  entrance, as you know, goes to Eastern Bank, it goes to Panera's, it goes to Smashburger's, and it goes to that small, I'm sorry, Chinese spot on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1086.172s">And</a>  now Raising Cane's. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1088.274s">I</a>  have to wait five and 10 minutes to get in and out of there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1092.296s">So</a>  I'm wondering if they might want to also promote more people going in if they get a little bit discouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1100.459s">If</a>  on that street right by Dunkin Donuts, I forget the name of that street, that there could also be additional small signage entrance to Raising Cane's here also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1110.903s">I</a>  don't know how that works with zoning or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1115.565s">is</a>  a suggestion because I think especially in the beginning with the fine product like that, especially with families and inflation on higher restaurants right now, it's going to be busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1124.867s">I</a>  wish them success. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1126.688s">I'm</a>  just wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1127.848s">I</a>  think it's a really good idea.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1129.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1130.109s">Yes,</a>  this is just about the signs and we did the special permit on other items already, but I do believe Raising Cane's is making improvements at the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1138.051s">Kathy,</a>  if you want to speak on it.</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1141.411s">I</a>  can address that briefly as part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1145.143s">that</a>  we put some kind of signage so that when you get to the end of Riverside have where the light is that they don't block the box, and that's going to be somehow tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1155.592s">To</a>  a light right before the block the box so that cars and coming going down Riverside have to the fouls way will be aware that they can't block the box and that there's going to be a change in light. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1166.942s">In</a>  addition to that, I believe we also discussed the. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1172.349s">putting</a>  some kind of signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1174.351s">I</a>  don't recall who is specifically responsible for it, but that other entrance was addressed as something that should be made known to Raisin Cane customers that they can also exit out of that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1187.982s">So</a>  those were discussed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1188.683s">I</a>  believe there were new paint marks as well were?</p>

    <p>[Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1190.805s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1192.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1194.107s">Any</a>  further comment on the special permit for signage for Raisin Canes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1201.013s">Seeing</a>  none in the chamber and none on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1205.402s">Are</a>  there any motions?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1210.592s">I</a>  would, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1213.172s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1214.712s">I'll</a>  defer to that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1215.373s">Well,</a>  I'm just gonna move forward.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1217.413s">I'll</a>  second your motion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1218.333s">Okay,</a>  so I think that with the concessions for the neighbors and for the business that's moving in, I think that we've been pretty thorough with our meetings and informing the neighbors, so I would move forward with the changes as instructed and approve.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1472.204s">Whereas</a>  the city of Medford has climate sustainability, affordable housing and other goals that would be easier to accomplish if we could reach either renters or landlords or both in our city, and whereas a lack of a registry of rental properties means that we currently miss opportunities to reach either our renters or our landlords or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1489.257s">Be</a>  it so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1494.059s">with</a>  energy efficiency standards as described in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, Section 2.2.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1501.583s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this ordinance be referred to committee for further discussion in the Planning and Permitting Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1507.606s">Be</a>  it further resolved that members of the Planning and Permitting Committee submit questions to the chair, clerk, and city staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1516.499s">and</a>  be it further resolved that the council work with the building department and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on the drafting of this ordinance to ensure that it best serves the city of Medford and our climate and affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1529.104s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1530.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1532.02s">So</a>  one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1545.311s">I</a>  know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1556.319s">And</a>  tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1564.306s">There</a>  are also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1566.667s">you</a>  know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1578.234s">That</a>  would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1587.719s">And</a>  there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1591.541s">I</a>  know in the climate adaptation and action plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1595.844s">it</a>  has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1597.645s">There</a>  are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1611.216s">I</a>  know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1622.765s">know,</a>  junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1641.162s">being</a>  able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1647.206s">And</a>  really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1664.037s">So</a>  that's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1665.638s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1667.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1670.511s">I</a>  would really like to thank Councilor Callahan for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1674.074s">I</a>  think this is an idea that most residents assume we already do as a city, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1679.639s">And</a>  it is something that, you know, it's information that the city should really have in order to communicate its message better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1686.084s">And</a>  I think that kind of touches at two of the arcs that we're trying to work on this term in the city of Medford with the city government communication modernization. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1697.644s">we're</a>  ambitious as a city council and as a city when it comes to our climate goals, housing goals, but also the very basis of just having our existing laws be carried out and enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1709.991s">And</a>  this registry would allow us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1712.693s">It</a>  would allow us to be more responsive to a lot of constituent concerns and a lot of resident concerns like what you mentioned about absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1720.757s">and</a>  it would help us restructure some of the ideas that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1725.939s">For</a>  example, with the good landlord tax credit, which I know a lot of people are really excited about, this idea allows us to reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1735.041s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1741.197s">This</a>  sounds really interesting I'm curious about if this is common practice and other cities in the area I'm not I'm not familiar with this as a concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1749.64s">I</a>  would be curious to hear if other cities practices commonly and another thought I have and I don't think this necessarily is a deal breaker but if it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1759.005s">I</a>  don't know what that would mean for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1760.006s">Prohibitive</a>  administratively for City Hall staff and what that would mean for requirements for maybe additional hiring or restructuring, or if that's just something to discuss in committee because I know the resolution says, you know, talk about it and planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1775.215s">Obviously</a>  that would be the time to talk to City Hall staff, but that those are just things that come up and also things being</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1789.77s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1791.271s">I</a>  would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1802.477s">For</a>  example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1813.064s">They</a>  just don't have access to who those people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1815.995s">So</a>  I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1828.24s">We're</a>  gonna go to President Bears, Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1831.721s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1833.222s">Yeah,</a>  having spoken with not just the planning department, but also code enforcement, building inspectors, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1841.365s">And</a>  also, this is a policy that's in effect in Boston, Worcester, other communities around the city, around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1847.952s">There's</a>  a huge issue with being able to identify what's an owner-occupied home, what is a rental unit, what's an illegal rental unit, and this would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1857.521s">I</a>  think I was listening to Councilor Tseng talk a bit about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1863.643s">Building</a>  code, health and safety, you know, there's a lot of difficulty with reaching out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1871.49s">We</a>  send it out in the tax bill, absentee landlord, absentee property owner, maybe they never open the envelope and maybe they never see it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1879.318s">So</a>  there's a number of things when it comes to quality of life here in a community where this would be a huge benefit for the city to be able to identify this and I think the good and important thing to recognize is that most of the people who are renting property owners or renting properties in the city are <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1895.52s">the</a>  right thing, following the rules, you know, and this is a way for the city to provide access to the different programs and benefits available and be in contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1905.303s">And</a>  then for the folks who are problem properties, and we know of them, and we know many of them are in the hillside neighborhood and over-renting to tough students, and we have overgrowth, and we've had petitions coming in here before, this is a way for the city to actually keep track of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1918.587s">And</a>  that's been a huge note from code enforcement and building, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1924.013s">It's</a>  just hard to say, here's the file on this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1926.535s">And</a>  this property may be violating snow and ice removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1928.776s">They</a>  may have overgrowth under the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1930.277s">They</a>  may have trash on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1931.798s">They</a>  may have noise nuisance complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1933.72s">They</a>  may have a whole plethora list of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1936.201s">But</a>  because there's no registry, there's nothing to attach any of that to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1940.104s">And</a>  they get away with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1941.745s">So</a>  this really is a way for us to have that list, know what's going on in the city, and make sure that while most folks are doing the right thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1952.753s">address</a>  the issues with those who are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1954.556s">And</a>  I think that's something that all of us can acknowledge is an issue that we all experience here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1960.147s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1961.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1963.012s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1964.48s">just</a>  a question for Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1967.902s">So</a>  it says here the building department, the office and the PBS. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1971.745s">Do</a>  you have a good idea of where this project once it is implemented would primarily be maintained? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1978.57s">Would</a>  it be the building department or PBS? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1980.531s">And</a>  what's do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1982.053s">Can</a>  you just, like, give us an idea of the amount of staff time that it would take to get this off the ground and maintain a longer term? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1987.897s">If</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1992.844s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, if you have a direct response.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1994.664s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1995.705s">I</a>  mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2001.626s">So</a>  the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2011.768s">So</a>  really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2015.309s">But</a>  as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2018.888s">who</a>  will implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2020.19s">I</a>  think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2037.995s">I</a>  can also speak to some of Councilor Lazzaro and Councilor Leming's questions, because I happened to hold a meeting on this a few weeks ago with some city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2050.561s">It</a>  seems like most of the work would fall within the purview of the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2055.623s">Actually,</a>  the new building commissioner that we have here in Medford set up the rental registry system for their last municipality, and so they're very well-versed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2064.487s">how</a>  to create the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2067.391s">They've</a>  created an online system that really maintains itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2070.415s">And</a>  so it wouldn't, you know, the setup would take time for the staff to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2075.521s">But</a>  once the system is in place, they expect the system to be quite self-containing.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.183s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.963s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2085.184s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.084s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.284s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.344s">If</a>  I can't do the chair to Council Kalyan or any other councils that can what documents were we asking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2092.865s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.166s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.886s">This</a>  is an intrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2095.946s">Um</a>  process and what we're asking for for renters information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2100.287s">Landlords</a>  information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2102.008s">Can</a>  anybody share what we</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2111.423s">Again,</a>  this is the beginning of the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2114.086s">Excuse</a>  me, we're not going to interrupt people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2122.575s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, please go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2127.515s">So</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2135.158s">Yes,</a>  this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2146.181s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2149.238s">My</a>  understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2162.961s">There</a>  will be a chance for everybody to participate on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2171.122s">Please</a>  do not interrupt speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2172.643s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, are you finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2175.594s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2176.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2177.196s">And</a>  I think that's what the big concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2179.72s">I</a>  think that we're doing something that sounds like it doesn't need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2185.148s">We've</a>  been we've been <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2190.538s">Based</a>  on interrupt speakers, I'm gonna ask the room to be silent, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2195.799s">I'm</a>  hearing dialogue back and forth from fellow councils that we're here to do people's business and we should do some things later on that we'll talk about that we need to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2206.581s">We</a>  keep doing business and keep throwing more work onto people that we already know don't have the capability to do what you're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2214.703s">You're</a>  asking for something that's already done <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2216.983s">through</a>  the city in every way possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2221.646s">If</a>  the biggest thing is just to get the information out to people, there's other ways to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2226.889s">But</a>  to be intrusive and then really take all these unnecessary documents, it makes people very uneasy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2235.133s">And</a>  I'll be honest with you, for a council that's very, very astute in understanding about people that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2241.96s">I</a>  probably most difficult people that are going through a very difficult time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2245.661s">I</a>  was getting phone calls from landlords saying, George, what do we do hypothetically? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2250.703s">Hypothetically?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.024s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.584s">Because</a>  the conversation scares our residents, that our landlords allow to give them a place to live, but are afraid to give documentation, because maybe they're undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2266.948s">And</a>  they're petrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2268.854s">This</a>  is a fear that you should wait when we get to this point, but also understand we're trying to do something over and over again with different issues on this council lately that's redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2280.723s">And</a>  it's putting more work to departments that need to do their work, not to do this additional stuff that we want to get people to know that there is some sort of rebate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2292.964s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2294.487s">There</a>  are so many other ways we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2299.899s">But</a>  to keep bringing resolutions through. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2304.286s">I</a>  think it's hurting this community and it's driving more wedges through this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2312.729s">So</a>  I would request that we deny this process and not put more work on more departments that don't need it right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2323.673s">I</a>  would just note that the departments themselves have requested it and it's part of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2330.959s">It</a>  is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2331.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2333.32s">I'm</a>  not going to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2335.641s">Seriously,</a>  my role is to just state facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2340.242s">Okay,</a>  please stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.103s">Please</a>  stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2342.983s">You</a>  have to be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2346.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2348.065s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2352.166s">Seeing</a>  none, name and address for the record, please, for public participation.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2356.027s">Robert</a>  Jones, 5 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2357.348s">Mary</a>  Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2360.126s">Again,</a>  I really don't know where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2363.449s">The</a>  people that own the houses pay their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2367.752s">We</a>  know how to contact them when we're looking for their money, correct?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2372.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2373.277s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2375.178s">If</a>  they don't pay, then they are contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2377.76s">So</a>  you have a mechanism to contact every homeowner in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2382.844s">It's</a>  a current system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2384.065s">Who</a>  is going to be processing and administering all this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2388.84s">rental</a>  registry, we're going to have a rental registry department here, because we barely have enough staff to provide the basic city services that we have right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2398.444s">Thank</a>  you, as was as was noted, and please do not if you're going to shout, I'm going to ask you to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2403.886s">Thank</a>  you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2405.106s">I</a>  just want to if you I can answer your question, which is that the people who are responsible for enforcing the building code have said that this would make their jobs easier.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2412.073s">Can</a>  you name them?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2413.194s">Yes,</a>  the people who work in the building department, the building commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.515s">Are</a>  they here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2415.835s">It</a>  was just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2417.136s">Well,</a>  we're not, we haven't had them, we're just referring to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2419.457s">So</a>  we're going to have the discussion as members of the public have noted, we're going to have a long discussion just on this topic so that everyone can have their points concerned, so that points like Councilor Scarpelli's can be raised and so that we can craft an ordinance that works for the community.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2431.925s">It</a>  would be nice if the people that you talked to would be here to verify that you had talked to them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2437.233s">We're</a>  going, okay, I don't think we need to be verifying anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2440.194s">We're</a>  gonna have a discussion.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2441.494s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2441.794s">Read</a>  the room, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2443.314s">I</a>  have, and I'm disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2445.395s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2446.115s">And</a>  I think that you guys are way overstepping your boundaries here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2449.815s">I</a>  think you're beyond the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2453.576s">I'm</a>  gonna let you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2454.856s">You</a>  got three minutes, 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2458.857s">That's</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2459.797s">I'm</a>  not a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2460.837s">I'd</a>  love to ask a city solicitor, but obviously we don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2465.228s">Another</a>  point that I'd like to make with all the, what I consider drastic and radical changes that you're trying to push through in the city, I think they should be put on a ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2477.437s">And</a>  if they're truly...</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2481.277s">Just</a>  a reminder that the disruption does take away from the speaker's time.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2484.158s">Oh,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2485.538s">Well,</a>  the police are here so they can drag me from the podium if you so desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2489.62s">If</a>  needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2490.48s">If</a>  needed, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2491.701s">I'll</a>  stay here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2494.241s">The</a>  other thing was, through the chair to the city clerk, what is our next municipal election? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2501.264s">How</a>  about September 3rd? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2502.324s">There's</a>  no election on September 3rd?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2504.932s">That's</a>  not a municipal election, that's a state primary.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2506.914s">Oh,</a>  sorry, I misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2508.014s">The</a>  next election in the city of Medfordwood will be September 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2511.917s">So</a>  why don't we craft all the ordinances and the registries, whatever that may be, and put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2517.962s">And</a>  if it's truly the will of the people, we'll see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2520.984s">And</a>  people will be able to vote at the ballot box, not down here with a two minute limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2532.344s">Every</a>  week, it's something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2534.125s">And</a>  it's overstepping the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2536.845s">You're</a>  doing charter review here on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2540.406s">And</a>  if we had a city solicitor, maybe they could weigh in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2544.608s">I</a>  guess that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2547.649s">What</a>  is the impetus of this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2550.329s">Because</a>  it doesn't sound like <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2552.418s">The</a>  problem landlords are not going to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2555.419s">You</a>  understand that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2557.239s">The</a>  people that you're talking about enforcing are not going to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2560.8s">And</a>  we know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2562.08s">You</a>  know how to get in touch with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2563.54s">So</a>  I question why this registry is even being put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2568.301s">Is</a>  it to mimic the one that they have in Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2571.402s">Lynn</a>  has a rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2573.542s">Is</a>  that where you got the information from, Mr. Chair?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2576.909s">I'm</a>  not going to engage in the back and forth, but as I noted, this is in the city's comprehensive plan and was requested by several departments in the city as a way to... Okay, well, I'd like to know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2586.593s">I</a>  just told you it's the building department and the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2589.094s">I</a>  don't believe you, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2591.135s">Okay,</a>  well, I'm sorry that you don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2592.936s">You</a>  can continue your comment, but I'm not going to engage in the back and forth.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2595.817s">Okay,</a>  well, I thought we were here to ask questions and you would answer them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2600.679s">No,</a>  you're here to make comments and we will hear them.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2603.52s">I'm</a>  asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2608.317s">You</a>  have 55 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2609.438s">OK,</a>  we have somebody else ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2611.06s">So</a>  my question is, what is the impetus, the end game for this rental registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2616.886s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2617.987s">Number</a>  two, who in the building department asked for this registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2622.839s">And</a>  I have plenty of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2624.28s">And</a>  if this registry and some of the other things that we have rise above the charter of the city, and if they're legal, I'd like to have that legal opinion by a city solicitor or KP Law, whoever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2637.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2638.049s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2650.477s">No,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2650.757s">I'm</a>  going to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2651.497s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2652.87s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2653.812s">Hi,</a>  it's Kathleen Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2655.554s">I</a>  have a couple thoughts or questions about this rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2661.624s">I</a>  don't own a two family home, so I don't really have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2666.991s">I</a>  can't comment, but I do have some thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2671.194s">One</a>  is that all this information, like Mr. Jones said earlier, all this information should be somewhere in some sort of city database that we have with our names and addresses, that we pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2688.632s">You</a>  know, so either someone's not doing their job correctly, or someone is not using the technology that we have to do their job, or we're missing some piece of technology to gather that information to be able to utilize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2706.248s">Because</a>  if we have some sort of computer system, we have some sort of database that has all this information in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2715.666s">And</a>  then my other thought was about how do you get around people who rent illegally or like, I mean, I can only assume, because I have seen college students before, you know, you have an apartment in Hillside that's supposed to rent to four people, but there's eight people living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2734.002s">How</a>  do you get around that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2735.203s">Like,</a>  how do you, I just, I think that there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2740.185s">I</a>  think it's a nice idea, but I think we have that information and we should utilize what we have before we start creating something new.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3096.367s">I</a>  didn't quite say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3097.208s">I</a>  said we know that there's a small percentage of people who are problem landlords, but code enforcement has said because there's no registry, it can be difficult to track them down and we are well aware that there are a lot of corporate owners using shell corporations and they're almost impossible for the city to get in touch with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3110.245s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3111.451s">Okay,</a>  all right, so I didn't hear anything about single families. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3114.793s">There's</a>  tons of single family homes that don't enforce their codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3117.994s">I</a>  walk the streets of Medford all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3120.275s">There's</a>  no code enforcement for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3123.317s">There's</a>  trash thrown in front of their businesses, overgrowth, things are not taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3127.859s">What</a>  are you doing about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3129.52s">Are</a>  they registered? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3130.2s">Do</a>  you reach out to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3131.901s">How</a>  are you gonna reach out? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3132.882s">You</a>  talk about tax programs that you wanna reach out to us for tax programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3135.703s">There's</a>  other ways to reach out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3138.084s">do</a>  you what about the tax incentives for single family homebuyers how are you going to reach out to them are you going to have them register there's ways to reach out to these people without having to and again the people that end up getting burned with these types of things are the small property owners who actually the majority of them are pretty good landlords and they're the ones who end up bearing the brunt of these these laws that's all i have to say thank you</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3164.517s">Thank</a>  you, and I will note we do have a business license program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3167.698s">All</a>  businesses are licensed, and this council on multiple budgets has requested additional funding for code enforcement, including in the most recent budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3175.679s">We</a>  currently only have two code enforcement officers.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3178.4s">Well,</a>  then maybe we should start there first.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3180.861s">We're</a>  doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3183.981s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3185.022s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">It's</a>  been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">And</a>  I feel like there's something wrong with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">You're</a>  going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">Also,</a>  my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">by</a>  going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">And</a>  it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">And</a>  in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">you</a>  indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">Well,</a>  let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">Because</a>  if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">not</a>  renting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">So</a>  what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">These</a>  are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">In</a>  fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3303.712s">There's</a>  nothing in the ordinance that would suggest that whatsoever.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">city</a>  of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">And</a>  if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">Now,</a>  if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">MCAD</a>  in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">And</a>  you can also go to the public health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">Right</a>  now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">But</a>  every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">Because</a>  that unfortunately, is where this is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">Because</a>  once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">Let</a>  me see your references. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">And</a>  where were you renting last? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">That's</a>  not what this council's job is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">What</a>  an answer!</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3383.677s">I</a>  would just note again that this doesn't say anything like that.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.78s">This</a>  doesn't say anything.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">You</a>  don't know you haven't gotten there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">You</a>  just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3397.528s">I</a>  have said point Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3399.33s">I</a>  have the authority to respond with facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3400.991s">These</a>  are not factual facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3403.774s">You</a>  would please tell me where this says that we're going to discriminate ethnically against.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">I</a>  didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3410.599s">What's</a> </p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">Mr.</a>  President, what's the registry going to include? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">Ask</a>  the maker of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">You</a>  cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">Then</a>  you don't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">Go</a>  someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3436.542s">Yeah,</a>  54 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3438.544s">50</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">I'm</a>  just frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">And</a>  probably taking it out on all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">But</a>  I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">I'm</a>  going to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">I</a>  have a bad habit of repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">Please</a>  just do what you were elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">Well,</a>  you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">Did</a>  you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3466.122s">So</a>  let me just... All right, if we're gonna shout again, I'm gonna ask you to leave.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">Let</a>  me just conclude by saying the following.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3474.404s">You</a>  have 30 seconds, you have 15 seconds actually.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">Well,</a>  you know something, just relax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">You</a>  had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">You</a>  took my time up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">I'm</a>  gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">and</a>  think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">So</a>  you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">Maybe</a>  there is something that can work its way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">Maybe</a>  if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">And</a>  the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">And</a>  at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">that</a>  revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">No,</a>  wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3798.822s">Hi,</a>  my name is Longway Su, 250 Spring Street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3804.363s">You</a>  may speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3805.083s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3805.984s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank you for the city council for opportunity to express my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3815.338s">First,</a>  I want to thank the Council for giving us the chance to express our thoughts and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3821.984s">For</a>  me, I basically have three things I want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3826.208s">First</a>  is privacy, second is fairness, and third is efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3832.453s">and</a>  actually said I have to come today to express those points because I think a lot of good folks already expressed those comments, but probably I need to rehash them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3845.016s">First</a>  is the privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3847.076s">I</a>  think it is unfair to put in this kind of burden for the landlord to collect, validate, and reporting those private informations to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3860.527s">You</a>  may think that would be helpful, you may think it would be helpful, like a government body, but for us regular folks, it's just not a big brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3871.573s">We</a>  just want to pay our tax and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3873.413s">We</a>  have a job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3876.115s">And</a>  collecting those private information really violates the right of the landlord and also the tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3884.192s">I</a>  mean, how can write it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3885.432s">This</a>  is a whole of a body of work involving for the registration, both on the city and on the citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3894.135s">So</a>  this is privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3896.035s">Second</a>  is fairness. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3898.356s">Me,</a>  I'm not evil. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3900.316s">I</a>  live my property for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3903.317s">I</a>  work my bone to earn that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3905.898s">I</a>  literally got a machine all myself because it cost 500 to get plumber. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3911.71s">I</a>  literally, like I work so hard for their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3915.393s">I</a>  just share the same responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3918.175s">I</a>  paid exactly what I own in terms of tax for like other single resident in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3927.141s">It</a>  is unfair to discriminate small owner like me just because I have a property, I rent it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3936.128s">I</a>  already did my fair part. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3938.069s">I</a>  pay my tax, just leave me alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3950.368s">Third</a>  is efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3952.75s">I</a>  just couldn't notice that one of the reason that the objective is to be affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3962.095s">I'm</a>  not a scientist or economic scientist. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3965.657s">I</a>  just couldn't make the connection of affordable housing versus more fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3971.621s">Really,</a>  how that will even help in terms of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3976.338s">it</a>  will make metaphor even more expensive for renter, because every penny you extract from landlord will eventually triple down to all resident here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3989.181s">So</a>  my suggestion to the city council is actually try to more efficiently use the tax money you already have towards the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3998.033s">They</a>  are other people's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3999.635s">They</a>  are the money from, like, pulling from the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4003.42s">Those</a>  should be, you already have those money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4006.604s">that</a>  we probably should have more proposal, we should working on using that existing tax money more efficiently, rather try to expand the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4017.068s">And</a>  if it does, please do it properly, just raise the tax rate, do it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4024.13s">And</a>  that's all my comments, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4025.69s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4033.493s">No</a>  hands on Zoom, go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4037.901s">I</a>  just want to say that I strongly oppose this rental licensing ordinance, and I just want to make a general appreciation of why I only own my house, I don't have rental property, and some other people have made great points about the specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4056.283s">I</a>  just think that the rental licensing ordinance is a clear example, in fact, of government overreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4062.729s">When</a>  the government imposes such licenses, it typically aims to regulate for the sake of regulation and nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4069.796s">In</a>  this case, under the guise of climate sustainability and affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4074.64s">However,</a>  what actually occurs is a limitation on the freedom of property owners to engage freely in the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4081.805s">This</a>  not only introduces unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, but also inflates costs for both landlords and tenants, for both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4093.493s">reflecting</a>  a misguided approach to solving housing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4096.677s">A</a>  much more effective method would be to encourage free market competition and innovation, which naturally elevates housing standards, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4103.884s">sustainability</a>  goals, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4106.454s">and</a>  affordability without imposing burdensome regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4109.135s">And</a>  I would just like to add, based on the comment on the previous person, which I applaud, is that, yes, I would try to focus on efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4118.02s">And</a>  I understand that by definition, the government is inefficient because the government uses somebody else's money on someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4124.723s">And</a>  as such, the government thinks that resources are unlimited, but they're not unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4129.145s">We</a>  work as hard as we can to basically pay our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4133.747s">And</a>  then we're not getting anything out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4136.497s">You</a>  can't even drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4137.837s">I</a>  had to change two bearings in my car already because you basically drive like it's a landmine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4143.679s">You're</a>  trying to avoid potholes everywhere you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4146.54s">So</a>  I please request that the city council, please use the resources that you already have efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4154.403s">Property</a>  prices go up every year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4157.384s">I</a>  keep paying more taxes, so please, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4160.345s">Please</a>  use as efficiently as you can with the limitation that I have stated that it's always going to be more inefficient than the free market. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4168.208s">Please</a>  use what you have as efficiently as you can and leave us alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4173.469s">We</a>  already do our part, we work as hard as we can, and we don't want to contribute anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4178.691s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4179.991s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4431.471s">Okay,</a>  but I'll tell you something that could be wrong in that too as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4435.412s">We</a>  know that maybe some of this you're looking for the fall points as they call it, you know, maybe somebody's there who's destructive of property or maybe a landowner is having a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4446.156s">You</a>  have a better way of contacting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4448.137s">I</a>  know sometimes it's very hard to contact someone even if you go by their tax <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4454.019s">bill</a>  if they live out of state or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4456.242s">I've</a>  gone through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4457.183s">I</a>  helped a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4458.264s">I</a>  still do with his business besides teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4460.786s">He</a>  owns a small real estate brokerage firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4464.03s">Sometimes</a>  we get the envelope back three times in four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4467.714s">We</a>  say we give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4469.015s">So</a>  that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4470.537s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4471.698s">But</a>  we pay a lot of money for printing census forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4474.919s">We</a>  have the postage, probably free. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4477.88s">But</a>  we have people who are very responsible, I'm hoping, who process all those forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4482.981s">And</a>  that's a good base. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4484.201s">We</a>  also have the registration of voters in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4490.303s">ways</a>  during, excuse me, during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4494.446s">But</a>  if you're an example, my niece, who was going through different internships, had to come and live with me after I lost my brother suddenly a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4503.291s">She</a>  was in and out of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4505.953s">Fine,</a>  I welcome her anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4507.754s">She</a>  just left, as a matter of fact, again this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4510.936s">Every</a>  time I filled out the census, I didn't know whether to put her name down because I didn't know if she was going to leave in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4516.419s">Now,</a>  it could have been she maybe took a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4519.74s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4520.221s">I'm</a>  just making these as examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4522.102s">If</a>  someone had to bring her up and she wasn't living there anymore, what would something like this do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4526.564s">Accuse</a>  me, the homeowner, of fraud? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4528.725s">You</a>  know, if she was going off someplace else to live for a few months? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4533.027s">To</a>  me, I want you to take this that you didn't put <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4537.089s">some</a>  other intention and besides, I think it's going to come to something bigger too, and not better but worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4544.452s">People</a>  don't watch these meetings anymore and I know it's a motion tonight President Pierce, that you're going to look into speaking time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4552.435s">Well</a>  there's a lot of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4554.036s">Come</a>  to me and say we're not watching it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4556.697s">We're</a>  sick of issues coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4558.598s">We're</a>  bored We have no idea where they're going with some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4561.419s">They're</a>  meaningless to us We don't want to watch anymore and you know what happens in a year or two They don't vote because they just don't want to be bothered anymore and they feel like they don't have a voice So I hope I helped in some way to um, just direct <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4577.585s">I</a>  wouldn't say meaningless, but some motions that really can cause a lot of meaningless commotion for yourselves and that your time can be better spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4586.77s">And</a>  another example of this is some people, including myself, I had company watching a meeting one night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4592.433s">And</a>  some people on the council were directing questions to the people who put these ordinances together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4599.479s">You're</a>  supposed to know all that information when you come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4602.642s">If</a>  we have a question, you should be able to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4607.206s">You</a>  shouldn't be asking each other questions behind your own motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4610.989s">That</a>  should be in a discussion, including in your salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4614.132s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.214s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.594s">Diaz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4616.974s">I'm</a>  going to go to Jennifer Fiore on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4622.705s">Give</a>  me one second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4626.628s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4627.629s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4629.41s">Hi,</a>  Jennifer Fiore, 61 Stickney Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4633.293s">I</a>  just had one quick comment or clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4636.596s">My</a>  understanding is that it would be the landlords and the renters who would be on this registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4641.099s">And</a>  I think it's actually also pretty concerning for the renters to have their privacy invaded like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4650.627s">You</a>  know, renters might be of all different income levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4654.871s">They</a>  may potentially be receiving other government services. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4658.975s">And,</a>  you know, depending on where administrations head, you know, privacy and governments being aware of their whereabouts might be concerning for people and might disincentivize them from moving to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4675.782s">My</a>  second point is that just in observing these last few meetings, I just see such an immense amount of pain that is being caused in this community by the way the city council is conducting affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4688.912s">And</a>  I just think you all really should go home and reflect on what you're doing, what your goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4701.167s">and</a>  what your role really is as leadership for a city because you're causing pain and it's going to come back and haunt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4711.776s">And</a>  so I think collectively it's an opportunity to just think about where you want to see this community head and how the most productive way would be to go about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4724.888s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4726.929s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4739.76s">Councilor</a>  Callahan just to a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4741.402s">Renters</a>  are not on the registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4744.205s">There's</a>  rental properties that are on the right, so just be property owners and renters themselves are not on registry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4749.451s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4750.171s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4751.433s">You</a>  have five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4753.686s">Yeah,</a>  I think...

Sorry, could you provide your name and address for the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4770.515s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4771.315s">My</a>  name is Li Junhui. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4772.596s">I'm</a>  27 Hancock Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4774.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4774.558s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4775.738s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4776.159s">The</a>  first one, I think I watched the metaphor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4778.981s">I</a>  like metaphor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4780.202s">Now</a>  it's beautiful and beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4782.283s">I</a>  think I bought a house here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4784.285s">Beginning</a>  my tax is 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4785.666s">I</a>  did a very good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4787.327s">So</a>  make my house beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4788.848s">So</a>  now increase the tax to the 12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4792.831s">I'm</a>  OK, because I like to contribute to the metaphor, make the metaphor beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4799.534s">And</a>  also, it's a work of art. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4801.575s">But</a>  another thing, for this one, I think it definitely will be hurting the privacy of the landlord and also the renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4808.618s">I</a>  know the purpose, our goal, is to make the metaphor beautiful and also <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4815.541s">is</a>  a good business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4817.101s">So</a>  I think this is our all the resident resident ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4820.862s">So</a>  my point, I just like concern about this, this, this new policy will be heard our, our economics of the Medford will be not only heard a lot of privacy part and also for the renter to will be hesitated to run here if they have so many burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4839.066s">And</a>  also, this is like a <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4843.233s">their</a>  privacy, this is only my thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4845.755s">I</a>  think I want Medford to have a good business and also good future. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4850.197s">So</a>  I definitely ask you guys can reconsider this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4855.0s">Yeah.</a> </p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5191.81s">I</a>  bought a house and I have very good renters in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5197.472s">And</a>  as the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5200.071s">landlord</a>  that I don't know what to set up and what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5204.055s">And</a>  two months later, the water bill show up in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5207.298s">And</a>  you guys really know how to find us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5210.541s">And</a>  if you want to send those information along with the water bill, I'm okay to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5216.226s">Like</a>  if you have a rebate, send it with the water bill and I can get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5220.49s">There's</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5224.781s">I</a>  think there's like a really advanced technologies, a lot of things happening around the world, machine learning and different kind of tech, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5233.624s">And</a>  some of them is even open source is free. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5235.944s">So</a>  do leverage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5238.545s">And</a>  I'm pretty sure that you have a way to find the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5242.486s">And</a>  even if it's not in Massachusetts, it's in other states, it's in other countries, I'm pretty sure you have a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5247.067s">And</a>  that's my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5249.188s">And</a>  second point, it's the human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5253.337s">and</a>  listening to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5255.499s">So</a>  I live in another city in Massachusetts and I've never seen like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5262.684s">So</a>  this is the first time I have been in city council that like the audience is this kind of reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5269.129s">And</a>  I think what we should do is we should really listen to people and we should really focus on people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5276.215s">That's</a>  what the city council should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5279.297s">And</a>  I feel <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5281.681s">And</a>  a lot of gentlemen and ladies, they have already talked a lot about the efficiency, the rights, and then what the city council should focus on now, all reaching to this area, that I think all the landlords, they have their own rights, and then they have their own power to manage this property without a rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5302.553s">So</a>  I think, at last, I really want to suggest the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5307.788s">listen</a>  to people, and follow with people, and what you just hear, not just me, everyone else, it's just what people want to express and what to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5316.411s">And</a>  if this is the beginning of the conversation, let's end it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.113s">That's</a>  everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.753s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5321.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=5324.554s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Leong, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6444.793s">I've</a>  been here in December when you set the tax rate, what the city assesses for at least 19 Decembers in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6453.436s">I</a>  missed once on purpose to see what you would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6456.757s">Still</a>  the same results, seven to zero, they voted against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6460.538s">Maybe</a>  it's about high noon time to adopt what they did in Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Chelsea, Cambridge, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6473.959s">to</a>  adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6479.782s">And</a>  that is the real estate owner occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6484.684s">If</a>  you live in the house, doesn't matter how many units, because it's only going to apply to your one unit, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6495.546s">you</a>  would receive the owner occupied exemption, about 85% of owner occupied would receive a savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6505.355s">Instead</a>  of the usual, I'm getting $300, $400 every effing year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6510.24s">It's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6511.221s">So</a>  you, Councilor Bears, even said to the commissioner, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6518.055s">of</a>  the real estate downstairs that we have to look at this in advance, like six months before, which is like May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6525.542s">So</a>  this is the time, as you said, we should investigate whether we should adopt this or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6532.227s">At</a>  the full 35% exemption, or else don't even bother. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6536.391s">There's</a>  a lot of people that are business people behind me, actually, that does not want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6544.554s">because</a>  they're absentee owners, maybe not slumlords, but they know on Christian Street, there's two or three, Winchester, Wellesley, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6555.621s">They're</a>  just collecting rents, two, three, $4,000 a month, depending on how many bedrooms there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6561.544s">Every</a>  month it changes, and different cars come, no one knows where to park, not enough parking anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6570.75s">They</a>  don't know what color barrels to put out, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6573.777s">I</a>  don't know, do I make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6576.358s">Or</a>  is it you people with the problems?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6578.698s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6579.598s">We</a>  definitely have had a lot of conversations about owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6582.339s">I</a>  think you'd actually find that if we were to implement it, it would increase, it shifts the burden within the property tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6587.62s">It</a>  would actually increase the taxes on a lot of small multifamily homes.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6592.841s">What</a>  I just said was 85%, is my guesstimate, would save if they live in the house, period.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6600.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6601.002s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Jessica Healy on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6605.168s">name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6606.148s">You</a>  have five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6610.689s">I</a>  just want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6613.83s">I</a>  keep hearing that this is the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6615.43s">This</a>  is getting stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6616.71s">It's</a>  beginning phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6618.591s">I</a>  want to know, and I'm sure everyone else would like to know what the end goal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6623.512s">Everything</a>  that has beginning has an ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6626.192s">So</a>  there's some reason that you're putting all these different motions into play because there's some <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6634.392s">and</a>  goal you have, and I'm not sure what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6639.156s">If</a>  anyone could explain that to me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6642.658s">Many</a>  of the policies we've been discussing are part of the city's comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing plan, which are available on the city website, and they include recommendations for council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6652.345s">This</a>  is one of them.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6654.286s">Okay,</a>  so the housing and climate plan, okay.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6657.849s">And</a>  comprehensive plan as well, the citywide comprehensive.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6661.052s">All</a>  right, well, I'll have to look into those plans that you guys have set up, because apparently, from the different meetings I've been watching, not many people love these plans that you're putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6672.057s">I</a>  also just have to state that, like another gentleman stated that was just up there, watching this meeting and the snickering and the remarks that are stated back to people and the laughing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6687.435s">It</a>  comes off very condescending and very arrogant And that is not what we elected you guys to be and to act And I don't know if you notice you're getting this negative feedback Due to the way that you behave in your mannerisms the way you speak to others The looks you give it's just No one wants to hear that when they're expressing <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6717.324s">issues</a>  that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6718.765s">And</a>  I'm understanding, because I know, like they said, the vote's gonna be 6-1, it's gonna go through, and you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6730.072s">You're</a>  just basically sitting here listening to us because you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6733.815s">You</a>  have to have public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6736.496s">If</a>  you did not legally have to have it, you would be fine and you would pass everything through and you would not listen to us at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6745.222s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6747.679s">you</a>  need to show respect to gain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6752.562s">And</a>  I appreciate your time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6755.984s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6756.545s">And</a>  I would just, the clerk has noted to me that Massachusetts general does not require public body, step public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6763.289s">It</a>  is something that we choose to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6769.993s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6771.094s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6780.459s">So,</a>  I believe that you may have a you may feel that you have everyone's best interest, the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6792.981s">But</a>  I think your focus is maybe the other things are out of your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6798.246s">That's</a>  why you're focusing on these little things like getting the homeowners names and addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6804.391s">I</a>  mean, because you already have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6807.374s">And</a>  I mean, what would you try and do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6810.277s">Try</a>  and find out what we charge for rent because that's against the law and you can't do that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6817.223s">That</a>  is between me and the IRS. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6819.73s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6820.971s">It's</a>  like asking me how much I make. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6822.613s">That's</a>  none of your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6824.154s">You</a>  can request that, but you can't demand it from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6827.637s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6828.438s">So</a>  these are things that maybe you can request from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6831.14s">And</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6832.381s">If</a>  you want to send something out and request it and volunteer, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6837.264s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6838.065s">If</a>  people want to volunteer that information, that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6841.61s">But</a>  this is a democracy, and I stand by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6845.855s">We</a>  live in a democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6848.278s">And</a>  with a democracy, you can't dictate these things to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6852.583s">That's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6854.686s">And</a>  that becomes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6856.775s">communist,</a>  which I'm not accusing you of. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6860.238s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6861.379s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6861.819s">I'm</a>  not accusing you of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6864.081s">And</a>  it becomes a dictatorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6866.322s">That's</a>  against our democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6869.045s">And</a>  that's what the United States of America stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6872.287s">Okay,</a>  so now we get past that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6874.969s">There</a>  are other things in this city that you could really help us with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6879.704s">How</a>  about the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6881.365s">That's</a>  deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6883.106s">Those</a>  students are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6884.327s">My</a>  granddaughter goes to the high school at the daycare there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6888.649s">That</a>  place is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6890.85s">Even</a>  the street getting up the hill is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6893.792s">These</a>  students deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6895.873s">Why</a>  are you focusing on landlords and tenants when children are at stake? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6902.196s">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6903.657s">That's</a>  our focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6904.958s">These</a>  young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6905.898s">How</a>  about the elderly? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6907.677s">Why</a>  are we focusing on them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6908.878s">Those</a>  are the helpless. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6910.439s">I'm</a>  not helpless. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6911.679s">Tenants</a>  aren't helpless, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6914.081s">Because</a>  they have resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6916.462s">They</a>  do have resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6918.163s">In</a>  a mailing, as this other woman had suggested, send out a mailing, put it on, give the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6926.588s">I'm</a>  just beside myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6927.929s">I'm</a>  just flabbergasted with what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6931.531s">And</a>  I do believe <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6934.107s">Council</a>  has in best interest trying to get some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6939.971s">But</a>  maybe the high school is out of your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6943.213s">Maybe</a>  everything is out of your, and it's above you, and you don't know how to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6947.656s">So</a>  you're focusing on this minute stuff because that's exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6953.559s">Focus</a>  on the important stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6954.98s">That's</a>  what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6956.901s">That's</a>  what you're in charge of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6959.003s">Get</a>  our schools in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6961.98s">help</a>  our teachers, help our police department, help our firemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6967.824s">That's</a>  what you can do and you will be proud and you will have our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6974.208s">And</a>  let me tell you something, I will support you, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6977.73s">And</a>  I've lived here my entire life. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6981.772s">That's</a>  what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6982.713s">We</a>  need a council that's gonna be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6987.976s">This</a>  rental stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6990.253s">It's</a>  minor, it's minor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6992.954s">Our</a>  children and our city and bring in revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=6997.477s">There's</a>  so much revenue you can bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7000.478s">That's</a>  what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7001.979s">And</a>  you will go down in history in the city of Medford as being a great city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7006.341s">But</a>  right now, people are mocking you and laughing at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7010.363s">I</a>  know people from other cities that are mocking us and making fun of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7015.342s">saying,</a>  who was running your city council?

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7132.177s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and city council members for allowing me to participate in this important discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7139.183s">I</a>  want to reiterate without <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7143.803s">going</a>  over old rope about everything that previous speakers have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7150.184s">But</a>  focus on a couple of points that they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7154.585s">Number</a>  one, a gentleman spoke about putting together a bill and putting on a ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7161.047s">And</a>  that's an excellent idea because there are six people representing the entire city of Medford, some of whom aren't homeowners, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7171.409s">some</a>  of whom haven't been long time residents and haven't made a huge investment in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7178.951s">So</a>  I think that's a democratic way to go, is to go ahead and put together something to put on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7188.413s">Second</a>  of all, touching upon the issue of being able to contact homeowners, I was personally <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7200.43s">As</a>  a resident and as an American citizen, Democrat, offended by a notification I received in the mail, I received two of them, the last one being a notification about changing water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7219.6s">Okay,</a>  and in that it said final notice, and if you do not comply with this ordinance, then we have the right to shut off your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7235.387s">Well,</a>  I don't know who navigated and orchestrated that letter, but if they were to look at state laws and take legal input, it is illegal in the state of Massachusetts for anyone to interrupt water services to a property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7260.524s">It's</a>  a health and safety law, and it's against health and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7266.194s">Every</a>  home in the state of Massachusetts is required to have water and sewer working. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7275.58s">So</a>  you cannot threaten residents that you will cut off their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7280.743s">If</a>  they're multiple dwelling residents, then you're not only cutting off the water to the home of the owner, you're cutting it off to the renter's properties as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7295.97s">The</a>  owner has to pay for that water. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7298.832s">If</a>  you can't reach the owner, which is apparent that you can, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7304.585s">then</a>  it's against the law to threaten somebody you will cut off their water and sewage system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7311.752s">Again,</a>  I would love to support the current city council members, but again, I have to, you know, go back and support my fellow citizens and residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7323.723s">I've</a>  lived here for over 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7327.426s">I</a>  brought my son up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7329.447s">He</a>  went to Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7332.069s">He</a>  participated in all the Medford sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7336.051s">I</a>  worked on committees on these sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7339.053s">I</a>  was a primary fundraiser for the Medford Pop Warner and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7349.565s">North</a>  Medford Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7351.807s">And,</a>  you know, I love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7353.909s">There's</a>  a lot of people that love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7356.131s">And</a>  let's make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7358.713s">Let's</a>  talk about making America better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7361.515s">Let's</a>  make Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7363.977s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to participate.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7365.719s">Thank</a>  you, Maureen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7367.74s">Maureen,</a>  can we get your name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7371.103s">Say</a>  again, please.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7372.779s">get</a>  your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Maureen Dunham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7374.501s">My</a>  name is Maureen Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7376.162s">I</a>  live at 55 Ellsworth Street, North Medford, and I've been a homeowner here for 34 years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7384.188s">Thank</a>  you very much, Maureen.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7392.035s">Any</a>  further comment on this agenda item? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7397.459s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7403.057s">I</a>  just wanted to make a statement about how I think that some of our intentions are to bring ideas to the floor in a regular meeting with the intention of then discussing them further in committee, which committee meetings are also public meetings open to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7422.895s">And</a>  the idea there is there's just one agenda item that we can talk about more fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7427.774s">I</a>  think that what may be happening is that it's breeding uncertainty and confusion, which then makes people worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7437.842s">And</a>  for that reason, I'm not comfortable moving forward with this agenda, with this item tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7451.187s">Since</a>  we're in an open meeting right now, I'm comfortable speaking with the whole committee about this because we're allowed to all meet together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7458.831s">We</a>  are not usually allowed to all speak together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7461.533s">So</a>  it's really difficult for us to kind of have these strategizing meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7465.195s">But</a>  something that we have spoken about is like, let's introduce something that we know would be something that maybe we've spoken about in our <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7473.649s">campaigns</a>  or it's something that's a priority of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7476.231s">And</a>  we will start the conversation and then we'll move it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7479.414s">And</a>  when we have committee meetings, it will be, we'll have more time to discuss things and we'll be able to hammer out the details without having private conversations that violate open meeting law, which is illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7493.465s">We</a>  don't wanna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7494.446s">So</a>  what I think is happening by accident is we're drumming up fear in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7504.554s">I</a>  think maybe what might be a better move for some things going forward would be to have a really clear objective that we can bring to regular meetings and then maybe amend on the floor or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7518.663s">Just</a>  a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7520.384s">I</a>  just don't feel comfortable moving this to committee personally.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7522.886s">Not</a>  per se.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7528.029s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7533.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7533.92s">I</a>  respect my colleagues viewpoint, I think that I think what you're saying actually is in a bigger scheme, you know, we have, we should rethink how we, you know, when we have items introduced on the agenda, we send them to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7550.747s">This</a>  is how other municipalities in the state do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7553.969s">If</a>  there are other avenues to just, you know, send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7557.15s">to</a>  committee have a developed proposal before we create, you know, before we introduce it bring us to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7563.216s">I</a>  think that would be appropriate but I think that's something for us to investigate down the line, I would disagree on the conclusion with my fellow Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7571.865s">Now,</a>  I have been listening and taking a lot of notes during this during the last few, the last <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7580.114s">comments.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7581.135s">And</a>  I think there are a few buckets of questions for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7584.236s">And</a>  I, you know, I think we do have the answers for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7587.238s">I</a>  think on the question of privacy, as Councilor Callahan has stated, as is done in municipalities around the state, we wouldn't ask for tenant information that's just not done in other states or in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7600.985s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7602.526s">Here's</a>  an example of what information is collected usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7607.228s">Contact</a>  information for the property owner, property manager, number of units you're registering, and number of units at the property, dates of buying property, because there are certain laws that exempt properties because of age, and the city wouldn't want to overcharge landlords, and some fire code related items. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7630.805s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7631.507s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7632.51s">That's</a>  what's usually collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7635.799s">And</a>  I think, you know... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7639.045s">There's</a>  there's some questions another bucket of questions is, why do we need to collect this information, why do we need to create this registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7646.99s">Right</a>  now, you know, given that we might have some information but I think that's the point is we only have some of this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7653.434s">There</a>  are a lot of their landlords in the city who they might own property but that property is registered under their spouse's name right because their spouse about that property or their spouse was was a primary sign on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7666.002s">And</a>  we wouldn't be able to tell if that's a primary residence or a secondary property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7672.704s">There</a>  are a lot of cases like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7673.924s">There</a>  are also just more generally cases where we can't tell based on the tax bill whether it's owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, whether it's a primary or secondary residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7685.106s">And</a>  this would help us identify a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7689.327s">I</a>  will say another... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7694.255s">Another</a>  reason that I think we need to, another question about the functionality, about the feasibility of this that we should correct the record on is whether this is legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7707.841s">This</a>  is very clearly legal, done in many municipalities around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7712.103s">And</a>  there are legal, we can create legal methods to have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7716.565s">people</a>  register. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7717.946s">Now</a>  that answers the question of, you know, when you have these already, you have these landlords that aren't responding yet, how can we expect them to participate, we can use legal methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7728.891s">Now</a>  the last, I think the last bucket is less about the policy itself, and more about this idea of listening and sympathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7736.134s">And</a>  I actually do have sympathy for landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7738.035s">I</a>  mean, I close family members who are small landlords, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7742.077s">And</a>  when I put myself in their shoes, I want them to know about the rebates and the tax credits they can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7747.638s">And</a>  that's something that, given how they're registered on the tax bill right now, the city doesn't know that they're landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7754.459s">And</a>  they don't have a problem with the city knowing that they're a landlord, but because the city doesn't know that they're a landlord, they can't get that information about rebates and tax credits and subsidies. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7764.701s">And</a>  so I think for that reason, I would move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7767.481s">For</a>  all those reasons, I would move the question.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7770.882s">On</a>  the motion of councilor second refers the committee on planning and permitting seconded by seconded by council vice president cons Councilor Leming just Councilor Leming</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7781.308s">Just</a>  on another one of the points that was sort of brought up and some of the public discussion I would like to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7789.692s">We'll</a>  just talk a little bit about the back end of some of this stuff I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7794.754s">I</a>  know that people do tend to send a lot of emails to council members sometimes they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7801.417s">Sometimes</a>  I'm not able to reply to all of them, especially if they're on some of these <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7805.018s">hot</a>  button issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7806.739s">Some</a>  of them slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7808.34s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7809.781s">I've,</a>  excuse me, I've had, I had one experience recently in an email where a woman sent us an email about the transfer fee, and I asked if she wanted to talk on the phone about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7824.861s">You</a>  know, just I've never met her before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7826.642s">I</a>  didn't even know what she looked like, but I wanted to talk with her on the phone about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7830.845s">And</a>  she refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7832.627s">I</a>  don't know how to build bridges in a community when people refuse to even talk to me.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.28s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.941s">What</a>  I'm thinking, some of the things my fellow councils aren't understanding is <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7881.001s">The</a>  dialogue that started in January and the presentations that we've been putting forward is dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7890.663s">And</a>  what you're not listening, what you're not understanding is you have to win the trust of people for them to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7898.965s">Let</a>  me give you some hints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7903.626s">When</a>  my fellow Councilors mentioned that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7906.786s">There's</a>  7,500 people voted for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7909.368s">So</a>  that's what they're gonna support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7911.59s">That's</a>  wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7912.951s">The</a>  7,500 people, they got you elected, but you have to work for 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7919.477s">And</a>  so the dialogue that has been going on since we started here, and it's gonna continue with the next resolution, is that we're hurting our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7932.127s">We're</a>  dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7934.511s">Our</a>  city isn't good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7936.533s">Our</a>  city is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7938.995s">And</a>  the dialogue that we're spending is attacking who? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7942.578s">Homeowners.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7944.74s">Everything</a>  we've done so far, nothing of substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7948.203s">We</a>  could talk about having subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7950.385s">We</a>  could talk about all these meetings we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7952.527s">We've</a>  got nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7953.448s">We've</a>  had nothing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7955.683s">So</a>  I think what we're not understanding is what people are saying, maybe because they can't talk to me, maybe because people are reaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7961.184s">And</a>  here's the thing, it's now by the hundreds, and it's people that normally don't come to this podium, you see them tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7969.926s">Whatever</a>  you're trying to do, whatever agenda you're trying to pull out, you're hurting people, you're dividing the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7978.187s">And</a>  it's gonna go on, with everything else that we have tonight, we're gonna see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7983.956s">You're</a>  trying to justify, I respect you more than anything in the world, all of you, but you're trying to justify things, but you're not looking at the human factor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7993.201s">People</a>  aren't talking to you, because people don't trust you, Councilor Lemmie. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7997.423s">You</a>  haven't earned it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8007.991s">What</a>  I'm hearing is, what I'm hearing from a lot of people, I'm hearing a lot of hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8013.881s">People</a>  are hurting because you're attacking them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8018.564s">So</a>  what have we been talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8021.686s">What</a>  is it we've been working on? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8023.307s">What</a>  is the lesson so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8024.747s">We've</a>  talked about rent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8026.388s">We've</a>  talked about a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8027.929s">We've</a>  talked about a registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8030.19s">We've</a>  talked about how the firefighters are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8032.852s">We've</a>  done nothing yet for what the city needs, and the mayor's loving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8037.795s">The</a>  mayor has done nothing for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8040.296s">We're</a>  five years into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8043.035s">And</a>  no matter what happens, this council, I've been around the council 18 years now, whether it's school committee, city council, we've made sure we've at least been the voice so people can, they can come and talk to us because no one's listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8058.219s">That's</a>  what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8060.34s">That's</a>  what everybody's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8061.42s">The</a>  undertone here, is it really about a registry? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8065.462s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8067.406s">Please,</a>  it gets out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8070.548s">Listen,</a>  I don't like the fact that people yell out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8073.57s">I</a>  think it's just a poor way to get things through. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8076.272s">But</a>  here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8077.973s">Right</a>  now, that's how they feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8079.253s">They're</a>  angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8083.136s">And</a>  maybe some of you don't know, because I don't want to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8085.897s">It</a>  doesn't matter if you lived here a day or 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8088.599s">I</a>  hate to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8090.606s">Because</a>  everybody, everybody's a method Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8092.847s">Everybody's</a>  a family in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8094.688s">But</a>  right now we're doing nothing but dividing, trying to find a way to deceive and divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8101.311s">You</a>  don't even see it, but it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8102.832s">She's</a>  usually as a marionette. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8104.373s">She's</a>  like with puppets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8107.414s">With</a>  everything's going on in the city, the city's a mess and people aren't happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8110.336s">And</a>  we're talking about registries. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8113.217s">This</a>  is what we're saying, people are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8115.999s">This</a>  Mia doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8117.419s">And</a>  she's using us as pawns. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8123.137s">So</a>  believe me, publicly, I'm going to tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8128.56s">I</a>  despise the fact that it's George Scarpelli against the rest of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8133.903s">I</a>  hate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8134.803s">I</a>  don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8136.464s">I</a>  want the seven of us to do great things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8139.426s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8141.066s">And</a>  we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8142.631s">No,</a>  people can talk negatively about you, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8145.473s">We</a>  have done some great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8147.355s">We</a>  have done some great things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8149.596s">But</a>  it's all being overshadowed now by dividing, picking and choosing my group and your group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8156.462s">And</a>  things are going to come out tonight that's going to prove to that it's going to show to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8160.545s">Look</a>  what she's done to the fighting department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8162.647s">Look</a>  what she's done to this council with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8165.472s">So</a>  again, this is just another piece that's dividing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8169.493s">And</a>  Councilor Leming, you're an educated person, you're involved, appreciate that you ran, but you have to understand, people here are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8180.375s">This</a>  city is hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8181.295s">This</a>  city, whether you wanna believe it or not, is divided more than I've ever seen in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8186.035s">And</a>  we could put a dog and pony show and put lipstick on a pig, and we could do little parades and think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8191.916s">It's</a>  not hitting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8193.377s">We</a>  represent everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8196.001s">whether</a>  you like me or not, I'm still gonna fight for people that don't like me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8202.907s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8207.331s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8214.857s">I</a>  hear everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8219.021s">And</a>  I think what I'm struggling with is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8224.702s">My</a>  understanding of how we work on policies is we bring a suggestion for something that we might pass in a year or two years or six months or whatever, we bring it here to get it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8240.436s">Now,</a>  any policy, whatever policy that is, it is by definition, it is not totally worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8250.043s">Not</a>  all of the answers are there, because this is how we create policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8255.264s">We</a>  create policy by giving it a number, and then by sending it through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8259.466s">And</a>  that process, and tell me if I'm wrong, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8263.547s">That</a>  process involves three public hearings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8267.908s">It</a>  has to go through first reading, second reading, third, something like that, after it's been written.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8273.633s">after</a>  all the committee meetings.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8274.854s">After</a>  all of the committee meetings, it involves three times that it has to appear before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8280.677s">And</a>  that's when the answer, when all of the questions, when it's been worked through with the staff, with, you know, in committee with the public, with, you know, whatever sort of listening sessions and other things that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8295.104s">So</a>  what I'm struggling with is, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8298.206s">You</a>  know, we're bringing things here to give it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8303.188s">And</a>  what that does is it allows us to then begin the process of discussing it publicly where everyone is welcome for many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8312.993s">And</a>  I think for the, like the leaf blower ordinance, we had eight or nine, was it nine public meetings about it?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8321.317s">Leaf</a>  blower was five, budget was seven.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8324.844s">I</a>  thought that we had the eighth leaf blower like public swap but we had a lot of meetings.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8329.928s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8330.608s">So,</a>  I think what I'm trying to say is, this is the second time since I've been a city council which is like three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8340.97s">people</a>  come, dozens of people come to the meeting to prevent us from ever being able to discuss a policy and we're being accused of not knowing all of the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8354.381s">Well,</a>  the reason that we have this process is so that we can include the public in the entire discussion of every aspect of it and every detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8365.109s">So</a>  what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8370.06s">And</a>  I will say, I'm saddened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8372.941s">I'm</a>  very saddened that I now seem to be on the receiving end of something where, specifically for in-town landlords, I have for years talked about how in-town landlords are the people that we want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8393.071s">And</a>  there's video of me from years ago <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8397.89s">So,</a>  like, this is, I just want to know we're coming up on the 15 minute limit for the previous question today, you have about a minute, then I want to go a minute but that's what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the conversation, so that we can talk about it for many months in open public committee meetings, and then we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8416.795s">the</a>  three public hearings in the city council, all of which are designed to answer those detailed questions and for you to have input on those answers, those questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8426.781s">So</a>  that's what I'm struggling to get to is the point where we can actually discuss this rather than having it shut down before anyone is allowed to discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8435.947s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8437.267s">So</a>  we're at about two minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8439.068s">It's</a>  by the City Council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8440.368s">There's</a>  15 minutes to debate the call for the previous question of Councilor Tseng, and the discussion remains to Councilors only. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8446.529s">So</a>  we have one minute left on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8447.669s">Are</a>  there any other Councilors who'd like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8450.07s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8452.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8457.231s">Vice</a>  President Collins, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8458.512s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8459.512s">Thank</a>  you for letting me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8462.873s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion from my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8465.254s">I</a>  appreciate everybody who's come to the podium to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8467.754s">I</a>  am aware that hearing people tonight, people feel like they're not being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8474.316s">I'm</a>  also aware that there's probably not a lot that I can say that people believe, such as when I say that everything that people have spoken to, I'm listening to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8484.199s">I</a>  won't speak for my fellow Councilors, but I know it's true for them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8487.159s">We're</a>  listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8488.48s">I'm</a>  taking notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8490.438s">We</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8491.698s">I'll</a>  echo what Councilor Callahan said. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8493.419s">I</a>  think that engaging in every part of this process is important, taking note of things that really concern people with this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8501.36s">For</a>  example, people are wondering, does this include compromising information? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8505.661s">I</a>  don't think it does, but I think that's something for us to talk about in committee and make crystal clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8509.681s">People</a>  are saying, why is this necessary when I know that you have info about property owners already?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8514.842s">I</a>  think that's- I think Councilor Collins, you have about 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8516.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8517.523s">I</a>  think that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8518.843s">I</a>  think that's a great question and we should look at okay, what really needs to be added to augment already already have, I think the most salient thing for me, all the folks in this room that are property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8530.41s">I</a>  think Councilor Callahan made it really clear at the beginning, that's not who we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8534.633s">people</a>  said, we know that there are property owners in this community that are hurting neighbors as well as tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8540.915s">They're</a>  not the folks who are here talking about how much work they're putting into their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8544.556s">Those</a>  are the folks that we can't reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8546.257s">And</a>  those are the folks that we need to be able to reach that we make sure that they are contributing to the community the way that all of you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8553.679s">I</a>  think this is, I know we're coming up on my time limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8556.38s">That's</a>  why I think this is worth considering further so that we can get into the concerns that were raised tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8563.749s">and</a>  elucidate them and get that clarity and have those discussions with everybody who we already know is interested in this conversation and all the people that we didn't hear from tonight, because those perspectives need to be- Thank you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8573.796s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8574.536s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to call the previous question and debate and move to a final vote, seconded by Council Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8582.662s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8586.524s">This</a>  is to end debate for previous question.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.349s">Councilor</a>  Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.829s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8590.21s">This</a>  is a thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8591.43s">It's</a>  the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8591.911s">He</a>  called the question and that were initiates a period of 15 minutes of debate among the council, after which by majority vote, we will move to a final vote.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8778.647s">I</a>  am on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8779.468s">You</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8780.168s">I</a>  will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8784.272s">Oh,</a>  I'm not on Zoom anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8786.414s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8788.616s">Sorry,</a>  I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8790.537s">Nevermind.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8791.478s">I</a>  think Councilor Leming might have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8792.719s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8795.021s">Okay,</a>  well, we'll share it in a second.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8797.543s">There's</a>  an attachment to... Please take your conversations outside if you're gonna have private conversations in the chamber.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8804.462s">There's</a>  an attachment to this rule change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8805.963s">So</a>  I appreciate president bears reading the original rule because the thing that we changed is that we just changed the first sentence from five minutes to two minutes and added a sentence saying public participation shall not exceed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8823.893s">If</a>  folks could take their private conversations out into the, into the rotunda, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8835.575s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Zari. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8836.321s">You</a>  may continue.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8838.066s">public</a>  participation shall not exceed 90 minutes per agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8841.127s">So</a>  during a single meeting, and we added additionally that interested parties can also contribute written comment on agenda items via an online form, which would mean that we would have to create that, that would imply that we would be adding that to our, the way that we, our methods of communication with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8861.651s">And</a>  a paper form in the office of the city clerk would also be, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8867.012s">something</a>  that we would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8869.573s">There's</a>  been a spill in the chambers, so I'm distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8874.374s">So</a>  there are a lot of ways that people can contact the City Council right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8878.495s">This</a>  is not a strategy to limit public participation so much as it's a way for us to carry on the business of the City Council, hear from people in a way that does not <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8894.72s">That</a>  is more efficient, more democratic and allows more people to feel comfortable speaking with city Councilors and making sure their voices are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8905.389s">Something</a>  I wanted to mention at the beginning of my remarks is that the, the way that we operate in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8912.034s">as</a>  a city council is that we're representative democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8915.616s">Like</a>  we got voted in and we're supposed to be debating amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8918.817s">We're</a>  never meant to be debating with the public because we would never have time to debate with every resident in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8925.219s">There</a>  just isn't time for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8927.3s">We're</a>  not supposed to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8928.621s">We're</a>  supposed to hear a specific period of time of public comment, and then we are supposed to debate together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8936.844s">we're</a>  going to have to come to an agreement amongst ourselves and then land on a conclusion and take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8942.327s">So,</a>  uh, this the goal of this resolution is to get us closer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8947.35s">The</a>  reason I have this pulled up is because, uh, we did some research and we pulled up the cities surrounding our region <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8965.293s">One</a>  of the most permissive of the area for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8970.517s">Many</a>  cities just have one section when I say public comment I mean that's one section of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8977.242s">We</a>  would have an opportunity for the public to speak after every agenda item which only one other city has, which is revere and. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8986.638s">says</a>  a few minutes, it's like one to two minutes in the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8990.32s">But</a>  other all the other cities have one city, you have to be sponsored, many, you have to sign up in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8997.183s">So</a>  if something triggers you that you're sitting in the chambers, and you say, Oh, that's interesting, I would want to speak on that you and you stand up and you say, No, you can't you have to sign up by like the Friday beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9011.407s">and</a>  have prepared remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9013.129s">So</a>  a lot of that stuff is very different in Medford and that's something we don't want to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9018.514s">That's</a>  important to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9020.055s">And</a>  the other thing to keep in mind is that there are opportunities to communicate with city councilors and integrate opinions of the public prior to city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9036.246s">that</a>  I think are more effective at getting messages across that are not included in public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9045.028s">For</a>  instance, I actually would like to make a motion to amend this resolution to be three minutes instead of two minutes based on feedback that I've received.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9054.191s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9057.312s">And</a>  that's all I have to say for now, but I appreciate the support of Councilor Leming and Councilor Tseng as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9063.453s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9064.534s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9067.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9067.774s">So</a>  my reason for co sponsoring this is really just I mean, it's pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9072.778s">We've</a>  had a couple of meetings that have gone on till very late this term, it seems to be a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9079.803s">Last</a>  time on March 12, a lot of people who came up for public comment were saying rightfully so that they didn't want to have to wait so long to offer their public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9091.053s">Even</a>  now, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9092.874s">and</a>  a half hours into the meeting that we're that we're discussing this, and I would personally favor, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9101.201s">More</a>  efficient meetings to accommodate these agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9108.287s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9110.469s">And</a>  I look forward to continue to listen to continue</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9122.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9122.473s">Um,</a>  I really want to highlight again that there are three changes with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9128.098s">The</a>  first one is the switch to a three minute speaking period per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9134.964s">As</a>  you've amended on the floor, the resolution says two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9140.949s">We've</a>  heard feedback from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9142.591s">There's</a>  been extensive discussions about what is an appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9146.694s">And</a>  a lot of folks who have asked us, reached out to us and contacted us to ask us to consider lengthening it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9154.201s">And</a>  so I'm very happy that you've been open to changing it to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9159.565s">I</a>  think the second change is the 90 minute upper limit, which you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9164.689s">And</a>  the third change is creating a new channel for people to get their records entered into the public, the formal record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9172.835s">And</a>  so I think a lot of folks don't realize what they call us or email us before a meeting that's not entered into the official record on something, but unless they ask us to read that into record or enter that into the record, this would create an easier mechanism <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9187.606s">both</a>  in person and online to enter their comments into the formal record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9194.472s">And</a>  so we're creating an online form and an in-person form to be put into the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9202.279s">I</a>  think this idea of new channels is really important because it goes to the idea of restructuring. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9209.025s">There</a>  are some things that won't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9210.726s">We</a>  will still have the general public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9213.288s">We</a>  would still have the general public participation section at the end of the meetings where folks are free to say whatever they want and free to speak for the times they desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9229.815s">But</a>  we also recognize the need to restructure because of the need to democratize the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9235.758s">Now,</a>  I've done quite a lot of work for a professor at the Kennedy School who's working on democratizing local government and state governments and working on ideas of how to restructure public participation processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9252.708s">There's</a>  been a lot of formal critiques and research out there that shows that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9257.31s">The</a>  way that public participation is done, especially in Massachusetts, there's a very lengthy thesis about this, a very lengthy published paper from Harvard Law and from the American Bar Association that shows that how public participation is often done in Massachusetts disadvantages those who support ideas, who support the ideas put on the agenda, disadvantages those who aren't able to make a meeting time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9281.907s">who</a>  aren't able to come to a 7pm meeting on a Tuesday because they might be working or they need to wake up early, they have children to take care of and they can't participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9293.053s">The</a>  way that it's done right now also disadvantages folks who want to speak on an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9298.496s">but</a>  don't feel like they're empowered to because many folks in the room might oppose their viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9306.7s">Leading</a>  actually, in fact, to a limitation of their First Amendment right to free speech because it <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9312.88s">it</a>  limits their ability to speak up without feeling threatened by a member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9322.466s">We're</a>  empowered by numerous federal court cases to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9327.349s">The</a>  Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges versus Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9331.712s">There's</a>  a Chesterfield City Planning Commission court case as well, where the courts actually ask <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9338.416s">Um,</a>  and I would urge, um, city <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9343.926s">to</a>  be wise in designing their public participation processes and empower the city to do that and ask us to create alternative channels, which we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9354.472s">And</a>  I forgot to mention one really important alternative channel that we are creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9360.055s">Councilor</a>  Callahan and Lazzaro and I have been working on a resolution on this agenda to create listening sessions for the city council through the public engagement committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9370.76s">And</a>  so what we're saying is you can still speak up about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9375.203s">You</a>  can still get your comment entered on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9377.784s">We're</a>  going to restructure how that's done so that other folks who want to speak on an item can speak, and they don't have to wait till too too late in the night to speak.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9388.151s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9390.913s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9392.393s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9397.077s">I</a>  appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9399.538s">I</a>  also appreciate the motion on the floor to amend it from two minutes to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9402.959s">I</a>  think that's welcome change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9404.3s">Two</a>  minutes feels a bit too much of a cut right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9408.341s">I</a>  think three minutes is more reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9410.562s">I</a>  think that for myself is supportable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9413.163s">My</a>  reasons are the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9415.143s">I</a>  think that this is a tweak that will <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9418.113s">help</a>  more people to participate in our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9420.835s">I</a>  can hear the response in my head and also slightly from the chambers of another way of looking at this, which is, you know, gosh, those jerks are really tired of long meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9431.844s">We</a>  know the job that we signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9433.185s">Sorry,</a>  I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9434.567s">I</a>  know the job that I signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9436.188s">We</a>  have a lot of long nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9437.989s">I</a>  know how to prep for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9439.33s">I</a>  drink coffee in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9440.431s">I</a>  eat before the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9441.732s">I'm</a>  paid to listen to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9442.953s">I'm</a>  gonna do that if we have to be here till 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9445.035s">every</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9446.076s">That's</a>  the job, committed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9447.776s">What</a>  I think is not okay is we're experiencing a tension between wanting to optimize for the number for people being able to speak at the length that they choose and wanting to make it possible for more people to speak at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9462.365s">And</a>  I think for a lot of meetings in a row, we've experienced people not being able to say their piece, people showing up and tending to speak and having to leave early because they have to get up for work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9471.23s">They</a>  have to go put their child to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9473.3s">any</a>  other reason, they can't stay up until midnight with us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9476.762s">I</a>  just saw it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9477.582s">I</a>  know there are some folks here to speak on a later resolution who said, I could speak if it comes up before 9.30, it's 9.40, they can't be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9486.567s">And</a>  I think that that is, I think that that leaves people out of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9490.549s">I</a>  think that this is a way that we can make a small tweak to finesse this one avenue for participation that could have the result of allowing more people to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9502.679s">concurrently,</a>  I think that we can always do a better job of publicizing the various ways, other ways that residents can let their feelings be known with Councilors, which as Councilor Tseng noted, we still have the public participation section at the end of every agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9517.25s">Our</a>  information is public on the city website all the time, and I'm always really grateful to people who make use of that and always encourage more people to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9525.597s">People</a>  can submit comments to the president, to the city clerk to have them entered into the minutes or to be read aloud into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9533.375s">I</a>  also do want to note that like all of our other rules that are governing this body, this is enforced at the discretion of the chair, whoever that may be, which gives us the option to make exceptions where the need arises or where the space arises. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9547.825s">For</a>  example, when we have a short agenda and aren't under time pressures, we can give everybody a little bit more breathing room in the event of, you know, I've heard from other communities, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9559.497s">using</a>  that discretion to allow more time for people with speech disabilities who do need more time to say their piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9565.139s">And</a>  I think this gives us a tool to allow more people to come to the podium, if that's the avenue that they want to share their feelings with the council, while still giving us the flexibility and doubling down on our other ways for having residents communicate with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9579.805s">So</a>  I'll support the motion to move this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9583.927s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9585.347s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9587.728s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9589.687s">Wow.</a> </p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9626.677s">You've</a>  eliminated people, they've walked away. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9629.038s">Parents</a>  have left the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9631.359s">There's</a>  no voice there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9634.04s">You're</a>  saying this isn't limiting? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9635.341s">The</a>  more people are gonna talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9638.803s">You</a>  just saw what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9640.723s">Whether</a>  they liked it or not, they expressed themselves and people left. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9644.725s">At</a>  least they left fulfilled that they had a place to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9649.295s">but</a>  now we're gonna implement the three minute time limit and the 90 minute hired stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9656.139s">Come</a>  on, it's embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9660.481s">We</a>  were elected for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9662.642s">We're</a>  like for the people of city of Medford, just cause it's inconvenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9665.924s">You</a>  can make, you can say anything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9667.945s">A</a>  listening group, this is a listening group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9670.887s">We</a>  don't have to invent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9672.788s">This</a>  is a listening group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9674.869s">So</a>  you wanna talk about different, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9678.527s">You</a>  want to talk about different, we have so many other meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9681.329s">You've</a>  been to these subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9683.43s">It's</a>  packed, right?

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9731.62s">Let</a>  them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9733.142s">This</a>  is their forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9736.484s">They</a>  didn't make the choice to only go once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9739.719s">once,</a>  twice a month, that was this council's choice, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9745.901s">So</a>  when you put things up there, be honest, because those communities, they meet every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9752.063s">They</a>  have a forum every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9755.504s">All</a>  we did tonight, after you vote this in tonight, all you've done again is devalue what people want and what people are about in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9766.527s">So</a>  people reached out, told you three minutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9769.906s">I</a>  get 1,000 phone calls, people are disgusted about this, and they're not coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9774.33s">You're</a>  forcing them not to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9775.811s">Maybe</a>  that's what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9776.831s">You</a>  say that's not what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9780.534s">But</a>  that's exactly what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9785.338s">I'm</a>  disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9786.039s">It's</a>  the first time I feel ashamed of being part of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9790.002s">You're</a>  shutting people up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9792.584s">You're</a>  dismissing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9796.24s">You're</a>  going to keep coming back and forth with resolutions that you're putting forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9799.482s">And</a>  that's not business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9800.803s">That's</a>  your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9801.743s">That's</a>  your agenda business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9804.005s">Our</a>  city is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9805.025s">And</a>  I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9806.466s">We've</a>  done nothing to conquer anything in this community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9810.749s">We're</a>  going to go to budget season with the mayor that's dictated what's going on and what we're going to do with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9816.552s">And</a>  we don't even know what we're doing with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9819.434s">But</a>  I'm glad you put this working group together that was hidden. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9822.275s">I</a>  didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9828.203s">This</a>  is disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9830.744s">Every</a>  single resolution's coming forward now is hurting people and dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9837.647s">I</a>  can only sit back and talk to people and say, hey, listen, these are good people, which you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9843.449s">They're</a>  my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9847.871s">So</a>  don't tell me you all haven't talked about it because you have, not illegally, but you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9853.666s">I</a>  haven't talked to the mayor about any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9855.126s">It's</a>  the first time I've heard every resolution you people are putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9859.767s">And</a>  it's doing nothing but dividing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9863.088s">So</a>  like I said, you can spin it any way you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9866.309s">The</a>  bottom line is people are gonna speak less time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9870.249s">People</a>  can only talk for 90 minutes instead of when they feel like they're content and they can walk away and go to sleep at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9881.452s">And</a>  for what, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9884.457s">All</a>  you're doing is hurting the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9887.321s">Keep</a>  following the mayor, you're hurting the city.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9898.045s">Oh,</a>  so I was, I'm not actually in favor of reducing the amount of time that people, so I would have done this differently, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9908.392s">I</a>  do think that having, and I've looked at some other cities, I have to say, I am so happy that we do something that I have not seen really anywhere else, I guess maybe Revere does it, but that we let people speak on every single agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9922.765s">Most</a>  cities, there's one public comment period that applies to like anything that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9929.748s">You</a>  have your two minutes during that public comment period and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9933.829s">And</a>  you don't get to be there when they're debating the whole rest of, while they're debating the body is debating that particular agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9940.812s">So</a>  I love that we do that and I think that we should keep that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9943.673s">I'm</a>  glad this doesn't in any way get rid of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9947.515s">I</a>  do think that meetings that go to one, two, three o'clock in the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9951.94s">the</a>  poor people who have to speak on a topic that doesn't come up until after midnight, like that's also, that's just not good democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9963.73s">The</a>  way I would have done it, and I don't know how much people are open to changes on the floor, but I think that we should have a limit on the end time of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9978.522s">And</a>  if we limit the end time of the meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9982.037s">So</a>  that nobody has to stay up until you know one o'clock in the morning to be heard on their on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9989.713s">Then,</a>  allowing the chair, which I think we already have as an option to before any public participation to declare hey like there's 100 people in the room for this item, we're going to leave it to and we and this is currently our policy anyway that we have done for this item, we're going to have two minutes per issue we did that you know a number of weeks ago for a different issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10014.153s">And</a>  that the chair can do that in order to meet the deadline of the midnight 1231 o'clock whatever it is that we decide is the final hour that this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10023.782s">that</a>  the city council meetings end on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10026.064s">So</a>  that's where I would go with it is have like a meeting end time so that nobody has to stay up till one o'clock in the morning just to speak on their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10035.189s">The</a>  other possibility is to let public comment happen at the beginning and then have it apply to all of the agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10041.172s">That's</a>  very common. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10042.853s">And</a>  then nobody, no members of the public have to stay until midnight, one o'clock in the morning in order to speak on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10052.261s">So</a>  I think there are other ways to go that would let people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10061.471s">I'm</a>  just not sure that this is the one that I, I'm not sure that I love this one.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10147.997s">And</a>  I didn't come up and say that certain people should be allowed to make decisions and other people shouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10152.179s">And</a>  I certainly didn't say that when people are elected to public office, that they should be forced and required and demanded to have the legitimacy of our government disrespected on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10167.347s">Now,</a>  when we talk about what this council has been doing for three months now, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10172.81s">We</a>  put forth a governing agenda in a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10175.631s">No</a>  council has ever done that before in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10178.052s">We</a>  put every item we wanted to work on for the next two years in that document and made it public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10181.794s">We</a>  talked about it at multiple meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10183.975s">We</a>  announced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10185.536s">We</a>  said, here's everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10186.516s">What</a>  was in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10187.056s">A</a>  rental registry was in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10189.215s">rent</a>  stabilization was in that transfer fee was in that prop two and a half was in that a new Medford High School was in that fixing the roads and sidewalks was in that everything that everyone has talked about tonight that we want to do was in that document and it passed this body unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10203.5s">And</a>  it was put out publicly I will speak Thank you and you can wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10208.394s">I'm</a>  not being rude, you're being rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10209.895s">You</a>  need to have basic respect and decency for your government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10214.379s">These</a>  people were elected, me and these six people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10217.422s">You</a>  don't see me sitting here and saying, George, shut up, and allowing people to yell. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10221.825s">Yes,</a>  please wait, thank you, please wait, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10225.028s">Now,</a>  we did that, never been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10227.951s">We</a>  said what we wanted to do, and that's after we've campaigned and we've talked to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10234.176s">We</a>  disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10236.363s">We</a>  could sit here for three days and never take a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10241.264s">And</a>  at the end of that, we could hear from everybody 50 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10244.705s">There</a>  are things we are going to disagree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10248.106s">That</a>  is what living in a society means. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10251.767s">And</a>  the way that we work through those disagreements is the democratic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10256.229s">We</a>  have a democratic process in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10258.669s">It's</a>  called an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10260.53s">People</a>  won an election and those people are doing what they believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10265.271s">I'm</a>  one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10266.472s">I</a>  know there are people who won an election in this room who disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10270.374s">And</a>  they say on some things, I don't know, maybe not all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10274.896s">We've</a>  disagreed at the podium before, I'll at least say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10277.337s">And</a>  George and I have had many a disagreement in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10280.278s">I</a>  hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10282.279s">I</a>  listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10282.92s">I</a>  try to take it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10284.02s">Sometimes</a>  I change what I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10285.441s">Sometimes</a>  I make an amendment to my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10287.802s">Sometimes</a>  we find a different answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10289.863s">Sometimes</a>  we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10291.758s">We</a>  were on the opposite ends of this for two years, where I was on the end of a lot of 5-2 votes, where I lost, and I didn't go out at the end of the day and say, oh, these people, they're bad Councilors, and I don't like serving with them, and I don't think they're my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10305.149s">How</a>  many times have I gone and defended George or Rick or John or Adam to people who think they're the worst person in the world? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10312.414s">And</a>  I say, no, I sat next to them, and they have their best intents at heart, and so do I. And sometimes we disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10320.922s">There</a>  are rules in place to allow the public business to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10324.664s">There</a>  are state laws that govern this process their city council rules, and quite frankly, cancer Collins is right, unless this council chooses, they want to remove me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10334.696s">State</a>  law gives me, as the chair of this body and the chair of the meeting, the ultimate authority on any public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10341.999s">If</a>  I really wanted to silence everybody, I could stand there and bully my minions, as people think they are, and say, I'll stand here and public participation's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10351.902s">And</a>  you vote me out of this chair if you don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10355.031s">And</a>  you know, my minions will do it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10356.932s">Because</a>  they just think the way that I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10359.154s">And</a>  everything I say, we sit here and we put our minds into telepathy and we connect us, the six of us, and we all vote the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10366.939s">We</a>  all believe the same thing because it's a cult of personality. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10371.283s">And</a>  that's what happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10373.244s">I</a>  could do that if I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10375.926s">I</a>  don't do that because I value the public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10379.268s">I</a>  may not support this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10381.89s">You</a>  don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10383.769s">What</a>  I can tell you is that in 2022, 6-0, the council voted on a final rules package that reduced public participation from 10 minutes to five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10395.354s">And</a>  where was the outrage in 2022 when this council reduced from 10 to five, and now we wanna go from five to three? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10400.936s">Because</a>  a lot of people wanna talk, and a lot of people get in touch with me and say, I'm not coming to a meeting, I can't wait till 10 p.m., I got things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10408.199s">There's</a>  a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10411.04s">Just</a>  because you show up here in this room, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10413.837s">even</a>  if it's 100 to one, it doesn't mean that you're representing all the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10418.981s">It</a>  just doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10421.823s">There</a>  was a night proposal in 2022 to create a public forum that's mentioned here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10427.387s">Some</a>  other cities and towns do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10428.568s">We</a>  didn't vote for it at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10430.229s">The</a>  more I think about it, the more I think it might be the fairest way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10432.991s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10434.032s">I</a>  like the idea of Councilor Callahan to entertain alternatives, but I'm also gonna respect if there's a vote tonight that I'm on the wrong end of, I lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10442.895s">Am</a>  I gonna get furious? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10443.836s">Am</a>  I gonna scream? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10444.536s">Am</a>  I gonna shout? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10445.197s">Am</a>  I gonna say that we should storm the castle and take the back of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10450.762s">And</a>  these people are just, where did they come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10454.304s">And</a>  they don't care about Medford, they don't love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10458.688s">We</a>  agree to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10461.35s">And</a>  what people call division is disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10465.354s">We</a>  can listen, we can hear, we can sit there for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10469.574s">And</a>  at the end of it, I know we've all experienced it in our families, with our friends, with our colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10476.138s">We</a>  may not agree at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10478.239s">What's</a>  important is that we respect the systems and structures that we have created to work through the difficulties of these decisions, the democratic process, the elections of representatives to take votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10490.936s">That</a>  is how this process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10492.998s">If</a>  you want to change that process, run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10496.12s">If</a>  you want to change that process, go tell the Charter Committee to change the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10500.443s">If</a>  you want to change that process, there are myriad ways to petition your government for the redress of your grievances, but it does not entitle anyone, anyone to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10511.164s">say</a>  that I can talk for as much as I want, and I can say whatever I want, and that I shouldn't have to respect, because it's actually the disrespect of the people and the institution that degrades community trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10523.349s">So</a>  when we can't talk to each other across our divisions and differences, there are plenty of people who I've talked to on the phone for an hour, and we were no closer at the end of that hour than we were at the beginning, and they said, you didn't hear me, you didn't listen to me, but I'll talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10537.924s">It</a>  doesn't mean I'm going to change my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10539.429s">And</a>  there's a lot of people in this room I don't think I'm ever going to get to agree with everything I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10542.879s">And</a>  I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10544.957s">But</a>  that's what this process is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10547.138s">And</a>  at the end of the day, maybe this isn't the right approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10550.381s">Maybe</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10551.141s">We'll</a>  see how I vote at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10553.483s">But</a>  that's the vision of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10555.564s">We</a>  are being as transparent as we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10558.446s">We</a>  are entertaining and engaging with residents in myriad ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10562.048s">We</a>  are having these public comment sessions on our issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10565.831s">The</a>  way that every legislative body in the history of the world works is that a proposal is initiated, it's sent to committee, and we have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10573.922s">We</a>  have a lot of people online said, hey, we should just have one topic meetings when there's a lot of people who are interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10578.669s">There</a>  are, they're called committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10580.712s">When</a>  this goes to committee, when what just went to committee rental registry, we'll have a meeting on the rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10585.54s">We'll</a>  have another four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10587.537s">and</a>  we'll talk about it, and maybe we'll disagree, and maybe at the end of this two years, so many people will disagree with six of us, that three of us will lose, and three more people will come on, and they'll repeal what we did, or they'll try, and I welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10599.962s">That</a>  is what democracy is, and I invite anyone to participate in good faith in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10605.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10610.327s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cassidy.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10612.808s">Any</a>  further comment from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10616.37s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10618.561s">I</a>  just want to be slightly more clear than what I said before, which is I would actually really like to discuss this, to be able to come up with some other ideas in committee rather than voting on this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10632.216s">So</a>  that'd be my preference.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10636.461s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10636.881s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10638.063s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[GOUOtu3l1ks_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10643.564s">Patrick</a>  Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10646.466s">I</a>  actually like this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10648.608s">I</a>  thank the Councilors that put it forward for putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10654.133s">But</a>  I also think it's half the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10655.934s">So</a>  I do think that people tend to, not everyone, but a lot of people tend to bloviate and they tend to like a gas fill whatever space is given to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10665.923s">And</a>  I think that Medford is going through a tough time of transition and transformation right now, and that we're pretty dysfunctional. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10674.751s">And</a>  so I do think that it is important to have some measures like this in place to, to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10683.584s">rain</a>  people in a bit and I think in a functional city, you have the public and the governing bodies, holding each other accountable, as well as having some degree of self regulation but you can always rely on the self regulation so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10699.111s">I</a>  like what was put forward, and I like that Councilor Callahan suggested some alternatives to it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10707.193s">The</a>  other half of this, though, is that I think that the council should potentially consider, and the committee's address is part of this, but putting maybe less agenda items per agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10718.396s">And</a>  then the second thing, and I've mentioned this before, is staying within the realm of local issues, because bringing in national and global issues as well <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10727.978s">a</a>  couple weeks back, Gaza and the embargo in Cuba, tonight talking about some of the big oil company issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10739.444s">Those</a>  might touch on local issues to some extent, but I think that it also massively extends the conversation beyond the local purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10750.689s">And</a>  we'll, as time goes on, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10756.092s">very</a>  much track, like even if everything that was talked about here was put into effect, I think that it would still extend the conversation into the hours of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10765.854s">So</a>  something that I've been focusing on on the side is just filling the communications and information void in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10774.175s">And</a>  if outside of council, some of the councillors wanted to talk to me on how to better reach the public in certain ways, I'd be open to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10782.617s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10785.981s">We're</a>  gonna go to Zoom.</p>

    <p>[GOUOtu3l1ks_SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10786.441s">We're</a>  gonna go- And that was two and a half minutes, by the way.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10788.283s">You</a>  did great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10788.783s">I</a>  clocked it at 2.20. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10792.226s">We're</a>  gonna go to, and if folks, you can see, there's a little timer in the top right of the screen when I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10799.231s">Gonna</a>  go to Haley Carr on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10801.312s">You</a>  have five minutes, Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10802.773s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10806.876s">Haley</a>  Carr, 68 Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10811.616s">President</a>  Bears I've known you probably since the early 2000s, let's say when we were kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10818.685s">I</a>  never saw you being president of this council on my bingo card for any time soon, but I respect you for the position and it's definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10831.71s">a</a>  difficult one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10833.231s">However,</a>  I the reason why I hopped on to zoom tonight is because a few hours ago now my father spoke, who has been a citizen of the city for about 60 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10848.405s">And</a>  it seems like it's a common theme for many of you on council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10855.393s">to</a>  smirk or think that some of these citizens with real grievances based on the proposals that you're bringing forward aren't to be taken seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10869.923s">And</a>  I think that this agenda item just further serves that idea that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10878.402s">You</a>  want you say you want to listen to the public and you say you want to you know in return be respected by the public and and limit their Ability to come up and talk because it can get out of hand and what have you but it's a total total oxymoron and It just shows <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10898.433s">You</a>  know You just sat here and gave this this this long monologue, uh president bears and you said that you do have the ultimate authority and if you wanted to Exercise that authority you very well could and to me as a citizen a tax paying Citizen, I own property here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10920.463s">That</a>  sounds like a threat and I don't know why you think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10928.988s">Not</a>  a divide in this city and why? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10931.992s">You</a>  many of you can't fathom that so many people are outraged about the things that you're all proposing And the division really comes from the way that you and other council members and school committee members ran your election I've been involved <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10949.312s">In</a>  politics since I was seven years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10952.353s">I</a>  was holding signs for my grandfather. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10954.194s">I</a>  was Participating in the recount when he got in for his second term So I have a i've watched my father run campaigns over the years for certain individuals I have an idea of what i'm talking about And when I tell you i've never seen a campaign run the way that your our revolution our revolution group did this past election term <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10977.063s">Whatever</a>  you sent out a pamphlet of however many individuals telling people go out and vote for the we all have the same ideas This is what we stand for go out our resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10989.347s">We</a>  follow this national agenda and That's where the division stemmed from And it's great that you said that you passed some sort of agenda for the the next two years about the high school and the the roads and <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11005.812s">Medford</a>  Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11007.675s">I</a>  don't know why those issues weren't on the forefront of this year starting in January when you all took an oath and got sworn in again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11016.55s">I</a>  don't know why the first <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11019.175s">Things</a>  on the agenda had to be things that absolutely outrage majority of the citizens in medford and property owners And you're shocked that they're outraged I don't know why you didn't come out the gate with these ideas you have about a new high school about you know <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11039.972s">Medford</a>  square like somebody said medford square add a few more restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11044.214s">That's</a>  where you'll get taxed You have one minute i'm aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11047.416s">I</a>  can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11047.996s">Thank</a>  you And i'm just kind of perplexed that you're perplexed that you you can't see how hypocritical this whole thing has become and <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11061.482s">People</a>  don't trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11063.722s">There</a>  seems to be a lack of transparency when it comes to, Councilor Scarpelli said he's not even aware of some of these things that are being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11072.084s">You</a>  talk amongst yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11074.504s">And</a>  I just hope in the future, and I really hope that you can level with me, Councilor Bears and whoever else here, because I'm your age, and I hope you can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11083.886s">There</a>  has to be more trust, transparency, and the people need to feel like they're not being made <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11091.067s">fools</a>  when they come up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11093.809s">And</a>  that's my take on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11096.55s">And</a>  you can do with it what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11098.011s">And</a>  I know I'm up on my time, but I do appreciate all your services.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11720.893s">Just</a>  tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11726.476s">What</a>  is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11730.778s">You're</a>  talking about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11732.678s">And</a>  if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11743.944s">Let</a>  me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11749.106s">Did</a>  you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11751.827s">I</a>  only give them two minutes to speak to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11753.988s">Of</a>  course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11755.549s">That</a>  would be the height of insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11757.85s">But</a>  you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11765.353s">That's</a>  a shame, that is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11768.054s">And</a>  not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11781.457s">You</a>  can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11785.458s">And</a>  just as an information to Councilor Tseng, you indicated this month is Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11789.7s">Well,</a>  do you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11791.803s">Do</a>  you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11792.584s">Today</a>  is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11796.127s">I</a>  don't see that on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11797.909s">That</a>  to me is as important as your Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11800.491s">But</a>  you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11804.996s">What</a>  does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11812.683s">I</a>  strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11819.807s">And</a>  let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11826.25s">And</a>  hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11836.655s">But</a>  even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11841.357s">That's</a>  what you signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11842.938s">You</a>  wanted to be a council to represent the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11845.699s">And</a>  if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11850.261s">So</a>  to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11855.803s">You</a>  spent two hours of your time on a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11858.684s">But</a>  you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11861.545s">That</a>  makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11863.167s">And</a>  it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11867.414s">Again,</a>  I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11871.76s">And</a>  also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11874.924s">Anyone</a>  have ever heard of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11876.852s">It's</a>  a very interesting book, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11878.994s">It's</a>  a naked socialist.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11882.056s">I</a>  said, I just hope it's not about me.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11883.558s">No,</a>  it's not about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11884.478s">I'm</a>  gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11887.841s">This</a>  goes back to 1968. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11890.423s">A</a>  lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11900.952s">Regarding</a>  public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11902.654s">One</a>  line, and it says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11905.376s">Government</a>  may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11914.223s">When</a>  it does, you're operating toward tyranny. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11916.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11917.646s">Let</a>  me just finish, please, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11920.308s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11921.229s">I</a>  would can I just finish please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11923.17s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11924.271s">Can</a>  I just finish please sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11926.993s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11927.913s">I</a>  would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11940.701s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11948.746s">So</a>  quick point of privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11950.087s">I</a>  wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11951.127s">It's</a>  not for the council's comfort that we would like to offer this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11957.431s">It's</a>  because two meetings ago, we had a very long public comment period after one agenda item and one member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11967.837s">This</a>  is an example, but this has happened, I think, to multiple people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11971.928s">the</a>  leaf blower ordinance was being voted on, and then he stood up and he said, Good morning, Councilors, because it was after midnight, and he had waited that whole time to talk about leaf blowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11982.174s">It's</a>  for Norman, who waited to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11984.415s">It's</a>  not for us and for our comfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11986.817s">It's</a>  for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11987.637s">It's</a>  for people who wait to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11990.239s">It's</a>  so more people can speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11992.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12000.589s">When</a>  a zoom K Lazzaro name and address for the record please you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12004.393s">Hi</a>  Kathleen Lazzaro 52 Grace Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12007.736s">And</a>  I don't, I oppose this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12013.962s">I</a>  think by reducing the time from five minutes to now three minutes, on a night like tonight, there's a lot to say about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12022.629s">And</a>  when you're sitting waiting, more ideas come to mind that you want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12029.354s">I</a>  don't think anybody will, I always say that, I would not speak for more than the time that I want to say what I need to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12038.491s">You</a>  know, move along, I'm not going to stand up here and chat for 5 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12044.314s">I</a>  also think that not everyone is a. Has ease with public speaking, and it might take someone 5 minutes to get out their issues with the item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12056.421s">Whereas</a>  someone else might get it out in 2 or even less. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12059.683s">So,</a>  I think 5 minutes is a. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12063.021s">a</a>  good amount of time, and if someone needs the full time to talk, they should be able to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12069.311s">If</a>  someone doesn't need the full time, they can end and move along to a new item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12077.204s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12078.561s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12079.722s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12080.983s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12082.684s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12086.667s">So</a>  first, I have a few things to say, and some of them sort of a little bit at cross purposes, but anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12094.773s">I</a>  think there's a concept that I'll introduce, sort of refers to what Councilor Tsai was getting at, the heckler's veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12101.077s">So</a>  there's the heckler's veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12102.899s">Every</a>  time somebody wants to build an apartment or put in a chicken restaurant or extend a subway line, a bunch of people are like, no, and they come and they oppose it, and then it gets opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12114.907s">And</a>  so I could see why that's not always great because sometimes certain things have a concentrated harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12123.493s">and</a>  diffuse benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12126.576s">And</a>  so we sort of get screwed up by the angry people coming to oppose something happening in their neighborhood or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12135.825s">So</a>  that's one aspect where too much public comment, I think, I think can be <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12143.516s">destructive</a>  to the general, the general thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12147.478s">That</a>  said, the specific resolution I share some of the concerns that Councilor Callahan has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12154.87s">But</a>  my specific concern is that I really feel like there's like four reforms here and I feel like that's doing too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12161.974s">Maybe</a>  the sponsors could pick their favorite one and pass one rather than multiple, you know, especially with the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12173.081s">I'm</a>  not sure that the petitions have been a problem and the people who stay till all the way at the end of the meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12180.72s">I</a>  think it'd be fair to give them more than three minutes, personally, because they did the paperwork, they probably spent an hour to come down here to fill out the paperwork, and then they're going to wait till perhaps midnight, so we can give them more than three minutes I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12198.416s">Another</a>  thing I wanted to say was that I sort of asked, and I created a Facebook post to this effect, was what is the purpose of public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12209.925s">And</a>  basically, I think people have two answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12212.207s">You</a>  can bring a unique knowledge, expertise, or lived experience to the question, something that you've studied or that you've dealt with firsthand or anecdote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12221.794s">Sometimes</a>  that's wishful thinking, as you know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12227.489s">The</a>  other thing is you want to make residents feel heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12231.072s">And</a>  so I basically wanted to say that I think one of the reasons, besides the structure of public comment that is making residents feel unheard is <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12242.011s">that</a>  I think it is confusing to people and illegible that this thing where we're saying all we're doing today is we're sending this to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12248.615s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12249.515s">I</a>  understand why committee is valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12251.757s">I</a>  understand why you can get work done in committee that you can't get done in the main meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12260.185s">That</a>  being said, I think some people feel that that's confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12263.726s">Sometimes</a>  it comes up as an answer when, you know, the actual answer is inconvenient, not right at hand or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12270.867s">And</a>  I think it just confuses people, doesn't make a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12274.108s">So</a>  that's one thing I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12276.628s">That's</a>  sort of what Councilor Lazzaro said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12280.369s">I</a>  think that this thing where, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12287.608s">where</a>  we're not defending the policy of the merits, but waiting for committee to defend the policy, certain aspects of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12293.831s">I</a>  think that confuses people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12294.972s">And</a>  I think that there could be ways to make that more legible, doesn't necessarily have to change the actual process, but something to make it more clear to people what is going on with that, I think would make people feel heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12306.337s">Because</a>  if that's the purpose of public comment, then it matters what people feel, you know, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12312.978s">You</a>  wanna be able to feel heard, you have to ask, do you feel heard? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12315.88s">And</a>  I think that would make it easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12317.982s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12318.903s">Thank</a>  you, William.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12321.685s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12324.628s">Just</a>  a quick point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12326.77s">There's</a>  no changes to anything about petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12329.792s">That's</a>  all in the rules as they stand right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12332.455s">The</a>  only changes are in the first paragraph.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12334.536s">I</a>  think actually there's the inclusion of the form as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12342.691s">That's</a>  a separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12343.491s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12345.172s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12345.872s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12347.513s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12348.853s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12357.416s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12359.817s">Hi,</a>  Jess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12360.237s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12360.997s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12362.958s">Jessica</a>  Healy, Four Lock Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12366.919s">So</a>  I'm opposed to putting it down to three minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12372.293s">I</a>  think the best option would possibly to put the people who are like me on Zoom down to three minutes and leave the people that actually show up in person, leave that at five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12389.76s">I</a>  think that too much stuff goes on for one meeting twice a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12398.18s">So</a>  maybe going back to meeting once a week would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12402.483s">So</a>  you're not there till 1, 2 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12406.626s">I</a>  understand no one wants to be, but people also need to be heard and can't be limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12412.11s">So</a>  I think maybe staying till five minutes, if you're in person, three minutes on Zoom, at least we'll cut it down a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12420.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12422.958s">Thank</a>  you, Jess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12424.339s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12425.8s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12426.749s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12430.791s">So</a>  I wanted to mention several points. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12432.732s">So</a>  first of all, I do oppose changing the minutes from 5 down to 3 and cutting it at 90 minutes maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12442.598s">So</a>  what I just wanted to say that I think the problem that I'm seeing, and this relates to all the issues that have been present at the City Council lately with the real estate tax, sales tax, with the rental ordinance that just passed and then with this, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12464.783s">You</a>  have already decided what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12467.605s">So</a>  you want the rental licensing audience, you have already decided that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12471.989s">You</a>  want to implement a real estate sales tax, you have already decided that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12477.033s">And</a>  now you have already decided that you want to reduce the number of minutes that people talk from five down to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12486.598s">What</a>  I think, and this is why people get kind of fearful, is because you have already decided your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12491.942s">And</a>  then I think all the goals that you have are laudable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12496.845s">I</a>  think everyone wants affordable housing related to real estate sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12500.468s">Everyone</a>  wants, you know, sustainability, and everyone wants housing affordability, which was the other goal for that rental license in Orleans. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12511.216s">So</a>  then, why aren't we, why aren't you discussing, and then we participating, about what are all the different approaches, in this case, for example, that we can have? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12524.204s">How</a>  can we approach the problem that meetings are running until really late, and that people, including all of us, we have to wake up really early tomorrow to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12533.29s">What</a>  can we do to sort of make the process more efficient, instead of already having decided what you are gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12540.915s">So,</a>  for example, there's a lot of technology that could be used to get people's input and make this a lot more efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12549.861s">Machine</a>  learning, collaborative full-chain approaches, and we have generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12553.643s">You</a>  could just like, you know, analyze everyone's comments, get summaries out of it, come here, we discuss, saves a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12562.349s">For</a>  example, I'm assuming that everyone is in favor of making the democratic process as democratic as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12568.256s">So</a>  I consider town meeting, the direct democracy clearly were too big for town meeting, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12574.344s">But</a>  in the town meeting, I was in New Hampshire, so during the town meeting, the moderator <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12579.77s">the</a>  morning of, basically sets the rules, and then the people that are present in the town meeting actually have the capability to sort of override those rules or ask for modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12590.041s">So</a>  what about, for example, again, discussions? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12592.884s">I'm</a>  not saying this is a good idea, that you're the moderator, Mr. President, and then you say, well, today there's a lot of people who have a very big agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12600.151s">I</a>  think the rules should be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12601.733s">open</a>  to the floor, discuss, see whether that works, that doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12605.838s">But</a>  we're not allowed to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12607.48s">You're</a>  not discussing that, you have already decided that you want it done from five to three, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12611.064s">So</a>  I encourage the council to basically, in general, again, because this has applied to every issue I've been present for, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12618.018s">that</a>  maybe instead of just saying like, well, I'm gonna tackle housing affordability by taxing homeowners, which is not gonna address housing affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12627.326s">In</a>  fact, it's gonna make it a lot worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12629.348s">So</a>  that you say like, we wanna make housing more affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12633.612s">Let's</a>  see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12635.213s">Taxing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12636.494s">market-oriented</a>  approaches, removing regulations, opening the, you know, changing zoning so there can be more construction, more competition, so we're going to lower prices, more supply, equal demand, prices are going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12648.744s">And</a>  then I think that's going to lead to a lot of better results. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12652.147s">So,</a>  we define the issues, but again, I applaud you for the issues, they're all good, but I don't agree at all with the methods and you have already decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12660.233s">So,</a>  define the issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12662.833s">Let's</a>  discuss every single option, taxation, non-taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12666.535s">Give</a>  me one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12667.576s">And</a>  then I think that would lead to a lot better results. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12671.178s">It</a>  will help develop trust because we would see, you know, we will have an input, we'll be able to discuss with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12680.288s">And</a>  maybe we'll just improve how things work, and then there wouldn't be a need for meetings to run over as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12686.509s">Because</a>  the city council is not new, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12688.69s">So</a>  it has been going on since Medford was created? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12692.83s">Since</a>  1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12693.831s">OK,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12694.811s">Since</a>  1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12696.731s">So</a>  if it has worked up until now, then obviously it can be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12701.912s">But</a>  then discuss how to improve it, rather than, we have decided to improve it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12706.073s">So</a>  thank you very much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12707.373s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12708.772s">I</a>  feel like you're engaging in good faith, and I want to engage back in good faith on a couple of things really quickly, which is just to say that the rules have changed over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12717.674s">This</a>  charter's been in since 1987, passed in 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12721.676s">Before</a>  then, the council appointed a city manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12723.516s">There's</a>  been a variety of approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12725.377s">I</a>  personally think part of democracy is trying new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12728.797s">And</a>  Thomas Jefferson had the idea of a revolution every 30 years, because things need to change with the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12735.079s">And</a>  I think that's some of what we're seeing happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12738.24s">in</a>  many places across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12740.081s">Just</a>  on the point of what you're saying, I think we are trying our best, and I think I would speak for every councilor here, that we are open to hearing from people about how we can do better on the housing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12750.444s">If</a>  you look at the governing agenda we put out, which hadn't been put out before, there's a number of things under there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12755.525s">You</a>  listed things I think you would agree with, and I would agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12758.966s">Maybe</a>  things you would agree with, I would disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12760.406s">Maybe</a>  things I would agree with, you would disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12762.967s">trying</a>  to get the full scope of the strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12764.729s">We</a>  are having the meetings on zoning reform to significantly look at reducing regulations and allowing more to happen in this community to advance climate goals and planning goals and walkability goals and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12775.622s">We're</a>  also looking at things like the transfer fee because there's a political window of possibility of how the city can acquire funding <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12783.991s">I</a>  don't think it's an ideal policy, but it's not just to say that we should only implement ideal policies and like when it comes to town meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12789.716s">I've</a>  been in town meetings before, you know, there's a reason that the city incorporated in 1892 into a city we used to have a town meeting right there's places that have town meeting representative town meeting Council Manager Mayor Council, this city's charter is a mayor council and it's representative democracy so you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12805.819s">I</a>  just think these are good things to debate, but I also think there's systems and structures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12810.862s">But</a>  I do think we're trying to be as transparent as we can and say that we're looking at a number of different ways to approach major challenges and trying to be as open with the community as we can by listing those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12820.708s">And</a>  I personally don't think it's always, we've decided there's one specific path and we're not willing to debate details and approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12827.592s">I</a>  think that's what we wanna do and one of the reasons that we have these committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12830.974s">So</a>  I hope that we can get more people attending and sharing their opinions at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12836.462s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12836.802s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, then we'll go to Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.464s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.825s">I</a>  just wanted to address one thing, because I'm feeling frustrated that I brought the rental registry here <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12851.932s">And</a>  I very purposefully did not decide a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12855.453s">I</a>  did not want to have come up with all the answers because I wanted to be part of the public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12860.974s">So</a>  this you have already decided everything, that's why I couldn't answer questions about the details of rental registry because I don't want to come here having decided everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12870.695s">So</a>  that's the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12872.015s">We</a>  get a number for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12874.116s">And</a>  it's frustrating that dozens of people are coming out to say, don't give it a number so that it can be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12881.912s">That's</a>  what I'm having trouble with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12883.476s">I</a>  want to be able to give something a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12885.0s">And</a>  I think we should not have all the details before we give it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12888.549s">But</a>  then I'm being... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12890.222s">criticized</a>  that I don't have all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12894.223s">But</a>  the reason I don't have all the answers is because I don't want to have come here having decided everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12899.444s">I</a>  want to give it a number so that we can have a public process of many public meetings so that your opinions, the public opinions, can exactly be part of this process that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12911.988s">So</a>  that's part of what I want to be able to do here is have fewer <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12919.135s">long</a>  extended discussions, and I'm not talking about this particular resolution, but fewer long extended discussions that prevent us, people saying, please do not begin a discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12931.543s">I</a>  would much rather people come to the discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12934.465s">Like,</a>  let's agree to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12936.467s">And</a>  then we can have the discussion where people can give their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12939.569s">But</a>  to come here with dozens and dozens of people saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12943.171s">Whatever</a>  you do, you're a terrible person, if you agree to allow this to be discussed, I find it... This is why you might see me not, quote-unquote, listening to dozens of people, because all I'm voting for is for it to be allowed to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12962.203s">And</a>  I think it should be discussed and that's for, you know, these other things, whether it's the real estate transfer fee, the rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12971.087s">All</a>  I'm saying is, we should be able to discuss it in open public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12976.59s">This</a>  is part of what I'm a little bit frustrated with is the idea that we're coming here having already decided and then suddenly it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12983.193s">to</a>  zero or six to one or five to two because we've already decided, but like all I wanted to do is discuss and be able to like have the open public forum that you are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12995.997s">So</a>  I guess that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12997.737s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13002.218s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13002.738s">I'll</a>  try to keep this brief, but I think that we are touching on what seems to me to be an important topic kind of underwriting this council right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13011.901s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13012.895s">You</a>  know, as we have stated tonight and many other times, we're doing things a little bit differently this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13019.416s">We</a>  have more in different committees where meeting in committee is way more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13023.157s">We</a>  put out a governing agenda, which we'll continue to revise and update, which we've never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13028.278s">The</a>  council is going through growing pains. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13030.158s">I</a>  think the committee is, the community is going through growing pains and seeing our evolution as a council and our workflow and trying to get used to that and trying to participate and understand, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13041.756s">what</a>  that looks like and how to plug into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13043.698s">And</a>  I just want to acknowledge that as a thing that I think is going on and that it makes sense to be going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13051.543s">I</a>  think that this is an important topic because I think that a lot of what people are wanting, we are trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13060.269s">And</a>  I know that there's some breakdowns in trust because I think that there's some <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13066.229s">messaging</a>  about what we're here to do, that is unfair and untrue, but has legs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13069.992s">And</a>  I think, I hope we're going to work through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13072.094s">I</a>  think that that makes it hard to communicate when we say, you know, I hear folks say, you know, we feel like we should be a part of the process and we're not a part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13080.782s">I</a>  think that this council is trying to, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13084.116s">make</a>  committees a place where people really do come together and get into the weeds with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13088.041s">Historically,</a>  they haven't been that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13089.583s">The</a>  fellow Councilors are right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13090.924s">Usually</a>  attendance is super low. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13092.486s">I</a>  think we all really want to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13094.528s">Are</a>  we there right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13096.07s">No,</a>  absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13097.172s">Does</a>  it need to get better? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13098.493s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13099.474s">I</a>  really appreciate people calling that out and also making suggestions to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13104.52s">you</a>  know, here's how we need to do this differently so that the energy and the input that we get at these meetings, what can we do differently and what just needs time so that that energy and that level of input is occurring in the place where it is on the schedule for us to get into the weeds together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13121.098s">I</a>  think we have some co-evolving to do to get to that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13128.26s">And</a>  I hope that we'll get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13129.901s">And</a>  for myself as one Councilor for this group, I think that's an honest effort in good faith and to anybody from the community who is willing to bring that energy and that frustration and that irritation to help us get there, that's welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13144.366s">And</a>  just as an illustrative example, because for me as one Councilor, it is frustrating to hear people say, we know this is a done deal or see what is sometimes a consensus and call it a conspiracy <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13158.212s">I</a>  think it's fairly intuitive that people running, committing to do similar things, similar people voted for similar ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13167.017s">And</a>  so now there's plurality of that opinion on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13169.738s">I</a>  don't think that's a conspiracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13170.859s">I</a>  think that's statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13173.6s">So</a>  it's frustrating to me to hear, this is a done deal, this is something shady, for an example of, I think what we're trying to, I wish that we got more, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13188.484s">attention</a>  all the times when we're stuck in the weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13190.885s">Council</a>  President Bears mentioned earlier at the very beginning of the meeting 10 years ago, the report on the food trucks ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13202.691s">There's</a>  been one particular constituent that's been hounding me for months about the food trucks ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13206.233s">Where</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13206.693s">Where</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13207.194s">When's</a>  it going to get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13209.014s">We're</a>  still working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13210.155s">We're</a>  still hearing from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13211.256s">We're</a>  still hearing from staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13213.857s">We're</a>  going to give that the space that it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13217.327s">I'm</a>  sorry, I've gone on longer than I meant to, but I think that what we're talking about tonight, I think that we're circling around a topic that we are really earnestly trying to work through on the council, which is trying to get to a place where we can do this work together, we can bring in more people, we can put in the places where more people can be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13232.539s">So</a>  thank you for indulging me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13234.361s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13235.322s">I'm</a>  going to go to Nadine on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13236.963s">Nadine,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13238.284s">You</a>  have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13242.626s">Hi,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13243.567s">My</a>  name is Nadine Moretti, 126 Birgit Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13247.009s">So</a>  I just wanted to talk about what you had said a few minutes ago, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13253.434s">You</a>  had mentioned that just because 25 people got up today, you know, tonight to speak, means that, you know, they're the only ones that are against this resolution amongst the other resolutions during all the past meetings that, you know, you've had a big number of people in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13269.486s">That's</a>  definitely not the case that only 25 people are against this registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13273.507s">It's</a>  probably like, you know, countless numbers, but basically people aren't comfortable with public speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13281.09s">You</a>  know, maybe they're at work, maybe they're home asleep because they have to work early. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13285.671s">Maybe</a>  they know that despite all their <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13289.013s">speaking</a>  at the podium and on zoom, the opposing views will fall on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13293.877s">I</a>  mean, that's how we feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13295.758s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13296.118s">And</a>  I know you say you hear everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13297.899s">It</a>  still isn't registering with us that anyone's listening to us except for one Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13302.863s">And</a>  I know it keeps being said because we truly feel that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13307.694s">you</a>  know, at least I do, that George cares the most and really wants to listen to the people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13314.596s">So</a>  I think it's wrong that you think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13318.277s">25</a>  people got up tonight because they went to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13320.817s">There's</a>  90 people on Zoom and there's people that just, you know, don't have any faith anymore in the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13328.899s">So</a>  I just wanted to make that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13330.56s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13332.349s">Thanks,</a>  Nadine, and I apologize if I actually agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13335.332s">I</a>  was trying to make the point that there are a lot of people who don't get to talk in the meeting, so I agree with you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13341.318s">I'll</a>  go to the podium, name and address for the record, five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13347.044s">Bill</a>  Carr, 47 Blakely Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13350.408s">I'm</a>  just looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13352.113s">a</a>  brochure that was passed out at election time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13355.816s">And</a>  this city is in a major problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13357.237s">George,</a>  it's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13357.857s">I'll</a>  be all right, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13359.018s">I</a>  know, he looks at me, because we're old friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13361.319s">He's</a>  worried about what I'm going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13362.46s">Don't</a>  worry, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13363.121s">I'm</a>  all set.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13364.402s">So</a>  anyway, it says right here, Zach Beers, Anna Callahan, Kit Collins, Emily Zell, Matt, Jacqueline, Justin. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13370.846s">So</a>  this is your brochure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13371.947s">The</a>  first thing it says right off the bat, fix the budget process and raise revenue to fully fund school city services infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13381.656s">I</a>  asked for the chair, how many meetings have you had with the mayor in the last three months to do that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13387.52s">We</a>  have met since last March on the budget ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13391.042s">We</a>  just passed it at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13392.423s">Not</a>  the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13393.123s">No,</a>  it created a brand new budget process.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13394.804s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13395.285s">To</a>  create revenue.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13395.865s">No,</a>  hold on a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13396.726s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13397.386s">You</a>  read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13397.706s">I'm</a>  going to answer your question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13398.827s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13399.047s">It</a>  said fix the budget process and raise revenue to fund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13402.574s">We</a>  just passed the first budget ordinance in the history of the city to fix the budget process we're starting budget meetings, April 15, two months earlier than we ever have for, and we just released a press release from the financial task force of the council leadership the school committee leadership and the mayor to discuss raising revenue to fund our schools, city services and our capital needs so literally in the last two weeks we've done exactly what that bullet point said.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13425.247s">How</a>  many meetings have you had with the mayor to raise revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13428.752s">Because</a>  we're in a cash crunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13430.173s">Just</a>  let me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13431.375s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13431.836s">So</a>  we're in a real crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13433.278s">We</a>  know the schools are in the hole, millions of dollars.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13436.161s">It's</a>  not, it's about $215,000 in the deficit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13437.803s">We</a>  shouldn't be in the hole at all, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13440.968s">So</a>  we shouldn't really be in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13443.066s">We</a>  can't give the fire department a decent raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13445.167s">We</a>  can't give our school teachers a different raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13447.949s">What's</a>  happening is people leaving the city, they're not sending their kids to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13452.152s">I'm</a>  a graduate of Medford High, so are you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13453.893s">They're</a>  afraid to send their kids there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13455.694s">Okay,</a>  we need to raise revenue to make the schools more secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13459.176s">We</a>  need to raise the revenue so we can keep teachers here, we can keep firefighters here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13464.252s">You</a>  had how many meetings since January 1st with the mayor to raise revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13468.754s">When</a>  I talk raise revenue, I come from a business perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13473.036s">We</a>  can talk about Assembly Square, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13474.577s">How</a>  many hundreds of millions of dollars have come from that postage stamp in Solomon, George? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13479.299s">Take</a>  a guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13481.74s">Hundreds</a>  of millions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13482.941s">We</a>  have Mystic Gap, we have Medford, we have this whole area that's underdeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13486.202s">So</a>  I'm just asking, how many meetings have you had with the mayor?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13488.351s">with</a>  the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13489.091s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13489.872s">In</a>  what like to raise revenue, real revenue to bring in developers to bring real if you want to put the with the mayor on it, I've had two or three financial task force meetings with Vice President Collins and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13500.055s">So</a>  we've also had two meetings on the zoning ordinance two minutes on the linkage for your ordinance, three meetings on the governing agenda, two meetings on budget recommendations where we requested a lot of the things you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13509.638s">I</a>  mean, probably 1015 if you if you count what is this council done?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13513.559s">I'll</a>  give you a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13514.579s">Rick</a>  Orlando is standing right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13515.54s">This</a>  is how things get done in the last 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13517.48s">There's</a>  only been a handful of products that have had any success in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13520.421s">Very</a>  few. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13521.701s">He</a>  was one of the first ones.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13522.862s">We</a>  approved two planned development districts so far this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13526.163s">So</a>  you had nine meetings on the blowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13530.784s">What</a>  do you guys use? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13532.444s">What</a>  are they called?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13533.625s">I'm</a>  pretty sure it was six.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13535.769s">you</a>  need one you need one right here yes or no and that's it that there's no community there's no meaning just that you just you forward against and that you call it i agree with you but the people wanted to talk the new school the new schools got done because the gentleman right behind me and another lady decided to get together with a bunch of people like yourself and they went to the mayor's office they said we need new schools and it happened they figured out how to make it happen they got community what you need to do and i'm giving the council you're all young people you've been around just a little bit of time <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13566.064s">the</a>  mayor, find out what's got to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13568.285s">You</a>  don't need meetings on real estate and landscape blow dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13573.226s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13574.167s">We</a>  don't need that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13575.307s">We</a>  need real revenue coming to the city, and we are missing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13578.468s">So</a>  all these little subcommittees, that's all great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13581.189s">It's</a>  not working for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13583.05s">We</a>  don't have enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13584.29s">We're</a>  struggling to pay for things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13586.631s">We</a>  can't give people decent wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13588.652s">You</a>  can't give teachers, my parents are both teachers, you can't give a teacher a 2% raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13592.793s">That's</a>  insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13593.873s">They</a>  can't afford to live in their own city that they're teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13596.954s">So</a>  it's got to start from this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13598.834s">You</a>  need to go to the mayor's office, whether you like it or you don't like it, and sit down and figure out what's going on, and hold her feet to the fire, and make her put a plan together with the council, work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13609.937s">That's</a>  how Rick Orlando got the schools done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13612.017s">They</a>  raised $90 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13613.757s">We</a>  got all new schools for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13615.198s">You</a>  probably don't know that because you didn't live here at that time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13617.398s">I</a>  was in the first fifth grade at the Brooks, and I'm a good friend of Beth Fuller.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13620.421s">You</a>  benefited because of this gentleman right here.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13622.643s">Yes,</a>  and the building committee, and Orlando was the co-chair, Rick.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13627.007s">Rick,</a>  how long did you work? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13629.069s">How</a>  long did you work?</p>

    <p>[Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13632.453s">About</a>  three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13635.175s">How</a>  long? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13635.936s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13636.957s">How</a>  much were you paid?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13641.781s">I've</a>  been, I've been, I've engaged with you a little bit more time, but if you get people like Rick and other people that still care about the city that have a lot of knowledge, we can help you get this process pushed forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13653.309s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13653.589s">You</a>  can't do it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13654.389s">You</a>  can't do it when you have these different agendas, whether that, whether I agree or disagree with them, you can't have these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13659.413s">You've</a>  got to get everybody on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13660.974s">And</a>  when you divide the city, you don't get people like myself and Rick and all these other people that good people want to come out and help you guys go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13668.479s">We</a>  will just come up here and fight you all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13670.76s">And</a>  that's no good either. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13672.121s">Nothing</a>  gets done.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13673.203s">I</a>  would I would respectfully say that there's a lot of avenues where we're trying to do that and I would hope that we can consider all of our individual proposals and plans.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13680.151s">How</a>  do you think the field's got built? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13681.532s">How</a>  do you think the science does? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13686.698s">Those</a>  are good community people, those are Medford old school people that came forward, and they wanted to do something good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13692.783s">You</a>  have a lot of people behind me that would do something, but if we keep this fight up, you're never going to get.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13697.947s">I</a>  really hope folks applied for the building committee for the high school, we're going to have a lot of conversations coming out of the budget and the financial task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13704.893s">I</a>  think we just need to consider everything on the merits, and I appreciate your input, and I hope that we can continue to do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13709.277s">The</a>  school committee's got to put their agenda down, make the school safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13711.859s">Medford</a>  High is not safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13713.4s">You</a>  can't have people not coming to us, sending their kids to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13716.803s">It's</a>  very unsafe up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13718.124s">That's</a>  not a good image for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13720.626s">That's</a>  just one thing that could be changed very easily.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13722.688s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13723.068s">Thank</a>  you, Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13724.489s">I'm</a>  going to go to Tony Tanks on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Tony Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13728.596s">I,</a>  again, thank you for this privilege that I'm going to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13731.857s">Hopefully</a>  it lasts five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13734.798s">And</a>  I actually had a long list of points I wanted to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13738.64s">Most</a>  of my points were covered eloquently by previous speakers, such as Mr. Jelomino, former Council Pantera, and former Council Pantera, and Mr. Carr, who just spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13749.943s">I</a>  really appreciate their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13751.424s">And</a>  they have some common sense answers to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13757.873s">this</a>  particular resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13759.373s">In</a>  the spirit and the reasons for it, I'm not going to go on and repeat what they said, but I do believe that this council would have better success in regaining some of the faith of this community by retracting this resolution and coming up with alternate ways to ensure that residents have available time to speak fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13783.379s">I</a>  know there's other ways to do it and some of them were mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13787.094s">I</a>  do want to state and be clear, though, I am formally opposed to this resolution, and I hope alternate means can be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13793.857s">Thank</a>  you again for the ability to speak.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13796.438s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13797.879s">I'm</a>  going to go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13800.16s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13801.26s">Mr.</a>  Orlando, you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13803.517s">Richard</a>  Orlando, Winford Way, Medford, Bill, Mr. Carr, thank you, but there are a lot of other people involved with that project, aside from myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13812.63s">I</a>  happen to be the face many times, but a lot of great people, both within and outside of the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13818.457s">Um,</a>  just just a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13820.459s">We're</a>  talking about democratic process, representative government and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13825.364s">And</a>  through you to Councilor Callahan, I'm glad you talked about the process to bring it to a committee, release it from this group to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13837.506s">Do</a>  you think the people in this community that have been listening to these last few meetings with hundreds of people here have any confidence and trust that what you're going to do in the subcommittees is going to be representative of their interests? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13852.636s">The</a>  trust is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13854.817s">Now,</a>  you may need to figure out how to bring that back, but the trust is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13859.501s">What</a>  you do here, we're going to see you do in those subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13862.783s">That's</a>  the feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13865.785s">So</a>  I think you need to think about trust without trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13871.288s">The</a>  opinion is this council doesn't care for Medford, doesn't care for the community, and doesn't care for the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13877.852s">And</a>  I find it interesting when we talk about debate, disagreement, it's almost like those are results. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13885.737s">Those</a>  aren't results, that's stagnation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13889.739s">Creating</a>  results are the kinds of things that Mr. Carr did with the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13894.704s">Creating</a>  results are doing things through the schools with all of the good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13899.907s">I</a>  look at what's going on in the schools now and it breaks my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13904.17s">I</a>  look at 10, 15 years ago, how the schools, the growth in there, the educational programs and so on were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13910.654s">Those</a>  are results. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13912.515s">Debate,</a>  disagreement as a badge of accomplishment, sorry, that's coming up short. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13920.08s">And</a>  the last point, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13922.315s">Mr.</a>  Khamid is that you have a lot of people that are being put off for helping because they don't feel that either whether it's a council, the person in the corner office over there even cares about reaching out to people that can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13940.128s">And</a>  volunteerism, that was an amazing, when you work with a group of people that accomplish great things, it's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13952.219s">And</a>  right now, I'm not seeing that go on in the city, and it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13956.06s">And</a>  I just hope that can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13957.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13958.301s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Orlando. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13961.262s">I'm</a>  not going to recognize this name. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13964.603s">I'm</a>  going to go to Ron Giovino on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13969.164s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13970.445s">Five</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13977.433s">This</a>  is Ron Givino, 326 East Border Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13982.637s">I'm</a>  going to try to get back on this topic of this agenda, which is public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13988.461s">Since</a>  this council has been in session, we've had the Gaza issue, the fire chief issue, the property transfer fee issue, the rental registry issue, and soon to be public participation issue that have all gone over 90 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14007.645s">And</a>  I'm just wondering which citizen would you tell to be quiet because we've reached the 90 minute limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14013.649s">I</a>  think the timing of this is incredibly poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14018.853s">I</a>  think that it's unacceptable to assume that people will not have a voice anymore in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14025.237s">And</a>  I think it's a bad step for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14027.178s">I</a>  also would remind the public that despite comments from the president of the city council, the Medford Charter Review Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14037.785s">is</a>  working diligently and hard and do and will have a say in the future of how this government is run. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14045.39s">Things</a>  like how to get on the agenda, things like how much time you get to talk at a city council meeting, things like how long a discussion will be, will all be on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14054.355s">So</a>  I encourage the public to, if they're looking for another place to voice their opinion, the Medford Charter Committee is the place to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14063.48s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14066.681s">Thank</a>  you, Ron, and the council looks forward to considering the recommendations of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14070.943s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14077.387s">Kelly</a>  Catalo, 23 Salem Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14080.749s">The</a>  night of the transfer tax, I didn't get to talk till 1230 at night, but I'd like to think that the information and the education I was able to give this council <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14091.055s">was</a>  taken into consideration and I'd like to think it was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14095.218s">If</a>  you had a 90 minute roll, I never would have been able to speak and I stayed here all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14102.162s">I</a>  didn't speak just on behalf of myself, but on a lot of property owners and a lot of tenants in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14108.125s">People</a>  that can't find their voice, they're not gonna send you an email, they're not gonna come to this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14114.729s">They'll</a>  call me, they'll call somebody they know, can you go speak for me?

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14320.381s">I</a>  was going to say it was George's moving van driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14325.732s">He</a>  joked that he drove Georgia's moving van.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14328.974s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14329.474s">No,</a>  but Harvey, what a great resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14331.436s">Wouldn't</a>  you like to sit down and have a conversation with him? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14334.258s">But</a>  then I look at these subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14336.299s">I</a>  don't know how in a one hour frame, you're going to talk about transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14341.243s">There's</a>  three and a half hours here that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14343.304s">And</a>  now you're going to take it and put in a subcommittee that's only an hour long. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14346.086s">I</a>  don't understand it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14348.888s">But</a>  the subcommittees, the committees last as long as they need to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14351.57s">So</a>  they're not just one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14352.591s">They</a>  could be five hours if they need to be.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14354.943s">Can</a>  you please not put a 90 minute limit?</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14359.748s">But</a>  topics need to be discussed to the point of exhaustion if you're going to make laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14367.86s">And</a>  I don't think it's funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14369.8s">And</a>  I think that I give a lot of my time to kind of this podium for other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14373.861s">And</a>  I don't appreciate the two Councilors that are sitting here laughing at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14377.542s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14378.742s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[FLTVHcz7fAI_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14668.532s">As</a>  a council, I'm just saying what you would mention, the 10 minutes down to five minutes without an uproar, that's what you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14674.997s">Now,</a>  less than two years later, you want to bring it from five minutes down to two minutes, or we'll compromise and go to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14680.841s">Maybe</a>  we'll only wait a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14682.202s">If</a>  nobody says anything, we'll bring it down to one minute, and then no minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14687.005s">That's</a>  where it seems like we're headed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14689.567s">So</a>  I sat through hundreds and hundreds of city council meetings, filming them for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14697.953s">It</a>  was rare to see the council chambers filled like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14701.576s">Certainly</a>  not week after week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14704.329s">And</a>  I thought to myself, why is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14706.751s">During</a>  those times, the council heard the people, they heard from companies, they heard from the mayor, they got ideas and they acted on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14715.499s">They</a>  didn't bring their own agenda, their own playbook of things that they want to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14721.221s">and</a>  put that out every single week, week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14724.223s">They</a>  would hear things, they would hear the hospitals closing, and let's bring people together and see how we can fight against hospital closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14729.948s">Let's</a>  deal with the Green Line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14732.369s">How</a>  are we gonna work with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14734.271s">Those</a>  were the discussions that happened in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14737.053s">Not</a>  just, this is what we wanna do, and we're gonna go out there, and we're gonna push, push, push, and we're just gonna make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14743.057s">It</a>  would save a bunch of time if you guys would just do your whole agenda in one night, say, pass it all through six to one, and we're all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14750.512s">We</a>  know it's a done deal, and yes, it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14752.693s">We</a>  know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14753.854s">Nothing</a>  we say is going to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14755.675s">You</a>  said we could talk for three days straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14759.058s">A</a>  disagreement is a disagreement, and it's gonna be my way, and that's the way it is.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14762.46s">I</a>  said we could talk for three days straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14764.281s">We</a>  may not agree on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14765.282s">We</a>  may not get to a point of agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14766.582s">Yeah,</a>  and nothing's going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14768.083s">That's</a>  not true.</p>

    <p>[FLTVHcz7fAI_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14768.564s">You're</a>  still gonna pass it through.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14769.845s">That's</a>  how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14770.425s">Mr.</a>  Krumman, it changed tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14772.206s">The</a>  initial proposal was two minutes, now it's three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14773.947s">It</a>  changed because people spoke.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14775.568s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14776.129s">So</a>  it changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14776.989s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14777.249s">So</a>  there's evidence.</p>

    <p>[FLTVHcz7fAI_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14779.059s">Still</a>  reducing it, still reducing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14783.542s">It's</a>  just this every week you guys just come in creating problems that don't exist, changing things for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14795.511s">The</a>  city was great before and the chambers weren't that full. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14798.874s">That's</a>  because people were happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14799.895s">They</a>  had no reason to come up here and complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14802.861s">That's</a>  why they weren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14803.942s">So</a>  you guys were able to sneak in, get your 7,500 votes, get in, take these seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14807.723s">Congratulations,</a>  you did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14809.284s">And</a>  you're appeasing to the 7,500 people that voted for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14811.625s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14813.046s">The</a>  60,000 people, 40,000 other people that didn't vote for you, they didn't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14818.029s">That's</a>  our fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14819.85s">And</a>  some of the people that did vote for you have come up and said, oops, we made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14822.711s">We</a>  shouldn't have voted for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14824.392s">So</a>  hopefully next time it'll go better. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14828.302s">Hopefully</a>  we can not change the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14830.685s">At</a>  least not the 90 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14831.927s">The</a>  90 minutes will be a big part because three minutes, that's 30 people can talk and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14836.293s">If</a>  there's actually somebody that supports you guys, that's 15 people on each side and that's really not a lot of people, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14843.991s">three</a>  minutes, 30 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14845.713s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14846.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14847.655s">I'm</a>  going to go to school committee member and Toppa name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14850.699s">Please</a>  welcome for your first time as a school committee member and congratulations.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14854.083s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14855.344s">John</a>  Ellen Toppa, 12 Murray Hill Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14859.849s">I</a>  just wanted to take a moment <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14861.691s">and</a>  voice my opposition for the current bill as it stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14868.034s">I</a>  feel like while I appreciate the amendment of having two to three minutes, I feel like that the <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14876.75s">especially</a>  have strong disregard for the 90 minute cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14881.152s">In</a>  terms of I understand where it comes from, I can sympathize with a lot of the issues that come with 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14887.815s">meetings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14889.236s">I</a>  also worry about the discomfort of someone who has waited those 90 minutes and their opportunities cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14895.039s">I'm</a>  lucky that I have spoken up here a few times and can get my point across in three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14899.921s">I</a>  know that for a lot of people who may wanna speak for the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14903.963s">a</a>  two-minute conversation can take five, and that's sort of where I'm at with that, but wanted to appreciate the studies that were brought in and appreciate what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14915.112s">However,</a>  I feel like this <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14917.523s">proposed</a>  motion as it stands with the single amendment does not seem fit and I'd worry about the effect it may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14924.485s">The</a>  timing, of course, is a huge thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14926.225s">That's</a>  why there's a lot of discomfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14927.586s">There's</a>  a lot of anger. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14929.926s">And</a>  I wonder where that would be, if this would be proposed later, as well as other future sort of amendments that may differ at shorter agenda, caps on agenda time, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14940.289s">I</a>  don't know the legality of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14943.297s">I</a>  didn't run for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14944.157s">I</a>  don't understand any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14946.378s">However,</a>  I appreciate you giving me the time to speak and would like to voice my opposition for the 90 minute cap and decrease from five to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14953.939s">So,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14955.819s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14956.319s">I</a>  think we have three people who already spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14959.5s">So,</a>  have you spoken to Mr. Cassidy on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14962.18s">All</a>  right, sorry you, you get to go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14966.161s">Name</a>  and address for the record you have five minutes Mr. Cassidy.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14994.058s">Is</a>  my two and three minutes up yet?</p>
