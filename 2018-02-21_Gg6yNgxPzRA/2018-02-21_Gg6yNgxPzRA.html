    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=0.759s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2.821s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3.581s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4.422s">Councilor</a>  Laura Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5.223s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=6.424s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=7.505s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8.205s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8.946s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10.047s">President</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=11.148s">Presence,</a>  please rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=13.73s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=25.479s">Before</a>  we start the meeting tonight, I know I spoke to a bunch of the press before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=30.717s">City</a>  Council rules state if you want to tape, if you want a video, please respect our rules, which are the middle window to the middle window and around the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=39.524s">Please</a>  do not come up here and have your iPhones in people's faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=44.688s">So</a>  if you want to tape, we don't have a problem with anybody taping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=47.911s">Just</a>  respect the rules and tape within the certain parameters that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=52.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=55.359s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=58.623s">18-090</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=61.567s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Office of Community Development forward the Medford City Council an explanation of programs, policies, and procedures currently in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=70.492s">to</a>  ensure inclusionary housing in the city of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=74.136s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=75.677s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=76.478s">First</a>  of all, I'm talking to the chair of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=81.363s">I</a>  know that they've been drafting up a few of the ideas and presentations of what we're looking for moving forward with development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=91.312s">One</a>  of the biggest concerns that we hear now is the lack of housing and the lack of the type of housing that makes Medford the community that Medford is, which is housing for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=103.077s">And</a>  I think that looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=106.639s">the</a>  rules and the policies that we need to jump in a little bit deeper in seeing what we're doing to make Medford continue to thrive as a community of families and looking to possibly increasing our affordable housing to what is acceptable in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=130.889s">I</a>  know we're still at, I believe, 10%, but I think it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=136.991s">Another</a>  piece that's alarming, you can see it in our community next door, they're having huge concerns with residents there that were accepted into the affordable housing units in different condominiums and now are being told by the developers that are there that they now need to move out because of the popularity of <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=162.583s">of</a>  selling those condos as individual units and they're being asked to leave and given a mere $1,000 just to move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=169.892s">So</a>  I think it's important that before <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=172.948s">I</a>  shouldn't say this before, but it's hitting us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=175.529s">I</a>  think we need to take a more active role moving forward and ensuring that what we're doing to protect our residents here in Medford with our added development and how we're looking at affordable housing is presented in a way that we hold the values of our families in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=195.115s">So</a>  with that, I appreciate the time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=198.715s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=199.796s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=200.716s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=202.097s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli has got great timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=206.359s">Just</a>  a couple of weeks ago, our zoning subcommittee met under the direction of Chairman Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=210.42s">And</a>  one of the topics that we discussed in that meeting was inclusionary housing and inclusionary zoning ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=216.143s">And</a>  I think it's the time right now is to really address the issue that we have here in the city of Method or affordable housing or the lack thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=222.998s">And</a>  one of the focuses that we've had is obviously meeting the threshold that's established by the state of 10%, but also retaining and replacing the expiring new stock of affordable housing units in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=233.705s">This</a>  is something that I wholeheartedly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=235.226s">I</a>  thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it forward, and I look forward to working with him towards a finished product.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=238.809s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=240.009s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Naife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=241.791s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Naife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=244.733s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=247.114s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=248.715s">I</a>  would just add that where the CPA now is in effect in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=253.36s">and</a>  one of the options for the CPA money that's available is affordable housing, that that also be looked at, Mr. President, to see what funding is available to assist in low to moderate and affordable housing within our community.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=267.383s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=269.303s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=273.624s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=274.764s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=275.845s">18-091,</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=282.79s">with</a>  the upcoming spring youth sports season starting in April, that the DPW director and city administration report back to the city council on the steps being taken to prepare our playing fields for all youth organizations.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=298.643s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=299.884s">Again,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=301.265s">This</a>  came about with conversations indirectly with the new director of recreation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=309.033s">members</a>  of the park board and members of our youth organization and also my background in working with facilities management and playing fields and knowing what we're doing in our community where I work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=324.508s">and</a>  preparing our playing fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=326.129s">One</a>  thing that we know that our DPW is drastically understaffed and I want to make sure that as the weather, if the weather continues the way it's going now, we might be playing at the beginning of March in a few weeks, hopefully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=342.234s">But</a>  we need our playing fields in a position where our children <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=348.772s">can</a>  play in a safe environment and making sure that we're giving, making sure the city administration is preparing those fields and giving our DPW and parks department what they need to make sure that those fields are under, um, uh, supervised and make sure that they're, they're, they're, um, planned accordingly moving forward as we get closer to the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.618s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.938s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=369.978s">Councilor</a>  Knife.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=371.118s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=372.419s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper with a B paper and request that the administration report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=378.25s">What</a>  the process is for permitting fields at this point in time, Mr. President, usually it goes before the parks board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=383.415s">The</a>  parks board meets once a month when they have a quorum, and then permits are issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=387.078s">And</a>  I don't think it's the most effective or efficient process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=389.78s">Here</a>  we have a recreation department with a budget of $315,000 annually that hopefully will be up and running sometime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=396.966s">And</a>  the way that we're permitting our fields I don't think is going to be conducive to the best use and the best possible practices that we can do at the municipal level, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=403.561s">So</a>  I'm asking that the administration conduct a review of the permitting process for their fields and provide recommendations as to how we can improve that to maybe a weekly permitting process as opposed to a monthly permitting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=412.743s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=415.103s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=416.024s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=416.844s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=419.884s">This</a>  is an important issue, but if I could also amend the resolution to make sure that we inspect all the park equipment in our top lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=428.562s">and</a>  all the play structures, just to make sure everything's safe, especially after the winter and the cold weather when things rust and things crack and break and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=435.744s">So</a>  if we could have those inspected as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=438.164s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=439.664s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=441.885s">Councilor</a>  Falco stole exactly what I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=445.165s">I</a>  just think when you see the baseball and softball start, you also see the younger brothers and sisters at the tot lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=453.327s">And</a>  that's something that we always get reports come April, the swing's broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=457.861s">bar</a>  is missing on the, you know, monkey bars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=461.062s">So</a>  if we could just get ahead of that situation so that we, all our children can get on those taut lots and have fun while their siblings are out swinging the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=470.105s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=962.479s">Thank</a>  you, yes, I think that's the least that needs to be done at this point in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=968.022s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1458.112s">Well,</a>  I'm telling you what I know.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1460.732s">But</a>  when you found out in January, what did you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1463.033s">Was</a>  that the same story? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1464.113s">I'm</a>  telling you what I know.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1465.814s">And</a>  if you have other stories, I'll be happy to listen to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1468.995s">But</a>  I'm telling you my latest.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1471.116s">So</a>  you're going by the latest story, but what you were told in January, you're just going to go with the latest?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1476.294s">I'm</a>  telling you what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1477.675s">If</a>  I had a different story, I would say that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1480.556s">I'm</a>  telling you what I know.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1481.556s">I've</a>  heard four stories so far.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1483.477s">I</a>  understand, but you have more information than I have then.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1487.278s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1488.859s">So</a>  Mr. Edwards told me that he cleaned his office and he may have discarded the item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1500.103s">Now,</a>  if you know what a magazine clip looks like, it's about this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1505.913s">It's</a>  black. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1508.214s">Has</a>  some appearances that looks like it could be a small cell phone, small remote control, small other electronic device.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1520.439s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1521.379s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1522.98s">We</a>  have one speaker speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1524.5s">You</a>  want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1525.301s">You</a>  can speak after the speaker is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1527.101s">Please</a>  don't interrupt or mock anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1528.962s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1530.503s">I</a>  don't know what other items he had there and how it could have been confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1535.196s">But</a>  that's the story that he provided to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1539.657s">Now,</a>  we did not have any evidence of a magazine clip available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1547.859s">Sometime</a>  in early January, Mr. Tully came to my office during his shift and told me about what he had found. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1559.102s">I</a>  asked him routine questions about where he found it, who was there, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1565.475s">Those</a>  kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1568.215s">And</a>  he couldn't really fill in much more except the fact that he found it and put that in Mr. Edwards' office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1575.297s">We</a>  checked with different other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1578.817s">And</a>  at this point in time, I'm unable to identify where the chain of custody took place after Mr. Edwards allegedly <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1594.195s">discarded</a>  the item, or did not see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1597.856s">Now,</a>  subsequent to that, we try to make some decision as to whether we felt this rose to the level of a reportable incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1611.8s">I'm</a>  told that Officer Ricciardi, who is the school resource officer, was also told at some point in early January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1620.642s">That's</a>  what I'm told. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1622.585s">I</a>  want to be sure that I'm not 100% sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1627.809s">At</a>  the time, we felt that it was an isolated incident, that it was something that was not dangerous in the sense because it wasn't a firearm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1641.88s">Bullets</a>  don't fire themselves, not a weapon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1644.582s">No</a>  weapon was found. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1652.165s">we</a>  should take our time and not raise anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1658.446s">However,</a>  subsequent to that, in conversations that I've had with people in recent times, indicates to me that even though we did not feel it presented a clear danger, that other people do, and that they would have preferred that we made a full report <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1682.506s">to</a>  the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1684.166s">And</a>  as I indicated earlier, the chief and I talk all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1688.487s">I</a>  have no problem telling the chief anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1691.268s">And</a>  we've talked about a lot of difficult situations over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1695.349s">We</a>  don't hide things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1697.109s">But</a>  a judgment was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1699.95s">And</a>  that judgment said, we don't see this as dangerous at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1706.391s">So</a>  therefore, I take responsibility <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1711.476s">for</a>  not reporting it to the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1714.458s">But</a>  I did so, I believe, in good conscience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1719.643s">I</a>  believe that it was something that I needed to know more about before I raised it or elevated it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1730.051s">Over</a>  the years, I have reported any number of things the chief can verify to him that I thought were dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1737.537s">I</a>  don't believe that Mr. Edwards <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1742.042s">would</a>  have any motive for not turning it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1746.344s">After</a>  all, he wasn't there on the weekend, didn't belong to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1752.508s">He</a>  has turned in many items, and Officer Ricciardi has indicated this, to him on multiple occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1760.292s">So</a>  I don't believe he had any reason not to turn it in if he knew he had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1765.915s">At</a>  this point in time, since it has become an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1771.104s">especially</a>  in light of what's taken place in other communities around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1777.867s">We</a>  have authorized a full sweep today, full sweep of the McGlynn Complex, which was conducted by Medford Police, Somerville Police, Everett Police, and Arlington Police with dogs that are weapons and drug trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1796.516s">and</a>  we found no trace of weapons, ammunition, or drugs in the complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1802.621s">I'm</a>  comfortable that that building is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1807.385s">We</a>  have also initiated, in order to help the public feel comfortable, a sweep of all school buildings over the next few days to ensure that there is nothing there that would be of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1825.796s">We</a>  are also planning this week to put together material, media, and others to talk to the public about the nature of school security, what we have in place, without getting into sensitive items, but what we have in place, and also to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1844.949s">I</a>  have communicated with the Teachers Association President, Charlene Douglas, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1851.181s">It's</a>  possible that I will meet with the McGlynn faculty on Monday afternoon to answer any questions they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1858.424s">We</a>  believe that our schools are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1861.666s">We</a>  believe that we do more than most school systems do to keep our schools safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1867.909s">We</a>  believe that we will continue to review and upgrade what we have if we find that there is room here to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1880.762s">and</a>  we believe that we can go forward recognizing that the decision that I made with others in my employee needs to be upgraded in the future and that a lesson learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1899.294s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1901.095s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1903.537s">Just</a>  if I could, Mr. Superintendent, two points.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1905.978s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1906.519s">The</a>  decision that was made that this wasn't a serious incident <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1910.285s">Who</a>  else was in consultation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1912.006s">Was</a>  the chief of police involved in this conversation?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1914.627s">No,</a>  the chief of police was not involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1917.589s">I</a>  did talk to the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1918.83s">I</a>  did talk to the custodian. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1920.41s">I</a>  did talk to a couple of other people that I work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1924.853s">And</a>  in my opinion, at that particular point in time, Officer Ricciardi did come in at some point, came to the conclusion that it was not something that warranted a full investigation at this point.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1938.911s">Okay,</a>  and my other point was, at the beginning of your speech, you mentioned that the clip, the magazine clip, potentially had three to four bullets, which is pretty specific to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1950.961s">And</a>  at any point, did you receive a picture of this, even though the principal stated he did not have the clip, or doesn't recall ever seeing the clip? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1962.471s">At</a>  what point did you see the clip itself?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1967.987s">I</a>  saw the picture last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1972.91s">And</a>  the clip is, if you look at the clip, you can see one bullet at the top, and then there are holes on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1981.536s">The</a>  chief can describe this better than I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1984.038s">But</a>  he can tell how many rounds might be in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1988.321s">But</a>  the person's hand covered most of it, holding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1993.304s">So</a>  he couldn't tell beyond a certain point whether there were additional bullets beyond <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1998.346s">the</a>  3 to 4 that he was able to identify.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2001.211s">So</a>  in your opinion, you just mentioned that you want to make the public feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2005.899s">And</a>  in your opinion, finding a magazine clip in a K through 8 school <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2013.137s">doesn't</a>  rise to the nature of seriousness to notify local police department, notify faculty, notify parents, notify students that there is an investigation that is gonna take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2028.304s">You</a>  didn't even feel it was at that level where you notify people in the community?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2033.727s">We</a>  have notified people on all kinds of situations in the past.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2039.27s">That's</a>  debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2042.112s">We've</a>  had a bomb incident, Mr. Superintendent, that your own school committee created a policy where serious incidents had to be reported immediately by the administration, which clearly wasn't followed in this case.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2058.239s">We've</a>  reported multiple situations over the years of all kinds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2064.701s">Certainly,</a>  you know, one can debate whether this rose to that level <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2071.889s">But</a>  given the consensus that I have- All due respect, there's no debate.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2075.931s">There's</a>  no debate, Mr. Superintendent, when you find a magazine, Mr. Superintendent, that there is a concern within a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2087.799s">There's</a>  no debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2088.879s">I</a>  don't see how you can say that it didn't rise to that particular level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2092.602s">I</a>  would question your judgment if you honestly believe that that doesn't rise to a level where you should be notifying at least public safety officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2106.654s">And</a>  I say with all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, because we've known each other for a lot of years, but I really don't see how that doesn't rise to a level in this day and age that people should be notified, especially after the incidences that we've had in this community where there's been a lack of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2125.105s">I</a>  thought we were past that stage and the best policy is 100% notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2131.332s">and</a>  then let the administrators and the police do what they have to do, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2135.536s">So</a>  I'd like to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2136.676s">Thank</a>  you, counsel.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2137.477s">That</a>  was the point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2138.498s">Let</a>  the superintendent finish and we will have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2142.321s">We</a>  let the superintendent finish and we'll have time to answer questions.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2146.604s">I'd</a>  like to respond to the notification issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2149.627s">If</a>  you're speaking about a couple of years ago when there was a bomb threat at the high school, the issue wasn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2157.535s">notification,</a>  the issue was timing of the notification, whether it was soon enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2162.956s">And</a>  the committee decided to make it a little bit faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2166.297s">We</a>  notified the public about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2168.858s">We</a>  just didn't do it immediately afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2170.978s">We</a>  did it a few hours later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2172.739s">We</a>  felt that more people would be home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2174.699s">But</a>  the committee felt differently, and we modified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2177.76s">Now</a>  as far as this situation goes, it happened during a school vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2183.342s">It</a>  happened when no students were in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2186.499s">It</a>  didn't happen where there was a firearm anywhere near it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2191.082s">And</a>  there was a plausible thought as to how it may have gotten there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2196.967s">Now,</a>  since that time, we're all aware of what happened in Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2201.771s">And</a>  I'm sure that there's a heightened feeling that somehow that is the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2208.536s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2209.875s">However,</a>  Massachusetts has tremendous gun laws, tremendous gun laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2214.016s">We</a>  can't buy what that individual bought in Florida, in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2219.937s">You</a>  can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2222.418s">From</a>  our standpoint, from my standpoint, I made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2226.939s">In</a>  that decision, we have back and forth, and it was determined that that was the wrong decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2233.941s">I</a>  accept responsibility for it, and we'll go forward from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2239.189s">but</a>  I made the decision in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2241.63s">Sometimes,</a>  you know, we make decisions that people don't agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2245.091s">If</a>  I thought there was something live, if I thought that students were in the building, if I thought there was a weapon anywhere near the place, my decision would have been different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2254.973s">So</a>  I stand on that for the time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2256.634s">I</a>  apologize to anyone who may feel that I did the wrong thing, but I certainly didn't do it with malintent or reason to <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2268.786s">let's</a>  say obfuscate any of the information from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2273.609s">I'll</a>  stand on that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2274.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2275.29s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2278.011s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2280.232s">One</a>  question I have is with regards to, you said you authorized the sweep today and that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2286.116s">I'm</a>  thankful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2287.036s">I'm</a>  thankful that there's going to be sweeps within all of our schools in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2290.538s">I</a>  guess my question goes to why didn't you think this was necessary when you found out in January?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2299.42s">Why</a>  didn't I think it was necessary in January?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2301.121s">A</a>  sweep of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2302.181s">That</a>  could have been there for weeks, and it was just found on the 28th.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2307.423s">No,</a>  we don't think that's the case, because the cleaning service that found it cleans that area regularly and did not see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2316.406s">It's</a>  clear to me that it landed there very recently in proximity to the time that it was found.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2324.189s">And</a>  what's clear to me is that you mentioned there was a plausible <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2329.358s">reason</a>  why it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2330.679s">And</a>  I just want to point out there's hundreds of reasons how it could have got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2335.341s">And</a>  that makes the parents and the staff extremely uncomfortable with how this was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2344.006s">I</a>  question many people's judgment on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2347.368s">And</a>  I guess a question now that a lot of people have, and there's a lot of questions that people have, is especially personnel that work there, because my <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2357.898s">phone</a>  has gone off the hook since the staff has been notified as of like 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2362.3s">today,</a>  they don't feel comfortable with the judgment that was made obviously by you, but by the principal of that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2369.804s">So</a>  I am under the impression he threw it away, and that's what I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2378.268s">And</a>  if you knew in January, I question what he told you then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2382.93s">you</a>  know, why it wasn't reported to the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2384.992s">So,</a>  I mean, I'm not gonna say too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2386.593s">I</a>  do know some of the results of the investigation that the police are working on, but what changes are gonna be made in staff before Monday?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2395.841s">I'm</a>  not gonna evaluate a principal in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2398.163s">Let's</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2400.305s">I</a>  will take actions on personnel matters as we go forward into the spring, but I'm not gonna evaluate a person in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2409.233s">That's</a>  not <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2410.373s">an</a>  appropriate way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2412.114s">Individuals</a>  are entitled to due process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2414.155s">They're</a>  entitled to the protections of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2417.117s">So</a>  the reality is that we will be reviewing personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2423.461s">We</a>  will be reviewing policies and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2426.423s">We</a>  will be ramping up some of our drills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2428.945s">I've</a>  also told the principals that the week we come back, we're going to run a special drill <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2437.5s">I'm</a>  a little concerned about it in some ways because I don't want to heighten in the students' minds that this is somehow an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2443.945s">But</a>  on the other hand, I think we should at least do one more drill at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2450.009s">It</a>  might help the community understand that we're prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2453.232s">But</a>  I think for the most realities of this thing, we will evaluate personnel and situations and policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2460.037s">The</a>  Medford School Committee is going to meet on Thursday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2463.259s">I'm</a>  sure that I'll hear <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2465.27s">from</a>  them pretty directly about what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2468.891s">And</a>  we will follow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2471.012s">And</a>  this judgment that I made won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2475.554s">It's</a>  just that simple.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2478.075s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2478.435s">I</a>  think by not doing anything with administration, by the school committee not doing anything with the administration is poor judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2486.339s">And</a>  by our superintendent of schools, who the people want to see do the right thing <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2493.385s">and</a>  to wait till the spring where parents and personnel at that school are extremely uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2499.908s">I</a>  think it's sending the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2503.49s">I</a>  hope the school committee does what they have to do on Thursday night, because this is something that cannot be repeated, and multiple things need to happen, including, I'm just beside myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2521.226s">We</a>  have not done lockdown drills in our schools this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2523.866s">I</a>  think we did them once, and they've only been done one time last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2527.527s">You</a>  also have the staff who is extremely concerned because they've never done evacuation drills from cafeterias or auditoriums. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2537.689s">There</a>  are personnel who are scared to take their children into the auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2543.53s">I</a>  was there with my family a couple weeks ago, and I mean, this affects <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2549.685s">hundreds</a>  of people that are at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2551.585s">And</a>  this affects our whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2553.706s">And</a>  it's something that really, this cannot be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2557.646s">And</a>  I'm, again, thankful for the police and their investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2560.767s">And</a>  I hope that all the questions that are being asked on social media, and I'm sure are going to be asked tonight, I hope they're answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2569.548s">And</a>  I know that once the investigation is done, I know they will be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2573.449s">I'm</a>  not going to answer them, although I know a lot of the answers, because the investigation is active. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2581.206s">But</a>  people, every single parent, and every single personnel at that school deserves every answer eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2590.049s">And</a>  the sooner, the better.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2592.35s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2593.33s">Councilor</a>  Falco?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2594.21s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2595.731s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2597.031s">Thank</a>  you, Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2599.212s">I</a>  find everything to be very alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2604.734s">As</a>  a father of three kids in the Medford Public Schools, I always feel that my kids are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2611.804s">And</a>  now I see something like this today, and I feel they're safe, but I have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2616.928s">And</a>  I think they're very valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2619.57s">You</a>  know, as far as, you know, when we notify police about an incident like this, do we have a clear policy as to when? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2626.555s">I</a>  mean, to me, there should be a clear, you know, I watch the commercials, I hear it on the radio, I see it on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2633.059s">See</a>  something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2634.901s">I</a>  tell my kids that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2636.602s">You</a>  know, and I think it's a good theory to go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2639.464s">Because</a>  I think, you know, we need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2641.328s">keep</a>  law enforcement active and engaged in what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2644.57s">To</a>  me, this is a clear case where see something, say something should have been the appropriate choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2656.478s">Do</a>  we have a clear policy that says in this situation, there's some sort of ammunition and I'm no gun expert, but there's some sort of weapon that we contact the police.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2670.12s">So</a>  Councilor, you've been on the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2671.841s">Yes,</a>  I have.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2672.402s">And</a>  you've received multiple phone calls or letters from me when situations have happened over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2680.608s">And</a>  I believe Councilor Scarpelli, you have also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2683.63s">Anyone</a>  who's on the school committee knows that it's a regular practice, and we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2689.214s">There</a>  are some things that happen in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2690.736s">It</a>  could be a kid fight, something else like that, or in the backyard, or an injury, or something like that, that you just can't <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2698.956s">take</a>  everything that happens every day and send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2701.678s">But</a>  having said that, this situation, in retrospect, was one that deserved notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2708.882s">And</a>  the judgment that I made was not the best judgment at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2715.126s">I</a>  accept that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2719.509s">What</a>  I would like to see is I would like to see the school committee work on a clear policy.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2723.572s">The</a>  school committee wants to be notified, Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2725.973s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2726.593s">They</a>  want to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2728.041s">on</a>  situations that are serious and I should have notified them on this one.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2733.603s">But</a>  I think the parents as well, because if you're going to notify the school committee, that's going to go out to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2739.564s">So</a>  the general public should hear from our school leader, the superintendent saying, this is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2744.226s">This</a>  is what's been found. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2745.386s">This</a>  is what we think is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2748.767s">I</a>  mean, getting input from the chief as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2751.448s">I</a>  think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2753.148s">You</a>  know, I understand that there are probably certain issues that are minor, that maybe not everyone needs to know about, if there's a fight in the playground or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2760.893s">But</a>  something like this, where there's a piece of ammunition that's found, you know, within the school building, that that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2768.558s">And</a>  that's a concern that many people have here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2770.659s">There's</a>  many people that are watching at home that have this concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2773.801s">And</a>  I know all of us behind this rail have the same concern.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2776.803s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2777.964s">And</a>  I just want to say that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2780.819s">Normally,</a>  I tell the chief virtually everything because we have very good communication and have for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2787.443s">In</a>  this instance, I didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2788.804s">I</a>  failed in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2790.445s">I</a>  accept that responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2792.207s">But</a>  typically, the school committee does want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2795.108s">And</a>  I think it's clear to me that I should have informed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2798.671s">But</a>  I don't believe and I think this is the key point that needs to be made and needs to be heard throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2805.815s">I</a>  don't believe our schools are unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2808.597s">I</a>  don't believe <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2810.418s">that</a>  our children are in danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2812.159s">I</a>  believe that the school committee, the council, by paying money for cameras and other things like that, have provided quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2820.584s">The</a>  police department has worked very closely with us, with resource officers, with all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2825.267s">We</a>  work closely with the district attorney to determine what's happening on the street on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2830.771s">There</a>  is a lot going on that heads off issues in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2836.747s">If</a>  I made a mistake this time, not if I made, I made a mistake this time, I accept that responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2842.772s">But</a>  I believe enough's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2845.234s">And</a>  I believe that if we, we dedicate ourselves to it, we'll be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2851.219s">I</a>  believe our schools are safe as any school in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2856.083s">But</a>  having said that, there are no guarantees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2859.927s">There</a>  are no guarantees that I can give you or anyone of sound mind could give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2865.438s">because</a>  we live in a society that is a little violent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2868.32s">We</a>  live in a society that does do unusual things at times, and we do have a lot of mental health out there, and there are guns on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2876.287s">And</a>  that requires even more, more from the people that make decisions, make decisions about these issues and these policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2883.814s">But</a>  in this instance, I accept responsibility.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2888.798s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, I would honestly like to see you, the police chief Sacco, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2894.501s">the</a>  mayor and the school committee come together and formulate a policy as to, you know, when, you know, to actually put a policy in place, when should the police be contacted about an issue like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2905.748s">Because</a>  I think there needs to be a clear definition, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2909.051s">I</a>  mean, I'd like to see that.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2910.011s">I</a>  will put that on our calendar for Thursday evening.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2912.433s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2913.113s">Now,</a>  the Thursday night meeting, which I know I've received a ton of calls about, I believe that's going to be at the high school.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.077s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.377s">I</a>  would respectfully ask that that be held here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2922.199s">I</a>  think it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2924.264s">from</a>  being a former school committee member, having meetings at the high school, the acoustics are really, they're not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2930.509s">I</a>  think you, my guess is you're gonna have a lot of people at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2933.852s">I</a>  think that it's better situated to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2936.033s">You</a>  have microphones, you have, people will be able to actually hear the dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2940.577s">This</a>  is an important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2942.258s">It's</a>  an important issue that people wanna know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2944.6s">They</a>  wanna know what happened, when it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2946.521s">They</a>  wanna see a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2948.163s">I</a>  think that if you try to have a meeting like that in a library or the superintendent's conference room, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2952.694s">I</a>  really think that's probably not the best way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2955.576s">I</a>  think having it here at Chambers is the best venue to have the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2961.76s">I</a>  think it seats more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2963.301s">And</a>  I think, like I said, the acoustics are much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2965.383s">I've</a>  been to budget meetings up at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2967.964s">And</a>  if you're sitting in the back, you really have no idea what's going on up at the front, just because the acoustics are not great.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2974.369s">So</a>  let me ask a technical question of the clerk, if I may, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2978.691s">We've</a>  posted a meeting, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2980.693s">We've</a>  posted it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2982.762s">Can</a>  we make a modification if the chair agrees to make that modification under the open meeting law?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3001.211s">Right</a>  now, the city has only accepted, number one, is the clerk's posting board as the primary posting board, and two, is the 24-hour posting board <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3013.427s">which</a>  is the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3016.769s">So</a>  we have not accepted, but the website today is a posting board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3024.195s">That's</a>  not to say that other cities in town haven't done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3029.238s">It's</a>  probably something we should look at now.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3031.059s">So</a>  I'll communicate with your office tomorrow morning, and you can tell me whether we fall within the guidelines.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3037.564s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.425s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.725s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3039.886s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3040.966s">With</a>  regard to the sweep of the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3043.456s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3044.076s">With</a>  regard to the sweep, uh, regarding the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3046.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3047.359s">Uh,</a>  now you said that will be done in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3049.44s">Is</a>  that going to be done on the weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3051.161s">Uh,</a>  just because, I mean, we're asking that they begin tomorrow and they start doing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3058.046s">So</a>  we sweeping schools while kids are in the schools.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3061.769s">Not</a>  at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3063.23s">No,</a>  they're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3064.451s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3064.771s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3065.071s">It's</a>  fake. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3065.372s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3066.012s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3066.612s">I</a>  should know that my kids are very excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3069.294s">Um,</a>  with regard to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3072.466s">Now,</a>  with regard to our current situation, with our current protocols, we lock down the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3079.65s">We</a>  lock down the schools currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3081.371s">If</a>  there's an issue and the schools go down, it's a lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3085.353s">I</a>  know we've talked about this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3087.514s">I've</a>  received a number of calls with regard to people asking about why aren't we using ALICE, which is a program that's well-known. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3096.159s">Police</a>  Chief Sacco, I believe you know about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3097.94s">And</a>  I believe there are members of the police force that are trained in the ALICE program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3102.594s">Is</a>  that something that we are potentially looking at moving towards? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3106.796s">Is</a>  that something that you think would be beneficial? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3110.298s">I</a>  mean, I know there's a lot that goes into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3113.499s">But</a>  if you could weigh in on that a little bit, because I know I've received a number of questions about that.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3119.202s">It's</a>  a program that's been around for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3121.163s">And</a>  it seems like every day another school district is adopting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3124.945s">It</a>  just gives the school system, the staff, and students options to pick from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3132.199s">I'm</a>  a proponent of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3133.439s">I've</a>  seen it in action in many communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3135.9s">It's</a>  something that obviously the superintendent and the school committee would have to approve, but you just don't switch and have it work right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3143.723s">You</a>  have to do a lot of training and educating, uh, the staff and faculty and students and probably start at the high school and go to the middle school and then the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3155.847s">So</a>  it's something that would take a little bit of time, but I'm sure that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3159.964s">Like</a>  I said, it's going like wildfire right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3163.067s">It's</a>  spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3164.468s">Many</a>  of the districts in the state have adopted the ALICE program.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3168.912s">I've</a>  done a little bit of research myself on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3172.214s">And</a>  if you go online, there's videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3175.397s">I</a>  think the City of Waltham has a video on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3179.561s">And</a>  they do a good job of basically describing what it is and what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3184.545s">And</a>  they walk you through the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3188.53s">From</a>  what I can see, it seems like it's a good program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3190.95s">I</a>  think it's something that we should really look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3193.411s">If</a>  it's something that you support, I really think that we should probably be moving in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3201.292s">You're</a>  our expert with regards to law enforcement, and I think that- I don't know about expert, but- But I do feel that you really are our expert when it comes to law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3211.874s">You</a>  talk to people in other districts, and I know Superintendent Belson, you do as well, but I think that this is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3218.364s">In</a>  my opinion, this is something that the school committee should really consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3223.687s">Looking</a>  into Alice, I know it doesn't happen overnight, but I think maybe we should look into it and probably by the fall, by the next school year, it's something that we should implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3234.833s">So</a>  if we could, and I'm not sure if you could possibly add that to your agenda for Thursday night, but I think it's something that should be considered.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3241.877s">If</a>  I may, just before the superintendent speaks on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3245.057s">I</a>  think it's important that we at least do the training in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3248.419s">Whether</a>  it be ALICE or some other program, or we create a local program, adopting the best practices from all the other programs that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3257.363s">I</a>  think we need to do that and we have people ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3260.324s">We</a>  have at least three instructors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3263.194s">at</a>  this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3263.854s">And</a>  just so that everyone knows what ALICE stands for, it's alert, lockdown, inform, it's confront or combat, and evacuate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3275.162s">So</a>  I know that there's the questionable component there, that option of confronting the bad guy, but it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3284.348s">And</a>  if you're faced with the other alternative, you have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3290.011s">And</a>  that would be the option. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3291.598s">This</a>  program gives you options. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3293.119s">It's</a>  not just a lockdown and hide under the tables and shut the lights and put the red card out or the green card out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3298.441s">This</a>  gives you options. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3299.441s">If</a>  you have a means of escape, you escape. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3302.662s">And</a>  like I said, I've seen it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3304.723s">I've</a>  worked with a lot of people in many police departments that actually teach their whole school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3310.506s">And</a>  it's, you know, there's some initial reluctance, but then it's overwhelmingly supported once it's in place.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3319.069s">So</a>  a comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3323.362s">Of</a>  all the letters in ALICE, the only one we don't do is confront. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3330.184s">Because</a>  everyone alerts people if there's something going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3334.385s">Everyone</a>  locks down if they have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3337.707s">Everyone</a>  informs mutual aid or assistance when they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3343.948s">And</a>  everyone tries to evacuate if they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3346.869s">It's</a>  the confront part that becomes of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3350.471s">And</a>  the reason it's of concern <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3353.291s">Think</a>  about young kids, little kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3355.872s">Should</a>  they be trying to confront? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3358.553s">Are</a>  all teachers, are all staff physically able to confront? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3363.635s">Will</a>  they try to confront? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3367.296s">Can</a>  we mandate that they confront? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3370.517s">There's</a>  a lot to this that needs to be thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3372.718s">And</a>  what age group do you start? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3375.259s">And</a>  when do you start? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3376.02s">It's</a>  really an active shooter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3377.34s">It's</a>  not just a general program for bomb threats or things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3380.341s">It's</a>  a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3381.322s">So</a>  there's a lot to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3384.346s">In</a>  that regard, who confronts and in what way, and who's able to confront, not everybody is going to be willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3394.713s">So</a>  we have to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3396.074s">Chief</a>  and I have talked about starting maybe with the older kids and the higher grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3404.64s">There's</a>  some issues with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3405.56s">But</a>  look, I am more than willing to have the discussion and to have <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3411.988s">an</a>  active give and take on this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3414.829s">But</a>  we need all the players who are going to be expected to step up to tell us whether they're prepared to confront. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3421.51s">Now,</a>  the other day when the Parkland situation took place, if you remember the sequence, the individual pulled a fire alarm to get people to evacuate the setting and then was going to pick them off with his gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3439.614s">I've</a>  heard many times, why don't we evacuate this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3442.662s">And</a>  I've told you in previous occasions that evacuation isn't always the best drill because the explosive or the sniper could be on the outside of the building, not just on the inside of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3457.674s">It's</a>  all situation-specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3460.496s">And</a>  it needs to be talked about, more than willing to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3464.539s">Let's</a>  not just put out alphabet soup, ALICE, and say that's a cure-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3469.763s">Happy</a>  to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3471.184s">Happy</a>  to get people to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3473.148s">But</a>  it's got to be adopted and committed to by the people who are going to implement it, or else it's just another training program that will go nowhere.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3481.612s">Well,</a>  I mean, I think it's something that should be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3484.174s">I</a>  think the school committee should seriously consider it, at least at the high school level, maybe even the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3492.598s">I</a>  understand there's concerns at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3495.021s">I</a>  get that, but I think, especially if it's something, Chief, that you're a fan of, I would think that it's something that should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3502.467s">I'd</a>  like to see that part of a future school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3506.711s">I</a>  think it's something that they should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3509.933s">With</a>  regard to the McGlynn staff.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3512.675s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3513.676s">Now,</a>  I believe you said you may possibly meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3517.475s">Is</a>  that something that's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3519.376s">I</a>  mean, is there a demand there?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3520.677s">It's</a>  been offered to the president of the MTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.259s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.58s">And</a>  she hasn't confirmed it yet, but she thinks it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3526.002s">But</a>  she has to confirm it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3527.263s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3528.203s">Well,</a>  I thank you for answering all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3532.206s">That's</a>  all I have for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3535.349s">Like</a>  I said, I'm a big fan of see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3538.771s">I</a>  think that should have been the first thing, the first approach that you should have taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3544.316s">I</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3545.837s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3546.87s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and Mr. Belson, thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3549.692s">I</a>  appreciate your being so candid with the situation and accepting responsibility for what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3557.078s">With</a>  that being said, when will the investigation be complete?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3562.081s">Well,</a>  that's a police investigation, so I leave that to the Chief to answer that one.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3571.815s">As</a>  with any investigation, it's hard to give a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3574.896s">I</a>  mean, the investigators are speaking with a number of individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3580.278s">I'd</a>  like to be able to tell you within a week, maybe two weeks tops, but it takes time and we don't know when someone starts to give us a story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3590.002s">We</a>  don't know what road it's going to take us down, so it may take a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3594.604s">They</a>  made tremendous headway since it came to my attention on Friday through Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3601.271s">that</a>  they've worked on this and the pieces are coming together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3604.692s">Everybody's</a>  been cooperative? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3606.932s">To</a>  date, yes.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3611.353s">Superintendent</a>  Belson, now we have the STARS program, and what would the normal reporting process be in the STARS program if a situation like this occurred?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3620.655s">STARS</a>  was set up to look at school threats, the acronym School Threat Assessment and Response System. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3628.377s">So</a>  when a school threat is identified, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3631.243s">or</a>  we believe it is identified, and we believe it requires additional resources above and beyond what we have, we would notify the STARS commanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3642.128s">Chief</a>  Sacco once headed that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3643.709s">I'm</a>  not sure who heads it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3647.351s">We</a>  would notify them, and they would provide us with those resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3651.493s">So</a>  let's say we needed a graphologist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3653.254s">They</a>  might have a graphologist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3654.515s">Let's</a>  say we needed a certain type of psychiatrist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3657.516s">They</a>  would help us with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3659.017s">Let's</a>  say we needed a forensic help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3662.237s">There</a>  are certain police departments and entities in the state that have forensic, the bomb squads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3666.838s">They</a>  would coordinate the kind of specialized assistance that we need to make the appropriate threat assessment and then make the appropriate response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3676.881s">If</a>  we needed, unfortunately, a SWAT team, that would be the ultimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3684.423s">But</a>  it's a coordinated response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3685.904s">And</a>  I want to make that point very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3687.364s">There's</a>  a lot of people out there selling products about, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3691.135s">coordinating</a>  with schools and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3693.015s">There's</a>  a lot of money being made in the school security business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3697.276s">And</a>  part of it brings up the idea that we could have an uncoordinated response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3704.838s">And</a>  that's the last thing we wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3706.038s">The</a>  chief and I both agree that if we have a situation that requires mutual aid or specialized assistance, we want that coordinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3716.854s">You</a>  may not know, but I think we will have said it many times, but maybe you don't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3722.057s">There</a>  are floor plans on the computers of the police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3726.02s">There</a>  are doors that are marked that people can go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3729.802s">There's</a>  all kinds of pre-preparation in place for STARS to work and for our own police to respond strategically and specifically to areas which we believe require attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3744.906s">What</a>  we don't want is we don't want what happened in 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3747.747s">Remember</a>  1992?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3748.448s">I</a>  was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3749.588s">I</a>  was there.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3753.39s">In</a>  1992, there was a altercation at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3760.513s">And</a>  at that time, people came from everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3763.054s">Helicopters</a>  were flying over the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3764.694s">People</a>  were coming in all different kinds of uniforms, not coordinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3768.276s">And</a>  that only created more problems than it assisted in helping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3773.857s">So</a>  it's very important, and I thank the chief and his comrades at NMWEC for the work that they have put in to ensure that a response of that type through the STAR system is one that is coordinated, thorough, and strategic.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3793.568s">And</a>  Mr. Belson, if this incident had occurred when school was in session, what would the response have been?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3798.271s">Very</a>  different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3799.872s">Very</a>  different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3800.472s">If</a>  it occurred when students were there, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3803.234s">would</a>  have been a full report and immediate response.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3808.577s">In</a>  terms of identifying failures in the reporting system, I think that this has been opened up as a failure in the reporting structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3815.581s">And</a>  where's the biggest failure that you've identified thus far in terms of the reporting structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3819.683s">Is</a>  it between the cleaning contact crack to giving it to the senior custodian, the senior custodian not reporting it to the principal appropriately?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3827.067s">I'm</a>  not going to blame anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3831.383s">I</a>  knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3832.684s">I</a>  have a relationship with the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3835.364s">I</a>  should have made the report.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3837.805s">And</a>  I guess the next question is, what are the next steps that we can hear from so that we can be assured that this isn't going to happen again?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3843.127s">The</a>  next step is to continue to fortify and to continue to assess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3846.709s">I</a>  expect to be in front of you in and around March 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3849.75s">I</a>  know you're looking forward to seeing me again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3852.311s">Attempted</a>  humor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3856.926s">to</a>  get funding for the upgrade to all the security cameras that we've put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3863.972s">We</a>  have upgraded all of them so that they're now capable to withstand some of the weather issues that previously they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3872.219s">They</a>  have better visibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3873.48s">They</a>  have better ability to pan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3876.022s">And</a>  we think it's a distinct improvement over what we've been able to have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3881.267s">So</a>  I'll be in front of you for that, too.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3884.684s">Do</a>  you have any knowledge as to whether or not the school committee is going to continue to allow rental opportunities to outside organizations in our schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3890.508s">Is</a>  this something they're going to be looking at from a policy standpoint?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3892.309s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3893.21s">I</a>  think there are a lot of terrific groups that rent our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3895.431s">And</a>  every group from Cub Scouts to all kinds of groups all the way up rent our schools or use our schools in a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3903.717s">This</a>  is an outlier situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3906.278s">This</a>  is not something that's happened frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3910.541s">Maybe</a>  we didn't handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3911.542s">Maybe</a>  I didn't handle it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3914.65s">But</a>  that doesn't mean we should deprive the community of the resources of the schools, which I think are very important to providing appropriate recreation and assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3923.134s">Look,</a>  shut down the pool, we just did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3925.055s">You</a>  want to shut down the gymnasium? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3926.616s">We</a>  can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3928.196s">We</a>  can't live in fear.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3929.337s">No,</a>  and I'm not asking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3931.178s">I</a>  don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction to address an issue in the community that I think needs a long hard look. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3939.402s">And</a>  I can certainly appreciate how candid you are this evening, and thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3943.145s">That</a>  does it for my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3944.626s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3946.087s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3946.908s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3948.088s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3949.389s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent Pelson, for coming down tonight to responding to the concerns as this became aware in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3958.255s">And</a>  also thank you for taking responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3961.218s">That's</a>  a component of your leadership I'm grateful for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3967.468s">A</a>  number of things have been brought up by some of the Councilors that I'm concerned of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3971.372s">I</a>  was particularly concerned of, as Councilor Knight mentioned, a reassessment of or an examination of the groups that use our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3982.782s">I</a>  know the Chief mentioned that this is an ongoing investigation and that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3988.126s">There's</a>  one piece to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3993.178s">single</a>  out a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3995.079s">I</a>  don't want to vilify anyone, Mr. Superintendent, but I can't imagine in my mind how one mislays something so important, critical, and apparently dangerous that's in a school building as bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4020.487s">a</a>  clip of bullets and I hope I am not asking for an answer and perhaps you can't answer that and perhaps you know right now, but I'm hoping sincerely that we get to the bottom of where these have gone and how that piece of evidence sort of has exited the scene and hope that something so grave as this is dealt with in a better way.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4050.478s">So</a>  I appreciate the observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4052.719s">I</a>  can assure you that my conversations with certain individuals will be very direct and very thorough, and that decisions will be made about a lot of things in the next short period of time.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4067.583s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4069.664s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4071.404s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4072.945s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, in my opinion, it's clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4078.217s">if</a>  this wasn't brought to certain people's attention in the community, this would have never came out in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4087.12s">That's</a>  my own feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4089.361s">And</a>  again, we can talk about best practices, we could talk about additional funding for cameras, we could talk about new policies and procedures, and all that can be negated by one bad judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4104.284s">All</a>  that, any policies and procedures in place can all be negated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4108.145s">And</a>  I think that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4109.685s">I</a>  do think we have policies and procedures in place that weren't followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4113.746s">And</a>  I know you take responsibility now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4117.127s">You</a>  mentioned about coordinated and uncoordinated efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4121.288s">I</a>  would consider what took place an uncoordinated effort internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4126.049s">Would</a>  you not?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4130.249s">I</a>  don't think it was a question of coordination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4133.274s">Not</a>  notifying.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4134.394s">I</a>  don't think that was full coordination, but clearly part of part of coordination is notification, correct?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.216s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.496s">I'll</a>  accept that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4145.377s">My</a>  other point, and I'm not a Johnny come lately on the issue is year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4150.079s">I've</a>  been questioning you regarding the rentals of our school buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4155.991s">And</a>  year after year, we've had debates, many at this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4160.536s">And</a>  I'm not going to rehash all the different debates, but I do feel strongly, Mr. Superintendent, you promised me you'd look into this, that many of our buildings are rented out to outside organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4174.511s">that</a>  have no affiliation with this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4177.273s">We</a>  do no background checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4179.214s">We</a>  have no idea who are entering, exiting, what they're bringing into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4184.818s">And</a>  in my opinion, when it's mentioned to you, you kind of shrug it off and say, well, we can't crawl up and hide in a ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4196.346s">We</a>  rent our buildings out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4197.847s">And</a>  I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4199.508s">But</a>  the safety and security of our children and our faculty should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4204.831s">And</a>  if it comes to telling a program that they're no longer welcome back in this community because we choose not to rent out our buildings to make an additional 25 or 30 grand a year, which is a pittance, to be quite honest with you, in the scheme of a city budget, to me would lend a lot more peace of mind to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4225.575s">We've</a>  had this discussion about the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4227.896s">After</a>  3 o'clock, we don't have one security person on at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4234.071s">After</a>  three o'clock, as you know, there's extracurricular activities, there's after school programs, and there's not one person at the high school that's there for security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4244.355s">I</a>  don't count custodians, I know you do, for security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4248.216s">I</a>  don't count having faculty around that they're security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4252.938s">And</a>  I think that's a real breach of a safe and secure building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4257.92s">And</a>  I just can't see why you can't see that, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4261.559s">And</a>  again, it concerns me about a lack of judgment when it comes to having people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4267.44s">We</a>  don't know what they're bringing into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4269.921s">We</a>  really don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4270.741s">In</a>  this day and age, Mr. Superintendent, I think it's best to err on the side of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4275.422s">And</a>  I know you mentioned about Cub Scouts, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4278.723s">And</a>  we don't want to make Cub Scouts not come into our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4281.563s">I'm</a>  talking about outside organizations that have no city affiliation, that you don't know who's going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4290.839s">Chief</a>  of Police doesn't know who's entering these buildings, and we don't know what they're doing inside these buildings, but they do have access to classrooms, to auditoriums, to cafeterias, and to a host of things within our building, and that's of grave concern, and something that no policy or procedure is going to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4308.784s">We</a>  have to take an internal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4310.956s">saying,</a>  is this what we really want out of our buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4313.978s">Is</a>  it worth the public safety? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4315.599s">Is</a>  it worth the wear and tear? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4317.44s">I</a>  don't believe so, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4319.361s">And</a>  I don't think we could just shrug our shoulders year after year and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4323.383s">We've</a>  had no incidences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4324.444s">We're</a>  doing fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4325.885s">This</a>  could have been an incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4327.606s">If</a>  you found some flour, sugar, and frosting underneath the seat in the auditorium, you would say they're baking a cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4335.05s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4336.051s">But</a>  you find a magazine with bullets, and you don't think there's any serious nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4340.414s">That</a>  there's no affiliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4352.782s">I</a>  really believe, Mr. Superintendent, that someone needs to be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4357.455s">Someone</a>  needs to be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4359.158s">You</a>  don't want to discuss particular personnel matters, and I agree, this is not the forum to discuss it, but someone needs to be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4367.209s">How</a>  can you be cleaning your office the day after this took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4371.004s">take</a>  a magazine off the shelf and say, oh, this doesn't look like my pocket pen or this doesn't, and discard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4380.567s">How</a>  does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4381.868s">Unless</a>  your office is a filthy mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4385.609s">I</a>  don't understand how that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4387.23s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4389.018s">And</a>  even if it does look like a cell phone, how many people throw cell phones out? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4393.322s">I</a>  mean, I just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4395.645s">It</a>  seems to me the perfect, and I hate to use the words, the perfect coverup to something that should have been reported immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4409.991s">We're</a>  not here to alarm people, I agree with you, but having administrators, having faculty, having parents, having them make that decision whether this is serious or not, whether they want to send their kids to school, is up to them, Mr. Superintendent, and not up to you making an individual, standalone decision on whether you think it rises to an area of such seriousness that people should be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4434.549s">I</a>  really am very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4437.45s">I</a>  have to say, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're stepping down soon and I wish you well in your retirement, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4447.853s">I'm</a>  very disappointed that it's taken seven weeks to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4451.744s">into</a>  the public and just barely come out, and only because I think people found out about it and raised awareness that it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4460.31s">Otherwise,</a>  I think it would have been brushed under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4462.832s">And</a>  it would lead me to believe what else is being brushed under the rug that we should be aware of.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4502.52s">We</a>  don't brush things under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4505.022s">But</a>  from time to time, we make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4508.629s">That's</a>  what decision makers do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4510.21s">We</a>  make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4511.711s">And</a>  if I've made a decision that didn't square with everyone else, then I accept responsibility for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4518.196s">But</a>  we don't brush things under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4519.878s">And</a>  the chief will tell you that we have talked about some very tough items. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4524.381s">And</a>  there will be some things you don't know about because they're personal and they're caught up in legal matters that you can't know and the school committee gets advised of because it's not a public matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4533.869s">But</a>  that's the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4535.27s">And</a>  that's what's required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4537.981s">But</a>  clearly on safety matters, safety matters, we don't brush things under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4543.663s">Now</a>  as far as people using our facilities, we can cancel every basketball game, we can cancel every hockey game, let me finish, we can cancel every game where people come in who are visiting from some other place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4557.067s">We</a>  know, we know that in society today there are some people out there that do horrible things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4565.188s">And</a>  we can't just regulate everything that's going on all around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4570.054s">Now,</a>  if you don't want to rent the school properties, if you don't feel that that revenue or that communication with the public is a good one, that can be a policy discussion with the school committee guided by some input that you want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4582.688s">But</a>  clearly, our schools <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4585.598s">Our</a>  schools are going to be places, they've been community schools for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4589.0s">People</a>  have used them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4590.281s">And</a>  people come in visiting from other communities and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4594.244s">If</a>  we stopped everyone at the door, let me finish the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4596.785s">If</a>  we stopped everyone at the door, the event would never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4600.768s">So</a>  I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4603.31s">But</a>  clearly, we don't hide anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4606.952s">This</a>  was a situation, it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4610.374s">And</a>  as I've said before, I'm taking responsibility for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4612.956s">I'm</a>  not sure how much more I can say that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4614.943s">Well,</a>  I don't think it's enough responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4617.103s">But</a>  needless to say, at the beginning of your speech, you made mention, and you referenced it, that that building was rented prior to what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4626.725s">And</a>  I believe you mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4627.986s">And</a>  you can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4630.286s">You</a>  mentioned that to allude that this was probably brought in from somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4635.687s">This</a>  wasn't a student bringing it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4637.928s">This</a>  was probably someone that came into our building through a rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4642.709s">Is</a>  that not correct, Mr. Superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4644.977s">That's</a>  my assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4646.558s">Investigation</a>  is undergoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4648.519s">I'm</a>  not going to conclude anything until the police finish their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4652.161s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4653.182s">So</a>  that leads you to believe that we should be looking at who's renting our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4658.405s">Shouldn't</a>  that lead you to believe that we do need security, Mr. Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4663.828s">Do</a>  you have security when you rent these buildings there?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4666.429s">These</a>  buildings, when they're rented of that type, like for example, the Japanese language school has two security guards there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4671.212s">They</a>  pay for them.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4672.752s">I'm</a>  talking about the McGlynn schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4674.413s">There's</a>  security there.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4676.195s">They</a>  pay for coverage by custodians who function as security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4681.018s">So</a>  we have custodians that are now security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4683.199s">Are</a>  they paying a different rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4685.261s">They</a>  provide us with coverage in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4687.882s">That's</a>  what we need.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4691.32s">We</a>  could talk as we've done in the past few years until we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4695.103s">We</a>  just don't see eye to eye on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4697.445s">And</a>  I hope it never amounts to anything other than just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4700.447s">But</a>  I think we need to take a serious look at, Mr. President, our rentals, which the superintendent told me for the last, I think, four or five budget periods that it's being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.334s">Is</a>  it being looked at? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.954s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4714.594s">Maybe</a>  it's being looked at.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4715.355s">We</a>  have provided some security, have paid for some security of certain people in these large groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4719.096s">I've</a>  mentioned the Japanese as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4721.356s">But,</a>  you know, not every group is paying for security, so maybe we need to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4726.538s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4727.278s">Maybe</a>  we need to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4729.799s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4731.399s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4733.18s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4734.1s">I'm</a>  not going to... I won't be redundant what my colleagues have already issued, but I do have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4739.822s">I</a>  know we have parents that need to talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4742.443s">I</a>  have to express my displeasure, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4744.625s">I</a>  know that how hard you work as an educator, one of the greatest superintendent minds in education in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4751.449s">I</a>  think what we have with this situation is something that in many layers bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4757.193s">As</a>  a former school team member, we were adamant that notification was paramount to whatever situations moving forward at that time, and obviously that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4768.501s">I</a>  appreciate you coming out and saying that you're taking responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4771.946s">And</a>  I appreciate you saying that this isn't a forum for personnel matters, but I know as a parent, as a parent of two children in the Medford Public Schools, we need to see something happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4786.921s">There</a>  has to be something done, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4788.722s">This</a>  isn't something we're going to push to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4790.684s">Something</a>  has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4794.062s">Because</a>  I know we don't want to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4796.967s">We</a>  don't want to live in fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4798.53s">I</a>  personally think the opposite now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4800.433s">We</a>  need to live in fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4802.056s">These</a>  are scary times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4803.198s">Our</a>  kids are afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4804.932s">And</a>  this would have been a great learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4807.834s">Imagine</a>  getting into a classroom and teaching the situation of bringing this type of dangerous ammunition and weapons into our schools and understanding how we could teach our children how important and how scary this is because it is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4823.825s">Society</a>  today is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4825.046s">It's</a>  frightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4826.377s">You</a>  know, I've talked to my kids about this just the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4829.179s">You</a>  know, Councilor Knight and I talked about this when I talked about our local government taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4833.943s">And</a>  then this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4836.025s">I'm</a>  so disappointed, so many different levels, because I'm going to beat the dead horse with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4843.791s">It's</a>  bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4845.412s">It's</a>  ammunition to a weapon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4848.345s">of</a>  mass destruction, where kids have died just recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4851.787s">So</a>  there is fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4852.607s">There</a>  is heightened fear in this room and at home with our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4858.771s">So</a>  I need you to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4860.332s">I</a>  know we don't want to be afraid and we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure that our kids feel safe in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4866.371s">I</a>  absolutely agree with you, and we do a great job in our school system making sure we feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4870.753s">But</a>  you know what, I think society has to realize, when things get done, it's out of fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4875.655s">And</a>  this is fear, this is necessity now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4877.996s">And</a>  to have to start at this level, this is something that I'd have to put a huge black eye in what didn't happen in this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4885.739s">This</a>  was bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4886.999s">This</a>  was bad in so many different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4888.96s">that</a>  I'm sick of just even discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4891.842s">But</a>  moving forward, I know the parents need to talk, but we have so many members in our community, our school community, that you work so hard to protect and making sure that our students with mental issues and are disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4907.713s">These</a>  are our kids that are right in the front line of situations like this, that we need to get answers for to make sure they're protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4914.798s">So,</a>  again, as a former colleague of many of those teachers there who taught with them and went through the lockdown situations in that course, I can understand, but we need to do more with this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4930.612s">We</a>  need to know that if it happens again, a bullet is enough, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4935.699s">A</a>  threat is enough that we have to let our children and our parents and our faculty know what's going on so we can prepare our children to make decisions what we think is right and safe for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4946.813s">So,</a>  again, believe me, I hate to be a heavy, but I tell you what, I am so sad and so disappointed that this wasn't presented in that fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4955.403s">I</a>  know Dan Tully, he's a very thorough individual, and I'm sure he brought it to the attention that it was going to be reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4963.837s">and</a>  it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4964.437s">So</a>  I think we need to, you need to move on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4967.399s">And</a>  I know that the investigation is one thing, but as a leader of our school system that I, that I entrust with you, we need to make, we need to make some hard decisions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4976.185s">So</a>  thank you, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4977.986s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4981.949s">I</a>  thank councilor Scarpelli for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4984.21s">I</a>  just have a point of information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4986.132s">I</a>  don't think that the school committee needs to move on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4994.42s">I</a>  believe that somebody that knew about it in January has to be evaluated as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4999.623s">So</a>  that's my comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5003.366s">My</a>  other last two questions, to wrap it up, would be for the Chief of Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5010.391s">Having</a>  multiple, multiple people come to me with this information, very upset about it, obviously for the safety of themselves, their fellow staff members, and the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5023.499s">And</a>  then days later, knowing that I had to handle it, and they obviously needed to be handled, they now fear retaliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5033.904s">So</a>  as a chief of police that has done everything right since I came to you on Friday, I want you to know this is the fear of personnel in that building, that they fear retaliation from the principal and from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5049.612s">And</a>  I want them to know, have your comment on that.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5054.151s">First</a>  thing, I don't know that that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5056.852s">But</a>  second thing, most importantly, if they feel that there's anything happening to them because of reporting this incident, they have to let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5066.136s">They</a>  have to let the police department know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5067.676s">It</a>  goes all the way back to reporting what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5072.798s">And</a>  I have to say at this point, and I haven't said it in a while, but the schools in Medford are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5081.141s">Schools</a>  in this region are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5083.285s">But</a>  I have to tell you, that doesn't happen by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5087.626s">That's</a>  because of the hard work of the teachers and the staff in the schools every single day, that they keep their thumb on what's going on in those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5095.368s">So</a>  I have to give them a lot of credit for what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5098.349s">They're</a>  the ones that are keeping those schools safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5100.889s">So</a>  I don't want anyone to think otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5104.27s">And</a>  when I say the teachers and the staff, I'm talking about the custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5108.811s">Because</a>  I keep thinking in my mind what would have happened <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5111.892s">If</a>  the custodian didn't find that, but some child found that later in the day or the following week or a month later.</p>
