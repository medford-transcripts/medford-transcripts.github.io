[SPEAKER_26]: Presence, please rise and salute the flag.

13
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:24,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

14
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:29,763
[SPEAKER_26]: Before we start the meeting tonight, I know I spoke to a bunch of the press before.

15
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:39,224
[SPEAKER_26]: City Council rules state if you want to tape, if you want a video, please respect our rules, which are the middle window to the middle window and around the back.

16
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:44,308
[SPEAKER_26]: Please do not come up here and have your iPhones in people's faces.

17
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:47,571
[SPEAKER_26]: So if you want to tape, we don't have a problem with anybody taping.

18
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:51,494
[SPEAKER_26]: Just respect the rules and tape within the certain parameters that we have.

19
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:52,695
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

21
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:01,167
[SPEAKER_26]: 18-090 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli.

22
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:10,059
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Office of Community Development forward the Memphis City Council an explanation of programs, policies, and procedures currently in place.

23
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:13,735
[SPEAKER_26]: to ensure inclusionary housing in the city of Medford.

24
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,117
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Scarpelli.

25
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

26
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,323
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I'm talking to the chair of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

27
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:30,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they've been drafting up a few of the ideas and presentations of what we're looking for moving forward with development.

28
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:42,797
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the biggest concerns that we hear now is the lack of housing and the lack of the type of housing that makes Medford the community that Medford is, which is housing for families.

29
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that looking into

30
00:01:46,639 --> 00:02:10,849
[SPEAKER_05]: the rules and the policies that we need to jump in a little bit deeper in seeing what we're doing to make Medford continue to thrive as a community of families and looking to possibly increasing our affordable housing to what is acceptable in our community.

31
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're still at, I believe, 10%, but I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

32
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:41,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Another piece that's alarming, you can see it in our community next door, they're having huge concerns with residents there that were accepted into the affordable housing units in different condominiums and now are being told by the developers that are there that they now need to move out because of the popularity of

33
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:49,832
[SPEAKER_05]: of selling those condos as individual units and they're being asked to leave and given a mere $1,000 just to move out.

34
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's important that before

35
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:55,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't say this before, but it's hitting us now.

36
00:02:55,529 --> 00:03:15,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to take a more active role moving forward and ensuring that what we're doing to protect our residents here in Medford with our added development and how we're looking at affordable housing is presented in a way that we hold the values of our families in our community.

37
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:18,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I appreciate the time, Mr. President.

38
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

39
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:20,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

40
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

41
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:26,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Councilor Scott Pelli has got great timing.

42
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a couple of weeks ago, our zoning subcommittee met under the direction of Chairman Falco.

43
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,643
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the topics that we discussed in that meeting was inclusionary housing and inclusionary zoning ordinance, Mr. President.

44
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:42,286
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's the time right now is to really address the issue that we have here in the city of Medford or affordable housing or the lack thereof.

45
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:53,005
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the focuses that we've had is obviously meeting the threshold that's established by the state of 10%, but also retaining and replacing the expiring new stock of affordable housing units in the community.

46
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:55,206
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that I wholeheartedly support.

47
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:58,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank Councilor Scott Pelly for bringing it forward, and I look forward to working with him towards a finished product.

48
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Move approval.

49
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:00,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Naife.

50
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,713
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Councilor Naife.

51
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,473
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President.

52
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:07,755
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Max.

53
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,718
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just add that where the CPA now is in effect in the community,

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:26,663
[SPEAKER_22]: and one of the options for the CPA money that's available is affordable housing, that that also be looked at, Mr. President, to see what funding is available to assist in low to moderate and affordable housing within our community.

55
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

56
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,604
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

57
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:33,724
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

58
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:35,825
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

59
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:42,266
[SPEAKER_26]: 18-091, offered by Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved

60
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:58,203
[SPEAKER_26]: with the upcoming spring youth sports season starting in April, that the DPW director and city administration report back to the city council on the steps being taken to prepare our playing fields for all youth organizations.

61
00:04:58,643 --> 00:04:59,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

62
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, thank you, Mr. President.

63
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:07,310
[SPEAKER_05]: This came about with conversations indirectly with the new director of recreation,

64
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:23,796
[SPEAKER_05]: members of the park board and members of our youth organization and also my background in working with facilities management and playing fields and knowing what we're doing in our community where I work.

65
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,009
[SPEAKER_05]: and preparing our playing fields.

66
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that we know that our DPW is drastically understaffed and I want to make sure that as the weather, if the weather continues the way it's going now, we might be playing at the beginning of March in a few weeks, hopefully so.

67
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:48,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need our playing fields in a position where our children

68
00:05:48,772 --> 00:06:08,097
[SPEAKER_05]: can play in a safe environment and making sure that we're giving, making sure the city administration is preparing those fields and giving our DPW and parks department what they need to make sure that those fields are under, um, uh, supervised and make sure that they're, they're, they're, um, planned accordingly moving forward as we get closer to the season.

69
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:08,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

70
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:09,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

71
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:10,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knife.

72
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:12,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

73
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to amend the paper with a B paper and request that the administration report back to the council.

74
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,395
[SPEAKER_14]: What the process is for permitting fields at this point in time, Mr. President, usually it goes before the parks board.

75
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:26,697
[SPEAKER_14]: The parks board meets once a month when they have a quorum, and then permits are issued.

76
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think it's the most effective or efficient process.

77
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we have a recreation department with a budget of $315,000 annually that hopefully will be up and running sometime soon.

78
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:43,231
[SPEAKER_14]: And the way that we're permitting our fields I don't think is going to be conducive to the best use and the best possible practices that we can do at the municipal level, Mr. President.

79
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:52,083
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm asking that the administration conduct a review of the permitting process for their fields and provide recommendations as to how we can improve that to maybe a weekly permitting process as opposed to a monthly permitting process.

80
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:53,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

81
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:55,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

82
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:56,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

83
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward tonight.

84
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:07,806
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an important issue, but if I could also amend the resolution to make sure that we inspect all the park equipment in our top lots.

85
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:15,724
[SPEAKER_09]: and all the play structures, just to make sure everything's safe, especially after the winter and the cold weather when things rust and things crack and break and whatnot.

86
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:17,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could have those inspected as well.

87
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:18,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

88
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:20,404
[SPEAKER_26]: Council Member Kern.

89
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco stole exactly what I was going to say.

90
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:33,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think when you see the baseball and softball start, you also see the younger brothers and sisters at the tot lots.

91
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that we always get reports come April, the swing's broken.

92
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: bar is missing on the, you know, monkey bars.

93
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:49,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we could just get ahead of that situation so that we, all our children can get on those taut lots and have fun while their siblings are out swinging the bat.

94
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:50,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

95
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:51,085
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

96
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

97
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:55,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

98
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:01,388
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Councilor Falco.

99
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:02,208

[SPEAKER_26]: Changing ownership.

[SPEAKER_26]: Changing ownership.

112
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:56,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Justin, the hours, it seems like the hours are gonna stay the same, and I know you provide a valuable resource to that neighborhood, especially to my son, so I appreciate that.

113
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems like everything is in order, Mr. President.

114

00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:41,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The purpose of the meeting was to review all papers assigned to the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances and to review zoning.

145
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:51,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the beginning of this term, Mr. President, you decided to split these former zoning and ordinance subcommittee to two separate subcommittees.

146
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,116
[SPEAKER_09]: One was zoning and one is ordinance.

147
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:59,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we did is we actually just went through the papers that were in committee and we moved

148
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:02,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Papers 16555, 16660, 16705, 17542, 17094, 17321, and 17320 to the subcommittee on ordinances.

149
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:02,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Papers 16-359, 16-338.

150
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:24,777
[SPEAKER_09]: 16, 6, 2, 6, and 16, 6, 6, 6 are staying in the zoning subcommittee.

151
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:41,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we also, I talked about, um, inclusionary housing and mixed use housing and the committee members are going to be doing some research, uh, or have been doing research over the past couple of weeks, uh, to, um, to present, uh, at a meeting, um, next week.

152
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:42,782
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

153
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:43,742
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

154
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:46,803
[SPEAKER_14]: President, I move for adoption of the committee report.

155
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,740
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

156
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,523
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

157
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:53,984
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

158
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:55,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

159
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,526
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

160
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:05,733
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

161
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:06,493
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

162
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:07,234
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

163
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:08,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

164
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:11,157
[SPEAKER_26]: Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli.

165
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:16,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it so resolved that the city administration issue an RFP for the

166
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:28,728
[SPEAKER_26]: purchase of securing an independent security expert to perform a safety assessment of all public buildings in the city of Medford.

167
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:30,109
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Knight.

168
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

169
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:37,391
[SPEAKER_14]: With a recent school place shooting taking place, Councillor Scott Pelley and I were having a conversation about

170
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,254
[SPEAKER_14]: the tragic situations that's happened in America here when it comes to gun control.

171
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:46,222
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the questions that came up was, are we doing enough in our public buildings to keep our employees safe?

172
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:52,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Then this evening when we got here, it's been brought to my attention, Mr. President, that there was a little bit of a situation in our public schools.

173
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:59,685
[SPEAKER_14]: over the past week or so, month or so, I should say, that's been brought to our attention.

174
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the underlying resolution.

175
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:08,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure there are many individuals in the audience and they would like to come up and speak on the topic of what happened at our schools today.

176
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We can keep them as separate issues and open that up to public participation and move for approval on the paper.

177
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:14,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me-.

178
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

179
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:20,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, Councilor Knight for bringing that up.

180
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that

181
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:44,318
[SPEAKER_05]: As we're talking about such a serious situation, part of our discussion was the involvement of local politics and local municipalities to get involved, and really now pushing our state delegation to bring on to Washington what we think is something that needs to start at the local level, because we're seeing major

182
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: major catastrophic situations not being addressed by our brothers and sisters in Capitol Hill.

183
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:04,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that the President has made some moves today, but I think that we need to now start

184
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:16,582
[SPEAKER_05]: as a local government pushing our state delegation to making sure that they're presenting our views here in Medford that we can't stand for this type of violence.

185
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And say what you want about freedom of having guns, but there's a severe issue that's going on right now.

186
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the city of Medford should take ownership and start taking the lead that we can now push on to

187
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: press legislation to change our gun laws in this country and making sure that the way people can purchase firearms are looked into in a more drastic, dire way because what happened this past week and what's happened for the last few years and so on,

188
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to stop.

189
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to stop today.

190
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:17,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to take an active role as local government that if our senior delegation is not taking that step, I think we need, as a voice of Metro, to now start pushing that along to our government, our delegation in Washington.

191
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that our, my colleagues,

192
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,501
[SPEAKER_05]: support that and move forward with it.

193
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

194
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:27,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

195
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:28,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Lungo-Kern.

196
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

197
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:35,143
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could first just please read the resolve one more time.

198
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:52,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the city administration issue an RFP for the purpose of securing an independent security expert

199
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:59,018
[SPEAKER_26]: to perform a safety assessment on all public buildings in the city of Medford.

200
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, yes, I think that's the least that needs to be done at this point in the city.

201
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:08,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval.

202
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:13,844
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Nigh, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

203
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,124
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

204
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:15,865
Aye.

205
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:16,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

206
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:21,927
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lococo.

207
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:25,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

208
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:30,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we have the chief of police here tonight, and I just want to thank him for coming.

209
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a number of things have transpired over the last several days and a couple months, and I know that it's under an active investigation, and what I want to say is, since the police department has found out about this, on Friday, there has been an active investigation, and I'm

210
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:57,489
[SPEAKER_02]: really thankful for what the chief and the detectives have done so far.

211
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:12,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what can be said tonight, but I think there's a lot of unanswered questions, and if the chief could tell us what he can, I think that would be important for the public and the parents and the staff of every school within this city.

212
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just stop there.

213
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

214
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:15,481
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

215
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief, name and address of the record, please.

216
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr., Police Chief, City of Medford.

217
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

218
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:27,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to address, if I could, Mr. President, through you, the last resolution.

219
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I didn't move quick enough on the vote.

220
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:37,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to let you know that we're working with Ann Marie Irwin on a grant that the state may be able to provide.

221
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:41,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I have 16 officers that have been trained as critical response team.

222
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,625
[SPEAKER_10]: They were in the process of going to all the municipal buildings, doing a threat assessment on the municipal buildings.

223
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:52,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just be very concerned that

224
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:59,588
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're fortunate enough to be awarded the funding, that would be traveling in parallel paths.

225
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:04,033
[SPEAKER_10]: So we may be duplicating the efforts if the money could be used in another manner.

226
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:11,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm certainly willing to work with any consultant, but I also know sometimes the people who know the buildings the best are the people who work in them every day.

227
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:15,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And our officers know what goes on in a lot of those buildings.

228
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:18,463
[SPEAKER_10]: and they work well with all of the participants.

229
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:19,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they've already started.

230
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,844
[SPEAKER_10]: They've spoken to a group of people at the library.

231
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:25,765
[SPEAKER_10]: They've started by talking with a group of people here at City Hall.

232
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:32,986
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do more work in the schools, but we've done many years of work in the schools up to this point.

233
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just put that out there so that you know.

234
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:41,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that Anne-Marie Irwin and the mayor worked very hard in putting this together.

235
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Lieutenant Paul Covino put together

236
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,882
[SPEAKER_10]: the grant proposal, and we expect to hear shortly.

237
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:51,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it will be looked on favorably in light of what's going on around the world.

238
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:56,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to put that out there so that you're aware that we're not sitting back.

239
00:18:56,709 --> 00:19:01,792
[SPEAKER_10]: We just don't have the normal resources in our operating budget to do it on a regular basis.

240
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:05,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we're fortunate enough to get the grant, it'll be done.

241
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:06,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chief.

242
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Chief.

243
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:16,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I probably should defer to the superintendent first, uh, regarding the incident that took place at, at, uh, the McGlynn school.

244
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,921
[SPEAKER_10]: But I certainly will follow up with any questions.

245
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:23,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of the council members of the public may have, uh, right afterwards.

246
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:29,231
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important maybe that the superintendent go first and, and tell the story as he knows it.

247
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:29,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

248
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:30,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief.

249
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

250
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,520
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, Mr. Superintendent.

251
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,661
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

252
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,802
[SPEAKER_24]: President Roy Bellson, superintendent of schools.

253
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,323
[SPEAKER_24]: 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.

254
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, members of the council.

255
00:19:52,605 --> 00:20:00,468
[SPEAKER_24]: Historically, the chief of police and the school system have worked very closely together on all security matters.

256
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:07,411
[SPEAKER_24]: In 1999, when Columbine hit, the chief and I were part of a group that formed

257
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:11,748
[SPEAKER_24]: the STARS program, School Threat Assessment and Response System.

258
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,070
[SPEAKER_24]: It was part of NMLEC, the Northeast Middlesex Law Enforcement Council.

259
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:24,293
[SPEAKER_24]: And since that time, we've worked very closely together to put together all kinds of security measures for our schools.

260
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:27,634
[SPEAKER_24]: And we communicate very regularly with each other.

261
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:34,017
[SPEAKER_24]: When we think there's a danger, we talk and we take action.

262
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Recently,

263
00:20:38,220 --> 00:21:06,327
[SPEAKER_24]: Back in and around December 28th or 29th, I'm not 100% sure of that date, a cleaning service that's employed by the public schools at the McGlynn Complex, middle school and elementary, found in the rear of the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, in the back row under a seat, a magazine clip that contained some ammunition in it.

264
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:07,747
[SPEAKER_24]: It is unclear

265
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,720
[SPEAKER_24]: how much ammunition was in it.

266
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,946
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that it could have been, based on the chief's estimate, at least three to four rounds, but not necessarily a full clip.

267
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:21,988
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't tell that because we don't have the magazine.

268
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:29,112
[SPEAKER_24]: But from the picture that we were able to see, that's a reasonable estimate at this point in time.

269
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:33,956
[SPEAKER_24]: The cleaning service turned it over to a custodian at the building.

270
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:35,897
[SPEAKER_24]: The custodian

271
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:45,080
[SPEAKER_24]: brought the magazine clip to the principal's office at the McGlynn Middle, and put it on a shelf.

272
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,121
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the report that I have.

273
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,522
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, just a point of information.

274
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:51,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor Mox.

275
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:53,483
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hate to interrupt you, Mr. Superintendent.

276
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,365
[SPEAKER_22]: It'd be helpful if you can point out timelines.

277
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:01,287
[SPEAKER_22]: When was it brought to the principal's office as you make your presentation?

278
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:01,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy to do that.

279
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:02,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

280
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:03,608
[SPEAKER_24]: So,

281
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:12,953
[SPEAKER_24]: School went on Christmas break on the 22nd of December.

282
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:19,458
[SPEAKER_24]: To the best of our knowledge, at least at this point, we're checking on a couple of other things.

283
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:27,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Only one entity used the McGlynn during that weekend for a holiday service.

284
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:35,531
[SPEAKER_24]: The cleaning service has informed us that they did a thorough cleaning

285
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:44,171
[SPEAKER_24]: of the facility, including the auditorium, which they would typically do on Fridays, and found nothing at that time.

286
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:54,733
[SPEAKER_24]: The service was over sometime on Sunday, and the holiday commenced on Monday.

287
00:22:56,634 --> 00:23:03,435
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometime around the 28th, the cleaning service went back into the theater, or the 29th, I'm not 100% sure.

288
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:13,399
[SPEAKER_24]: and they found under the seat in the back row this magazine clip that I just described.

289
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:19,041
[SPEAKER_24]: It was turned over to the custodian, in-house custodian, whose name is Daniel Tully.

290
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:33,546
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Tully took that magazine clip, according to his report, and put it in the principal's office, Mr. Edwards' office, and he said on the shelf, along with some other things that were there,

291
00:23:36,482 --> 00:24:04,541
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Edwards has told us that he came into his office in and around the 30th of December to do some work and to do some cleaning, at which point he alleges that he cleared away some things that were unnecessary and may have, he doesn't know, may have discarded the magazine clip.

292
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,309
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Council Member Kern.

293
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

294
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:13,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ask that, I know that's Mr. Edwards' story today.

295
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I just also ask that Mr. Edwards' other three stories be told as well.

296
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I'm telling you what I know.

297
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:22,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you found out in January, what did you know?

298
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:23,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the same story?

299
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you what I know.

300
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,955
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you have other stories, I'll be happy to listen to them.

301
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,295
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm telling you my latest.

302
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going by the latest story, but what you were told in January, you're just going to go with the latest?

303
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,274
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm telling you what I know.

304
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,635
[SPEAKER_24]: If I had a different story, I would say that also.

305
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:41,396
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm telling you what I know.

306
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:42,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard four stories so far.

307
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,598
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand, but you have more information than I have then.

308
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

309
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:59,943
[SPEAKER_24]: So Mr. Edwards told me that he cleaned his office and he may have discarded the item.

310
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:05,145
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, if you know what a magazine clip looks like, it's about this long.

311
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:06,373
[SPEAKER_24]: It's black.

312
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:15,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Has some appearances that looks like it could be a small cell phone, small remote control, small other electronic device.

313
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:20,819
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me.

314
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:22,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me.

315
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,200
[SPEAKER_26]: We have one speaker speaking.

316
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,100
[SPEAKER_26]: You want to speak?

317
00:25:25,301 --> 00:25:26,741
[SPEAKER_26]: You can speak after the speaker is done.

318
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Please don't interrupt or mock anybody.

319
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

320
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:34,104
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what other items he had there and how it could have been confused.

321
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:38,357
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's the story that he provided to me.

322
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:46,719
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, we did not have any evidence of a magazine clip available to us.

323
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:57,302
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometime in early January, Mr. Tully came to my office during his shift and told me about what he had found.

324
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:04,524
[SPEAKER_24]: I asked him routine questions about where he found it, who was there,

325
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Those kinds of things.

326
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:13,076
[SPEAKER_24]: And he couldn't really fill in much more except the fact that he found it and put that in Mr. Edwards' office.

327
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:16,877
[SPEAKER_24]: We checked with different other people.

328
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:33,580
[SPEAKER_24]: And at this point in time, I'm unable to identify where the chain of custody took place after Mr. Edwards allegedly

329
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:36,075
[SPEAKER_24]: discarded the item, or did not see it.

330
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:50,179
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, subsequent to that, we try to make some decision as to whether we felt this rose to the level of a reportable incident.

331
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:59,882
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm told that Officer Ricciardi, who is the school resource officer, was also told at some point in early January.

332
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:01,282
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I'm told.

333
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,827
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to be sure that I'm not 100% sure of that.

334
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:20,559
[SPEAKER_24]: At the time, we felt that it was an isolated incident, that it was something that was not dangerous in the sense because it wasn't a firearm.

335
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Bullets don't fire themselves, not a weapon.

336
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:25,442
[SPEAKER_24]: No weapon was found.

337
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:36,666
[SPEAKER_24]: we should take our time and not raise anxiety.

338
00:27:38,446 --> 00:28:01,712
[SPEAKER_24]: However, subsequent to that, in conversations that I've had with people in recent times, indicates to me that even though we did not feel it presented a clear danger, that other people do, and that they would have preferred that we made a full report

339
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,446
[SPEAKER_24]: to the chief of police.

340
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,627
[SPEAKER_24]: And as I indicated earlier, the chief and I talk all the time.

341
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,248
[SPEAKER_24]: I have no problem telling the chief anything.

342
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:14,589
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've talked about a lot of difficult situations over the years.

343
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,249
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't hide things.

344
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,149
[SPEAKER_24]: But a judgment was made.

345
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,711
[SPEAKER_24]: And that judgment said, we don't see this as dangerous at this point in time.

346
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:30,292
[SPEAKER_24]: So therefore, I take responsibility

347
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,937
[SPEAKER_24]: for not reporting it to the chief.

348
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:38,542
[SPEAKER_24]: But I did so, I believe, in good conscience.

349
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:49,251
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that it was something that I needed to know more about before I raised it or elevated it.

350
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:55,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Over the years, I have reported any number of things the chief can verify to him that I thought were dangerous.

351
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:00,280
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe that Mr. Edwards

352
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:05,484
[SPEAKER_24]: would have any motive for not turning it in.

353
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:11,067
[SPEAKER_24]: After all, he wasn't there on the weekend, didn't belong to him.

354
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:18,511
[SPEAKER_24]: He has turned in many items, and Officer Ricciardi has indicated this, to him on multiple occasions.

355
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:24,174
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't believe he had any reason not to turn it in if he knew he had it.

356
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:29,837
[SPEAKER_24]: At this point in time, since it has become an issue,

357
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:35,826
[SPEAKER_24]: especially in light of what's taken place in other communities around the country.

358
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:54,694
[SPEAKER_24]: We have authorized a full sweep today, full sweep of the McGlynn Complex, which was conducted by Medford Police, Somerville Police, Everett Police, and Arlington Police with dogs that are weapons and drug trained.

359
00:29:56,516 --> 00:30:02,601
[SPEAKER_24]: and we found no trace of weapons, ammunition, or drugs in the complex.

360
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:06,444
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm comfortable that that building is clear.

361
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:23,779
[SPEAKER_24]: We have also initiated, in order to help the public feel comfortable, a sweep of all school buildings over the next few days to ensure that there is nothing there that would be of concern.

362
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:43,208
[SPEAKER_24]: We are also planning this week to put together material, media, and others to talk to the public about the nature of school security, what we have in place, without getting into sensitive items, but what we have in place, and also to address this issue.

363
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:50,773
[SPEAKER_24]: I have communicated with the Teachers Association President, Charlene Douglas, and

364
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:57,064
[SPEAKER_24]: It's possible that I will meet with the McGlynn faculty on Monday afternoon to answer any questions they have.

365
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,705
[SPEAKER_24]: We believe that our schools are safe.

366
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:06,948
[SPEAKER_24]: We believe that we do more than most school systems do to keep our schools safe.

367
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:19,354
[SPEAKER_24]: We believe that we will continue to review and upgrade what we have if we find that there is room here to do so.

368
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:38,233
[SPEAKER_24]: and we believe that we can go forward recognizing that the decision that I made with others in my employee needs to be upgraded in the future and that a lesson learned.

369
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:40,455
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to take any questions.

370
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, Councilor Mox.

371
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Just if I could, Mr. Superintendent, two points.

372
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:46,159
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

373
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,801
[SPEAKER_22]: The decision that was made that this wasn't a serious incident

374
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Who else was in consultation?

375
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Was the chief of police involved in this conversation?

376
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:56,809
[SPEAKER_24]: No, the chief of police was not involved.

377
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:58,730
[SPEAKER_24]: I did talk to the principal.

378
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,370
[SPEAKER_24]: I did talk to the custodian.

379
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I did talk to a couple of other people that I work with.

380
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:18,120
[SPEAKER_24]: And in my opinion, at that particular point in time, Officer Ricciardi did come in at some point, came to the conclusion that it was not something that warranted a full investigation at this point.

381
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:30,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, and my other point was, at the beginning of your speech, you mentioned that the clip, the magazine clip, potentially had three to four bullets, which is pretty specific to me.

382
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:41,911
[SPEAKER_22]: And at any point, did you receive a picture of this, even though the principal stated he did not have the clip, or doesn't recall ever seeing the clip?

383
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:46,475
[SPEAKER_22]: At what point did you see the clip itself?

384
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:50,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I saw the picture last night.

385
00:32:52,910 --> 00:33:01,516
[SPEAKER_24]: And the clip is, if you look at the clip, you can see one bullet at the top, and then there are holes on the side.

386
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:03,357
[SPEAKER_24]: The chief can describe this better than I can.

387
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:07,500
[SPEAKER_24]: But he can tell how many rounds might be in it.

388
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:11,843
[SPEAKER_24]: But the person's hand covered most of it, holding it.

389
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:17,807
[SPEAKER_24]: So he couldn't tell beyond a certain point whether there were additional bullets beyond

390
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:19,969
[SPEAKER_24]: the 3 to 4 that he was able to identify.

391
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:25,017
[SPEAKER_22]: So in your opinion, you just mentioned that you want to make the public feel comfortable.

392
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:32,189
[SPEAKER_22]: And in your opinion, finding a magazine clip in a K through 8 school

393
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:47,944
[SPEAKER_22]: doesn't rise to the nature of seriousness to notify local police department, notify faculty, notify parents, notify students that there is an investigation that is gonna take place?

394
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:52,486
[SPEAKER_22]: You didn't even feel it was at that level where you notify people in the community?

395
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:56,868
[SPEAKER_24]: We have notified people on all kinds of situations in the past.

396
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,950
[SPEAKER_22]: That's debatable.

397
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:17,238
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had a bomb incident, Mr. Superintendent, that your own school committee created a policy where serious incidents had to be reported immediately by the administration, which clearly wasn't followed in this case.

398
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,061
[SPEAKER_24]: We've reported multiple situations over the years of all kinds.

399
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:30,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Certainly, you know, one can debate whether this rose to that level

400
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,351
[SPEAKER_24]: But given the consensus that I have- All due respect, there's no debate.

401
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:47,599
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no debate, Mr. Superintendent, when you find a magazine, Mr. Superintendent, that there is a concern within a building.

402
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:48,579
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no debate.

403
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see how you can say that it didn't rise to that particular level.

404
00:34:52,602 --> 00:35:00,586
[SPEAKER_22]: I would question your judgment if you honestly believe that that doesn't rise to a level where you should be notifying at least public safety officials.

405
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:24,484
[SPEAKER_22]: And I say with all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, because we've known each other for a lot of years, but I really don't see how that doesn't rise to a level in this day and age that people should be notified, especially after the incidences that we've had in this community where there's been a lack of notification.

406
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:29,427
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought we were past that stage and the best policy is 100% notification.

407
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:35,516
[SPEAKER_22]: and then let the administrators and the police do what they have to do, Mr. Superintendent.

408
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:36,656
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to clarify that.

409
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, counsel.

410
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:38,458
[SPEAKER_26]: That was the point of information.

411
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:41,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Let the superintendent finish and we will have time.

412
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:45,764
[SPEAKER_26]: We let the superintendent finish and we'll have time to answer questions.

413
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:49,607
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to respond to the notification issue.

414
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:57,133
[SPEAKER_24]: If you're speaking about a couple of years ago when there was a bomb threat at the high school, the issue wasn't,

415
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:01,656
[SPEAKER_24]: notification, the issue was timing of the notification, whether it was soon enough.

416
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:05,457
[SPEAKER_24]: And the committee decided to make it a little bit faster.

417
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,558
[SPEAKER_24]: We notified the public about that.

418
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,938
[SPEAKER_24]: We just didn't do it immediately afterwards.

419
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,319
[SPEAKER_24]: We did it a few hours later.

420
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,259
[SPEAKER_24]: We felt that more people would be home.

421
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,880
[SPEAKER_24]: But the committee felt differently, and we modified.

422
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Now as far as this situation goes, it happened during a school vacation.

423
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,102
[SPEAKER_24]: It happened when no students were in the building.

424
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:29,341
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't happen where there was a firearm anywhere near it.

425
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:35,686
[SPEAKER_24]: And there was a plausible thought as to how it may have gotten there.

426
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:41,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, since that time, we're all aware of what happened in Florida.

427
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:48,476
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm sure that there's a heightened feeling that somehow that is the same situation.

428
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:48,816
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not.

429
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,996
[SPEAKER_24]: However, Massachusetts has tremendous gun laws, tremendous gun laws.

430
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:59,077
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't buy what that individual bought in Florida, in Massachusetts.

431
00:36:59,937 --> 00:37:00,638
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't do that.

432
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:05,639
[SPEAKER_24]: From our standpoint, from my standpoint, I made a decision.

433
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:13,621
[SPEAKER_24]: In that decision, we have back and forth, and it was determined that that was the wrong decision.

434
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:18,122
[SPEAKER_24]: I accept responsibility for it, and we'll go forward from that.

435
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:20,709
[SPEAKER_24]: but I made the decision in good faith.

436
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes, you know, we make decisions that people don't agree on.

437
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:33,873
[SPEAKER_24]: If I thought there was something live, if I thought that students were in the building, if I thought there was a weapon anywhere near the place, my decision would have been different.

438
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:36,614
[SPEAKER_24]: So I stand on that for the time being.

439
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:46,617
[SPEAKER_24]: I apologize to anyone who may feel that I did the wrong thing, but I certainly didn't do it with malintent or reason to

440
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:52,968
[SPEAKER_24]: let's say obfuscate any of the information from the public.

441
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:54,289
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll stand on that.

442
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:54,909
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

443
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

444
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

445
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:05,835
[SPEAKER_02]: One question I have is with regards to, you said you authorized the sweep today and that was done.

446
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thankful for that.

447
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:10,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thankful that there's going to be sweeps within all of our schools in this city.

448
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:17,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question goes to why didn't you think this was necessary when you found out in January?

449
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Why didn't I think it was necessary in January?

450
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,101
[SPEAKER_02]: A sweep of the school.

451
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: That could have been there for weeks, and it was just found on the 28th.

452
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:35,746
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we don't think that's the case, because the cleaning service that found it cleans that area regularly and did not see it.

453
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:43,349
[SPEAKER_24]: It's clear to me that it landed there very recently in proximity to the time that it was found.

454
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's clear to me is that you mentioned there was a plausible

455
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:50,519
[SPEAKER_02]: reason why it was there.

456
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to point out there's hundreds of reasons how it could have got there.

457
00:38:55,341 --> 00:39:03,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes the parents and the staff extremely uncomfortable with how this was handled.

458
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I question many people's judgment on this.

459
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:17,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess a question now that a lot of people have, and there's a lot of questions that people have, is especially personnel that work there, because my

460
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:22,260
[SPEAKER_02]: phone has gone off the hook since the staff has been notified as of like 2 p.m.

461
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:29,424
[SPEAKER_02]: today, they don't feel comfortable with the judgment that was made obviously by you, but by the principal of that school.

462
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:36,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am under the impression he threw it away, and that's what I was told.

463
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:41,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you knew in January, I question what he told you then.

464
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,812
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, why it wasn't reported to the police.

465
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm not gonna say too much.

466
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:55,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know some of the results of the investigation that the police are working on, but what changes are gonna be made in staff before Monday?

467
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,743
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not gonna evaluate a principal in this forum.

468
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:58,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's understand that.

469
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:08,892
[SPEAKER_24]: I will take actions on personnel matters as we go forward into the spring, but I'm not gonna evaluate a person in this forum.

470
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:09,653
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not

471
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,954
[SPEAKER_24]: an appropriate way to do it.

472
00:40:12,114 --> 00:40:13,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Individuals are entitled to due process.

473
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:16,577
[SPEAKER_24]: They're entitled to the protections of the law.

474
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:22,621
[SPEAKER_24]: So the reality is that we will be reviewing personnel.

475
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,683
[SPEAKER_24]: We will be reviewing policies and practices.

476
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,925
[SPEAKER_24]: We will be ramping up some of our drills.

477
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:36,390
[SPEAKER_24]: I've also told the principals that the week we come back, we're going to run a special drill

478
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,504
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a little concerned about it in some ways because I don't want to heighten in the students' minds that this is somehow an emergency.

479
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:49,149
[SPEAKER_24]: But on the other hand, I think we should at least do one more drill at this point in time.

480
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,671
[SPEAKER_24]: It might help the community understand that we're prepared.

481
00:40:53,232 --> 00:41:00,017
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think for the most realities of this thing, we will evaluate personnel and situations and policies.

482
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:03,179
[SPEAKER_24]: The Medford School Committee is going to meet on Thursday night.

483
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,180
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that I'll hear

484
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,871
[SPEAKER_24]: from them pretty directly about what they want.

485
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:10,132
[SPEAKER_24]: And we will follow that.

486
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:15,534
[SPEAKER_24]: And this judgment that I made won't happen again.

487
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:16,755
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just that simple.

488
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:18,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

489
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:26,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by not doing anything with administration, by the school committee not doing anything with the administration is poor judgment.

490
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:31,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And by our superintendent of schools, who the people want to see do the right thing

491
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:39,888
[SPEAKER_02]: and to wait till the spring where parents and personnel at that school are extremely uncomfortable.

492
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's sending the wrong message.

493
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:59,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the school committee does what they have to do on Thursday night, because this is something that cannot be repeated, and multiple things need to happen, including, I'm just beside myself,

494
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not done lockdown drills in our schools this year.

495
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:06,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did them once, and they've only been done one time last year.

496
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:16,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have the staff who is extremely concerned because they've never done evacuation drills from cafeterias or auditoriums.

497
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:22,710
[SPEAKER_02]: There are personnel who are scared to take their children into the auditorium.

498
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there with my family a couple weeks ago, and I mean, this affects

499
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,465
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of people that are at that school.

500
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And this affects our whole community.

501
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:37,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that really, this cannot be tolerated.

502
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, again, thankful for the police and their investigation.

503
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:49,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that all the questions that are being asked on social media, and I'm sure are going to be asked tonight, I hope they're answered.

504
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:53,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that once the investigation is done, I know they will be answered.

505
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:58,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to answer them, although I know a lot of the answers, because the investigation is active.

506
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:09,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But people, every single parent, and every single personnel at that school deserves every answer eventually.

507
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sooner, the better.

508
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:12,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

509
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:13,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Counsel Falco.

510
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

511
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:16,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

512
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chief Sacco.

513
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:24,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I find everything to be very alarming.

514
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:30,736
[SPEAKER_09]: As a father of three kids in the Memphis Public Schools, I always feel that my kids are safe.

515
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:36,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I see something like this today, and I feel they're safe, but I have concerns.

516
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:38,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they're very valid concerns.

517
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:46,174
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as far as, you know, when we notify police about an incident like this, do we have a clear policy as to when?

518
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:52,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to me, there should be a clear, you know, I watch the commercials, I hear it on the radio, I see it on TV.

519
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:54,380
[SPEAKER_09]: See something, say something.

520
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:55,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I tell my kids that.

521
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:58,924
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and I think it's a good theory to go by.

522
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:00,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think, you know, we need to,

523
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:03,950
[SPEAKER_09]: keep law enforcement active and engaged in what's going on.

524
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,773
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, this is a clear case where see something, say something should have been the appropriate choice.

525
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:29,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a clear policy that says in this situation, there's some sort of ammunition and I'm no gun expert, but there's some sort of weapon that we contact the police.

526
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,721
[SPEAKER_24]: So Counselor, you've been on the school committee.

527
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:32,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I have.

528
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:40,128
[SPEAKER_24]: And you've received multiple phone calls or letters from me when situations have happened over the years.

529
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:42,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe Counselor Scarpelli, you have also.

530
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyone who's on the school committee knows that it's a regular practice, and we do it.

531
00:44:49,214 --> 00:44:50,716
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some things that happen in a school.

532
00:44:50,736 --> 00:44:57,661
[SPEAKER_24]: It could be a kid fight, something else like that, or in the backyard, or an injury, or something like that, that you just can't

533
00:44:58,956 --> 00:45:00,937
[SPEAKER_24]: take everything that happens every day and send it out.

534
00:45:01,678 --> 00:45:07,822
[SPEAKER_24]: But having said that, this situation, in retrospect, was one that deserved notification.

535
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:14,726
[SPEAKER_24]: And the judgment that I made was not the best judgment at this point in time.

536
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:15,667
[SPEAKER_24]: I accept that.

537
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:23,371
[SPEAKER_09]: What I would like to see is I would like to see the school committee work on a clear policy.

538
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:25,673
[SPEAKER_24]: The school committee wants to be notified, Mr. Feldman.

539
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,573
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that.

540
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:27,454
[SPEAKER_24]: They want to be notified.

541
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:32,582
[SPEAKER_24]: on situations that are serious and I should have notified them on this one.

542
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:39,484
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the parents as well, because if you're going to notify the school committee, that's going to go out to the general public.

543
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:44,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So the general public should hear from our school leader, the superintendent saying, this is a concern.

544
00:45:44,226 --> 00:45:45,366
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's been found.

545
00:45:45,386 --> 00:45:48,387
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we think is happening.

546
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, getting input from the chief as well.

547
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:51,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know,

548
00:45:53,148 --> 00:46:00,473
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I understand that there are probably certain issues that are minor, that maybe not everyone needs to know about, if there's a fight in the playground or something like that.

549
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:08,057
[SPEAKER_09]: But something like this, where there's a piece of ammunition that's found, you know, within the school building, that that's a concern.

550
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a concern that many people have here tonight.

551
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:13,421
[SPEAKER_09]: There's many people that are watching at home that have this concern.

552
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,623
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know all of us behind this reel have the same concern.

553
00:46:16,803 --> 00:46:17,263
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand.

554
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:19,965
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to say that, you know,

555
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:26,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Normally, I tell the chief virtually everything because we have very good communication and have for many, many years.

556
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:28,624
[SPEAKER_24]: In this instance, I didn't do it.

557
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:30,185
[SPEAKER_24]: I failed in that regard.

558
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:31,746
[SPEAKER_24]: I accept that responsibility.

559
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,308
[SPEAKER_24]: But typically, the school committee does want to know.

560
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:37,490
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it's clear to me that I should have informed them.

561
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:45,015
[SPEAKER_24]: But I don't believe and I think this is the key point that needs to be made and needs to be heard throughout the community.

562
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,857
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe our schools are unsafe.

563
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,498
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe

564
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,679
[SPEAKER_24]: that our children are endangered.

565
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:59,964
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that the school committee, the council, by paying money for cameras and other things like that, have provided quite a bit.

566
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:05,227
[SPEAKER_24]: The police department has worked very closely with us, with resource officers, with all kinds of things.

567
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:10,070
[SPEAKER_24]: We work closely with the district attorney to determine what's happening on the street on a regular basis.

568
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:15,554
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a lot going on that heads off issues in our schools.

569
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:22,312
[SPEAKER_24]: If I made a mistake this time, not if I made, I made a mistake this time, I accept that responsibility.

570
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:24,173
[SPEAKER_24]: But I believe enough's in place.

571
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:30,739
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe that if we, we dedicate ourselves to it, we'll be fine.

572
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:35,163
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe our schools are safe as any school in the Commonwealth.

573
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,685
[SPEAKER_24]: But having said that, there are no guarantees.

574
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:44,050
[SPEAKER_24]: There are no guarantees that I can give you or anyone of sound mind could give you.

575
00:47:45,438 --> 00:47:47,740
[SPEAKER_24]: because we live in a society that is a little violent.

576
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,326
[SPEAKER_24]: We live in a society that does do unusual things at times, and we do have a lot of mental health out there, and there are guns on the street.

577
00:47:56,287 --> 00:48:03,293
[SPEAKER_24]: And that requires even more, more from the people that make decisions, make decisions about these issues and these policies.

578
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,697
[SPEAKER_24]: But in this instance, I accept responsibility.

579
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:13,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent, I would honestly like to see you, the police chief Sacco, and the

580
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:25,688
[SPEAKER_09]: the mayor and the school committee come together and formulate a policy as to, you know, when, you know, to actually put a policy in place, when should the police be contacted about an issue like this?

581
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:28,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think there needs to be a clear definition, in my opinion.

582
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:29,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'd like to see that.

583
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:32,353
[SPEAKER_24]: I will put that on our calendar for Thursday evening.

584
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:32,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

585
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:38,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the Thursday night meeting, which I know I've received a ton of calls about, I believe that's going to be at the high school.

586
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:39,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

587
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:41,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I would respectfully ask that that be held here.

588
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's, you know,

589
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:49,588
[SPEAKER_09]: from being a former school committee member, having meetings at the high school, the acoustics are really, they're not great.

590
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:53,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you, my guess is you're gonna have a lot of people at this meeting.

591
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:56,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's better situated to be here.

592
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:00,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You have microphones, you have, people will be able to actually hear the dialogue.

593
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:02,218
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an important topic.

594
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:04,220
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an important issue that people wanna know about.

595
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,501
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanna know what happened, when it happened.

596
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:07,702
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanna see a timeline.

597
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:12,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if you try to have a meeting like that in a library or the superintendent's conference room,

598
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:15,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I really think that's probably not the best way to go.

599
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:21,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having it here at Chambers is the best venue to have the meeting.

600
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it seats more people.

601
00:49:23,301 --> 00:49:25,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, like I said, the acoustics are much better.

602
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:27,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been to budget meetings up at the library.

603
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:33,728
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're sitting in the back, you really have no idea what's going on up at the front, just because the acoustics are not great.

604
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:37,190
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me ask a technical question of the clerk, if I may, through the chair.

605
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:40,012
[SPEAKER_24]: We've posted a meeting, Mr. Clerk.

606
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:41,894
[SPEAKER_24]: We've posted it at the high school.

607
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:52,407
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we make a modification if the chair agrees to make that modification under the open meeting law?

608
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:12,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, the city has only accepted, number one, is the clerk's posting board as the primary posting board, and two, is the 24-hour posting board

609
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,868
[SPEAKER_16]: which is the police station.

610
00:50:16,769 --> 00:50:22,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have not accepted, but the website today is a posting board.

611
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:28,618
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not to say that other cities in town haven't done that.

612
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,459
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably something we should look at now.

613
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:36,944
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll communicate with your office tomorrow morning, and you can tell me whether we fall within the guidelines.

614
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:38,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

615
00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:38,565
[SPEAKER_24]: OK?

616
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:38,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

617
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:40,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

618
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:42,968
[SPEAKER_09]: With regard to the sweep of the schools,

619
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:43,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

620
00:50:44,076 --> 00:50:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: With regard to the sweep, uh, regarding the other schools.

621
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

622
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, now you said that will be done in the near future.

623
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that going to be done on the weekends?

624
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:57,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, just because, I mean, we're asking that they begin tomorrow and they start doing it all.

625
00:50:58,046 --> 00:51:01,149
[SPEAKER_09]: So we sweeping schools while kids are in the schools.

626
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,210
[SPEAKER_24]: Not at this point in time.

627
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,431
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're not there.

628
00:51:04,451 --> 00:51:04,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

629
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

630
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:05,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fake.

631
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:05,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

632
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:06,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

633
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:08,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I should know that my kids are very excited about that.

634
00:51:09,294 --> 00:51:11,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, with regard to, uh,

635
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:19,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, with regard to our current situation, with our current protocols, we lock down the schools.

636
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,311
[SPEAKER_09]: We lock down the schools currently.

637
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:24,372
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's an issue and the schools go down, it's a lockdown.

638
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:26,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've talked about this before.

639
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:35,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I've received a number of calls with regard to people asking about why aren't we using ALICE, which is a program that's well-known.

640
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Police Chief Sacco, I believe you know about that.

641
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe there are members of the police force that are trained in the ALICE program.

642
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:46,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that we are potentially looking at moving towards?

643
00:51:46,796 --> 00:51:49,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that you think would be beneficial?

644
00:51:50,298 --> 00:51:52,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know there's a lot that goes into it.

645
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:57,581
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you could weigh in on that a little bit, because I know I've received a number of questions about that.

646
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:01,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a program that's been around for quite a while.

647
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:04,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems like every day another school district is adopting it.

648
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:10,187
[SPEAKER_10]: It just gives the school system, the staff, and students options to pick from.

649
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a proponent of it.

650
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it in action in many communities.

651
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:23,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that obviously the superintendent and the school committee would have to approve, but you just don't switch and have it work right away.

652
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:35,227
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to do a lot of training and educating, uh, the staff and faculty and students and probably start at the high school and go to the middle school and then the elementary school.

653
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:38,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's something that would take a little bit of time, but I'm sure that, uh,

654
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:42,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, it's going like wildfire right now.

655
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:44,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's spread.

656
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:48,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of the districts in the state have adopted the ALICE program.

657
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:51,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done a little bit of research myself on it.

658
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go online, there's videos.

659
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:58,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the City of Waltham has a video on it as well.

660
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:04,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And they do a good job of basically describing what it is and what you do.

661
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:07,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And they walk you through the program.

662
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,930
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I can see, it seems like it's a good program.

663
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's something that we should really look at.

664
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:20,152
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's something that you support, I really think that we should probably be moving in that direction.

665
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:31,574
[SPEAKER_09]: You're our expert with regards to law enforcement, and I think that- I don't know about expert, but- But I do feel that you really are our expert when it comes to law enforcement.

666
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:37,175
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk to people in other districts, and I know Superintendent Bellson, you do as well, but I think that this is something that

667
00:53:38,364 --> 00:53:42,406
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, this is something that the school committee should really consider.

668
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:54,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking into Alice, I know it doesn't happen overnight, but I think maybe we should look into it and probably by the fall, by the next school year, it's something that we should implement.

669
00:53:54,833 --> 00:54:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could, and I'm not sure if you could possibly add that to your agenda for Thursday night, but I think it's something that should be considered.

670
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,898
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, just before the superintendent speaks on this,

671
00:54:05,057 --> 00:54:07,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that we at least do the training in the schools.

672
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:16,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether it be ALICE or some other program, or we create a local program, adopting the best practices from all the other programs that are out there.

673
00:54:17,363 --> 00:54:20,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to do that and we have people ready to go.

674
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,565
[SPEAKER_10]: We have at least three instructors.

675
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:23,734
[SPEAKER_10]: at this point.

676
00:54:23,854 --> 00:54:34,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And just so that everyone knows what ALICE stands for, it's alert, lockdown, inform, it's confront or combat, and evacuate.

677
00:54:35,162 --> 00:54:43,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that there's the questionable component there, that option of confronting the bad guy, but it works.

678
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:49,071
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're faced with the other alternative, you have to do something.

679
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:50,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be the option.

680
00:54:51,598 --> 00:54:53,039
[SPEAKER_10]: This program gives you options.

681
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,401
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just a lockdown and hide under the tables and shut the lights and put the red card out or the green card out.

682
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,361
[SPEAKER_10]: This gives you options.

683
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:01,862
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a means of escape, you escape.

684
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:04,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, I've seen it work.

685
00:55:04,723 --> 00:55:10,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I've worked with a lot of people in many police departments that actually teach their whole school district.

686
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:17,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, you know, there's some initial reluctance, but then it's overwhelmingly supported once it's in place.

687
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,350
[SPEAKER_24]: So a comment on that.

688
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:29,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Of all the letters in Hellas, the only one we don't do is confront.

689
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:33,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Because everyone alerts people if there's something going on.

690
00:55:34,385 --> 00:55:36,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone locks down if they have to.

691
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:42,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone informs mutual aid or assistance when they do it.

692
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:45,889
[SPEAKER_24]: And everyone tries to evacuate if they can.

693
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:50,411
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the confront part that becomes of concern.

694
00:55:50,471 --> 00:55:51,671
[SPEAKER_24]: And the reason it's of concern

695
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Think about young kids, little kids.

696
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:57,453
[SPEAKER_24]: Should they be trying to confront?

697
00:55:58,553 --> 00:56:02,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Are all teachers, are all staff physically able to confront?

698
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Will they try to confront?

699
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we mandate that they confront?

700
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:12,638
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot to this that needs to be thought about.

701
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:14,019
[SPEAKER_24]: And what age group do you start?

702
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:15,980
[SPEAKER_24]: And when do you start?

703
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,300
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really an active shooter program.

704
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,321
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just a general program for bomb threats or things like that.

705
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:20,721
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a program.

706
00:56:21,322 --> 00:56:22,362
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's a lot to it.

707
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:34,253
[SPEAKER_24]: In that regard, who confronts and in what way, and who's able to confront, not everybody is going to be willing to do that.

708
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:35,954
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to think about it.

709
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:42,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Chief and I have talked about starting maybe with the older kids and the higher grade levels.

710
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,440
[SPEAKER_24]: There's some issues with it.

711
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,344
[SPEAKER_24]: But look, I am more than willing to have the discussion and to have

712
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:54,088
[SPEAKER_24]: an active give and take on this subject.

713
00:56:54,829 --> 00:57:00,550
[SPEAKER_24]: But we need all the players who are going to be expected to step up to tell us whether they're prepared to confront.

714
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:18,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, the other day when the Parkland situation took place, if you remember the sequence, the individual pulled a fire alarm to get people to evacuate the setting and then was going to pick them off with his gun.

715
00:57:19,614 --> 00:57:21,654
[SPEAKER_24]: I've heard many times, why don't we evacuate this?

716
00:57:22,662 --> 00:57:36,733
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've told you in previous occasions that evacuation isn't always the best drill because the explosive or the sniper could be on the outside of the building, not just on the inside of the building.

717
00:57:37,674 --> 00:57:39,575
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all situation-specific.

718
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:43,658
[SPEAKER_24]: And it needs to be talked about, more than willing to talk about it.

719
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:49,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's not just put out alphabet soup, Alice, and say that's a cure-all.

720
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:50,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Happy to look at it.

721
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:52,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Happy to get people to talk about it.

722
00:57:53,148 --> 00:58:00,912
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's got to be adopted and committed to by the people who are going to implement it, or else it's just another training program that will go nowhere.

723
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:03,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I think it's something that should be looked at.

724
00:58:04,174 --> 00:58:12,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the school committee should seriously consider it, at least at the high school level, maybe even the middle school level.

725
00:58:12,598 --> 00:58:14,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand there's concerns at the elementary school.

726
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:21,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that, but I think, especially if it's something, Chief, that you're a fan of, I would think that it's something that should be considered.

727
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:26,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see that part of a future school committee meeting.

728
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's something that they should look at.

729
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:32,055
[SPEAKER_09]: With regard to the McGlynn staff.

730
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:32,856
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

731
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I believe you said you may possibly meet with

732
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:39,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that's going to happen?

733
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:40,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is there a demand there?

734
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:42,959
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been offered to the president of the MTA.

735
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:43,560
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

736
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,942
[SPEAKER_24]: And she hasn't confirmed it yet, but she thinks it's a good idea.

737
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:46,922
[SPEAKER_24]: But she has to confirm it.

738
00:58:47,263 --> 00:58:47,483
OK.

739
00:58:48,203 --> 00:58:51,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I thank you for answering all my questions.

740
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:53,307
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I have for now.

741
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:58,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I'm a big fan of see something, say something.

742
00:58:58,771 --> 00:59:03,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that should have been the first thing, the first approach that you should have taken.

743
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:05,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you for your time.

744
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:05,917
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

745
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Mr. Belson, thank you for being here.

746
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:16,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your being so candid with the situation and accepting responsibility for what's going on.

747
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:20,460
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, when will the investigation be complete?

748
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:26,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that's a police investigation, so I leave that to the Chief to answer that one.

749
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:34,736
[SPEAKER_10]: As with any investigation, it's hard to give a timeline.

750
00:59:34,896 --> 00:59:38,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the investigators are speaking with a number of individuals.

751
00:59:40,278 --> 00:59:49,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to be able to tell you within a week, maybe two weeks tops, but it takes time and we don't know when someone starts to give us a story.

752
00:59:50,002 --> 00:59:53,583
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know what road it's going to take us down, so it may take a little bit longer.

753
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:59,966
[SPEAKER_10]: They made tremendous headway since it came to my attention on Friday through Councilor Longo Kern.

754
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:04,392
[SPEAKER_10]: that they've worked on this and the pieces are coming together.

755
01:00:04,692 --> 01:00:05,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's been cooperative?

756
01:00:06,932 --> 01:00:07,632
[SPEAKER_10]: To date, yes.

757
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:19,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Superintendent Belson, now we have the STARS program, and what would the normal reporting process be in the STARS program if a situation like this occurred?

758
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:27,536
[SPEAKER_24]: STARS was set up to look at school threats, the acronym School Threat Assessment and Response System.

759
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,597
[SPEAKER_24]: So when a school threat is identified,

760
01:00:31,243 --> 01:00:41,228
[SPEAKER_24]: or we believe it is identified, and we believe it requires additional resources above and beyond what we have, we would notify the STARS commanders.

761
01:00:42,128 --> 01:00:43,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Chief Sacco once headed that group.

762
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:44,790
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure who heads it now.

763
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:51,473
[SPEAKER_24]: We would notify them, and they would provide us with those resources.

764
01:00:51,493 --> 01:00:53,054
[SPEAKER_24]: So let's say we needed a graphologist.

765
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:54,195
[SPEAKER_24]: They might have a graphologist.

766
01:00:54,515 --> 01:00:56,856
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's say we needed a certain type of psychiatrist.

767
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:58,917
[SPEAKER_24]: They would help us with that.

768
01:00:59,017 --> 01:01:01,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's say we needed a forensic

769
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:06,178
[SPEAKER_24]: There are certain police departments and entities in the state that have forensic, the bomb squads.

770
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:16,241
[SPEAKER_24]: They would coordinate the kind of specialized assistance that we need to make the appropriate threat assessment and then make the appropriate response.

771
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:22,063
[SPEAKER_24]: If we needed, unfortunately, a SWAT team, that would be the ultimate.

772
01:01:24,423 --> 01:01:25,864
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's a coordinated response.

773
01:01:25,904 --> 01:01:27,344
[SPEAKER_24]: And I want to make that point very clear.

774
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:30,465
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot of people out there selling products about,

775
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:32,995
[SPEAKER_24]: coordinating with schools and the like.

776
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:36,356
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot of money being made in the school security business right now.

777
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:44,118
[SPEAKER_24]: And part of it brings up the idea that we could have an uncoordinated response.

778
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,018
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the last thing we wanted.

779
01:01:46,038 --> 01:01:55,680
[SPEAKER_24]: The chief and I both agree that if we have a situation that requires mutual aid or specialized assistance, we want that coordinated.

780
01:01:56,854 --> 01:02:01,037
[SPEAKER_24]: You may not know, but I think we will have said it many times, but maybe you don't remember.

781
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:05,219
[SPEAKER_24]: There are floor plans on the computers of the police cruisers.

782
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,802
[SPEAKER_24]: There are doors that are marked that people can go to.

783
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:23,771
[SPEAKER_24]: There's all kinds of pre-preparation in place for STARS to work and for our own police to respond strategically and specifically to areas which we believe require attention.

784
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:27,587
[SPEAKER_24]: What we don't want is we don't want what happened in 1992.

785
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:28,327
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember 1992?

786
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:29,568
[SPEAKER_24]: I was there.

787
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:33,250
[SPEAKER_24]: I was there.

788
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:39,292
[SPEAKER_24]: In 1992, there was a altercation at the high school.

789
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:43,034
[SPEAKER_24]: And at that time, people came from everywhere.

790
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:44,654
[SPEAKER_24]: Helicopters were flying over the building.

791
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,756
[SPEAKER_24]: People were coming in all different kinds of uniforms, not coordinating.

792
01:02:48,276 --> 01:02:52,778
[SPEAKER_24]: And that only created more problems than it assisted in helping.

793
01:02:53,857 --> 01:03:10,326
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's very important, and I thank the chief and his comrades at NMWEC for the work that they have put in to ensure that a response of that type through the STAR system is one that is coordinated, thorough, and strategic.

794
01:03:13,568 --> 01:03:18,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. Belson, if this incident had occurred when school was in session, what would the response have been?

795
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Very different.

796
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:20,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Very different.

797
01:03:20,472 --> 01:03:21,973
[SPEAKER_24]: If it occurred when students were there,

798
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,355
[SPEAKER_24]: would have been a full report and immediate response.

799
01:03:28,577 --> 01:03:35,541
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of identifying failures in the reporting system, I think that this has been opened up as a failure in the reporting structure.

800
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:39,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And where's the biggest failure that you've identified thus far in terms of the reporting structure?

801
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:46,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it between the cleaning contact crack to giving it to the senior custodian, the senior custodian not reporting it to the principal appropriately?

802
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:49,749
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to blame anybody else.

803
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:51,963
[SPEAKER_24]: I knew about it.

804
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:54,124
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a relationship with the chief.

805
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,185
[SPEAKER_24]: I should have made the report.

806
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:03,107
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess the next question is, what are the next steps that we can hear from so that we can be assured that this isn't going to happen again?

807
01:04:03,127 --> 01:04:05,628
[SPEAKER_24]: The next step is to continue to fortify and to continue to assess.

808
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,690
[SPEAKER_24]: I expect to be in front of you in and around Mark 6.

809
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,330
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you're looking forward to seeing me again.

810
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,332
[SPEAKER_24]: Attempted humor.

811
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:22,691
[SPEAKER_24]: to get funding for the upgrade to all the security cameras that we've put in place.

812
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:31,458
[SPEAKER_24]: We have upgraded all of them so that they're now capable to withstand some of the weather issues that previously they weren't.

813
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:33,420
[SPEAKER_24]: They have better visibility.

814
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,121
[SPEAKER_24]: They have better ability to pan.

815
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:41,206
[SPEAKER_24]: And we think it's a distinct improvement over what we've been able to have in the past.

816
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:42,628
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll be in front of you for that, too.

817
01:04:44,684 --> 01:04:50,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the school committee is going to continue to allow rental opportunities to outside organizations in our schools?

818
01:04:50,508 --> 01:04:52,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this something they're going to be looking at from a policy standpoint?

819
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,749
[SPEAKER_24]: I think so.

820
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,371
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there are a lot of terrific groups that rent our schools.

821
01:04:55,431 --> 01:05:03,096
[SPEAKER_24]: And every group from Cub Scouts to all kinds of groups all the way up rent our schools or use our schools in a meaningful way.

822
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:05,458
[SPEAKER_24]: This is an outlier situation.

823
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:08,280
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not something that's happened frequently.

824
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we didn't handle it.

825
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:12,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe I didn't handle it well.

826
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:22,734
[SPEAKER_24]: But that doesn't mean we should deprive the community of the resources of the schools, which I think are very important to providing appropriate recreation and assistance.

827
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:24,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Look, shut down the pool, we just did it.

828
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,596
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to shut down the gymnasium?

829
01:05:26,616 --> 01:05:28,136
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't do that.

830
01:05:28,196 --> 01:05:29,037
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't live in fear.

831
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: No, and I'm not asking for that.

832
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:38,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction to address an issue in the community that I think needs a long hot book.

833
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,085
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can certainly appreciate how candid you are this evening, and thank you for being here.

834
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:44,206
[SPEAKER_14]: That does it for my questions.

835
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

836
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:46,868
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor.

837
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:47,768
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor DelaRusso.

838
01:05:48,088 --> 01:05:49,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

839
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:57,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Superintendent Pelson, for coming down tonight to responding to the concerns as this became aware in the community.

840
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,277
[SPEAKER_15]: And also thank you for taking responsibility.

841
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:05,040
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a component of your leadership I'm grateful for.

842
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:11,292
[SPEAKER_15]: A number of things have been brought up by some of the counselors that I'm concerned of.

843
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:20,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I was particularly concerned of, as Councilor Knight mentioned, a reassessment of or an examination of the groups that use our facilities.

844
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:27,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the Chief mentioned that this is an ongoing investigation and that's important.

845
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:29,508
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one piece to this.

846
01:06:33,178 --> 01:06:34,839
[SPEAKER_15]: single out a person.

847
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:59,447
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to vilify anyone, Mr. Superintendent, but I can't imagine in my mind how one mislays something so important, critical, and apparently dangerous that's in a school building as bullets.

848
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:28,810
[SPEAKER_15]: a clip of bullets and I hope I am not asking for an answer and perhaps you can't answer that and perhaps you know right now, but I'm hoping sincerely that we get to the bottom of where these have gone and how that piece of evidence sort of has exited the scene and hope that something so grave as this is dealt with in a better way.

849
01:07:30,478 --> 01:07:31,958
[SPEAKER_24]: So I appreciate the observation.

850
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:45,863
[SPEAKER_24]: I can assure you that my conversations with certain individuals will be very direct and very thorough, and that decisions will be made about a lot of things in the next short period of time.

851
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

852
01:07:49,664 --> 01:07:50,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor Mox.

853
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:52,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

854
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:57,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Superintendent, in my opinion, it's clear that

855
01:07:58,217 --> 01:08:05,300
[SPEAKER_22]: if this wasn't brought to certain people's attention in the community, this would have never came out in public.

856
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:07,981
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my own feeling.

857
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:22,966
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, we can talk about best practices, we could talk about additional funding for cameras, we could talk about new policies and procedures, and all that can be negated by one bad judgment.

858
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:27,805
[SPEAKER_22]: All that, any policies and procedures in place can all be negated.

859
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,245
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's what happened.

860
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:33,226
[SPEAKER_22]: I do think we have policies and procedures in place that weren't followed.

861
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:36,207
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know you take responsibility now.

862
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:40,047
[SPEAKER_22]: You mentioned about coordinated and uncoordinated efforts.

863
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:44,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I would consider what took place an uncoordinated effort internally.

864
01:08:46,049 --> 01:08:46,529
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you not?

865
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:51,710
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think it was a question of coordination.

866
01:08:53,274 --> 01:08:54,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Not notifying.

867
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:59,736
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that was full coordination, but clearly part of part of coordination is notification, correct?

868
01:09:02,216 --> 01:09:02,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

869
01:09:02,496 --> 01:09:03,637
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll accept that.

870
01:09:05,377 --> 01:09:10,059
[SPEAKER_22]: My other point, and I'm not a Johnny come lately on the issue is year after year.

871
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:15,500
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been questioning you regarding the rentals of our school buildings, right?

872
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:19,235
[SPEAKER_22]: And year after year, we've had debates, many at this podium.

873
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:33,991
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm not going to rehash all the different debates, but I do feel strongly, Mr. Superintendent, you promised me you'd look into this, that many of our buildings are rented out to outside organizations.

874
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:36,612
[SPEAKER_22]: that have no affiliation with this community.

875
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,754
[SPEAKER_22]: We do no background checks.

876
01:09:39,214 --> 01:09:43,897
[SPEAKER_22]: We have no idea who are entering, exiting, what they're bringing into these buildings.

877
01:09:44,818 --> 01:09:55,105
[SPEAKER_22]: And in my opinion, when it's mentioned to you, you kind of shrug it off and say, well, we can't crawl up and hide in a ball.

878
01:09:56,346 --> 01:09:57,466
[SPEAKER_22]: We rent our buildings out.

879
01:09:57,847 --> 01:09:59,027
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can appreciate that.

880
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:04,191
[SPEAKER_22]: But the safety and security of our children and our faculty should come first.

881
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:24,655
[SPEAKER_22]: And if it comes to telling a program that they're no longer welcome back in this community because we choose not to rent out our buildings to make an additional 25 or 30 grand a year, which is a pittance, to be quite honest with you, in the scheme of a city budget, to me would lend a lot more peace of mind to parents.

882
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:27,236
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had this discussion about the high school.

883
01:10:27,896 --> 01:10:32,917
[SPEAKER_22]: After 3 o'clock, we don't have one security person on at the high school.

884
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:43,635
[SPEAKER_22]: After three o'clock, as you know, there's extracurricular activities, there's after school programs, and there's not one person at the high school that's there for security.

885
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:47,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't count custodians, I know you do, for security.

886
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:52,338
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't count having faculty around that they're security.

887
01:10:52,938 --> 01:10:57,260
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's a real breach of a safe and secure building.

888
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,061
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just can't see why you can't see that, Mr. Superintendent.

889
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:06,960
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, it concerns me about a lack of judgment when it comes to having people.

890
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,281
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know what they're bringing into these buildings.

891
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,681
[SPEAKER_22]: We really don't know.

892
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:14,942
[SPEAKER_22]: In this day and age, Mr. Superintendent, I think it's best to err on the side of safety.

893
01:11:15,422 --> 01:11:18,383
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know you mentioned about Cub Scouts, and that's great.

894
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:21,283
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't want to make Cub Scouts not come into our building.

895
01:11:21,563 --> 01:11:29,445
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking about outside organizations that have no city affiliation, that you don't know who's going in there.

896
01:11:30,839 --> 01:11:47,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Chief of Police doesn't know who's entering these buildings, and we don't know what they're doing inside these buildings, but they do have access to classrooms, to auditoriums, to cafeterias, and to a host of things within our building, and that's of grave concern, and something that no policy or procedure is going to cover.

897
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:50,565
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to take an internal approach.

898
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:53,618
[SPEAKER_22]: saying, is this what we really want out of our buildings?

899
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:55,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it worth the public safety?

900
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:56,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it worth the wear and tear?

901
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,041
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't believe so, Mr. Superintendent.

902
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:03,023
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think we could just shrug our shoulders year after year and say, you know what?

903
01:12:03,383 --> 01:12:04,404
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had no incidences.

904
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:05,184
[SPEAKER_22]: We're doing fine.

905
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:06,985
[SPEAKER_22]: This could have been an incident.

906
01:12:07,606 --> 01:12:14,610
[SPEAKER_22]: If you found some flour, sugar, and frosting underneath the seat in the auditorium, you would say they're baking a cake.

907
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:15,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?

908
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:20,053
[SPEAKER_22]: But you find a magazine with bullets, and you don't think there's any serious nature.

909
01:12:20,414 --> 01:12:32,682
[SPEAKER_22]: That there's no affiliation.

910
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:36,244
[SPEAKER_22]: I really believe, Mr. Superintendent, that someone needs to be held accountable.

911
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:38,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone needs to be held.

912
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:46,388
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't want to discuss particular personnel matters, and I agree, this is not the forum to discuss it, but someone needs to be held accountable.

913
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:50,053
[SPEAKER_22]: How can you be cleaning your office the day after this took place?

914
01:12:51,004 --> 01:12:59,947
[SPEAKER_22]: take a magazine off the shelf and say, oh, this doesn't look like my pocket pen or this doesn't, and discard it.

915
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:01,368
[SPEAKER_22]: How does that happen?

916
01:13:01,868 --> 01:13:05,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Unless your office is a filthy mess.

917
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:06,930
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't understand how that happens.

918
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:07,850
[SPEAKER_22]: I really don't.

919
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:12,742
[SPEAKER_22]: And even if it does look like a cell phone, how many people throw cell phones out?

920
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,264
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I just don't understand.

921
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:23,092
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems to me the perfect, and I hate to use the words, the perfect coverup to something that should have been reported immediately.

922
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:53,774
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not here to alarm people, I agree with you, but having administrators, having faculty, having parents, having them make that decision whether this is serious or not, whether they want to send their kids to school, is up to them, Mr. Superintendent, and not up to you making an individual, standalone decision on whether you think it rises to an area of such seriousness that people should be aware of it.

923
01:13:54,549 --> 01:13:57,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I really am very disappointed.

924
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:07,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to say, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're stepping down soon and I wish you well in your retirement, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in this.

925
01:14:07,853 --> 01:14:11,274
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very disappointed that it's taken seven weeks to come out.

926
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:19,630
[SPEAKER_22]: into the public and just barely come out, and only because I think people found out about it and raised awareness that it came out.

927
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, I think it would have been brushed under the rug.

928
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:36,322
[SPEAKER_22]: And it would lead me to believe what else is being brushed under the rug that we should be aware of.

929
01:14:37,022 --> 01:14:38,484
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't brush things under the rug.

930
01:14:41,664 --> 01:14:45,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me, I'm not gonna tell you again with the comments, all right?

931
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:46,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Enough with the comments.

932
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:49,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Next time I'm gonna ask you to leave the room, all right?

933
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Give the respect to the people out there.

934
01:14:51,712 --> 01:14:55,295
[SPEAKER_26]: You wanna come up here and speak, you can come up here and speak, all right?

935
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:58,417
[SPEAKER_26]: But have respect for the person who's at the podium.

936
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:00,459
[SPEAKER_26]: You'll get the same respect when you come up here.

937
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:01,820
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

938
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,841
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't brush things under the rug.

939
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:07,965
[SPEAKER_24]: But from time to time, we make decisions.

940
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,150
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what decision makers do.

941
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,131
[SPEAKER_24]: We make decisions.

942
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:17,516
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I've made a decision that didn't square with everyone else, then I accept responsibility for that.

943
01:15:18,196 --> 01:15:19,858
[SPEAKER_24]: But we don't brush things under the rug.

944
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:23,561
[SPEAKER_24]: And the chief will tell you that we have talked about some very tough items.

945
01:15:24,381 --> 01:15:33,849
[SPEAKER_24]: And there will be some things you don't know about because they're personal and they're caught up in legal matters that you can't know and the school committee gets advised of because it's not a public matter.

946
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:34,809
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's the way it is.

947
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,691
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's what's required by law.

948
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:43,083
[SPEAKER_24]: But clearly on safety matters, safety matters, we don't brush things under the rug.

949
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:56,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Now as far as people using our facilities, we can cancel every basketball game, we can cancel every hockey game, let me finish, we can cancel every game where people come in who are visiting from some other place.

950
01:15:57,067 --> 01:16:04,450
[SPEAKER_24]: We know, we know that in society today there are some people out there that do horrible things.

951
01:16:05,188 --> 01:16:09,413
[SPEAKER_24]: And we can't just regulate everything that's going on all around us.

952
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:22,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, if you don't want to rent the school properties, if you don't feel that that revenue or that communication with the public is a good one, that can be a policy discussion with the school committee guided by some input that you want to make.

953
01:16:22,688 --> 01:16:24,611
[SPEAKER_24]: But clearly, our schools

954
01:16:25,598 --> 01:16:28,500
[SPEAKER_24]: Our schools are going to be places, they've been community schools for years.

955
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,881
[SPEAKER_24]: People have used them.

956
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:33,743
[SPEAKER_24]: And people come in visiting from other communities and the like.

957
01:16:34,244 --> 01:16:36,745
[SPEAKER_24]: If we stopped everyone at the door, let me finish the point.

958
01:16:36,785 --> 01:16:40,228
[SPEAKER_24]: If we stopped everyone at the door, the event would never happen.

959
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:42,189
[SPEAKER_24]: So I understand what you're saying.

960
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,312
[SPEAKER_24]: But clearly, we don't hide anything.

961
01:16:46,952 --> 01:16:49,554
[SPEAKER_24]: This was a situation, it's unfortunate.

962
01:16:50,374 --> 01:16:52,936
[SPEAKER_24]: And as I've said before, I'm taking responsibility for it.

963
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:54,357
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure how much more I can say that.

964
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I don't think it's enough responsibility.

965
01:16:57,103 --> 01:17:06,125
[SPEAKER_22]: But needless to say, at the beginning of your speech, you made mention, and you referenced it, that that building was rented prior to what took place.

966
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:07,946
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe you mentioned that.

967
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:09,946
[SPEAKER_22]: And you can correct me if I'm wrong.

968
01:17:10,286 --> 01:17:15,587
[SPEAKER_22]: You mentioned that to allude that this was probably brought in from somewhere else.

969
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:17,128
[SPEAKER_22]: This wasn't a student bringing it in.

970
01:17:17,928 --> 01:17:21,949
[SPEAKER_22]: This was probably someone that came into our building through a rental.

971
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:24,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that not correct, Mr. Superintendent?

972
01:17:24,977 --> 01:17:25,998
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my assumption.

973
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:27,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Investigation is undergoing.

974
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:31,941
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to conclude anything until the police finish their work.

975
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:32,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

976
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:37,884
[SPEAKER_22]: So that leads you to believe that we should be looking at who's renting our buildings.

977
01:17:38,405 --> 01:17:42,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Shouldn't that lead you to believe that we do need security, Mr. Superintendent?

978
01:17:43,828 --> 01:17:45,749
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have security when you rent these buildings there?

979
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:51,052
[SPEAKER_24]: These buildings, when they're rented of that type, like for example, the Japanese language school has two security guards there.

980
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:51,712
[SPEAKER_24]: They pay for them.

981
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking about the McGlynn schools.

982
01:17:54,413 --> 01:17:55,894
[SPEAKER_22]: There's security there.

983
01:17:56,195 --> 01:17:59,477
[SPEAKER_24]: They pay for coverage by custodians who function as security.

984
01:18:01,018 --> 01:18:03,159
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have custodians that are now security guards.

985
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Are they paying a different rate?

986
01:18:05,261 --> 01:18:07,862
[SPEAKER_24]: They provide us with coverage in those buildings.

987
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:08,463
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we need.

988
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,763
[SPEAKER_22]: We could talk as we've done in the past few years until we're blue in the face.

989
01:18:15,103 --> 01:18:16,924
[SPEAKER_22]: We just don't see eye to eye on this issue.

990
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:20,407
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hope it never amounts to anything other than just talk.

991
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:31,936
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think we need to take a serious look at, Mr. President, our rentals, which the superintendent told me for the last, I think, four or five budget periods that it's being looked at.

992
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:33,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it being looked at?

993
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:34,334
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

994
01:18:34,594 --> 01:18:35,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe it's being looked at.

995
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:39,036
[SPEAKER_24]: We have provided some security, have paid for some security of certain people in these large groups.

996
01:18:39,096 --> 01:18:40,576
[SPEAKER_24]: I've mentioned the Japanese as an example.

997
01:18:41,356 --> 01:18:45,718
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, not every group is paying for security, so maybe we need to look at it.

998
01:18:46,538 --> 01:18:46,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

999
01:18:47,278 --> 01:18:47,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we need to look at it.

1000
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:50,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1001
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:52,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

1002
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1003
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:59,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to... I won't be redundant what my colleagues have already issued, but I do have to.

1004
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:01,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have parents that need to talk,

1005
01:19:02,443 --> 01:19:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to express my displeasure, Roy.

1006
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:10,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that how hard you work as an educator, one of the greatest superintendent minds in education in the Commonwealth.

1007
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:16,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we have with this situation is something that in many layers bothers me.

1008
01:19:17,193 --> 01:19:28,121
[SPEAKER_05]: As a former school team member, we were adamant that notification was paramount to whatever situations moving forward at that time, and obviously that didn't happen.

1009
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:31,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you coming out and saying that you're taking responsibility.

1010
01:19:31,946 --> 01:19:45,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate you saying that this isn't a forum for personnel matters, but I know as a parent, as a parent of two children in the Memphis Public Schools, we need to see something happen.

1011
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:48,322
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be something done, Roy.

1012
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:50,264
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't something we're going to push to the side.

1013
01:19:50,684 --> 01:19:51,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Something has to be done.

1014
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:56,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know we don't want to say it.

1015
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:57,949
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to live in fear.

1016
01:19:58,530 --> 01:19:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think the opposite now.

1017
01:20:00,433 --> 01:20:01,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to live in fear.

1018
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: These are scary times.

1019
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids are afraid.

1020
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:07,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And this would have been a great learning process.

1021
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:23,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine getting into a classroom and teaching the situation of bringing this type of dangerous ammunition and weapons into our schools and understanding how we could teach our children how important and how scary this is because it is scary.

1022
01:20:23,825 --> 01:20:25,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Society today is scary.

1023
01:20:25,046 --> 01:20:25,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It's frightening.

1024
01:20:26,377 --> 01:20:28,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've talked to my kids about this just the other day.

1025
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:33,263
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Councilor Knight and I talked about this when I talked about our local government taking action.

1026
01:20:33,943 --> 01:20:34,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this happens.

1027
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:43,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so disappointed, so many different levels, because I'm going to beat the dead horse with this.

1028
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:44,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bullets.

1029
01:20:45,412 --> 01:20:47,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ammunition to a weapon.

1030
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:51,247
[SPEAKER_05]: of mass destruction, where kids have died just recently.

1031
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:52,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is fear.

1032
01:20:52,607 --> 01:20:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: There is heightened fear in this room and at home with our children.

1033
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So I need you to understand.

1034
01:21:00,332 --> 01:21:05,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we don't want to be afraid and we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure that our kids feel safe in our schools.

1035
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:10,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely agree with you, and we do a great job in our school system making sure we feel that way.

1036
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:14,854
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what, I think society has to realize, when things get done, it's out of fear.

1037
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:17,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is fear, this is necessity now.

1038
01:21:17,996 --> 01:21:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And to have to start at this level, this is something that I'd have to put a huge black eye in what didn't happen in this role.

1039
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:26,459
[SPEAKER_05]: This was bad.

1040
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:28,480
[SPEAKER_05]: This was bad in so many different ways.

1041
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,442
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm sick of just even discussing.

1042
01:21:31,842 --> 01:21:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But moving forward, I know the parents need to talk, but we have so many members in our community, our school community, that you work so hard to protect and making sure that our students with mental issues and are disabled.

1043
01:21:47,713 --> 01:21:54,118
[SPEAKER_05]: These are our kids that are right in the front line of situations like this, that we need to get answers for to make sure they're protected.

1044
01:21:54,798 --> 01:22:10,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, as a former colleague of many of those teachers there who taught with them and went through the lockdown situations in that course, I can understand, but we need to do more with this situation.

1045
01:22:10,612 --> 01:22:15,659
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to know that if it happens again, a bullet is enough, okay?

1046
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:26,453
[SPEAKER_05]: A threat is enough that we have to let our children and our parents and our faculty know what's going on so we can prepare our children to make decisions what we think is right and safe for our children.

1047
01:22:26,813 --> 01:22:35,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, believe me, I hate to be a heavy, but I tell you what, I am so sad and so disappointed that this wasn't presented in that fashion.

1048
01:22:35,403 --> 01:22:43,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Dan Tully, he's a very thorough individual, and I'm sure he brought it to the attention that it was going to be reported.

1049
01:22:43,837 --> 01:22:44,377
[SPEAKER_05]: and it wasn't.

1050
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:46,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we need to, you need to move on this.

1051
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:55,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that the investigation is one thing, but as a leader of our school system that I, that I entrust with you, we need to make, we need to make some hard decisions tonight.

1052
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:57,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Roy.

1053
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:00,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

1054
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:04,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank councilor Scarpelli for his comments.

1055
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:05,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a point of information on that.

1056
01:23:06,132 --> 01:23:12,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that the school committee needs to move on this.

1057
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:18,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that somebody that knew about it in January has to be evaluated as well.

1058
01:23:19,623 --> 01:23:20,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my comment on that.

1059
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:27,208
[SPEAKER_02]: My other last two questions, to wrap it up, would be for the Chief of Police.

1060
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:39,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Having multiple, multiple people come to me with this information, very upset about it, obviously for the safety of themselves, their fellow staff members, and the children.

1061
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And then days later, knowing that I had to handle it, and they obviously needed to be handled, they now fear retaliation.

1062
01:23:53,904 --> 01:24:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a chief of police that has done everything right since I came to you on Friday, I want you to know this is the fear of personnel in that building, that they fear retaliation from the principal and from the administration.

1063
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:13,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want them to know, have your comment on that.

1064
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,312
[SPEAKER_10]: First thing, I don't know that that would happen.

1065
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: But second thing, most importantly, if they feel that there's anything happening to them because of reporting this incident, they have to let me know.

1066
01:24:26,136 --> 01:24:27,636
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to let the police department know.

1067
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:31,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes all the way back to reporting what's taking place.

1068
01:24:32,798 --> 01:24:40,521
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say at this point, and I haven't said it in a while, but the schools in Medford are safe.

1069
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:42,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Schools in this region are safe.

1070
01:24:43,285 --> 01:24:46,626
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have to tell you, that doesn't happen by accident.

1071
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:55,308
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because of the hard work of the teachers and the staff in the schools every single day, that they keep their thumb on what's going on in those schools.

1072
01:24:55,368 --> 01:24:58,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to give them a lot of credit for what they do.

1073
01:24:58,349 --> 01:25:00,349
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the ones that are keeping those schools safe.

1074
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:03,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't want anyone to think otherwise.

1075
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:08,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I say the teachers and the staff, I'm talking about the custodians.

1076
01:25:08,811 --> 01:25:11,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I keep thinking in my mind what would have happened

1077
01:25:11,892 --> 01:25:18,915
[SPEAKER_10]: If the custodian didn't find that, but some child found that later in the day or the following week or a month later.

1078
01:25:19,075 --> 01:25:20,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it was placed there.

1079
01:25:20,636 --> 01:25:26,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something that we have to give credit to the custodians and to all the staff.

1080
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:27,299
[SPEAKER_10]: They know their buildings.

1081
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:29,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They know when something is out of place.

1082
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,541
[SPEAKER_10]: They know who doesn't belong there.

1083
01:25:33,142 --> 01:25:35,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We just have to improve the line of communication.

1084
01:25:35,783 --> 01:25:36,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is one glitch.

1085
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:39,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a major glitch, but this is one glitch that happened.

1086
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the most part, there's been great lines of communication between the police and the schools.

1087
01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:54,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that years ago, there was always the concern, if we tell the police it's going to be headline news, the police are going to go out of their way to embarrass the schools.

1088
01:25:54,552 --> 01:25:57,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that probably did happen way back.

1089
01:25:58,836 --> 01:26:07,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But we've come so far since then, working together and working closely, and solved a lot of issues before they actually rose to anybody's attention.

1090
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:08,953
[SPEAKER_10]: because we work so closely.

1091
01:26:08,993 --> 01:26:15,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to think this is one incident, one serious incident that obviously will never happen again.

1092
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:18,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that we'll get a call that night.

1093
01:26:18,996 --> 01:26:23,997
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have to give credit to the custodian for finding it, for turning it into the principle.

1094
01:26:24,397 --> 01:26:30,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Because what I'm told, the staff of the school, they report through their chain to their boss.

1095
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:32,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why it went that route.

1096
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:34,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why the custodian didn't call the police.

1097
01:26:35,011 --> 01:26:37,533
[SPEAKER_10]: He did it through the system that he's aware of.

1098
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:41,115
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing in writing that said, you will or you shall call the police.

1099
01:26:42,256 --> 01:26:43,137
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least he found it.

1100
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought he did the right thing and he went back to talk with the principal about it subsequently.

1101
01:26:49,482 --> 01:26:59,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Now earlier, this Officer Riccardi, I have to mention his name because he was mentioned a couple of times by the superintendent on whether he knew or didn't know.

1102
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:03,572
[SPEAKER_10]: All I can say is Officer Riccardi is very upset about this whole matter.

1103
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:06,591
[SPEAKER_10]: He never received an official call from anyone.

1104
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:10,553
[SPEAKER_10]: He got a call from a friend of his that mentioned this incident.

1105
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:14,415
[SPEAKER_10]: He immediately left the high school and went to the McGlynn School.

1106
01:27:15,195 --> 01:27:22,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want to go into details, but there were a couple of versions of that story once he got there, what he heard.

1107
01:27:22,498 --> 01:27:27,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And he didn't report it up the chain because it was almost like it was a non-issue.

1108
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It hadn't happened.

1109
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:30,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was no evidence.

1110
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:31,102
[SPEAKER_10]: There was nothing to look at.

1111
01:27:31,662 --> 01:27:33,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, it was kind of

1112
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:34,179
[SPEAKER_10]: case closed.

1113
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:42,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's beating himself up over that, because if he had reported it at that time, you know, we could have looked into it.

1114
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:44,381
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know that we'd be any further ahead today.

1115
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:50,622
[SPEAKER_10]: What brought it to a head was your conversation with me on Friday and what we were able to put together.

1116
01:27:50,662 --> 01:27:53,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are still a number of people we need to talk with.

1117
01:27:53,082 --> 01:27:55,003
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want it to be loud and clear.

1118
01:27:55,023 --> 01:28:00,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Riccati did what his job is, and he never heard it.

1119
01:28:00,244 --> 01:28:01,964
[SPEAKER_10]: He never got an official call on that.

1120
01:28:02,004 --> 01:28:02,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So the police department

1121
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:10,314
[SPEAKER_10]: was never officially notified of this incident until Friday morning by you, counselor.

1122
01:28:10,974 --> 01:28:14,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be no retaliation of personnel in the building is what you're telling me.

1123
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:23,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And because you're the one I trust that's here tonight, our children are safe to go to any of the Medford public schools on Monday morning.

1124
01:28:24,502 --> 01:28:24,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1125
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:30,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will have offices present at the various schools on Monday morning as well.

1126
01:28:31,035 --> 01:28:33,258
[SPEAKER_10]: to welcome them back to school after school vacation.

1127
01:28:33,298 --> 01:28:41,146
[SPEAKER_10]: But the rest of the schools will be swept, will be searched between now and Monday morning.

1128
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:42,427
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be checked.

1129
01:28:42,487 --> 01:28:44,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't guarantee that we can do it tomorrow.

1130
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:47,172
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to make arrangements with other communities with their dogs.

1131
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:52,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I've already spoken with Officer McGilvery and he's ready to go.

1132
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:53,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be done.

1133
01:28:54,115 --> 01:28:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Every one of the schools will be done.

1134
01:28:55,456 --> 01:29:01,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, the credit for the safety of the schools goes to the staff in those buildings every single day.

1135
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:02,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1136
01:29:03,282 --> 01:29:10,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And my reason for, you know, I really want to, I think I should mention my reason for asking about the retaliation.

1137
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:14,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I've received a number of complaints over the last

1138
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:30,477
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple years, a number of complaints on a whole host of issues with regards to administration at McGlynn, that administrator, including retaliation, including a whole host of things that I did let the superintendent know at our committee of the whole meeting in June.

1139
01:29:31,177 --> 01:29:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think it's extremely important because you do have a lot of scared personnel out there that fear retaliation from losing their job to a whole host of things.

1140
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:42,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just,

1141
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: really bothers me that they feel that way.

1142
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I understand where their concern is coming from.

1143
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:54,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I just think that's extremely important to bring up and make sure the chief is aware of.

1144
01:29:56,078 --> 01:29:56,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1145
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:57,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

1146
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:10,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I just ask that we request, um, upon the conclusion of the investigation, a copy of the investigative report, uh, the findings thereof and any remedial action that may or may not be taken, um, after the,

1147
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:13,369
[SPEAKER_14]: investigation is completed for our review.

1148
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:24,532
[SPEAKER_14]: If that material is not available to us for privacy reasons or whatever, I would ask that a presentation be made to a committee of the whole so that we can go over that and hear what happens at the end.

1149
01:30:24,732 --> 01:30:29,193
[SPEAKER_14]: We're at the beginning right now, Mr. President, but I'd like to come full circle on this and see some type of closure.

1150
01:30:29,233 --> 01:30:35,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to get a better understanding as to what happens once the investigation is over and what steps going forward are going to be taken.

1151
01:30:35,994 --> 01:30:36,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1152
01:30:36,857 --> 01:30:37,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1153
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:45,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, we've all had a chance to talk and ask questions, and we've heard from the superintendent and police chief.

1154
01:30:45,842 --> 01:30:51,325
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd really like to see that the parents and citizens have a chance to speak.

1155
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:52,566
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1156
01:30:52,826 --> 01:30:54,347
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to say something on my own.

1157
01:30:55,488 --> 01:30:59,910
[SPEAKER_26]: As an elected official up here, I feel I let my own grandchildren down, who go to those schools.

1158
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:04,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Roy's done a tremendous amount of work over the years for the schools.

1159
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,261
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I don't know how this happened, Rory.

1160
01:31:09,342 --> 01:31:14,824
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a shame, but I think it's time that this body step up with the school committee.

1161
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:23,508
[SPEAKER_26]: The school committee wants to operate on their own, but I think everybody, most of the people around this rail, all have children in the school system, or grandchildren in the school system.

1162
01:31:24,128 --> 01:31:34,273
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's time, especially in a situation like this, that we work in collaboration with the school committee to make sure that this gets done in a prompt and good fashion.

1163
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:38,211
[SPEAKER_26]: So they're just pushing it off to another group, and it gets pushed around.

1164
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:48,077
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's a suggestion that we should make to the mayor, to the city council, be involved in these discussions with this going forward, Mr. Superintendent.

1165
01:31:48,517 --> 01:31:50,658
[SPEAKER_24]: So Mr. President, if I make one more comment, if I can.

1166
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,939
[SPEAKER_24]: I've heard the word retaliation.

1167
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,481
[SPEAKER_24]: There will be no retaliation.

1168
01:31:55,961 --> 01:31:57,762
[SPEAKER_24]: There are a couple of legal matters pending.

1169
01:31:58,823 --> 01:32:04,106
[SPEAKER_24]: And those legal matters are being represented by legal counsel of the city.

1170
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:18,879
[SPEAKER_24]: and to indicate that somehow something is wrong because we defend ourselves in a legal setting in this public forum is wrong.

1171
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:27,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Furthermore, if there was any evidence of retaliation, I would not allow it in any way, shape or form.

1172
01:32:27,565 --> 01:32:28,546
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope you realize that.

1173
01:32:29,146 --> 01:32:31,868
[SPEAKER_24]: And secondly, with regard to that,

1174
01:32:33,012 --> 01:32:41,116
[SPEAKER_24]: There are situations and decisions that are made that people don't always agree with in terms of educational assignments, programs, services, and the like.

1175
01:32:42,276 --> 01:32:42,896
[SPEAKER_24]: But they're made.

1176
01:32:42,956 --> 01:32:44,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Some people agree and some people disagree.

1177
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:48,279
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the nature of how we plan and how we go forward.

1178
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:55,562
[SPEAKER_24]: And just because there's some disagreement doesn't necessarily mean that people are at risk of losing their jobs.

1179
01:32:56,062 --> 01:32:57,723
[SPEAKER_24]: People have professional status rights.

1180
01:32:57,763 --> 01:33:01,945
[SPEAKER_24]: They have all kinds of rights under their contract, all kinds of rights under the law.

1181
01:33:03,464 --> 01:33:05,365
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing's going to happen that's inappropriate.

1182
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:09,087
[SPEAKER_24]: If we disagree with someone on an issue, that can happen.

1183
01:33:09,767 --> 01:33:15,791
[SPEAKER_24]: But that happens in almost every forum and any place you go, in any operation, there may be some disagreements.

1184
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:23,615
[SPEAKER_24]: But no one is in jeopardy of losing their job in that regard because they spoke up or said something.

1185
01:33:23,675 --> 01:33:26,156
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, I appreciate it when people speak up.

1186
01:33:27,317 --> 01:33:30,739
[SPEAKER_24]: I like it when people speak to my face directly

1187
01:33:31,516 --> 01:33:35,278
[SPEAKER_24]: and call me on the phone when they've got something to say, rather than go to everybody else.

1188
01:33:35,799 --> 01:33:36,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Not everybody does that.

1189
01:33:38,541 --> 01:33:39,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of clarification.

1190
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:40,022
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of clarification.

1191
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:40,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Langeau-Kern.

1192
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:43,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to the people I trust.

1193
01:33:44,905 --> 01:33:45,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1194
01:33:47,947 --> 01:33:56,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there are people, Mr. President, there are people, Mr. President, who want to go and find out from the person responsible.

1195
01:33:56,773 --> 01:33:57,813
[SPEAKER_24]: And there are people that go around.

1196
01:33:57,833 --> 01:34:00,355
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have a problem with that in this particular point.

1197
01:34:00,947 --> 01:34:02,489
[SPEAKER_24]: but it does speak to the issue.

1198
01:34:02,989 --> 01:34:05,052
[SPEAKER_24]: And as far as trust goes, it cuts two ways.

1199
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:05,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1200
01:34:05,853 --> 01:34:10,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have any from the audience who would like to speak?

1201
01:34:10,899 --> 01:34:13,182
[SPEAKER_26]: Please step forward and state your name and the record, please.

1202
01:34:14,042 --> 01:34:15,603
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rose Poto-Gifford.

1203
01:34:16,143 --> 01:34:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I live on Parris Street in Medford.

1204
01:34:18,585 --> 01:34:20,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I was born and raised in this city.

1205
01:34:20,886 --> 01:34:29,011
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was born and raised in this city, and my mother was raised in this city, and I have never been so disgusted with this city in my life as I am today.

1206
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:35,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I am glad to see that a couple of you on this council have the spine to stand up and speak up.

1207
01:34:36,661 --> 01:34:51,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Regardless of whether or not this was reported, gun laws aside, protocols and policies aside, lockdown drills, active shooter drills aside, police being at the schools on Monday aside, this boils down to one thing.

1208
01:34:52,094 --> 01:35:04,484
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a principal in this city who was in possession of a loaded clip who did not feel the need to immediately do a sweep of the school to look for the gun that it belongs to.

1209
01:35:05,265 --> 01:35:07,386
[SPEAKER_06]: and he needs to be fired immediately.

1210
01:35:07,746 --> 01:35:25,651
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a superintendent in this city who was told that there was a loaded clip and he did not feel the need to request an immediate sweep to look for the gun that it belongs to and he needs to be fired immediately.

1211
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:34,968
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was a loaded clip found under a chair in this room right now, I would love to know what the procedure is to keep all of you safe.

1212
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Are our children not worthy of that?

1213
01:35:39,475 --> 01:35:40,816
[SPEAKER_06]: This is appalling.

1214
01:35:41,136 --> 01:35:46,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Would common sense not say, where is the gun that belongs to this clip?

1215
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,840
[SPEAKER_06]: This is appalling.

1216
01:35:49,801 --> 01:35:51,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely appalling.

1217
01:35:51,262 --> 01:35:54,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And my children will not be in school on Monday.

1218
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:57,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know when they will be back in school.

1219
01:35:58,806 --> 01:36:00,126
[SPEAKER_06]: This is disgusting.

1220
01:36:00,987 --> 01:36:06,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody in the chain of what went on with this needs to be fired immediately.

1221
01:36:13,865 --> 01:36:14,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1222
01:36:15,987 --> 01:36:17,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, my name is Melanie McLaughlin.

1223
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:21,172
[SPEAKER_20]: I live on Alston Street in Medford, Mass.

1224
01:36:25,717 --> 01:36:26,938
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to try not to cry.

1225
01:36:27,519 --> 01:36:27,719
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry?

1226
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:30,081
[SPEAKER_20]: I am going to try not to cry.

1227
01:36:31,302 --> 01:36:32,684
[SPEAKER_20]: These are our children.

1228
01:36:33,925 --> 01:36:35,226
[SPEAKER_20]: We are scared.

1229
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:44,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I received information that children in the school were searched and their backpacks were searched after this incident.

1230
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:47,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Our children were scared.

1231
01:36:48,704 --> 01:36:51,064
[SPEAKER_20]: I have more questions that I would like to ask.

1232
01:36:51,785 --> 01:36:56,907
[SPEAKER_20]: One question that has been asked of the community tonight, where is the principal tonight?

1233
01:36:58,327 --> 01:36:59,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Why is he not here?

1234
01:36:59,507 --> 01:37:03,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me.

1235
01:37:04,996 --> 01:37:08,357
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could hold our applause to the end so everybody can get to speak.

1236
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:09,158
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1237
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:18,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I sent a letter last week after the Parkland shootings to share that one of my children was afraid to come to school.

1238
01:37:20,081 --> 01:37:29,905
[SPEAKER_20]: She's my least anxious child and I shared this information because I was concerned about the many, many, many children out there who have anxiety that come to these schools.

1239
01:37:31,731 --> 01:37:35,692
[SPEAKER_20]: I was told not to worry about it, that we all have things that we have to work on.

1240
01:37:37,553 --> 01:37:38,153
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know.

1241
01:37:38,173 --> 01:37:39,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't understand.

1242
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:40,474
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Chief Sacco.

1243
01:37:40,494 --> 01:37:41,054
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know you.

1244
01:37:41,074 --> 01:37:46,136
[SPEAKER_20]: And with all due respect, when you call it a glitch, that just breaks my heart, because I think, you know what?

1245
01:37:46,256 --> 01:37:48,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Our children are not a glitch.

1246
01:37:51,297 --> 01:37:54,878
[SPEAKER_20]: Bear with me one second, because I had to write some things down that people asked me to share.

1247
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,580
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what is going to keep me awake tonight?

1248
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:02,932
[SPEAKER_20]: What's going to keep me awake tonight?

1249
01:38:03,933 --> 01:38:14,642
[SPEAKER_20]: What's going to keep me awake tonight is how do we know that that magazine clip wasn't put under that seat for someone to come back when that auditorium was full with their gun?

1250
01:38:15,283 --> 01:38:16,104
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we know that?

1251
01:38:16,304 --> 01:38:17,365
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know that.

1252
01:38:24,378 --> 01:38:31,947
[SPEAKER_20]: When we talk about mental health and students with issues with mental health, I am the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council here in Medford.

1253
01:38:32,287 --> 01:38:38,554
[SPEAKER_20]: I have had countless calls from families who have children with mental health issues who feel they are not being supported in our school.

1254
01:38:39,515 --> 01:38:44,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a child that went to the McGlynn Middle School who was bullied.

1255
01:38:45,382 --> 01:38:47,945
[SPEAKER_20]: We reported the bullying to the administrator.

1256
01:38:48,486 --> 01:38:50,549
[SPEAKER_20]: The administrator did not follow protocol.

1257
01:38:50,909 --> 01:38:57,177
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not know the administrator did not follow protocol until six months later when it was too late to report to anybody.

1258
01:38:58,618 --> 01:39:04,700
[SPEAKER_20]: My child lost a year and a half of her middle school education by being bullied at that school.

1259
01:39:05,961 --> 01:39:08,722
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can imagine how children feel in that circumstance.

1260
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:12,863
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know that this was an outside person, with all due respect.

1261
01:39:12,964 --> 01:39:16,405
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know that it was people that we rented the auditorium to.

1262
01:39:17,165 --> 01:39:20,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Although I agree that we should have more safety around that.

1263
01:39:24,608 --> 01:39:27,089
[SPEAKER_20]: The last question I have that I want you all to ask,

1264
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:31,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Did the school committee know this in December?

1265
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,001
[SPEAKER_20]: Was the school committee notified?

1266
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:36,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Was the mayor notified?

1267
01:39:37,923 --> 01:39:39,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1268
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:42,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I emailed the school committee, the mayor this morning at 6 a.m.

1269
01:39:42,767 --> 01:39:43,827
[SPEAKER_02]: and they found out Friday.

1270
01:39:44,448 --> 01:39:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure about the mayor, but the school committee woman, one school committee woman said the school committee was notified Friday.

1271
01:39:50,752 --> 01:39:52,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, I have to say thank you.

1272
01:39:53,854 --> 01:39:56,176
[SPEAKER_20]: As one mother to another, Councilor,

1273
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:00,587
[SPEAKER_20]: for your courage in coming forward with this information.

1274
01:40:02,088 --> 01:40:02,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1275
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:06,991
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't push things under the rug.

1276
01:40:07,031 --> 01:40:09,552
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't push things under the rug for security issues.

1277
01:40:09,572 --> 01:40:12,214
[SPEAKER_07]: As you stated, in this particular case, there was no we.

1278
01:40:28,254 --> 01:40:28,694
[SPEAKER_07]: There was you.

1279
01:40:29,895 --> 01:40:30,756
[SPEAKER_07]: You chose to do this.

1280
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:40,102
[SPEAKER_07]: You chose not to share with the school committee and communicate openly when you expressed many times, that's what the school committee asked for.

1281
01:40:40,922 --> 01:40:45,546
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what your former school committee colleagues have asked for over the years.

1282
01:40:46,646 --> 01:40:47,887
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't just one incident.

1283
01:40:48,207 --> 01:40:52,510
[SPEAKER_07]: This apparently is many incidents that have been brewing for years.

1284
01:40:54,492 --> 01:40:55,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the superintendent of the school.

1285
01:40:57,247 --> 01:40:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Please address the chair.

1286
01:40:58,007 --> 01:40:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1287
01:40:58,288 --> 01:41:00,128
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the superintendent of the school.

1288
01:41:00,148 --> 01:41:01,369
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a lot of responsibility.

1289
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:03,770
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not a police officer.

1290
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:05,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not the chief of police.

1291
01:41:07,612 --> 01:41:09,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not aware, but I don't think you have a law degree.

1292
01:41:12,215 --> 01:41:18,898
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes you think it's your responsibility to make the decision not to inform people?

1293
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:26,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it comes down to policies and everything else, policy is not going to stop.

1294
01:41:28,072 --> 01:41:28,372
[SPEAKER_07]: A bullet.

1295
01:41:29,053 --> 01:41:31,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Policy is not going to stop someone who wants to commit harm.

1296
01:41:32,915 --> 01:41:36,977
[SPEAKER_07]: But in this particular instance, it was a heinous act of neglect.

1297
01:41:38,898 --> 01:41:44,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Edwards should be held accountable and, in my personal opinion, fired.

1298
01:41:46,463 --> 01:41:48,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Belson, I know you're retiring.

1299
01:41:49,064 --> 01:41:56,569
[SPEAKER_07]: In my personal opinion, based on this and other instances that have come up, you should probably be leaving sooner than you are.

1300
01:41:58,285 --> 01:42:09,954
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've sat in those Committee of the Whole meetings, the search for the superintendent, and there's no doubting that you've given tons and tons of time and service to this community.

1301
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:13,537
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is unacceptable.

1302
01:42:14,057 --> 01:42:14,998
[SPEAKER_07]: This shouldn't be happening.

1303
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:18,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what is it going to take?

1304
01:42:19,501 --> 01:42:22,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to become another statistic, another community?

1305
01:42:23,084 --> 01:42:24,525
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about the McGlynn School.

1306
01:42:24,585 --> 01:42:27,327
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the Andrews, what, less than 500 feet away?

1307
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:31,046
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no cameras there.

1308
01:42:31,706 --> 01:42:32,927
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no line of sight there.

1309
01:42:33,627 --> 01:42:37,850
[SPEAKER_07]: What about all the children showing up for school on the school buses?

1310
01:42:39,651 --> 01:42:42,812
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be something that needs to be acted on, and it needs to be acted on now.

1311
01:42:43,693 --> 01:42:46,595
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be accountability across the board.

1312
01:42:48,256 --> 01:42:50,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't wait for this type of stuff to have.

1313
01:42:51,017 --> 01:42:52,338
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee needs to decide.

1314
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:57,061
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of those circumstances where action needs to happen sooner than later.

1315
01:42:59,977 --> 01:43:03,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And God forbid, if it happens later, hopefully we're all not regretting it later.

1316
01:43:04,839 --> 01:43:05,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1317
01:43:05,539 --> 01:43:05,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1318
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:09,620
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1319
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,780
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1320
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,321
[SPEAKER_29]: Lisa Ratanazio, 49 Metcalf Street in Medford.

1321
01:43:14,982 --> 01:43:16,662
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to bring up two points, please.

1322
01:43:16,902 --> 01:43:18,703
[SPEAKER_29]: I get a little nervous, so don't mind me.

1323
01:43:19,723 --> 01:43:21,444
[SPEAKER_29]: Retaliation and cover up.

1324
01:43:22,004 --> 01:43:25,805
[SPEAKER_29]: I heard what Mr. Mark said on the television with regards to cover up.

1325
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:30,508
[SPEAKER_29]: In fact, this has been more than one cover-up from this administration.

1326
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:32,690
[SPEAKER_29]: This man needs to go.

1327
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:34,691
[SPEAKER_29]: Not down the road.

1328
01:43:34,852 --> 01:43:36,813
[SPEAKER_29]: He should have been gone a long time ago.

1329
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:40,756
[SPEAKER_29]: First of all, you have dogs coming in, sniffing dogs.

1330
01:43:41,156 --> 01:43:42,457
[SPEAKER_29]: No parents are notified.

1331
01:43:43,558 --> 01:43:51,885
[SPEAKER_29]: Now you have magazines lying around somewhere in the schools and nobody is reporting it.

1332
01:43:52,005 --> 01:43:56,288
[SPEAKER_29]: He doesn't want to talk to Fox News and say, well, I don't know if there were bullets in it and I don't want

1333
01:43:56,727 --> 01:43:57,508
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, dodging.

1334
01:43:58,428 --> 01:43:59,409
[SPEAKER_29]: It's been no secret.

1335
01:43:59,449 --> 01:44:06,653
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been here for over 51 years and everybody is, I'm going to say it is in bed with everybody in this city and we all know it.

1336
01:44:07,653 --> 01:44:14,117
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Belson said that he's appreciative when people call him up and speak to him on the phone.

1337
01:44:14,477 --> 01:44:15,458
[SPEAKER_29]: Let me tell you something.

1338
01:44:15,765 --> 01:44:19,767
[SPEAKER_29]: This man is not afraid of the police, he's not afraid of you, he does not care.

1339
01:44:20,147 --> 01:44:29,953
[SPEAKER_29]: When my child was bullied last year and there was a police report that was written, he specifically told me, I don't care about the police report.

1340
01:44:29,993 --> 01:44:32,254
[SPEAKER_29]: You've seen one police report, you've seen them all.

1341
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:33,815
[SPEAKER_29]: Right to my face.

1342
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:35,576
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Belson, you're an idiot.

1343
01:44:38,345 --> 01:44:39,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't tolerate that here.

1344
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:40,368
[SPEAKER_29]: That's fine.

1345
01:44:40,388 --> 01:44:41,490
[SPEAKER_29]: I have to speak my mind.

1346
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:48,842
[SPEAKER_29]: As far as cover up goes and Mr. Police Chief over here and trying to protect somebody who has a job at the school.

1347
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:52,411
[SPEAKER_29]: the police retaliate.

1348
01:44:53,151 --> 01:45:05,882
[SPEAKER_29]: So for him to turn around and say, oh, don't worry, everybody's job is gonna be protected, I'd really like to see something in writing for that, whoever it was that reported this, that they will keep their job.

1349
01:45:06,543 --> 01:45:14,049
[SPEAKER_29]: Because if the police can retaliate against a victim, who's to say they're not gonna have retaliation against somebody else in that school?

1350
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,271
[SPEAKER_29]: I know about retaliation.

1351
01:45:16,331 --> 01:45:17,211
[SPEAKER_29]: Believe me, I do.

1352
01:45:17,651 --> 01:45:21,733
[SPEAKER_29]: I've had my fair share of it within this city and everybody knows it.

1353
01:45:22,314 --> 01:45:33,639
[SPEAKER_29]: But Mr Marks, what you said as far as cover up and sliding under the rugs and he's got things going on within his school and he's telling me my my son and his police report doesn't matter.

1354
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:36,131
[SPEAKER_29]: Enough's enough.

1355
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:37,913
[SPEAKER_29]: You've got to protect these kids.

1356
01:45:38,514 --> 01:45:40,757
[SPEAKER_29]: I've tried so hard to protect kids.

1357
01:45:40,797 --> 01:45:42,739
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm an advocate for children with disabilities.

1358
01:45:42,999 --> 01:45:43,841
[SPEAKER_29]: You all know that.

1359
01:45:44,101 --> 01:45:48,246
[SPEAKER_29]: And I will do whatever it takes to protect them and other children within this community.

1360
01:45:48,506 --> 01:45:48,867
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1361
01:45:53,712 --> 01:45:55,413
[SPEAKER_26]: Can we keep the clapping till the end, please?

1362
01:45:55,953 --> 01:45:56,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1363
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:57,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello, council.

1364
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:58,494
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Frank Volpe.

1365
01:45:58,514 --> 01:46:00,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on Winthrop Street in Medford.

1366
01:46:00,314 --> 01:46:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two questions that I'd like to put forth that were brought up and I think completely thrown away and done.

1367
01:46:06,097 --> 01:46:14,120
[SPEAKER_08]: One, who is the individual that took the picture of the magazine loaded with bullets and where is that magazine today?

1368
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we do not know where the magazine today, how was it disposed of then?

1369
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:20,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it thrown in the principal's trash in his office?

1370
01:46:21,302 --> 01:46:23,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it thrown in the dumpster out back behind the school?

1371
01:46:23,524 --> 01:46:25,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he bring it home and throw it away at his house?

1372
01:46:25,865 --> 01:46:30,607
[SPEAKER_08]: These are two very important questions that I think should be answered relatively immediately, okay?

1373
01:46:31,087 --> 01:46:32,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Very important questions.

1374
01:46:32,988 --> 01:46:39,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked in law enforcement for over 12 years on lawful disposal of ammunition, firearms, state, federal charges.

1375
01:46:39,911 --> 01:46:50,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish that this council, the mayor, and the committee all get together and swiftly act to remove the people that wrongfully disposed of this ammunition and covered it up.

1376
01:46:50,734 --> 01:47:07,360
[SPEAKER_08]: immediately to protect our children and our community, who were clearly and totally violated, and as you brought up earlier, disrespected, because no parent got the respect of the announcement that there was live ammunition found in a school here in Medford, Mass.

1377
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1378
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:08,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1379
01:47:11,841 --> 01:47:13,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1380
01:47:13,522 --> 01:47:15,983
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, Terrell Sainz, 91 Sydney Street, Medford, Mass.

1381
01:47:17,263 --> 01:47:20,124
[SPEAKER_30]: So, a few things for me.

1382
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:21,615
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm a father.

1383
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:28,400
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm a coach at the high school right now, fourth wall team.

1384
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:29,481
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm also a soldier.

1385
01:47:30,962 --> 01:47:31,863
[SPEAKER_30]: I deal with these things.

1386
01:47:32,003 --> 01:47:32,403
[SPEAKER_30]: I have.

1387
01:47:33,163 --> 01:47:38,527
[SPEAKER_30]: For 575 days of my lifetime, at 23 years old, I dealt with this stuff in combat.

1388
01:47:39,308 --> 01:47:41,950
[SPEAKER_30]: I can be and deal with this kind of stuff.

1389
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,951
[SPEAKER_30]: I hate to say that, but I can.

1390
01:47:44,852 --> 01:47:45,632
[SPEAKER_30]: My daughter cannot.

1391
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:48,014
[SPEAKER_30]: Your daughters, your kids cannot deal with this.

1392
01:47:50,031 --> 01:47:55,774
[SPEAKER_30]: The fact that the, as Julian said here, the ammunition was disposed of incorrectly is awful.

1393
01:47:57,314 --> 01:48:04,238
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know anyone with any sense of common sense, any half of a brain would think that that would be okay.

1394
01:48:05,418 --> 01:48:06,259
[SPEAKER_30]: You speak of policy.

1395
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:08,740
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, guess what?

1396
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:13,482
[SPEAKER_30]: Policy does not dictate common sense to say, hey, ammunition is here.

1397
01:48:14,362 --> 01:48:16,563
[SPEAKER_30]: You don't just go to your principal, you go right to the police right there.

1398
01:48:16,643 --> 01:48:17,364
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't care what anyone says.

1399
01:48:18,444 --> 01:48:23,265
[SPEAKER_30]: That should have been bypassed right away, instantly, without hesitation whatsoever.

1400
01:48:25,465 --> 01:48:26,585
[SPEAKER_30]: That's one part of it.

1401
01:48:27,106 --> 01:48:32,467
[SPEAKER_30]: The other part of it, as a coach, I have watched outsiders come into these schools.

1402
01:48:33,047 --> 01:48:34,347
[SPEAKER_30]: I get annoyed with it every single time.

1403
01:48:34,367 --> 01:48:41,128
[SPEAKER_30]: When I say outsiders, I mean like LaSalle College, Emanuel College, use our fields, coach our schools.

1404
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:45,369
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, by the way, I am also cyber security, cyber defense,

1405
01:48:48,243 --> 01:48:50,364
[SPEAKER_30]: counter-terrorism for the army.

1406
01:48:51,504 --> 01:48:53,005
[SPEAKER_30]: I hold a high-level clearance.

1407
01:48:53,965 --> 01:48:54,966
[SPEAKER_30]: I deal with this on a regular basis.

1408
01:48:55,726 --> 01:48:56,546
[SPEAKER_30]: I hate to say it again.

1409
01:48:57,367 --> 01:49:02,609
[SPEAKER_30]: When I walk around these schools and these facilities, I do an assessment, security-wise, of these facilities.

1410
01:49:03,209 --> 01:49:04,950
[SPEAKER_30]: And I can tell you right now, they are not secure.

1411
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:10,032
[SPEAKER_30]: I have walked through these schools, these hallways, without anyone questioning me one time.

1412
01:49:10,932 --> 01:49:11,492
[SPEAKER_30]: Look at my face.

1413
01:49:12,433 --> 01:49:15,434
[SPEAKER_30]: When I'm fully shaven, no hair, I look real damn young.

1414
01:49:17,472 --> 01:49:18,212
[SPEAKER_30]: I pass for a student.

1415
01:49:19,813 --> 01:49:20,474
[SPEAKER_30]: No one questions me.

1416
01:49:21,534 --> 01:49:22,235
[SPEAKER_30]: No one stops me.

1417
01:49:23,115 --> 01:49:24,696
[SPEAKER_30]: I walk in and out as I please through the high schools.

1418
01:49:27,197 --> 01:49:27,477
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay?

1419
01:49:28,218 --> 01:49:35,162
[SPEAKER_30]: I've gone through these schools, McGlynn as well, looked around, looked at the cameras that are not there, and the ones that are there are in poor sight, poor view.

1420
01:49:36,722 --> 01:49:43,306
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, something has to be done and done now, not later, not, we have to have a discussion about it, just do it now, get it done.

1421
01:49:46,408 --> 01:49:46,948
[SPEAKER_30]: I hate to say it,

1422
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:48,731
[SPEAKER_30]: But I can deal with this.

1423
01:49:48,991 --> 01:49:50,752
[SPEAKER_30]: And my kids and your kids cannot deal with this.

1424
01:49:51,152 --> 01:49:52,352
[SPEAKER_30]: Our faculty cannot deal with this.

1425
01:49:53,273 --> 01:49:54,773
[SPEAKER_30]: Our society cannot deal with this any longer.

1426
01:49:55,293 --> 01:49:55,693
[SPEAKER_30]: He's right.

1427
01:49:55,934 --> 01:49:57,974
[SPEAKER_30]: Fear is a motivator.

1428
01:49:59,715 --> 01:50:00,855
[SPEAKER_30]: Fear keeps people alive, actually.

1429
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:02,376
[SPEAKER_30]: Kept me alive.

1430
01:50:02,396 --> 01:50:04,316
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't say that much right now.

1431
01:50:05,977 --> 01:50:06,457
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm done with it.

1432
01:50:07,057 --> 01:50:07,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1433
01:50:10,538 --> 01:50:10,918
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1434
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:12,018
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1435
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:13,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Angelica Diaz.

1436
01:50:17,203 --> 01:50:22,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1437
01:50:24,731 --> 01:50:28,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fellow following student at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

1438
01:50:28,675 --> 01:50:29,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a senior.

1439
01:50:30,157 --> 01:50:36,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And within my past four years, we've only had two lockdowns, my freshman year and my sophomore year.

1440
01:50:38,444 --> 01:50:41,205
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no security in the school whatsoever.

1441
01:50:41,945 --> 01:50:48,786
[SPEAKER_01]: There are students every day that fear of going to school because of us hearing about the mass school shootings.

1442
01:50:49,526 --> 01:50:56,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that there needs to be something done with it, especially if there was one found at a middle school.

1443
01:50:56,408 --> 01:50:59,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You would expect it to be found at a high school rather than a middle school.

1444
01:51:00,969 --> 01:51:04,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is outrageously, it's unacceptable.

1445
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:21,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my brother and I have gathered a, we have assembled a walkout for March 14th for the support of those who have been killed as of February 14th in Florida.

1446
01:51:22,887 --> 01:51:29,269
[SPEAKER_01]: to ban the assault weapons, and I just want to make sure that there will be no consequences for those who do walk out.

1447
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:34,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a 17-minute walkout of a moment of silence for those who have died.

1448
01:51:35,012 --> 01:51:38,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody will reassure themselves back to their class.

1449
01:51:40,054 --> 01:51:42,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1450
01:51:45,276 --> 01:51:46,116
[SPEAKER_19]: The day after

1451
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:53,245
[SPEAKER_19]: the Florida shooting, I had gone into Mr. Edwards' office that morning.

1452
01:51:55,126 --> 01:52:01,391
[SPEAKER_19]: I had asked him what the procedure was in the event of this happening to us.

1453
01:52:03,432 --> 01:52:06,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And he couldn't tell me anything.

1454
01:52:07,898 --> 01:52:08,939
[SPEAKER_19]: He couldn't tell me anything.

1455
01:52:08,979 --> 01:52:10,300
[SPEAKER_19]: There was no procedure.

1456
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,761
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no code red.

1457
01:52:11,961 --> 01:52:13,102
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no code black.

1458
01:52:13,382 --> 01:52:19,687
[SPEAKER_19]: These children do not know what to do in the event somebody comes into their school with a gun.

1459
01:52:21,266 --> 01:52:22,527
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't know what to do.

1460
01:52:22,667 --> 01:52:23,948
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what they're practicing?

1461
01:52:24,288 --> 01:52:25,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Fire drills.

1462
01:52:25,649 --> 01:52:26,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Fire drills.

1463
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:30,053
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're in 2018, and we have mass shootings going on.

1464
01:52:30,693 --> 01:52:32,194
[SPEAKER_19]: This is unacceptable.

1465
01:52:33,055 --> 01:52:42,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I left that meeting not feeling reassured at all, to the point I have to think of how am I going to protect my son and you guys' care.

1466
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:45,044
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what my solution was?

1467
01:52:46,786 --> 01:52:48,227
[SPEAKER_19]: A bulletproof vest.

1468
01:52:49,667 --> 01:52:53,129
[SPEAKER_19]: A bulletproof vest with shields that you gotta put in.

1469
01:52:54,829 --> 01:52:55,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you kidding me?

1470
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:57,270
[SPEAKER_19]: A bulletproof backpack?

1471
01:52:58,371 --> 01:52:59,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I'm not gonna tell you again.

1472
01:53:00,352 --> 01:53:02,773
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what I have to add to the school supply list?

1473
01:53:04,554 --> 01:53:05,674
[SPEAKER_19]: This is unacceptable.

1474
01:53:05,754 --> 01:53:07,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Something needs to be done.

1475
01:53:07,415 --> 01:53:09,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Our children's lives are at stake.

1476
01:53:10,176 --> 01:53:12,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Doesn't that matter to anybody?

1477
01:53:18,581 --> 01:53:19,621
[SPEAKER_31]: Name and address of the record, please.

1478
01:53:19,881 --> 01:53:23,022
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Sean Began, 362 Lawrence Road, Medford.

1479
01:53:23,782 --> 01:53:27,242
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, members of the committee, for allowing us this forum.

1480
01:53:27,262 --> 01:53:30,823
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of raw emotion here today.

1481
01:53:31,323 --> 01:53:35,524
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've been taking some notes while the superintendent was speaking.

1482
01:53:35,944 --> 01:53:42,845
[SPEAKER_31]: And a couple of things I want to hit upon, one of which the gentleman from Medford Street just stated previously.

1483
01:53:43,745 --> 01:53:48,046
[SPEAKER_31]: Apparently, Mr. Superintendent Belson referred to it as a picture.

1484
01:53:48,626 --> 01:53:49,826
[SPEAKER_31]: but I think he meant photograph.

1485
01:53:50,046 --> 01:53:52,747
[SPEAKER_31]: Apparently there is a photograph of this clip.

1486
01:53:53,547 --> 01:54:00,788
[SPEAKER_31]: Now my notes that I was taking now, he said he just saw it for the first time yesterday, which tells me that it probably still exists.

1487
01:54:01,788 --> 01:54:10,630
[SPEAKER_31]: Before he leaves tonight, the members of this committee should find out from him where that photo is, make sure that the police have it in their possession.

1488
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:16,551
[SPEAKER_31]: Because if it was taken with a cell phone camera, which I imagine it probably was, it has a date stamp on it.

1489
01:54:16,931 --> 01:54:17,991
[SPEAKER_31]: We will know exactly

1490
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:20,822
[SPEAKER_31]: who took the photo, when it was taken.

1491
01:54:21,502 --> 01:54:32,087
[SPEAKER_31]: Because frankly, I read tonight, before I came here, this statement of Superintendent Belson, which was posted online by Lisa Evangelista.

1492
01:54:33,807 --> 01:54:34,948
[SPEAKER_31]: This statement stinks.

1493
01:54:35,608 --> 01:54:36,489
[SPEAKER_31]: It makes no sense.

1494
01:54:37,029 --> 01:54:38,709
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't pass the smell test.

1495
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:46,793
[SPEAKER_31]: Jake Edwards clearly is either not being forthcoming, he has changed his story,

1496
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:52,852
[SPEAKER_31]: or someone is now protecting him tonight, such that we don't know the full story.

1497
01:54:54,013 --> 01:55:06,319
[SPEAKER_31]: And a mistake was made, and Superintendent Belson is man enough to own that mistake, and I applaud him for that, because it's tough to come here before a group of angry people and own your mistakes.

1498
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:15,483
[SPEAKER_31]: He should not make another mistake, which would be not being completely and totally transparent

1499
01:55:16,044 --> 01:55:23,148
[SPEAKER_31]: about everything he knows about this incident and letting the community members know everything he knows about this incident.

1500
01:55:23,188 --> 01:55:24,689
[SPEAKER_31]: There is nothing to be hidden here.

1501
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,831
[SPEAKER_31]: There is no reason to hide anything.

1502
01:55:27,931 --> 01:55:31,013
[SPEAKER_31]: Why that clip was thrown out is a mystery.

1503
01:55:31,954 --> 01:55:34,515
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it was just a stupid decision that someone made.

1504
01:55:35,776 --> 01:55:39,038
[SPEAKER_31]: However, sometimes stupid decisions have consequences.

1505
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:41,440
[SPEAKER_31]: I think this one is going to have some consequences.

1506
01:55:43,675 --> 01:55:52,482
[SPEAKER_31]: Another thing that was stated, which I had to make a note of, was describing this as an isolated incident.

1507
01:55:54,584 --> 01:55:59,948
[SPEAKER_31]: Every one of the mass shootings that we've been hearing about was an isolated incident for that school.

1508
01:56:01,409 --> 01:56:04,051
[SPEAKER_31]: This isolated incident didn't cost any lives.

1509
01:56:04,671 --> 01:56:06,453
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want to have one that does.

1510
01:56:07,145 --> 01:56:10,166
[SPEAKER_31]: There's obviously security concerns at these schools.

1511
01:56:10,926 --> 01:56:12,526
[SPEAKER_31]: I have three children in these schools.

1512
01:56:12,586 --> 01:56:14,507
[SPEAKER_31]: Two of them are at Andrews Middle School.

1513
01:56:16,227 --> 01:56:23,748
[SPEAKER_31]: I asked them about the security measures at the school in these lockdowns and the drills that they do.

1514
01:56:25,409 --> 01:56:28,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Essentially, they told me these drills are pointless.

1515
01:56:28,609 --> 01:56:33,290
[SPEAKER_31]: They're hiding in a classroom, most of which have windows out to the hallway.

1516
01:56:34,151 --> 01:56:35,671
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't feel safe or protected.

1517
01:56:37,537 --> 01:56:45,163
[SPEAKER_31]: There has to be a complete reevaluation of the policies and procedures on security, and there has to be complete transparency.

1518
01:56:45,223 --> 01:56:47,745
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand there's a school committee meeting on Thursday.

1519
01:56:48,446 --> 01:57:00,355
[SPEAKER_31]: I would expect that we will know every detail, or I would hope that we will know every detail about what transpired, where the breakdown in communication was at that school.

1520
01:57:01,076 --> 01:57:06,200
[SPEAKER_31]: From what I heard today, the only person who acted correctly was the janitor.

1521
01:57:07,839 --> 01:57:09,060
[SPEAKER_31]: is pretty sad.

1522
01:57:09,701 --> 01:57:10,001
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1523
01:57:10,421 --> 01:57:10,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1524
01:57:12,703 --> 01:57:13,083
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1525
01:57:13,123 --> 01:57:13,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the right.

1526
01:57:13,864 --> 01:57:15,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I'm Hannah O'Brien, 31 St.

1527
01:57:15,826 --> 01:57:16,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Denis Ave.

1528
01:57:16,366 --> 01:57:18,608
[SPEAKER_21]: Now of 224 Park Street Stoneham.

1529
01:57:19,348 --> 01:57:24,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, uh, I'm an aunt of a child in the daycare at Mevrin public schools.

1530
01:57:25,033 --> 01:57:27,355
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a paraprofessional of the Mevrin public schools.

1531
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:31,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I have worked at the Medford Community Schools for about six years.

1532
01:57:32,652 --> 01:57:35,294
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a mother to 20 students when I'm in school.

1533
01:57:35,694 --> 01:57:35,974
[SPEAKER_21]: I am.

1534
01:57:36,455 --> 01:57:42,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Those parents trust us to make sure their kids are safe every single time they walk into school.

1535
01:57:42,579 --> 01:57:45,821
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to get emotional because those are my kids when I go to school.

1536
01:57:46,401 --> 01:57:49,223
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to make sure that they're safe all the time.

1537
01:57:49,864 --> 01:57:53,046
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to make sure the parents are informed that they're safe all the time.

1538
01:57:54,175 --> 01:58:01,159
[SPEAKER_21]: There is, I just can't, I've been so generally upset for the past week, and I don't even have kids.

1539
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,502
[SPEAKER_21]: These kids deserve the safe environment to go to school.

1540
01:58:06,842 --> 01:58:09,804
[SPEAKER_21]: We live in a world where we should be safe to go to school.

1541
01:58:09,824 --> 01:58:11,125
[SPEAKER_21]: We deserve an education.

1542
01:58:11,205 --> 01:58:13,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I deserve to go to work and feel safe.

1543
01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:16,588
[SPEAKER_21]: And right now, I don't feel like I'm safe at work.

1544
01:58:17,108 --> 01:58:18,669
[SPEAKER_21]: These kids don't feel like they're safe.

1545
01:58:19,069 --> 01:58:22,371
[SPEAKER_21]: The parents don't feel like they can send their kids to school, and it's generally sad.

1546
01:58:24,306 --> 01:58:25,366
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to do more.

1547
01:58:25,947 --> 01:58:30,629
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can't sit back and come to these meetings, and I just can't sit back anymore.

1548
01:58:30,649 --> 01:58:31,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't.

1549
01:58:32,269 --> 01:58:32,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1550
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:35,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1551
01:58:35,611 --> 01:58:36,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1552
01:58:38,172 --> 01:58:39,832
[SPEAKER_28]: John Sullivan, Sherman Place, Medford.

1553
01:58:42,065 --> 01:58:50,309
[SPEAKER_28]: There are some people, obviously, that have some concerns here about things that can be done, so I just wanted to speak for a few minutes on that.

1554
01:58:51,190 --> 01:59:02,356
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to get my thoughts on the record for suggestions to remedy some of these things, the tragic events that have taken place in Florida and many other cities.

1555
01:59:04,065 --> 01:59:11,209
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a common sense option I'd like to share with you so somebody could run it up the flagpole, the state representatives, senators, U.S.

1556
01:59:11,329 --> 01:59:17,091
[SPEAKER_28]: reps, senators, so they can work on the logistics of having it implemented.

1557
01:59:18,092 --> 01:59:26,336
[SPEAKER_28]: The solution doesn't involve disarming anyone, although we all think that severely mentally ill people shouldn't have guns.

1558
01:59:26,943 --> 01:59:28,804
[SPEAKER_28]: and it doesn't restrict the guns.

1559
01:59:28,965 --> 01:59:30,706
[SPEAKER_28]: It's something that everybody can get behind.

1560
01:59:31,647 --> 01:59:35,089
[SPEAKER_28]: The result would remove schools from the soft target list.

1561
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Our nation's schools need to be protected.

1562
01:59:38,712 --> 01:59:39,913
[SPEAKER_28]: So how do we accomplish this?

1563
01:59:40,893 --> 01:59:53,363
[SPEAKER_28]: We have about 100,000 public schools, ex-combat veterans in every school, two per school, along with the existing security to respond immediately to threats to the students and faculty.

1564
01:59:54,922 --> 02:00:03,629
[SPEAKER_28]: These men, America's best, our very best, tactically trained, will be bestowed the mission and purpose that is sometimes lacking when they return from active duty.

1565
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:08,974
[SPEAKER_28]: And as an ancillary benefit, it would employ these young heroes in a vitally important task.

1566
02:00:09,974 --> 02:00:12,577
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's why I believe it's a solution that everybody can get behind.

1567
02:00:17,213 --> 02:00:20,015
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, these things can be done with gun control and laws.

1568
02:00:20,775 --> 02:00:22,316
[SPEAKER_28]: But I consider that a separate issue.

1569
02:00:22,516 --> 02:00:24,597
[SPEAKER_28]: This particular part of the solution is paramount.

1570
02:00:25,398 --> 02:00:27,739
[SPEAKER_28]: It can be done instantly and provide instant results.

1571
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:38,846
[SPEAKER_28]: And just like everybody else said, if somebody's willing to do something to trade their life to do horrific things, then it would be impossible to stop them from doing that.

1572
02:00:38,886 --> 02:00:43,769
[SPEAKER_28]: But they would be trading their lives if they had somebody who was trained to do so to stop them.

1573
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:59,517
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I just wanted to pass this, get this out here, so anybody in this council that may think this is a good idea or anybody out there that may be listening, they can, you know, we can talk to our U.S.

1574
02:00:59,557 --> 02:01:03,139
[SPEAKER_28]: Senators and try to get a federal program started, you know.

1575
02:01:03,579 --> 02:01:05,922
[SPEAKER_28]: I figure you can have them vetted through Homeland Security.

1576
02:01:05,962 --> 02:01:11,227
[SPEAKER_28]: You could have any number of ways of getting people that are tactically trained to be in the schools.

1577
02:01:12,268 --> 02:01:14,210
[SPEAKER_28]: I have ideas on what it would cost.

1578
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:15,652
[SPEAKER_28]: I have all sorts of different things.

1579
02:01:15,752 --> 02:01:18,255
[SPEAKER_28]: But I mean, we don't need to get into it in this forum.

1580
02:01:18,295 --> 02:01:23,921
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think that with all the concerns that everybody has here for the students and faculties in the schools.

1581
02:01:24,619 --> 02:01:33,942
[SPEAKER_28]: that this kind of action would definitely, you know, safeguard the people that are in those schools for that reason.

1582
02:01:34,362 --> 02:01:35,443
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so thank you.

1583
02:01:37,883 --> 02:01:38,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1584
02:01:38,284 --> 02:01:39,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

1585
02:01:39,744 --> 02:01:40,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sir.

1586
02:01:40,464 --> 02:01:43,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1587
02:01:43,825 --> 02:01:45,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank the speakers.

1588
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:51,128
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes a lot of courage to come up here because one of the residents,

1589
02:01:52,557 --> 02:01:53,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Lisa, she's right.

1590
02:01:54,217 --> 02:01:56,298
[SPEAKER_11]: You come up here and you take your life in your hands.

1591
02:01:56,838 --> 02:01:58,678
[SPEAKER_11]: There's retaliation in this city.

1592
02:02:00,299 --> 02:02:14,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And this high school, there was a meeting at the high school with the chief and the superintendent, and I showed up with my camera, and I looked at the doorway, I looked at the woman behind me, I believe she was a mother, and she's shaking her head and I'm shaking my head.

1593
02:02:15,562 --> 02:02:17,382
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, check in with security desk.

1594
02:02:17,462 --> 02:02:20,083
[SPEAKER_11]: So immediately, you know me, I took out the camera and I,

1595
02:02:21,212 --> 02:02:26,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I made a little one minute video that you can walk into the high school.

1596
02:02:26,854 --> 02:02:38,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's security in the door, but for a long time you could walk into the high school, no security check, janitors walking around, people walking around, anyone could have planted anything there, drugs, anything.

1597
02:02:39,178 --> 02:02:43,179
[SPEAKER_11]: But you got the chief of police and the superintendent in there telling everyone everything's fine.

1598
02:02:44,059 --> 02:02:49,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got this little proof, this documentary, up on YouTube,

1599
02:02:50,899 --> 02:02:57,045
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of city do we live in where we cannot trust the people who take an oath to protect and serve?

1600
02:02:58,947 --> 02:03:01,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's mind-boggling.

1601
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:04,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And this happens in the middle of this huge massacre again.

1602
02:03:05,613 --> 02:03:09,017
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a massacre, and there's bullets in a high school.

1603
02:03:10,999 --> 02:03:14,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's a target on my back.

1604
02:03:14,362 --> 02:03:15,243
[SPEAKER_11]: You think I'm not scared?

1605
02:03:17,145 --> 02:03:19,046
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for quarry checks at the high school.

1606
02:03:19,086 --> 02:03:26,151
[SPEAKER_11]: The superintendent has all his reasons why there should be quarry checks for people who have supervised access to the school.

1607
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:30,114
[SPEAKER_11]: The station manager, Ben Brown, is the supervisor.

1608
02:03:30,174 --> 02:03:32,355
[SPEAKER_11]: He's paid $67,500 a year to supervise.

1609
02:03:32,815 --> 02:03:36,338
[SPEAKER_11]: But politicians who want to run for office, they have to get a quarry check.

1610
02:03:37,178 --> 02:03:39,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the people in power know their backgrounds.

1611
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:41,121
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what that's all about.

1612
02:03:41,521 --> 02:03:44,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about public safety when you get bullets in the auditorium.

1613
02:03:45,564 --> 02:03:45,884
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

1614
02:03:46,909 --> 02:03:50,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, solutions.

1615
02:03:51,771 --> 02:03:54,451
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, a couple of courageous counselors come forward.

1616
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:56,192
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much hypocrisy here.

1617
02:03:56,252 --> 02:04:02,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'll get the gavel if I even talk about, you know, the bluster from one individual.

1618
02:04:02,114 --> 02:04:05,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he was, you know, I think he wasn't, I think he was,

1619
02:04:06,664 --> 02:04:11,065
[SPEAKER_11]: set free, but the whole Otis Mass incident, and it's like, where was the protection for the kids there?

1620
02:04:11,545 --> 02:04:20,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all the bluster here with the cameras here, but that individual, I'm sorry, he's such a hypocrite, as is the superintendent of schools who wrote me the most malicious letter.

1621
02:04:21,528 --> 02:04:25,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, changing my name and putting a P in front of it to call me Pigleone.

1622
02:04:25,809 --> 02:04:29,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's childish, but that's what he's doing instead of protecting your kids.

1623
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:30,570
[SPEAKER_11]: He's writing nasty letters.

1624
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:35,011
[SPEAKER_11]: He's laughing to a new hire that Joe thinks I hire sexual predators at the high school.

1625
02:04:35,766 --> 02:04:36,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Roy, I do.

1626
02:04:37,648 --> 02:04:38,288
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sorry.

1627
02:04:38,628 --> 02:04:39,569
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much evidence.

1628
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:42,351
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much collusion.

1629
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's about time the parents came out and spoke tonight.

1630
02:04:46,154 --> 02:04:51,138
[SPEAKER_11]: They're disgusted, and they should be, because, as we all know, I told you so.

1631
02:04:51,498 --> 02:04:57,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I said this months ago, and the city solicitor was angry with me for saying, you can't trust your kids with Roy Belson.

1632
02:04:57,663 --> 02:04:59,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mark Rumley went nuts.

1633
02:05:00,085 --> 02:05:00,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

1634
02:05:01,146 --> 02:05:01,846
[SPEAKER_11]: This proves it.

1635
02:05:02,207 --> 02:05:03,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Belson, I'll do respect.

1636
02:05:05,319 --> 02:05:07,981
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't have bullets in a school, Mr. Belson.

1637
02:05:08,802 --> 02:05:10,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been preaching about this.

1638
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:11,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been attacked from everyone.

1639
02:05:11,224 --> 02:05:12,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been dragged in a court.

1640
02:05:12,465 --> 02:05:14,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been physically assaulted.

1641
02:05:14,467 --> 02:05:22,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And the police dragged me in a criminal court because I was physically assaulted by the city clerk, and they didn't want to answer the questions about the bomb-sniffing dogs.

1642
02:05:22,874 --> 02:05:24,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why they dragged me in a court, and I won.

1643
02:05:26,116 --> 02:05:27,678
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the city you live in, Medford.

1644
02:05:27,978 --> 02:05:29,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Until we get rid of all these individuals,

1645
02:05:30,816 --> 02:05:33,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Sacco, Roy Belson, they should quit tomorrow.

1646
02:05:34,039 --> 02:05:34,939
[SPEAKER_11]: They're leaving anyway.

1647
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:40,924
[SPEAKER_11]: The fruit of the poisonous tree will not exist if we have crop rotation in the city.

1648
02:05:41,305 --> 02:05:41,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1649
02:05:45,388 --> 02:05:45,768
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1650
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:46,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1651
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:47,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

1652
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:48,851
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Melanie Raelan.

1653
02:05:48,911 --> 02:05:51,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 20 Stanley Avenue in South Medford.

1654
02:05:52,003 --> 02:05:59,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, councillors, for making this meeting all about this very important issue that everyone is talking about, both online and in person.

1655
02:05:59,152 --> 02:06:01,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to grab my notes.

1656
02:06:03,365 --> 02:06:06,066
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm afraid to send my kid to school next year.

1657
02:06:06,086 --> 02:06:07,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I am so proud of being in Medford.

1658
02:06:07,986 --> 02:06:13,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so proud of all the wonderful things I hear about our schools, about how wonderful the education is, all the opportunities.

1659
02:06:14,328 --> 02:06:16,989
[SPEAKER_12]: My kid's going to go to the Columbus next year with his best friend.

1660
02:06:17,509 --> 02:06:22,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Columbus, which had a lockdown this fall because somebody with a knife was outside the school.

1661
02:06:22,811 --> 02:06:23,911
[SPEAKER_12]: And what was the procedure there?

1662
02:06:24,651 --> 02:06:25,832
[SPEAKER_12]: We were never really told that.

1663
02:06:25,972 --> 02:06:28,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not in the school itself, so maybe it was clear to those people.

1664
02:06:28,933 --> 02:06:31,373
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really think this is the issue at hand.

1665
02:06:31,493 --> 02:06:32,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And Counselor Marks, you really put it down.

1666
02:06:33,843 --> 02:06:35,163
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the procedure?

1667
02:06:35,184 --> 02:06:38,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli, everybody's asking this question.

1668
02:06:38,685 --> 02:06:39,445
[SPEAKER_12]: We need clarity.

1669
02:06:39,485 --> 02:06:40,505
[SPEAKER_12]: We need communication.

1670
02:06:40,825 --> 02:06:45,147
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a district-wide procedure that is clear and that every parent, student, and teacher knows.

1671
02:06:46,267 --> 02:06:47,228
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the procedure?

1672
02:06:47,528 --> 02:06:48,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you something clear.

1673
02:06:48,788 --> 02:06:51,709
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been 18 school shootings so far in 2018.

1674
02:06:52,670 --> 02:06:53,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you something else clear.

1675
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:58,032
[SPEAKER_12]: On February 13 and 14, police logs show a suspicious person at McGlynn School.

1676
02:06:58,192 --> 02:06:59,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a week ago.

1677
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, you can check the police logs.

1678
02:07:02,051 --> 02:07:06,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Louise Musto-Choate for letting me know about that, and I published it in Medford Moms.

1679
02:07:07,896 --> 02:07:08,737
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the procedure?

1680
02:07:09,097 --> 02:07:15,483
[SPEAKER_12]: McGlynn and Andrews, they have, I'll tell you something else very clear that everybody knows, it has every one of our middle schoolers.

1681
02:07:15,923 --> 02:07:18,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Every one of them, they're all there, 500 feet from each other.

1682
02:07:18,866 --> 02:07:23,990
[SPEAKER_12]: As Mr. O'Leary pointed out before, that's something a shooter could easily get to.

1683
02:07:25,331 --> 02:07:28,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep asking what is the procedure because that's really the thesis statement here.

1684
02:07:30,166 --> 02:07:31,527
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't affect one school.

1685
02:07:31,547 --> 02:07:33,067
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't affect just the people at McGlynn.

1686
02:07:33,248 --> 02:07:35,448
[SPEAKER_12]: It affects all of us, every single person here.

1687
02:07:35,588 --> 02:07:36,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone who's pregnant.

1688
02:07:36,809 --> 02:07:38,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone who's part of the Medford Family Network.

1689
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:40,830
[SPEAKER_12]: People who have already had their kids in the schools.

1690
02:07:40,931 --> 02:07:50,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, this is not something that is just a small part of the population and that one or two people can have a discussion that, oh yes, with just four bullets, we don't really need to tell everybody.

1691
02:07:50,154 --> 02:07:51,134
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that serious.

1692
02:07:51,675 --> 02:07:54,296
[SPEAKER_12]: We have an excellent police department, an excellent police station.

1693
02:07:54,316 --> 02:07:56,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Why were they not immediately notified?

1694
02:07:58,024 --> 02:07:59,264
[SPEAKER_12]: When was the mayor notified?

1695
02:07:59,284 --> 02:08:03,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, Councilor Lungo-Kern, you addressed that on Friday.

1696
02:08:03,526 --> 02:08:04,626
[SPEAKER_12]: The school committee was notified.

1697
02:08:04,666 --> 02:08:05,866
[SPEAKER_12]: When was the mayor notified?

1698
02:08:06,346 --> 02:08:07,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is that not clear?

1699
02:08:08,727 --> 02:08:09,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you something else clear.

1700
02:08:09,827 --> 02:08:15,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep hearing about this principal, Jake Edwards, who I have never met, but all I hear about him is horrible things.

1701
02:08:16,269 --> 02:08:21,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear that he has helped in this conversation of not bringing this to light.

1702
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:23,471
[SPEAKER_12]: He apparently threw it out, thinking it's a cell phone.

1703
02:08:24,434 --> 02:08:25,755
[SPEAKER_12]: very cover up sounding.

1704
02:08:26,936 --> 02:08:29,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently he doesn't allow the use of the auditorium for teachers.

1705
02:08:29,938 --> 02:08:31,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently there's some struggle there.

1706
02:08:31,639 --> 02:08:33,320
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been some stuff with the PTO.

1707
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:39,003
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I keep hearing all these things about him and I'm not quite sure why those haven't been addressed at large.

1708
02:08:39,324 --> 02:08:41,405
[SPEAKER_12]: They shouldn't be just discussed in small parent groups.

1709
02:08:41,465 --> 02:08:42,366
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be brought to light.

1710
02:08:44,087 --> 02:08:45,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford has a communication problem.

1711
02:08:45,868 --> 02:08:50,571
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to, we need to protect our kids in the case of anything to do with guns and ammunition.

1712
02:08:51,058 --> 02:08:54,699
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't said, it isn't clear, it isn't the same across the district, or if it is, we don't know about it.

1713
02:08:54,799 --> 02:08:55,559
[SPEAKER_12]: We, the parents.

1714
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:58,400
[SPEAKER_12]: The timeline of this case is not clear.

1715
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:00,381
[SPEAKER_12]: The procedure is not clear.

1716
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:03,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Even the course of action right now is not clear.

1717
02:09:04,202 --> 02:09:05,163
[SPEAKER_12]: What is going to happen now?

1718
02:09:05,663 --> 02:09:06,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I am not hearing anything.

1719
02:09:07,123 --> 02:09:11,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Lungo-Kern, again, I really appreciate you asking these exact questions, asking for clarity.

1720
02:09:11,625 --> 02:09:15,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Marks, too, and everybody here, honestly, I really appreciate all of your comments.

1721
02:09:16,457 --> 02:09:18,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally believe Principal Edwards should be fired.

1722
02:09:18,938 --> 02:09:19,919
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to fix this now.

1723
02:09:19,959 --> 02:09:23,460
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't just have an incompetent person who's supposed to be protecting our students.

1724
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:24,581
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the leader there.

1725
02:09:24,661 --> 02:09:25,621
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the heart there.

1726
02:09:26,022 --> 02:09:27,562
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sounds like he's heartless.

1727
02:09:28,903 --> 02:09:29,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1728
02:09:29,443 --> 02:09:29,763
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1729
02:09:31,784 --> 02:09:32,205
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1730
02:09:32,225 --> 02:09:33,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1731
02:09:33,645 --> 02:09:33,765
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi.

1732
02:09:33,805 --> 02:09:35,506
[SPEAKER_32]: Tanya Sullivan, Brackett Street in Medford.

1733
02:09:36,647 --> 02:09:38,027
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to just say something.

1734
02:09:39,088 --> 02:09:42,970
[SPEAKER_32]: I am co-chair of the CPAC in Medford.

1735
02:09:43,490 --> 02:09:45,571
[SPEAKER_32]: But more importantly, my most important role is a mother.

1736
02:09:46,622 --> 02:09:50,824
[SPEAKER_32]: And I want to kind of speak on behalf of a population that isn't really able to speak for themselves.

1737
02:09:52,445 --> 02:09:53,606
[SPEAKER_32]: My son has special needs.

1738
02:09:54,266 --> 02:09:58,469
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a lot of kids in our school system that have special needs.

1739
02:09:59,389 --> 02:10:09,155
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, in a situation like this, we're trying to figure out how our kids would be protected.

1740
02:10:09,695 --> 02:10:15,318
[SPEAKER_32]: Currently, to learn about lockdown, a lot of times they are taught

1741
02:10:16,463 --> 02:10:21,144
[SPEAKER_32]: how to react to this through games, how to stay quiet.

1742
02:10:22,484 --> 02:10:24,625
[SPEAKER_32]: Not all of the kids are able to stay quiet.

1743
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:30,666
[SPEAKER_32]: So there's a big concern for all kids.

1744
02:10:31,086 --> 02:10:37,108
[SPEAKER_32]: And those of us that have kids with special needs, we're also very concerned on a different level.

1745
02:10:38,328 --> 02:10:45,210
[SPEAKER_32]: So they might not physically be able to respond if something happens.

1746
02:10:46,306 --> 02:10:47,347
[SPEAKER_32]: What's in place for that?

1747
02:10:48,888 --> 02:10:50,369
[SPEAKER_32]: Will they understand the instruction?

1748
02:10:50,909 --> 02:10:51,790
[SPEAKER_32]: Will there be panic?

1749
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:52,650
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sure there will.

1750
02:10:54,271 --> 02:10:55,112
[SPEAKER_32]: Do they shut down?

1751
02:10:55,492 --> 02:11:02,016
[SPEAKER_32]: So there's a lot of different, I could go on, there are a lot of different angles to come at this for our kids.

1752
02:11:02,957 --> 02:11:05,038
[SPEAKER_32]: Like I said, they're taught about lockdown through games.

1753
02:11:05,658 --> 02:11:10,361
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know this because my child plays it out at home.

1754
02:11:11,522 --> 02:11:12,263
[SPEAKER_32]: He thinks it's fun.

1755
02:11:14,364 --> 02:11:15,705
[SPEAKER_32]: But it's not gonna be fun if it ever

1756
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:21,124
[SPEAKER_32]: if it ever comes to fruition and things need to happen, things need to change.

1757
02:11:22,244 --> 02:11:37,592
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to say that I would like to also talk about a vulnerable population, which are the teachers and the staff that are at the school that don't really have, they might have protocols.

1758
02:11:38,292 --> 02:11:39,853
[SPEAKER_32]: It's clearly not being walked through.

1759
02:11:40,554 --> 02:11:45,196
[SPEAKER_32]: It's clearly not being followed through, especially

1760
02:11:45,782 --> 02:11:48,724
[SPEAKER_32]: the speaker that was before saying there were only two lockdowns at the high school.

1761
02:11:49,565 --> 02:11:59,092
[SPEAKER_32]: My son is at the McGlynn Middle School, so it was kind of a wake-up call when I received the notice through a coworker emailing the news report.

1762
02:12:01,593 --> 02:12:14,623
[SPEAKER_32]: I would say that I would like to be at the table for the conversation that will occur, to speak for all kids, and especially for the vulnerable community that may not understand and may not be able to react as they need to in order to keep themselves safe.

1763
02:12:17,089 --> 02:12:21,172
[SPEAKER_32]: But as a mother, I'm ready to do what is necessary to move this forward.

1764
02:12:21,452 --> 02:12:21,793
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1765
02:12:22,253 --> 02:12:22,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1766
02:12:26,256 --> 02:12:27,437
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1767
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:31,040
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Stacy Nee, and I live on 6th Street in Medford.

1768
02:12:32,782 --> 02:12:36,305
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter is a kindergartner at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1769
02:12:37,123 --> 02:12:41,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's my oldest, so I haven't had that much experience with the schools in Medford.

1770
02:12:41,146 --> 02:12:52,433
[SPEAKER_00]: But fairly quickly, I learned from other parents that there were some concerns around transparency at the schools and with the school administration, and the city at large in some cases.

1771
02:12:53,894 --> 02:12:59,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I am asking the counselors tonight to consider this an opportunity for things to change.

1772
02:13:00,598 --> 02:13:04,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am asking you to be as transparent as possible

1773
02:13:04,741 --> 02:13:16,464
[SPEAKER_00]: with the findings of the police department, with who knew what, when, and any information that can be shared with parents about what happened and what will be done to make sure our kids are safe.

1774
02:13:17,244 --> 02:13:27,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can guarantee that I personally will hold you accountable with my vote, and I will ask the other parents and citizens in this town to do the same.

1775
02:13:28,387 --> 02:13:30,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and I hope that you will do the right thing.

1776
02:13:33,749 --> 02:13:34,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1777
02:13:34,189 --> 02:13:35,370
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1778
02:13:35,710 --> 02:13:35,850
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi.

1779
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:37,031
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Judy McLaughlin.

1780
02:13:37,492 --> 02:13:39,153
[SPEAKER_33]: I am a resident of Medford.

1781
02:13:39,173 --> 02:13:39,953
[SPEAKER_33]: I live in the Heights.

1782
02:13:40,053 --> 02:13:42,135
[SPEAKER_33]: I have two children in Medford Public Schools.

1783
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:48,860
[SPEAKER_33]: My older daughter is a graduate of the McGlynn Middle School, and my younger daughter is currently a student there.

1784
02:13:51,561 --> 02:13:56,345
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to remind everyone that this is not the first time that the security of that building has been compromised.

1785
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:01,228
[SPEAKER_33]: And forgive me if someone has already mentioned this, but I couldn't always hear everybody.

1786
02:14:03,588 --> 02:14:14,018
[SPEAKER_33]: In 2015, an unidentified person made their way into the school, and it became a news item, and I'm sure everyone here, if they didn't remember it already, is now reminded of it.

1787
02:14:15,699 --> 02:14:26,629
[SPEAKER_33]: My older daughter had just started at that school, had been there about three months, and it gave me pause, but I said I'm going to put faith in that this was an oops.

1788
02:14:29,414 --> 02:14:30,535
[SPEAKER_33]: This is not an oops.

1789
02:14:31,496 --> 02:14:32,837
[SPEAKER_33]: This is a big problem.

1790
02:14:34,538 --> 02:14:41,383
[SPEAKER_33]: Mostly because it was a breach of trust, a major breach of trust.

1791
02:14:42,845 --> 02:14:43,926
[SPEAKER_33]: A major breach of trust.

1792
02:14:46,708 --> 02:14:57,056
[SPEAKER_33]: And that we need to do better by our children, by our teachers, and by everyone in that area and in this community.

1793
02:14:58,499 --> 02:15:10,121
[SPEAKER_33]: And as others have said, I hold you all accountable for making sure that this is seen through thoroughly and that there are consequences for people who have failed us.

1794
02:15:11,242 --> 02:15:11,582
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1795
02:15:11,902 --> 02:15:12,202
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1796
02:15:14,062 --> 02:15:14,502
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1797
02:15:14,522 --> 02:15:15,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1798
02:15:16,083 --> 02:15:18,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Viviana Perdomo, Washington street.

1799
02:15:18,503 --> 02:15:21,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I was actually going to point out what she just said.

1800
02:15:21,624 --> 02:15:27,005
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not the first time that the McGlynn has been on the news for a breach of

1801
02:15:27,808 --> 02:15:28,629
[SPEAKER_18]: of security.

1802
02:15:29,289 --> 02:15:42,319
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can't blame, I can't blame the woman that sits in front of our school and tries to make sure that, you know, she keeps our kids safe because she does her best to make sure that our kids are safe.

1803
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:50,526
[SPEAKER_18]: But how much, like, there's other doors, things are opened.

1804
02:15:51,026 --> 02:15:56,570
[SPEAKER_18]: You can go in there, if one door is open, you can go in there and nobody's going to see that you're in there.

1805
02:15:59,586 --> 02:16:04,790
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to make sure, and everybody keeps saying on the news, they just said McGlynn Middle School.

1806
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:06,932
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not just a middle school.

1807
02:16:07,372 --> 02:16:09,073
[SPEAKER_18]: We have preschool kids there.

1808
02:16:09,153 --> 02:16:10,674
[SPEAKER_18]: We have elementary kids there.

1809
02:16:10,715 --> 02:16:12,336
[SPEAKER_18]: We have special need kids there.

1810
02:16:12,696 --> 02:16:15,518
[SPEAKER_18]: We have so many people in that school.

1811
02:16:15,638 --> 02:16:19,661
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not just the middle school kids, and I'm not saying that just because they're older.

1812
02:16:21,977 --> 02:16:23,437
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, they don't matter.

1813
02:16:23,457 --> 02:16:45,822
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm saying that we have the little ones that have no clue what a bullet is and what a, what is it, a magazine is, and you know, they can be playing around with it, and all of a sudden, you know, do something that, I don't know anything about guns, but you know, do something that could probably harm them.

1814
02:16:46,842 --> 02:16:48,043
[SPEAKER_18]: What if a kid got that?

1815
02:16:50,806 --> 02:16:55,108
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be made sure that things like this get reported.

1816
02:16:55,128 --> 02:17:01,572
[SPEAKER_18]: In hospitals, we have code black, we have code blue, we have all these codes.

1817
02:17:01,672 --> 02:17:05,054
[SPEAKER_18]: When you start, I just started a new job at a hospital.

1818
02:17:05,414 --> 02:17:15,399
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to watch a full-blown scenario about a person coming in with a gun and what to do to make sure that we keep our patients safe.

1819
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:18,321
[SPEAKER_18]: So why doesn't our school have that?

1820
02:17:20,615 --> 02:17:25,702
[SPEAKER_18]: It should automatically be taught to every single teacher what to do.

1821
02:17:26,143 --> 02:17:35,997
[SPEAKER_18]: There should be a video or there should be things to show to just teachers and to kids and it should be done yearly.

1822
02:17:37,475 --> 02:17:49,946
[SPEAKER_18]: to show because it doesn't matter because a kid can come there like in the middle of the year or they can come there like, you know, at the, like, they can be starting a new school and they don't know the school.

1823
02:17:50,407 --> 02:17:52,969
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be, it should just be policy.

1824
02:17:53,629 --> 02:17:58,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Make, if you guys don't want to do, you know, mock trainings or mock

1825
02:17:59,764 --> 02:18:04,607
[SPEAKER_18]: mock gun scenes, then you should show a video of what happens.

1826
02:18:04,727 --> 02:18:08,309
[SPEAKER_18]: And hopefully the kids remember, but at least we have something.

1827
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:13,612
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, we gotta remember, these are our kids.

1828
02:18:16,874 --> 02:18:17,234
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1829
02:18:20,616 --> 02:18:22,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1830
02:18:22,517 --> 02:18:24,398
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Betsy Murphy, Mystic Valley Parkway.

1831
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:28,961
[SPEAKER_23]: I can tell there are a lot of emotions

1832
02:18:29,790 --> 02:18:32,451
[SPEAKER_23]: through the parents and the members.

1833
02:18:33,852 --> 02:18:37,094
[SPEAKER_23]: And I get it, and I feel it.

1834
02:18:37,114 --> 02:18:39,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I work for a different district.

1835
02:18:40,115 --> 02:18:44,377
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been through three live shooting scenarios.

1836
02:18:45,558 --> 02:18:47,959
[SPEAKER_23]: They are helpful as a staff member.

1837
02:18:49,019 --> 02:18:51,761
[SPEAKER_23]: My gut tells me Medford is not there.

1838
02:18:52,461 --> 02:18:53,982
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm asking, get there.

1839
02:18:55,242 --> 02:18:55,803
[SPEAKER_23]: Get there.

1840
02:18:57,163 --> 02:18:58,164
[SPEAKER_23]: Train your staff.

1841
02:18:59,687 --> 02:19:03,990
[SPEAKER_23]: There was postings about all of this.

1842
02:19:04,811 --> 02:19:09,194
[SPEAKER_23]: And my response was, now I put my foot in my mouth.

1843
02:19:09,335 --> 02:19:12,797
[SPEAKER_23]: Because no, my response is incorrect in Medford.

1844
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:17,521
[SPEAKER_23]: My response was, support your first responders.

1845
02:19:18,081 --> 02:19:19,242
[SPEAKER_23]: Support your police.

1846
02:19:19,582 --> 02:19:21,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Support your school administration.

1847
02:19:21,424 --> 02:19:25,167
[SPEAKER_23]: I have gone through these trainings.

1848
02:19:25,874 --> 02:19:40,060
[SPEAKER_23]: and there is nothing that you can think of how you would react until you actually hear somebody saying those horrible words in the environment where you work, smelling the gunpowder.

1849
02:19:41,981 --> 02:19:47,104
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been through it three times and it still is upsetting, but I am better going through it.

1850
02:19:47,764 --> 02:19:52,306
[SPEAKER_23]: I will protect kids, adults, and myself better going through it.

1851
02:19:54,355 --> 02:19:56,336
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to guess Medford hasn't had one.

1852
02:19:57,916 --> 02:20:06,018
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's sad, because I ask the council, you want us to send our kids to school on Monday?

1853
02:20:07,539 --> 02:20:09,919
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's a lot of trust that you just lost.

1854
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Because we are all as one.

1855
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:22,123
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether it's the police department, the superintendent, the principal, or the parents, we are all responsible to keep our children safe.

1856
02:20:23,382 --> 02:20:24,543
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have failed.

1857
02:20:25,264 --> 02:20:32,609
[SPEAKER_23]: And if there is a potential person out there that's thinking of doing harm, you just encourage him and said, it worked.

1858
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:36,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Because if he planted that, we didn't get it.

1859
02:20:37,393 --> 02:20:38,814
[SPEAKER_23]: We didn't follow through.

1860
02:20:40,055 --> 02:20:44,179
[SPEAKER_23]: It went weeks without being noticed or correctly reported.

1861
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:49,983
[SPEAKER_23]: So realistically, I have my failings about administration.

1862
02:20:50,003 --> 02:20:51,945
[SPEAKER_23]: I honestly,

1863
02:20:53,004 --> 02:20:54,685
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't even want to waste the time talking about it.

1864
02:20:54,885 --> 02:20:57,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to know, is Medford going to get prepared?

1865
02:20:58,407 --> 02:21:01,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you going to request that we send our kids back to school before you're prepared?

1866
02:21:02,869 --> 02:21:05,171
[SPEAKER_23]: Because that's a big trust that you already lost.

1867
02:21:05,411 --> 02:21:06,371
[SPEAKER_23]: We all lost it.

1868
02:21:08,973 --> 02:21:12,755
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like an answer before Monday to know what you're going to do to keep my daughter safe.

1869
02:21:12,775 --> 02:21:13,455
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1870
02:21:14,375 --> 02:21:14,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1871
02:21:14,796 --> 02:21:15,296
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1872
02:21:19,258 --> 02:21:20,819
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1873
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:27,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, Council President Caviello, honorable counselors, Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford Mass.

1874
02:21:28,143 --> 02:21:30,304
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry for my tiredness this evening.

1875
02:21:30,324 --> 02:21:32,565
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just trying to make some sense of this.

1876
02:21:33,405 --> 02:21:48,273
[SPEAKER_27]: First off, my silent concern back in around the year 2000, after the closing of many neighborhood schools and the opening of the so-called new central schools, was my silent thought to myself,

1877
02:21:49,065 --> 02:21:54,466
[SPEAKER_27]: hope a Columbine never happens here or anywhere.

1878
02:21:56,887 --> 02:22:02,788
[SPEAKER_27]: My understanding is a big boo-boo happened at my wife's school.

1879
02:22:05,669 --> 02:22:10,130
[SPEAKER_27]: Because silence was not golden, are there others?

1880
02:22:11,131 --> 02:22:11,891
[SPEAKER_27]: God only knows.

1881
02:22:14,191 --> 02:22:16,572
[SPEAKER_27]: But hopefully for a silver lining,

1882
02:22:17,492 --> 02:22:21,314
[SPEAKER_27]: especially for you, Counselor Marks, with your children at the high school, if they're still there.

1883
02:22:22,975 --> 02:22:46,769
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully for a silver lining out of all this, after this admitted mistake, with the city budget of 167 point something, million dollars for the year, at least please post a full-time Medford police officer

1884
02:22:47,626 --> 02:22:58,473
[SPEAKER_27]: at Medford High School during business hours, especially in a 1970 building with over 500,000 square feet.

1885
02:23:00,335 --> 02:23:01,595
[SPEAKER_27]: Should have been done long ago.

1886
02:23:03,076 --> 02:23:07,119
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my humble request for a silver lining.

1887
02:23:07,339 --> 02:23:07,679
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1888
02:23:09,261 --> 02:23:11,002
[SPEAKER_26]: All I can suggest to everybody is

1889
02:23:12,295 --> 02:23:13,315
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a meeting on Thursday.

1890
02:23:13,335 --> 02:23:16,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently it's scheduled for the high school.

1891
02:23:18,458 --> 02:23:24,241
[SPEAKER_26]: The purpose of the meeting is to discuss security measures and policies for the Memphis Public Schools.

1892
02:23:25,161 --> 02:23:26,082
[SPEAKER_26]: The school committee's there.

1893
02:23:26,642 --> 02:23:28,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Come out there, make your voices heard.

1894
02:23:28,863 --> 02:23:31,164
[SPEAKER_26]: You came here and your voice is known to us.

1895
02:23:31,844 --> 02:23:33,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Make your voices known to the school committee also.

1896
02:23:35,086 --> 02:23:35,786
[SPEAKER_26]: Council Member Kern.

1897
02:23:36,466 --> 02:23:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on that, I thank Councilor Felco for asking that it be here.

1898
02:23:40,068 --> 02:23:41,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also ask that it be live.

1899
02:23:42,099 --> 02:23:46,023
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently it's here, but until they change it, it's- Well, it's at the school.

1900
02:23:46,323 --> 02:23:53,450
[SPEAKER_02]: We're asking to change it here, but I would further request that it be live for everybody to watch at home, those that can't make it.

1901
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:55,331
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently, it's at the school.

1902
02:23:55,371 --> 02:23:58,114
[SPEAKER_26]: Until it's been changed, it's there.

1903
02:23:58,394 --> 02:24:03,279
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, I ask everybody, you came here, your major concerns, I think everybody knows the concerns.

1904
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:07,983
[SPEAKER_26]: We all say, most of us have children, our grandchildren in the school is here.

1905
02:24:08,644 --> 02:24:08,924
[SPEAKER_26]: I do.

1906
02:24:09,044 --> 02:24:14,086
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think everybody with the exception of comfortable Russo as a children in the school.

1907
02:24:14,126 --> 02:24:22,470
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, make come Thursday, make your feelings known to the people who are going to make the policies and through the chair.

1908
02:24:23,950 --> 02:24:24,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1909
02:24:24,971 --> 02:24:25,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1910
02:24:25,451 --> 02:24:32,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, when, when will people officially know maybe the city clerk where the meeting is going to be?

1911
02:24:32,854 --> 02:24:34,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I strongly feel it should be here.

1912
02:24:35,305 --> 02:24:36,046
[SPEAKER_09]: in these chambers.

1913
02:24:36,146 --> 02:24:38,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it definitely going to be here, or?

1914
02:24:38,487 --> 02:24:39,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's up there.

1915
02:24:39,368 --> 02:24:42,210
[SPEAKER_17]: This committee, the whole meeting, is already been posted.

1916
02:24:43,251 --> 02:24:44,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Posted, all right?

1917
02:24:44,372 --> 02:24:46,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Location, time, and 48-hour notice.

1918
02:24:47,154 --> 02:24:50,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So you just can't change it.

1919
02:24:51,717 --> 02:24:52,478
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information.

1920
02:24:52,498 --> 02:24:54,059
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilman LaGuardia.

1921
02:24:54,099 --> 02:25:01,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the chair to the clerk, there are a number of department heads that change locations of meetings within City Hall, and they just put a posting on the door.

1922
02:25:01,785 --> 02:25:03,806
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a little easier to do, but this is our department.

1923
02:25:03,826 --> 02:25:04,307
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that.

1924
02:25:09,517 --> 02:25:12,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we do a reverse, can we do a reverse 9-1-1?

1925
02:25:12,278 --> 02:25:27,543
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, again, until the... Again, until, there's meeting laws that have... Yeah, we can make a request, but we can't demand where it's gonna go.

1926
02:25:28,583 --> 02:25:33,225
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, at the moment, until they make a change, it's at the high school.

1927
02:25:34,008 --> 02:25:37,689
[SPEAKER_26]: So keep an eye out on the webpages.

1928
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:39,250
[SPEAKER_26]: Superintendent Belson.

1929
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:43,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, members of the council, I want to answer a couple questions that were raised during the discussion.

1930
02:25:43,791 --> 02:25:47,653
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's important that this be public information.

1931
02:25:48,613 --> 02:25:56,296
[SPEAKER_24]: As I indicated earlier, I made the decision, whether it was right or wrong, I made that decision.

1932
02:25:57,436 --> 02:26:02,038
[SPEAKER_24]: I did not inform the school committee or the mayor until Friday.

1933
02:26:03,342 --> 02:26:05,063
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to make sure everyone understands that.

1934
02:26:06,844 --> 02:26:10,506
[SPEAKER_24]: And the police chief and I talked Friday morning, directly.

1935
02:26:11,086 --> 02:26:14,648
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to make sure everyone understands that sequence at this particular point in time.

1936
02:26:15,448 --> 02:26:15,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1937
02:26:16,329 --> 02:26:16,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1938
02:26:16,669 --> 02:26:21,411
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I want to thank everyone for voicing their concerns and everybody who came out there.

1939
02:26:21,451 --> 02:26:22,132
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1940
02:26:23,152 --> 02:26:24,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

1941
02:26:27,494 --> 02:26:27,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry?

1942
02:26:28,435 --> 02:26:30,596
[SPEAKER_26]: There was no paper then.

1943
02:26:34,881 --> 02:26:35,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_26]: Just a regular resolution.

[SPEAKER_26]: Just a regular resolution, okay.

[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

[SPEAKER_26]: We have a... Yes, we have two committee reports this evening that need to be reported out.

1951

[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee has put together a group of key priorities that we'd like to see drafted into an ordinance.

1954

[SPEAKER_14]: Copies of these key priorities have been distributed to the membership as well as the city solicitor.

02:28:07,556 --> 02:28:08,237
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1959
02:28:08,977 --> 02:28:09,698
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1960
02:28:09,718 --> 02:28:13,140
[SPEAKER_26]: And we had one more, Councilor Falco, if you want to report that one out.

1961
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:16,382
[SPEAKER_14]: We did that already.

1962
02:28:16,402 --> 02:28:20,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Regular business.

1963
02:28:21,146 --> 02:28:28,171
[SPEAKER_26]: No, we had a, in the, we had a committee at the whole meeting on the complaints, on open meeting law complaints.

1964
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:28,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh.

1965
02:28:34,824 --> 02:28:35,965
[SPEAKER_26]: We already did that one.

1966
02:28:35,985 --> 02:28:36,305
[SPEAKER_26]: No, we didn't.

1967
02:28:36,425 --> 02:28:37,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we don't do that one?

1968
02:28:37,166 --> 02:28:37,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1969
02:28:37,586 --> 02:28:38,787
[SPEAKER_26]: I thought you said it.

1970
02:28:38,807 --> 02:28:38,887
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

1971
02:28:39,148 --> 02:28:39,908
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, John.

1972
02:28:40,729 --> 02:28:40,809
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

1973
02:28:40,829 --> 02:28:50,597
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a matter earlier tonight, the Committee of the Whole, to review a open meeting law complaint.

1974
02:28:50,858 --> 02:28:55,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And we found that the complaint was not valid.

1975
02:28:57,944 --> 02:28:58,084
[SPEAKER_26]: And?

1976
02:28:59,534 --> 02:29:01,235
[SPEAKER_26]: who will be forwarded to the city solicitor?

1977
02:29:01,315 --> 02:29:08,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and the city solicitor will be writing up a response to the person that made the claim to, I believe, the Attorney General's Office.

1978
02:29:08,217 --> 02:29:08,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1979
02:29:08,657 --> 02:29:09,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

1980
02:29:09,697 --> 02:29:13,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I'd like the record to reflect that I recuse myself from voting on this subject matter.

1981
02:29:13,559 --> 02:29:15,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1982
02:29:15,599 --> 02:29:16,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Counselor De La Russa.

1983
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:21,501
[SPEAKER_25]: I, too, as an accused in the matter, recuse myself.

1984
02:29:21,581 --> 02:29:21,922
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1985
02:29:22,882 --> 02:29:26,023
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion by Counselor Falco, seconded by Counselor Scott Pelli.

1986
02:29:26,583 --> 02:29:27,323
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1987
02:29:27,343 --> 02:29:27,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1988
02:29:28,084 --> 02:29:28,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1989
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,920
[SPEAKER_26]: to vote present.

1990
02:29:33,861 --> 02:29:34,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1991
02:29:34,621 --> 02:29:36,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we have one more, Councilor Falco.

1992
02:29:36,781 --> 02:29:40,942
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, excuse me, Councilor Marks, I'm sorry.

1993
02:29:42,222 --> 02:29:43,623
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Mr. President.

1994
02:29:43,703 --> 02:29:54,365
[SPEAKER_22]: Paper of Council Resolution 17-795 was a proposed amendment to Chapter 94, Article 2, Division 1, relative to the expanded notification of certain public hearings.

1995
02:29:55,065 --> 02:29:56,985
[SPEAKER_22]: We received the response back in our packet,

1996
02:29:57,475 --> 02:30:14,544
[SPEAKER_22]: from the Community Development Board dated February 12th, 2018, and I would ask that a Committee of the Whole meeting be set up to discuss this particular response from Community Development Board, and this be a paper review referred to Committee of the Whole.

1997
02:30:14,744 --> 02:30:15,404
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1998
02:30:15,424 --> 02:30:18,045
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1999
02:30:18,085 --> 02:30:18,706
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2000
02:30:18,726 --> 02:30:20,587
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2001
02:30:20,827 --> 02:30:21,587
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2002
02:30:21,647 --> 02:30:22,087
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President?

2003
02:30:23,528 --> 02:30:24,028
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President?

2004
02:30:24,649 --> 02:30:25,549
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

2005
02:30:25,933 --> 02:30:34,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, we received correspondence from the city solicitor in our packet tonight, dated February 16th, 2018.

2006
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:43,005
[SPEAKER_22]: It's to Mayor Burke from Mark Rumley regarding Council Paper 18041, request for an opinion.

2007
02:30:43,665 --> 02:30:55,133
[SPEAKER_22]: This was, I won't read the whole thing, this was a request of opinion from Council and Knight regarding has the Board of Health exceeded their authority with the regulatory passage of a smoking ban in private clubs?

2008
02:30:55,934 --> 02:31:02,639
[SPEAKER_22]: where an exemption for smoking ban on private clubs is outlined in the city ordinance 58-43.

2009
02:31:02,999 --> 02:31:24,876
[SPEAKER_22]: The correspondence that we received back from the city solicitor stated that he believes that the Board of Health, and I'm not speaking on his behalf, this is how I interpret it, that he believes the Board of Health did exceed their authority in the passage of that smoking ban

2010
02:31:25,356 --> 02:31:28,399
[SPEAKER_22]: and what he refers to membership associations.

2011
02:31:29,259 --> 02:31:46,073
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask that this paper, because we were supposed to be following up on this, be referred either to a committee of the whole or some, be open to a subcommittee, whatever the council feels fit.

2012
02:31:47,133 --> 02:31:50,256
[SPEAKER_22]: And if there's any, I think we have someone that'd like to speak on it tonight.

2013
02:31:50,656 --> 02:31:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Thomas Brennan, 60 Dwyer Circle.

2014
02:31:53,688 --> 02:32:01,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm requesting that the City Council amend the present ordinance, which they worked on with the Board of Health to adopt 10 years ago.

2015
02:32:01,451 --> 02:32:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2004, the state banned smoking in workplace, bars, and restaurants.

2016
02:32:06,053 --> 02:32:13,256
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, you could basically smoke anywhere you want, a bus, a train, a fire station, city hall, hospitals.

2017
02:32:13,816 --> 02:32:17,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds crazy to think that it was a little over 13 years ago.

2018
02:32:18,158 --> 02:32:19,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you ever overturn that rule?

2019
02:32:20,339 --> 02:32:20,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

2020
02:32:25,356 --> 02:32:35,442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because you know it probably saved many, many lives, reduced smoking drastically, and provided the citizens with a better quality of life than they ever had before, although many people were opposed to it at that time.

2021
02:32:37,283 --> 02:32:48,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should the employees or anyone else doing business in a membership organization be subjected to secondhand smoke, which is the largest contributing factor of cancer to non-smoking individuals?

2022
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:54,954
[SPEAKER_04]: In February 2017, notification was sent to all membership organizations that an open meeting was

2023
02:32:55,629 --> 02:32:57,930
[SPEAKER_04]: held at City Hall to discuss proposed changes.

2024
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:00,671
[SPEAKER_04]: People spoke in favor as well as opposition.

2025
02:33:01,291 --> 02:33:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: The Board of Health came to a decision to ban smoking in all facilities to now protect every employee that works anywhere in the city from the deadly effects of secondhand smoke.

2026
02:33:11,514 --> 02:33:22,097
[SPEAKER_04]: The effective date of the regulation was July 10th, 2017, but was extended for six months to allow a moratorium that did not yield any suggested changes or amendments.

2027
02:33:23,578 --> 02:33:23,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me.

2028
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:31,681
[SPEAKER_04]: January 10th, 2018, the Board of Regulations went into effect prohibiting smoking in membership organizations.

2029
02:33:32,281 --> 02:33:36,742
[SPEAKER_04]: All facilities have been smoke-free since, with no violations reported today.

2030
02:33:37,582 --> 02:33:40,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford-Large & Velks got 14 new members since then.

2031
02:33:41,883 --> 02:33:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: At the City Council meeting January 16th, 2018, Councilor Knight requested an opinion of the City Solicitor to find out if the Board of Health had exceeded their authority, which the Council in 2007 recommended

2032
02:33:55,034 --> 02:34:02,476
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Board of Health requested to exempt the membership organization and adopted Ordinance 58-43.

2033
02:34:03,637 --> 02:34:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: The city solicitor agreed with Councilor Knight.

2034
02:34:09,198 --> 02:34:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: The new director of the Board of Health was unaware of that pre-existing ordinance that was in place.

2035
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:19,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Most cities and towns leave it up to the Board of Health to enact regulations.

2036
02:34:20,082 --> 02:34:23,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It is my understanding that this was the only time this happened in the city.

2037
02:34:23,883 --> 02:34:24,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know if I'm correct?

2038
02:34:25,470 --> 02:34:26,771
[SPEAKER_04]: on that or not.

2039
02:34:27,432 --> 02:34:44,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, the question that I asked the city solicitor was because we had an existing ordinance in place that exempted private clubs from the public smoking ban, how could the board of health pass a regulation that would be contrary to the ordinance that the legislative body had passed in 2007?

2040
02:34:45,525 --> 02:34:54,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So my question was whether or not the process and procedure was appropriate and whether or not the board of health had the authority to make the unilateral heavy handed action that they made and they do not.

2041
02:34:54,861 --> 02:34:56,804
[SPEAKER_14]: This issue has to come back to the council.

2042
02:34:56,844 --> 02:35:00,990
[SPEAKER_14]: If we want to allow smoking in private clubs right now, it is authorized.

2043
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:03,534
[SPEAKER_14]: If we want to ban that, that is a matter that has to come before the council.

2044
02:35:03,834 --> 02:35:04,956
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a legislative affair.

2045
02:35:04,996 --> 02:35:07,239
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not something that can be done regulatory, Mr. President.

2046
02:35:07,579 --> 02:35:11,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So my concern was that when this was implemented, it was implemented inappropriately.

2047
02:35:12,529 --> 02:35:20,711
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the city solicitor concurs with my opinion, and I also think that his opinion wasn't requested when the Board of Health went forward and made this action.

2048
02:35:21,651 --> 02:35:35,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in an effort to make sure that everything was done above bar, Mr. President, to be sure that we were in compliance with the law, I asked the question to the solicitor as to whether or not this process was handled appropriately, and whether or not the Board of Health had the authority to do it, because there was an existing statute in place already.

2049
02:35:36,274 --> 02:35:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: He is exactly right on that point.

2050
02:35:39,475 --> 02:35:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you read the paper that's before you,

2051
02:35:42,042 --> 02:35:43,142
[SPEAKER_04]: by the solicitor.

2052
02:35:43,603 --> 02:35:45,823
[SPEAKER_04]: He says that this can easily be overturned.

2053
02:35:47,404 --> 02:35:50,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to move ahead, make a decision on it.

2054
02:35:50,145 --> 02:35:51,845
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he can have this done forthwith.

2055
02:35:53,926 --> 02:35:56,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But moving forward, my opinion, there's a simple solution to this.

2056
02:35:57,748 --> 02:36:00,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We want a better quality of life for all the people who work in this city.

2057
02:36:01,329 --> 02:36:05,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone should have the same rights to be able to work in a safe and healthy environment.

2058
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:10,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask you to stand behind your Board of Health, look out for all employees that work in our city,

2059
02:36:11,024 --> 02:36:14,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them and their families that you are going to do what you were elected to do.

2060
02:36:14,707 --> 02:36:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: This council has said to us before that they are very limited on what they can do.

2061
02:36:19,271 --> 02:36:22,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you have the power and the opportunity to save people's lives.

2062
02:36:22,753 --> 02:36:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not plastic bags, bike paths, or potholes.

2063
02:36:26,416 --> 02:36:28,137
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually saving people's lives.

2064
02:36:29,258 --> 02:36:37,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I took the position as bar manager four years ago when a close friend of mine was unable to continue because he was battling cancer.

2065
02:36:38,065 --> 02:36:39,787
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the place he loved for close to 40 years.

2066
02:36:40,649 --> 02:36:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, he passed away from that 11 months ago.

2067
02:36:45,052 --> 02:36:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: His brother was a bartender, a board member, past exalted ruler, passed away as well due to cancer.

2068
02:36:52,458 --> 02:37:03,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this amendment 5843 was passed in 2007, the Medford-Largevelks alone, just one club, has lost nine members who were employees, seven of them due to cancer.

2069
02:37:04,427 --> 02:37:06,529
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, 2015, we lost a past exalted ruler and a bar manager.

2070
02:37:09,858 --> 02:37:12,060
[SPEAKER_04]: They were 46 and 48 years old.

2071
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:18,805
[SPEAKER_04]: As we speak, a former officer, active member, is hospitalized in the Mass General battling with cancer.

2072
02:37:18,945 --> 02:37:20,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You all know him very well.

2073
02:37:21,287 --> 02:37:24,789
[SPEAKER_04]: On a personal note, this time last year, I was diagnosed with cancer.

2074
02:37:25,229 --> 02:37:30,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately for me, it was caught in time, and I am cancer-free, but I am subject to constant testing.

2075
02:37:31,594 --> 02:37:32,675
[SPEAKER_04]: My life has changed.

2076
02:37:34,116 --> 02:37:37,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Cancer has affected all of us in one way, shape, or form.

2077
02:37:37,679 --> 02:37:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen most of you at

2078
02:37:39,958 --> 02:37:41,639
[SPEAKER_04]: um, cancer fundraisers.

2079
02:37:42,199 --> 02:37:50,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The Granada family trust over the past 10 years has raised over a million dollars to help fight and reduce pancreatic cancer.

2080
02:37:50,663 --> 02:37:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of you have been at these fundraisers, taking pictures with the family and commended them in this council chamber on their work.

2081
02:37:58,787 --> 02:38:02,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer.

2082
02:38:03,789 --> 02:38:06,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Scientists estimate one in four cases are caused by this.

2083
02:38:07,748 --> 02:38:12,969
[SPEAKER_04]: If you truly believe in this cause and support them, you will help them in this fight tonight.

2084
02:38:14,610 --> 02:38:30,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking as an employee of the city of Medford, 21 years ago, just like you did two months ago, we raised our right hands and made an oath to the city clerk, Ed Finn, to protect and serve all the citizens of the city of Medford and look out for everyone's best interest.

2085
02:38:31,414 --> 02:38:33,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the numbers don't lie.

2086
02:38:33,574 --> 02:38:34,675
[SPEAKER_04]: The facts don't change.

2087
02:38:35,035 --> 02:38:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: The Board of Health has done their homework.

2088
02:38:37,591 --> 02:38:49,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, as a council did 10 years ago, stand behind the Board of Health and partially repair the ordinance to include the membership associations in the smoking prohibition.

2089
02:38:49,498 --> 02:38:50,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple solution.

2090
02:38:51,259 --> 02:38:51,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2091
02:38:51,559 --> 02:38:52,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can do that tonight.

2092
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:53,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2093
02:38:53,638 --> 02:38:59,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out nothing in our ordinance requires private clubs to allow smoking.

2094
02:38:59,842 --> 02:39:07,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And the exemption only exempts private clubs from the public smoking ban, but it doesn't say that they don't have the ability to police themselves either.

2095
02:39:08,688 --> 02:39:13,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So I certainly understand Firefighter Brennan's, Captain Brennan's position on the issue.

2096
02:39:13,411 --> 02:39:15,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't particularly care for smoking in places either.

2097
02:39:16,353 --> 02:39:23,137
[SPEAKER_14]: However, my concern when I brought the question forward was whether or not it was handled appropriately and whether or not it was done within a fashion that was in the scope of their authority.

2098
02:39:24,636 --> 02:39:25,336
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

2099
02:39:25,977 --> 02:39:26,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2100
02:39:27,558 --> 02:39:39,925
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, in the spirit of cooperation, uh, as part of paper 18 0 dash, uh, 0 4 1, there was a B paper and I had a re recent discussion after the city solicitor issued his opinion.

2101
02:39:40,465 --> 02:39:48,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And if anyone recalls the B paper was requesting that, uh, these particular service clubs, or if you want to refer to them as membership associations,

2102
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:52,885
[SPEAKER_22]: have a dedicated smoking area and we asked that as a B paper.

2103
02:39:53,626 --> 02:40:01,336
[SPEAKER_22]: In my discussion with the city solicitor, he thought it would be wise to put some language within our city ordinance

2104
02:40:01,989 --> 02:40:11,314
[SPEAKER_22]: is requesting that member associations have an alternative, which would be a dedicated smoking area within their facility.

2105
02:40:11,994 --> 02:40:18,437
[SPEAKER_22]: And as Councilor Knight mentioned, that would be up to the membership to decide where, when, and if they want to do it.

2106
02:40:18,857 --> 02:40:23,820
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think that's appropriate that we have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss this issue.

2107
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:26,561
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a matter of crafting really a sentence

2108
02:40:26,949 --> 02:40:31,111
[SPEAKER_22]: of language into the city ordinance of 58-43.

2109
02:40:31,591 --> 02:40:37,733
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think it would, in my opinion, solve all problems for members that feel they have the right to smoke.

2110
02:40:38,093 --> 02:40:42,195
[SPEAKER_22]: And they do have the right to smoke, in my opinion, but in a dedicated area.

2111
02:40:42,635 --> 02:40:46,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Like any other establishment, we all have workplaces.

2112
02:40:46,376 --> 02:40:48,097
[SPEAKER_22]: There's areas even here at City Hall.

2113
02:40:48,437 --> 02:40:50,197
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't smoke anywhere around the building.

2114
02:40:50,457 --> 02:40:52,318
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't even smoke outside the doors.

2115
02:40:52,618 --> 02:40:59,179
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a dedicated area across about 30 feet from City Hall where is the dedicated smoking area.

2116
02:40:59,499 --> 02:41:03,840
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that would suit well for Captain Brennan and some of the concerns he raises.

2117
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:06,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Those numbers that he's mentioning are alarming.

2118
02:41:07,241 --> 02:41:12,062
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's only one particular establishment they're alarming of the number of cases of cancer.

2119
02:41:12,698 --> 02:41:14,900
[SPEAKER_22]: and people that frequent these particular areas.

2120
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:28,728
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would ask that this correspondence from the mayor be sent to a committee of the whole meeting and to discuss the dedicated smoking area and membership associations.

2121
02:41:28,908 --> 02:41:32,150
[SPEAKER_04]: This was also brought up at the Board of Health meeting.

2122
02:41:33,251 --> 02:41:39,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people that were in opposition of banning it altogether were in favor of that actual thing happening.

2123
02:41:40,370 --> 02:41:51,315
[SPEAKER_04]: The situation that we look at right now is the clubs or the membership organizations are basically turning into smoking clubs, losing more and more people.

2124
02:41:51,895 --> 02:41:54,417
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that don't smoke don't come to these clubs.

2125
02:41:54,477 --> 02:41:56,237
[SPEAKER_04]: The veterans aren't coming to these clubs.

2126
02:41:56,598 --> 02:42:01,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The veterans that have served 20 years to today are not going to these clubs.

2127
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're looking to do is turn that around.

2128
02:42:04,301 --> 02:42:07,943
[SPEAKER_04]: When you serve four years in the service and you've gone overseas,

2129
02:42:08,730 --> 02:42:15,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've served your country, you want to come back to a veterans organization and be able to hang with people that are dealing with the same thing as you.

2130
02:42:15,794 --> 02:42:19,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is the solution to start building up the membership of these clubs.

2131
02:42:20,816 --> 02:42:21,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2132
02:42:21,317 --> 02:42:21,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2133
02:42:22,577 --> 02:42:31,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I would also ask that as far as I know, I know the city solicitor did an opinion, but as far as I know, these particular organizations in the community,

2134
02:42:32,426 --> 02:42:48,438
[SPEAKER_22]: have not received any formal correspondence from the city, whether it's the Board of Health or from the city clerk's office, and I think it's only appropriate to let them know what the opinion is, and if truly they are allowed to smoke now in the building, they should be aware of that.

2135
02:42:49,719 --> 02:42:57,825
[SPEAKER_22]: And it'll be up to the council to get together on this and try and iron out something that's amendable to all parties.

2136
02:42:58,445 --> 02:42:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion.

2137
02:42:59,386 --> 02:43:00,707
[SPEAKER_04]: A question on that right now is,

2138
02:43:01,348 --> 02:43:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: The decision was made on Friday, I believe, the paper went out?

2139
02:43:06,530 --> 02:43:09,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We got this from February 16th from the city solicitor's opinion.

2140
02:43:09,751 --> 02:43:10,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, which is Friday.

2141
02:43:10,811 --> 02:43:14,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this actually overturned, or is it still implemented, the smoking ban?

2142
02:43:18,673 --> 02:43:24,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, but he's more or less saying if you were stopping people from smoking there now, you can't do that according to his opinion.

2143
02:43:24,655 --> 02:43:25,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, which we stopped on Monday.

2144
02:43:25,996 --> 02:43:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We just decided.

2145
02:43:27,596 --> 02:43:30,637
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to make sure that everything was on the right page.

2146
02:43:30,919 --> 02:43:33,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, and it's important that all the service organizations know that.

2147
02:43:33,441 --> 02:43:36,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Are aware of that, right, that you can now smoke back in your facility.

2148
02:43:36,103 --> 02:43:37,043
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we can solve this.

2149
02:43:37,123 --> 02:43:41,606
[SPEAKER_22]: I think with the Committee of the Whole meeting, get all the parties together, I think it's common sense.

2150
02:43:41,646 --> 02:43:48,111
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happened is, over the past almost two months, people are realizing that this is a much healthier environment.

2151
02:43:48,171 --> 02:43:50,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like you said, you don't smoke in your house.

2152
02:43:50,192 --> 02:43:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't smoke here in City Hall.

2153
02:43:51,733 --> 02:43:55,356
[SPEAKER_04]: In the military, where everybody smokes, you can't smoke in any buildings.

2154
02:43:55,896 --> 02:43:58,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the right thing to do.

2155
02:43:59,312 --> 02:43:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

2156
02:44:00,493 --> 02:44:02,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Committee to the whole, it's possible.

2157
02:44:02,436 --> 02:44:07,060
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight that we send this to the committee to the whole.

2158
02:44:08,202 --> 02:44:08,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

2159
02:44:09,203 --> 02:44:09,443
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

2160
02:44:09,463 --> 02:44:10,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2161
02:44:11,005 --> 02:44:12,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for your attention.

2162
02:44:12,727 --> 02:44:15,490
[SPEAKER_27]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street Method Mass.

2163
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:18,693
[SPEAKER_27]: Smoking is a very nasty habit.

2164
02:44:20,014 --> 02:44:21,296
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a very addictive drug.

2165
02:44:23,243 --> 02:44:32,631
[SPEAKER_27]: However, the government seems to have a nasty habit of also putting their nose in private people's business, such as private clubs like the VFW, American Legion.

2166
02:44:32,991 --> 02:44:36,374
[SPEAKER_27]: If it wasn't for these organizations, we'd be speaking German in this country.

2167
02:44:40,278 --> 02:44:50,927
[SPEAKER_27]: Smokers deserve a place where they can call themselves lepers instead of be chewing on some cinnamon stick here.

2168
02:44:51,823 --> 02:44:55,885
[SPEAKER_27]: and respecting people's rights to keep the smoke away from their face.

2169
02:44:57,386 --> 02:44:59,107
[SPEAKER_27]: Most people are considerate of their smokers.

2170
02:45:00,168 --> 02:45:05,050
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not saying maybe we should go as far as I told my VFW people.

2171
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:07,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Ban cigars and pipes.

2172
02:45:08,652 --> 02:45:09,613
[SPEAKER_27]: That's overpowering.

2173
02:45:10,273 --> 02:45:11,554
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I'm a fair person.

2174
02:45:11,614 --> 02:45:13,335
[SPEAKER_27]: I use common sense most of the time.

2175
02:45:15,676 --> 02:45:19,178
[SPEAKER_27]: But it doesn't affect me because as W.C.

2176
02:45:19,218 --> 02:45:20,939
[SPEAKER_27]: Fields says, there are loopholes.

2177
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:23,221
[SPEAKER_27]: And I seem to have found a few.

2178
02:45:24,201 --> 02:45:32,465
[SPEAKER_27]: However, some people that are upset at Mr. Counselor Knight's club, for example, when they're shooting the game of pool, they can't smoke.

2179
02:45:33,025 --> 02:45:37,648
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe they're going somewhere else, or at the fireman's club, this and that.

2180
02:45:38,548 --> 02:45:40,849
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not that smart with information.

2181
02:45:41,749 --> 02:45:43,370
[SPEAKER_27]: But there are loopholes.

2182
02:45:43,971 --> 02:45:44,711
[SPEAKER_27]: But the point is,

2183
02:45:46,527 --> 02:46:03,812
[SPEAKER_27]: The private entity should have the opportunity to vote amongst themselves, whether they're World War II, 98-year-old veterans, or from one of the other 100 wars that we've been into as teenagers today.

2184
02:46:06,312 --> 02:46:11,614
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe even the leper deserves a spot away from society.

2185
02:46:13,154 --> 02:46:14,956
[SPEAKER_27]: and I'll take one less shower per week.

2186
02:46:15,636 --> 02:46:17,318
[SPEAKER_27]: There'll be less pollution in your world.

2187
02:46:18,179 --> 02:46:18,579
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2188
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,642
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Monk, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2189
02:46:22,143 --> 02:46:22,823
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2190
02:46:22,843 --> 02:46:22,903
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2191
02:46:23,804 --> 02:46:24,925
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2192
02:46:28,789 --> 02:46:29,129
[SPEAKER_26]: Records.

2193
02:46:31,553 --> 02:46:36,195
[SPEAKER_26]: Records of the meeting of February 6th were passed to Counselor Marks.

2194
02:46:36,395 --> 02:46:38,675
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Marks, how did you find those records?

2195
02:46:38,835 --> 02:46:41,856
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been neglecting my duties, Mr. President, even more.

2196
02:46:42,477 --> 02:46:45,098
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Marks needs another week, he's been derelict in his duties.

2197
02:46:46,018 --> 02:46:49,939
[SPEAKER_26]: The records of the meeting of February 12th were passed to Counselor Scott Pelley.

2198
02:46:49,959 --> 02:46:51,240
[SPEAKER_26]: Were you derelict in your duties?

2199
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:52,320
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sir.

2200
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:53,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Scott Pelley, good job.

2201
02:46:53,760 --> 02:46:57,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, I find the records in order to approve them.

2202
02:46:57,962 --> 02:46:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

2203
02:46:58,812 --> 02:47:01,396
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli.

2204
02:47:02,677 --> 02:47:05,061
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a long night, it's not a long night.

2205
02:47:05,621 --> 02:47:07,224
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2206
02:47:07,284 --> 02:47:08,025
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

2207
02:47:09,146 --> 02:47:11,109
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Falco to adjourn.

2208
02:47:11,169 --> 02:47:12,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2209
02:47:12,511 --> 02:47:13,171
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

2210
02:47:13,973 --> 02:47:15,394
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
