[SPEAKER_06]: Please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I, Pledge of Allegiance.

20
00:00:55,249 --> 00:01:06,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I was called by Councilor Caraviello today to inform me of his absence due to ill health.

21
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:11,872
[SPEAKER_06]: 15-091 offered by Councilor Penta.

22
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:18,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council establish a citizen street recovery program.

23
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:32,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, um, I think during this past winter season, we've all seen, um, the problems that exist not only here in the city of Medford, but out throughout the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

25
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:44,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, and after speaking with the folks at the, uh, Massachusetts department of transportation and going online and reviewing some things across the country, as it relates to

26
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:54,222
[SPEAKER_03]: streets and neighborhoods, sidewalks, curbs, and a whole host of things, where the money might be coming from.

27
00:01:55,422 --> 00:02:09,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And after noticing that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just had this new identification program implemented, asking people on any state roadways, if you see something that's dangerous, please take a picture, send it in, and identify a particular location.

28
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It gave me the idea that here in the city of Medford, it doesn't take a genius to figure this out.

29
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:28,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Just drive down any street in the city of Medford and you have potholes all over the place and desperate need to be filled, you know, potential damage just waiting to happen on any car or truck that may be driving down the street.

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:38,767
[SPEAKER_03]: But that also leads to another host of issues as it relates to the good weather and the good times and how are we going to handle certain things such as

31
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:49,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, viruses that seem to be emanating, um, from certain drains and soil systems, um, as the West Nile virus has presented itself.

32
00:02:50,338 --> 00:03:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ran a survey last year of the 351 cities and towns, um, for which 229 of them responded on a major road survey.

33
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:07,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, and I don't know why the city of Medford did not respond to this.

34
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:22,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was in regards to Chapter 90 roadway funds that could be used for local communities had they sent in a description of what their needs might be for Chapter 90 roadway needs.

35
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:31,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes especially in light of the fact that this administration, Governor's administration, Charlie Baker, has made a commitment to Chapter 90 roadway funding.

36
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, where the city of Medford falls in this, I don't know.

37
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:40,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do the survey, and the survey methodology wasn't complete.

38
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:43,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It was complete for 229 cities and towns.

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We have here in the city of Medford a brand new building for which we are spending approximately $15 million for a new Department of Public Works building.

40
00:03:52,987 --> 00:04:05,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that Department of Public Works building, it would be hoped that we would have the men, the equipment, and the wherewithal to handle all the things necessary to look at our streets here in the city of Medford

41
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:12,826
[SPEAKER_03]: and as we continue to go forward and into the future, making our city better than what it has been and what it could be.

42
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:31,272
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of that, I'm going to be asking in a two-part layered program that if anybody out there, whether you're on your own street or you see a city street, private way, and you have a concern because of a pothole, take the picture of it.

43
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:33,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the picture of it, ID it,

44
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: send it in to the city clerk's office or the Department of Public Works, where you would at least get a, hopefully a system would be set up.

45
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:51,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You would get something that would be timed, dated and stamped and identified as to where the location might be.

46
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: This could also be representative of if your street is in desperate need of repair.

47
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also in regards to when NSTAR and any other utility comes into the community, digs up a street,

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And six months or a year after the fact, there's a big concave in the ground.

49
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,221
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hole in the ground.

50
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And that hasn't been addressed, and it doesn't take place.

51
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:13,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And that turns out to be a hole in the street.

52
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:27,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you're asking the taxpayers of this community to recognize $15 million is now being put into a new public works building, I think you should also be asking that issues such as this need to be addressed.

53
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And they shouldn't be put on a burner saying, we don't have enough money to do it.

54
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:31,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the equipment.

55
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,236
[SPEAKER_03]: or we don't have the men to do it.

56
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:40,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to stop looking at where we're going with this type of rehabilitation that's needed here in the city of Medford.

57
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: A most recent law passed by the state legislature will now allow sewer systems and drainage systems to have lava sides be placed into their drainage systems.

58
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Lava sides would be something that will be able to address Westphalia

59
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:02,145
[SPEAKER_03]: West Nile virus and any other potential that might be out there that has been out there.

60
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:27,381
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, um, that has not been allowed because of, I believe the pesticide content that might be, have an environmental impact, but because of this inbreeding and the extension or the acceleration of, of West Nile virus and other, and other issues related to that, um, this year, um, department of public works, um, and city engineers, um, will be allowed to use lavisides into these particular locations.

61
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We have in excess of $6.5 million in free cash.

62
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:39,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that approximately $1 million of that money would be used to get into this city restoration street program.

63
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:46,974
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that some monies may not be all, but some monies will be coming back from the federal government because of these storms.

64
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:51,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's a two-phase application from MEMA.

65
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, I believe

66
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:07,193
[SPEAKER_03]: The state administration feels comfortable approximately 35% of that, if not more, will be forthcoming on the first round, not knowing if they're going to accept the second round, having it to be identified as an emergency.

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully it will be identified.

68
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:14,015
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time in many, many years the weather has done what it has to the Northeast region in the area.

69
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:20,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking that into consideration and also recognizing that the new MS-4 permit that we talked about last week

70
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,492
[SPEAKER_03]: is now a real bone of contention.

71
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:48,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a meeting last week up on Beacon Hill, where the Mass Water Resource, not MWRA, the Mass Water Resource Association, which comprised about six individuals that deal with water and sewage and drainage and EPA requirements, are on board with this because they know that the cost, which is going to be anywhere from $800,000 plus per each community to implement an MS4 system,

72
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:54,850
[SPEAKER_03]: is also going to have an impact on roadways and sidewalks and streets, curbings and machinery.

73
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:10,835
[SPEAKER_03]: They're asking not only for a delay to this, but they're also asking, as we had asked last week, our city engineer, to ask a pushback in an educational program for educating not only our community, but all the communities, of what this is going to entail and the cost impact.

74
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We know also on an annual basis that we have approximately a million dollars or thereabouts that comes back each and every year

75
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: on our budget because of expenditures that don't take place, excise tax revenues, and a whole host of other things.

76
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:32,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think our commitment should be upfront relative to doing the streets and the potholes and doing them correctly.

77
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:47,430
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ways of doing it rather than just getting a shovel and taking it off the back of the truck and throwing it into a hole and let somebody drive over it, as compared to taking the time, putting it down, pounding it in, and making sure it's going to stay there for a reasonable period of time.

78
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Some streets are going to just need to be done completely all over.

79
00:08:51,470 --> 00:09:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the things, and I think this council has addressed it on numerous occasions, we keep giving licenses to NSTAR for whether it's gas or electric, whatever the diggings of the streets might be up.

80
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:07,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe we have a $10,000, I think that's it, Mr. Clark, isn't it a $10,000 bond that they have to put up?

81
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:10,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really need to start holding these accountable.

82
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:15,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the last time that one of the utilities came here, we asked that it go back in six months.

83
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, we were going to take that money.

84
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:30,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the mechanisms, we have the avenues to do this, but I think this not only bodes well for our community, I think it puts ourselves in the right direction, because all the streets in our city are in desperate need of repair, and some shape, manner, and form.

85
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:46,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So in essence, in a nutshell, it basically is asking any person in the community to go out there, whatever you see that you might think is a hazard, take the picture of it, or if you don't wanna take the picture and you can't, make a phone call, either to the clerk's office or the highway department, and hopefully they'll set up some kind of

86
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:51,185
[SPEAKER_03]: a situation where you call on a particular day, you get a number, and that's it.

87
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to the highway department, and they start addressing that this spring.

88
00:09:54,846 --> 00:10:12,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a shame to have the city administration say, we don't either have the equipment or the personnel to handle this, because that's not what they voted for when they voted for a $15 million building to upgrade the Department of Public Works, who claimed, or the city claimed, hasn't been upgraded in years, and they were working in a substandard building.

89
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,675
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to understand that if we're going to be paying monies to upgrade buildings

90
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,089
[SPEAKER_03]: and refurbish them or whatever we need to do.

91
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have the equipment, the men and the tools to go with it, to handle what our city needs might be.

92
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:30,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move the question, ask for a roll call vote and welcome any opportunity for comments.

93
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:31,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, councilor.

94
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,095
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an excellent resolution.

95
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:44,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, if I just may briefly comment in thanking you for bringing this up and also pointing out that, uh,

96
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:55,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about this so many times before, and I'm glad you're keeping this on the forefront, because it's appropriate for this time of year.

97
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:06,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Lungo-Koehn, I believe it was, Vice President, had the resolution not too long ago for the 311 system to be enacted quickly.

98
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta for approval, Councilor Camuso?

99
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

100
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up.

101
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I'm a little bit saddened that the administration didn't pursue participating in the survey, which may have told the state what our needs were.

102
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:34,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes the state uses this type of data when it comes to funding purposes for cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth.

103
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:40,422
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, I'm not surprised that he just let it sit on a disc or go on a shredder or whatever.

104
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:54,339
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, I do support this this evening, and I'm not gonna tell Councilor Penta what to do, but I'd like to make that, if you make the motion, I'd support it, the million dollars out of certified free cash to repair the roadways throughout our community.

105
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're gonna bring that up?

106
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanna do that now?

107
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd second that.

108
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,743
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended by Councilor Penta, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

109
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:06,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That a million dollars be taken out of free cash.

110
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:07,725
[SPEAKER_07]: To repair the roadways.

111
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:28,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, as I said earlier, I'd just like to commend the councilor as well as Councilor Lungo-Koehn for being forward thinking with the 311 system that she brought up a little while ago that this council supported because these are tools that the administration could use if they wanted to.

112
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:38,603
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're talking about an administration that doesn't have a fire department that has email throughout the entire department, picks and chooses who has it, as well as an administration that doesn't have voicemail.

113
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So, certainly, I'm not that surprised.

114
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:42,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

115
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So, on the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

116
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:54,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

117
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a technical glitch.

118
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

119
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:00,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

120
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up.

121
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:31,676
[SPEAKER_00]: like my other colleagues have mentioned, sounds very similar to the 311 system that this council has voted on three or four times over the last year with the department of public works building being redone for millions and millions of dollars with personnel, you know, we have the personnel, the staff that I truly feel that the 311 system is completely necessary and it sounds very similar to the citizens street recovery program because the 311 system

122
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:48,367
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand from Somerville, that number one, emails and concerns and questions that are brought up and brought to the City of Somerville, DPW, have something to do with streets, sidewalks, and potholes.

123
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the right time to do it.

124
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,732
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show our residents

125
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:59,054
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're responding to each and every issue that arises.

126
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:02,855
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just keep telling residents, we'll put it on a list, we'll put it on a list.

127
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where's the list?

128
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:04,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on the list?

129
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:05,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's first?

130
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:06,957
[SPEAKER_00]: First come, first serve.

131
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:08,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We need accountability.

132
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:09,898
[SPEAKER_00]: We need responsiveness.

133
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:19,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents need an avenue, whether it's a street recovery program and the 311 system or the 311 system.

134
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:23,843
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be put into place, especially with a state of the art facility.

135
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with Council Penta.

136
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:42,290
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'd like to amend actually is to ask, is the state, do we have any word, does the administration have any word from the state on if we're going to get any state aid with regards to the plowing, um, snow and ice removal costs or the pothole costs?

137
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:46,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a few years ago we got state aid with regards to the snow and ice removal.

138
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:50,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year we got state aid with regards to the potholes.

139
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:55,441
[SPEAKER_00]: repair in potholes because it can get very expensive and it is so needed.

140
00:14:55,901 --> 00:15:01,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it up last week with regards to potholes, asking the dpw when are we going to start repairing them.

141
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:07,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start getting liability claims within the legal department for busted tires, screwed up cars.

142
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,769
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a safety issue.

143
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:14,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to know if the state plans on, if we have any word if we're going to get any state aid.

144
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:19,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just like to second the approval of this and also

145
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:26,487
[SPEAKER_00]: that we send it to the mayor, that the 311 system should be implemented immediately.

146
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:34,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I've learned from anybody, I've learned from Council Penta, you keep bringing something up when it's important, just like the condom shell should have lighting.

147
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:40,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's off subject, but you keep bringing it up when things are important, and that's the avenue this council has, to keep speaking on it.

148
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:42,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that our residents deserve.

149
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,285
[SPEAKER_00]: They deserve to make a phone call, to say there's a pothole somewhere and somebody's gonna get hurt or a car's gonna get damaged,

150
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:56,413
[SPEAKER_00]: They deserve a confirmation number, and they deserve to know when it's going to be repaired and, you know, how quickly it's going to be repaired.

151
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,495
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people pay taxes for.

152
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville has that program, and we deserve it here, too.

153
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:02,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

154
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: On that matter, from my understanding, the first — Point of information, counsel.

155
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:09,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

156
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

157
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,506
[SPEAKER_03]: There were four snowstorms that we're dealing with.

158
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:18,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what the state is trying to do is put the first three in together because of its closeness in time and calling that the major storm.

159
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,423
[SPEAKER_03]: If, in fact, that goes through, a larger portion of federal monies will come back to the state.

160
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:29,185
[SPEAKER_03]: If they take them separately or individually, it'll be a lesser portion, and each will have to be argued.

161
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,126
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two avenues.

162
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

163
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,767
[SPEAKER_03]: One is for snow, and one is for potholes.

164
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:35,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a priority.

165
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:40,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the second priority on the agenda of the Baker administration, so I'm quite sure you're going to see something come out of this.

166
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,430
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see some action.

167
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

168
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:43,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Penter and my colleagues for speaking on this important issue.

170
00:16:49,169 --> 00:17:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is very similar to the crosswalks that we ask to be painted every year, basic city services that are not being done in the community.

171
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:13,199
[SPEAKER_02]: The request that Councilor Longo, myself, and other members have offered with the 311 system is just a reporting mechanism that allows people by electronic device.

172
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that, Mr. President.

173
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, you can use an electronic device to report something.

174
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to pick up the phone and reach out and listen to the mayor's 10-minute message board on what department to contact.

175
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:35,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, the mayor is about three quarters of the way into the recorded message.

176
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:45,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to listen to 20 other departments before you get to quote the mayor's office to issue a concern or request, Mr. President.

177
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:48,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that quite amazing in this community.

178
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:51,603
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the state is already out filling potholes.

179
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:57,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it on the Fells Way in the Wellington area, and we should be no different.

180
00:17:57,706 --> 00:18:09,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize that this is not the ideal time to fill potholes, but it's imperative that we get out there right now and fill these holes, have a tracking mechanism.

181
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Councilor Penta, whether it's sending an email or using your iPhone, there has to be a tracking mechanism that the city can log these requests in,

182
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:26,452
[SPEAKER_02]: and get back to residents in a timely fashion on whether or not their problem has any type of resolution.

183
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:34,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, Mr. President, is the city of Boston, as well as Somerville and Cambridge, they know how to involve the community.

184
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: What better than having 58,000 sets of eyes out in the community saying, hey, you know what?

185
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pothole on this street.

186
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one at the corner.

187
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one next to the sewer on High Street.

188
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:47,565
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one next to the catch basin on Main Street.

189
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,204
[SPEAKER_02]: What better than to have 58,000 reporters out there letting you know where the problem is?

190
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:57,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I would welcome that.

191
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:02,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, you know, I know it's a daunting task, but I would welcome that type of information.

192
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our community, it's frowned upon.

193
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,755
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they make it so difficult.

194
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:13,624
[SPEAKER_02]: to report in this community that people say, you know what, forget about it.

195
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:19,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what you're seeing on our streets and our roads is the years of the forget-about-its.

196
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:21,768
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't calling in anymore.

197
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:22,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's not worth it.

198
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:24,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get no response.

199
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think this is long overdue, Mr. President.

200
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:37,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3-1-1 system, you know, I believe, as was mentioned, some of us has had this in their community, I think, for 12 or 15 years.

201
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:39,954
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even longer.

202
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:46,060
[SPEAKER_02]: There was initial startup costs like any good program, but now it's worth its weight in gold.

203
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:56,952
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of complaints they receive and the number of calls that are adjudicated within a timely fashion speaks volumes to how city government should operate.

204
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shouldn't be the

205
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:10,839
[SPEAKER_02]: constant phone calls, because even during the storm, and I brought this up, Mr. President, residents would call me and say, I don't want to call you in particular, I just want to know how do I get a hold of someone?

206
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:16,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be 5 o'clock on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning, but I still need to get someone.

207
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:21,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the tough task of trying to put them in touch with someone that can assist.

208
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think these are the things that the mayor needs to move forward.

209
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked the mayor about having on the phone some type of mechanism where you can leave a phone call, a message.

210
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,410
[SPEAKER_02]: There is none of that at City Hall.

211
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone's not in their office, and many of these offices, as we know, are understaffed,

212
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may not be someone there.

213
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:56,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor rather the phone ring 7,000 times and no one pick it up than someone be able to leave a phone message to the appropriate department.

214
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how this city works for some reason.

215
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:09,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, but I wholeheartedly support this resolution, the motion that was offered by Councilor Longo a few weeks ago.

216
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:14,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, Mr. President, as I've done in the last couple of weeks,

217
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:24,523
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the issues that we should take to budget, and when the mayor says, hey, I need all your vote, I need all your vote for the budget, we sit down and say, yes, Mr. Mayor, you'll get that in due time.

218
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:30,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And that time is when you start working on some of the issues that's going to help this community move forward.

219
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:34,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them is the 311 system, Mr. President.

220
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel strongly about that.

221
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We also received

222
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,792
[SPEAKER_02]: through a request I had on the equipment that DPW has.

223
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:58,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we all know there's going to be a new yacht, and I was flabbergasted to see the equipment that we have currently right now with no plans to update, with a brand-new state-of-the-art facility coming in, and equipment that's 25, 30, 35 years old, Mr. President, in this community.

224
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:18,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's nice to get value out of your property, but at some point, it becomes an old piece of rust, and it's no longer valuable, and it ends up sitting behind the DPW yard, or in back of the police department, or a lot of other locations in this community.

225
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there needs to be a capital improvement plan.

226
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:30,733
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be something done in this community, and I hope the mayor takes this not only under advisement, but acts upon it, Mr. President.

227
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,495
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Penter as amended, Councilor Knight.

228
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:37,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

229
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Penter, for filing this resolution.

230
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel as though it's a good idea.

231
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime that we can take steps to connect people with government and ensure that government works for them is a good thing.

232
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:52,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So I certainly will be supporting this endeavor.

233
00:22:53,684 --> 00:23:00,768
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I would like to amend the paper by way of a B paper, Mr. President, because I think that it's safe to say that

234
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:08,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the state of our side streets is so that they can't be traveled down as frequently as they have been when no snow has been on them.

235
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:10,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So the wear and tear on our main roads has become excessive.

236
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:16,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That coupled with the fact that we've done a good amount of snow removal on those roads has really torn them up.

237
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:26,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to see what the cost would be, Mr. President, maybe an estimate from the city engineer explaining to us what the cost would be to resurface all of the emergency arteries in the city.

238
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:39,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, asking that the city engineer and the DPW commissioner report back to this council on a cost estimate as to what the price would be to actually resurface from curb to curb each emergency artery in this community.

239
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:44,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

240
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:45,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

241
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

242
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:50,842
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor has a wonderful asset, too, in his office.

243
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know Stephanie Muccini-Burke, who was a stalwart as a councilor, and she was all about accountability.

244
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:05,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the mayor can't figure this out, he can just reach across his office and maybe ask her to bring some of her leadership thoughts forward on this particular issue.

245
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:14,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as I said, we all know that she was all about holding people accountable when she was a city councillor, and she brings so much to that office.

246
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:24,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So if he can't figure it out, maybe he can get some of his staff to maybe look into the 311 or some type of similar product that may be out there.

247
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:26,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

248
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:28,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

249
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Naylor, maybe I'm confused.

250
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about side streets or off main streets?

251
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:44,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying our emergency arteries, the dedicated emergency arteries that we have here in the community have been, you know, beat on because of the high volume of travel and the high volume of heavy equipment that's been on it.

252
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all falling apart as well.

253
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:51,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a reporting mechanism here for people to report back whether or not they see something wrong on their street.

254
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:53,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it might also be important for us to,

255
00:24:53,743 --> 00:25:04,872
[SPEAKER_04]: actually get an estimate of the cost to resurface all those roadways that are in disrepair, so that when someone's coming into Medford from the city of Somerville, they can't tell they've entered Medford because of the way that the street feels.

256
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got no problem with that.

257
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:09,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd like to just divide that into two parts.

258
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:14,180
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one, we've had construction companies and utility companies dig up our streets.

259
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:23,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the cost has to be attributed to them, and maybe we should, again, getting back to, as compared to the legitimate cost of a city street, maybe just break it down in two ways.

260
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That which and how the city's been dug up, it's caused the problem.

261
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:33,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's a legitimate city street that we own outright with no other interference from an outside vendor, be it an instar or a contractor, so be it.

262
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we'll get a better handle of what the true cost would be.

263
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I mean, I don't think that the price is going to be the price.

264
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:46,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can always go back and subrogate against whoever we do feel as though is responsible for it to get a collection of our money back in that regard.

265
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have main street and four different sections of main street are broken up, one's national grid, one's, you know, and star and the other one is the city.

266
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do four different construction projects.

267
00:25:55,301 --> 00:26:08,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to end up in the same exact situation that we'd be in if we had the key to this effort will be in the city's enforcing the contracts and the ordinances with these, uh, with these outside vendors.

268
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:09,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the key.

269
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:12,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other part of the key is going back to a council of marks of literature,

270
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:22,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we're building this new building, and we don't have the equipment, and we don't have the men, or whatever it might be, we probably need to be looking at something that's going to cost us a few more dollars.

271
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:23,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what our free cash is for.

272
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,318
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have a special machine that's called a pothole pounder.

273
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:28,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone's ever seen it.

274
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out of the Midwestern part of the country.

275
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they do is they go up and down the streets, and in the middle of the truck, where

276
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:42,986
[SPEAKER_03]: where the hot tub is, it's hot, it goes into the ground, and then the pound, it just goes down, ba-boom, ba-boom, like that.

277
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:43,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's perfect.

278
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes ba-boom, ba-boom.

279
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It pounds itself right in.

280
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:52,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might cost a few thousand, $100,000, a couple of hundred thousand, whatever it might be.

281
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're looking at the long-term effect of this.

282
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the whole thing is.

283
00:26:57,813 --> 00:26:58,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not looking for 10.

284
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right, we could borrow it to see how it works.

285
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion, we'll take the B paper first.

286
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: for the city engineer to give to the city councilor a cost estimate for resurfacing the emergency arteries into our main streets of the city of Medford.

287
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that B paper, all those in favor?

288
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

289
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,931
[SPEAKER_06]: A roll call has been requested on the B paper.

290
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, if you would call the roll.

291
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:36,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

302
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:48,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

303
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,717
[SPEAKER_06]: A vote of six in the affirmative, one absence.

304
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:53,039
[SPEAKER_06]: The B paper passes.

305
00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:02,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the main motion, as amended, offered by Councilor Penta, again, a roll call vote has been requested for this.

306
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,304
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

307
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:05,745
[SPEAKER_07]: This includes the million dollars

308
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,564
[SPEAKER_06]: including the request for a million dollars from free gas.

309
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:12,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso?

310
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:12,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

311
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:14,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello?

312
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:14,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

313
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:15,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

314
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:15,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

315
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:17,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

316
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:18,247
Yes.

317
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:19,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

318
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:19,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

319
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta?

320
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:21,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

321
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:23,049
[SPEAKER_05]: President De La Russa?

322
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:23,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

323
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,872
[SPEAKER_06]: With a vote of six in the affirmative and one absent, the main motion carries.

324
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion of Councilor Knight.

325
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: to take papers in the hands of the clerk offered by Councilors Knight and Caraviello.

326
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:54,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deepest condolences to the family of World War II veteran Herbert Clark on his recent passing.

327
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

328
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:57,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

329
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my pleasure to bring this resolution forward.

330
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:02,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an opportunity to speak with Councilor Caraviello

331
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:06,217
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier this evening and he was very regretful that he wasn't able to make it.

332
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:14,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clark was actually waked this evening down at Gaffey Funeral Home and he's a great gentleman, a World War II veteran who was

333
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,003
[SPEAKER_04]: on foreign soil in Germany during that great clash, Mr. President.

334
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:24,566
[SPEAKER_04]: He raised 10 children here in the city of Medford, and he will be sadly missed.

335
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:29,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known Mr. Clark for a number of years, although we hadn't been in touch since I gave up my paper route.

336
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,391
[SPEAKER_04]: He lived around the corner from me.

337
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:36,917
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was a gentleman, he was a great man, a great family man, raised a great family, served his country well, and he will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

338
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:40,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask that this meeting this evening be adjourned in his honor.

339
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

340
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:44,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you would, I'll stand for a moment of silence.

341
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:57,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

342
00:29:58,094 --> 00:30:19,778
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension, I'd like to, if my council colleagues don't mind, I think a report of all the transfers internally that have taken place from July 1st up to say February, the end of February, would give us a good idea on where the mayor's transferring money within the budget and will prepare us to start looking at next year's budget.

343
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:24,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we know, the only transfers that need to come before the council, if it's for a totally

344
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:26,849
[SPEAKER_07]: different line item.

345
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:33,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's so many transfers that take place on a daily if not weekly basis within the departments.

346
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:41,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should have a good picture because we know that there's positions within the budget right now that have been funded that still have no one in the position.

347
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:43,773
[SPEAKER_07]: DPW director is one.

348
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:53,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over $100,000 a year job and the individual is being paid three days a week because it's a part-time so-called contract employee.

349
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:54,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a retiree.

350
00:30:54,867 --> 00:31:02,432
[SPEAKER_07]: that's currently doing the job rather than the, um, so, so I'd like to see where that money for that salary has went.

351
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:19,803
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, if we could ask the administration by the way of a resolve to provide us with all transfers that have taken place amongst, um, all the departments internally, and most of this will be the DPW, we'll be doing it from one line item to another line item that may have went to the overtime line item.

352
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:22,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's incumbent upon us to look at that as we get ready to, uh,

353
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:28,641
[SPEAKER_07]: to come into budget time so we can actually have a realistic look on where the mayor is moving the money around.

354
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:31,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to get a roll call vote on that.

355
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:37,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso, a roll call has been requested.

356
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:39,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

357
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

358
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:47,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great proactive approach for us to prepare for budget debates that are going to be coming up in very short order.

359
00:31:48,456 --> 00:32:00,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that being said, on a similar focus, I think it may be important, Mr. President, for the Assessor's Office to report back to us whether collections are keeping up with forecasted revenues, Mr. President.

360
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:05,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to see a contrast between current collections and projected revenues to date.

361
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:11,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as amended, that this paper be sent to the Assessor's Office and the Office of Budget and Finance.

362
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:12,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

363
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:19,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could also ask for the other report that we get, where exactly we are financially six months plus into the year.

364
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to get a report every month.

365
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,531
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been seeing that.

366
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:26,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think we need a clear picture to realize how much money is being moved around.

367
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:31,283
[SPEAKER_07]: internally, because there may be areas that the mayor may want to add a line item.

368
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:34,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, instead of moving the money around every year, maybe I want to do this or do that.

369
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:45,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And realistically, that's when we can look at it and see if we think there should be a reduction in the line item, an addition in the line item, because we're not seeing those transfers that take place during the year.

370
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:54,289
[SPEAKER_07]: The only transfers we technically usually see are the major ones that come to us June 20th, June 26th for moving major money around.

371
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But for instance, the police

372
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,281
[SPEAKER_07]: overtime budget.

373
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:03,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that that's close to in the arrears, if not in the arrears, and they have to fund it some way.

374
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's another line item somewhere within the budget that they would allocate money from.

375
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this would be a very good tool for all of us.

376
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we may want to ask for this again in like three months.

377
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:22,081
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd like to put the last day of February as a date because those are transfers that have already taken place and we can actually see it.

378
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:25,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe at the end of this month we'll ask for another one and another one.

379
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:33,420
[SPEAKER_07]: because I'm sure there's areas within the budget that are underfunded or overfunded that funds are being allocated from different line items.

380
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion as amended, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

381
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:41,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

382
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:41,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

383
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:49,845
[SPEAKER_05]: With the vote of six in the affirmative and one absent.

384
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:57,528
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

385
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:03,251
[SPEAKER_06]: May I just make one brief comment?

386
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:10,695
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's worked hard in this past month and worked full-time, in fact, overtime, it's been Paul Geer, Councilor Penta.

387
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:17,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a point of, just a point of correction.

388
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:24,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in, and when I gave my comments regarding the street recovery program, it was the Mass Municipal Association that ran

389
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:29,247
[SPEAKER_03]: the survey for the Commonwealth of Mass of the 229 cities and towns.

390
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:33,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have missaid that wrong, but that's, that's who did it.

391
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to let you know.

392
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:39,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they presented their chapter 90 budget because of the input that mass municipal gave to the state.

393
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:40,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they presented it.

394
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:41,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

395
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that, um, that, uh, correction Councilor.

396
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:52,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we're on suspension, before we return to regular business, I just want to announce that I'm calling for a committee of the whole meeting next Wednesday, March 18th,

397
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:59,389
[SPEAKER_06]: from 6 to 7 30 in the council office to deal with the issue of the opiate addiction.

398
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:10,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've reached out to people that are tied into that and we'll meet and it will be a beginning in dealing with this issue.

399
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:13,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

400
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming to you.

401
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:20,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

402
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:21,226
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're under suspension,

403
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, over the last several days, I received a number of phone calls and emails from, uh, particularly residents in salt method, uh, that are concerned about, uh, the resident permit parking, uh, or I should say lack of resident permit parking that's happening in the community.

404
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:47,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mentioned to many of the residents that called me that, uh, the chief of police is looking into, uh, permit parking, resident permit parking citywide.

405
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, he said within the next year or two,

406
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,041
[SPEAKER_02]: They will probably come out with some type of plan.

407
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Mr. President, we need immediate attention to this issue.

408
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:04,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And we not only need immediate attention, we need to look at sector parking.

409
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:12,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, as we all know, when area residents on their street want permit parking, they have to get together a petition.

410
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: If 51 percent of the residents sign it, it goes before the Traffic Commission, and then the Traffic Commission will vote it up or down.

411
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,329
[SPEAKER_02]: whether that street will have permit parking.

412
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only good for that street.

413
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:35,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I happen to live on Yield Street and want to park on the next street over that are both permit parking streets, I can only park on my street.

414
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:47,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, the issue, particularly in these snow times, is that there may be 20 spots with 50 residents that have permit parking that are looking to get spots.

415
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:54,899
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, sector parking makes sense if you wanted to break it down by precinct or by ward.

416
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:17,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've also had people mentioned, well, the reason why we started permit parking was that if I live close to, uh, just say the West Medford train center, uh, the commuter rail and people from other parts of the city or even outside the city want to use the commuter rail, uh, they can park on my street and take the commuter rail and stay there for eight hours.

417
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have one permit citywide, the same will be the case.

418
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:30,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have someone from North Method that comes down into West Method, parks there all day under his permit sticker, and takes the training.

419
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it does make sense to have sector parking out there.

420
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:44,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would eliminate a lot of the issues with people maybe from other areas parking for a particular reason in other neighborhoods.

421
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But something needs to be done immediately

422
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: to resolve this issue.

423
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not getting any better.

424
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:56,576
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking program that the mayor put in place has a lot of faults.

425
00:37:57,076 --> 00:38:08,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them, Mr. President, is the fact that after hours, on weekends, the only way you get permit parking enforced is by calling the police department.

426
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the system we went away from when supposing this new parking program was coming into effect.

427
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be on an add need basis.

428
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:24,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So residents shouldn't need to call to get basic enforcement of resident permit parking streets.

429
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you petitioned the traffic commission.

430
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the enforcement should be there.

431
00:38:29,882 --> 00:38:32,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, something needs to be done.

432
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:39,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask that we take a vote on this council asking that, uh, the chief of police make this a priority.

433
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:45,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's busy with a lot of issues, but, uh, you know, with this parking program, there should have been more involvement.

434
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:51,989
[SPEAKER_02]: and more input from the community regarding resident permit parking and how it's going to work throughout this community.

435
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Because clearly right now, it's dysfunctional.

436
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:09,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And at best, it functions on occasion and by phone call into the police department or into park method, which, in my opinion, is unacceptable.

437
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Residents shouldn't be required to make phone calls.

438
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President,

439
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:30,741
[SPEAKER_02]: that the chief of police report back to this council when he will start his process for revamping permit parking in this community and also to take into consideration sector permit parking.

440
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:35,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifty minutes ago, he informed me that that is his priority.

441
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:38,686
[SPEAKER_06]: On motion of Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

442
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

443
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I did speak to you before the meeting.

444
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he mention when?

445
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:47,130
[SPEAKER_00]: about how long with regards to the sector parking?

446
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he mention a couple weeks?

447
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that they've begun the discussions and they're working on it.

448
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:56,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's something that he's aware of and is working on.

449
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:04,785
[SPEAKER_06]: He's done, as we know, he's been forced to deal with all the issues around all of this parking.

450
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:06,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's been the point person on it.

451
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, people who, no matter what perspective they have,

452
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:24,784
[SPEAKER_06]: on what's unfolded before us regarding the parking program have been unanimous in my experience on one thing, that he is handling this in an outstanding way.

453
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:33,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have no reason to believe that he'll do nothing less in the coming weeks as this unfolds.

454
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

455
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,932
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, I did also get

456
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:45,126
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of phone calls and emails today and yesterday with regards to just the issues people are having.

457
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:52,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, the calls for me came from South Medford and the hillside where it's, you know, obviously more thickly settled.

458
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:59,058
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a real issue when there's 40 or so cars on a street that only can fit 30.

459
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:07,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Some even, some homes that are on corners where people are so used to, they have the permit and they're so used to just parking

460
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,184
[SPEAKER_00]: on the next street over, and they're getting ticketed and tagged.

461
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:17,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that needs to be looked at immediately, not two, three, four weeks down the line.

462
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:31,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we cease tickets to those people that have permits that are parking on a street over due to lack of parking on their street, or I just don't think the waiting game is what we can tell these residents who are getting ticketed and tagged.

463
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:37,530
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would ask the chief to look into possibly having his officers, especially on the overnight basis,

464
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:56,861
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody has a permit and has a permit for Yale Street and is parking on the street over, that they lighten up on actually ticketing until something is in place, whether that's two weeks, three weeks, a month, or longer to implement sector parking like Councilor Mark had mentioned.

465
00:41:57,402 --> 00:42:03,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that needs to be looked into, it needs to be discussed, and it needs to possibly be implemented sooner than later.

466
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:08,544
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't live in South Medford, but I have in the past.

467
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:16,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I couldn't park on my street, the obvious thing is, especially if I have a permit, I would feel like I'd have the right to park on the next street over.

468
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,934
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's definitely something that needs to be tossed around and discussed and possibly implemented.

469
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:23,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

470
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:31,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of a main motion of council mocks as amended by vice-president Lugo current Councilor Penta, I yelled to the lady at the podium.

471
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:34,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor, the lady at the podium.

472
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Please state your name and address for the record.

473
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:36,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

474
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:38,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

475
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:41,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respectfully disagree with you, Mr. Delarusso.

476
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:47,465
[SPEAKER_01]: The person who has been the point person for the parking program has been the chief of police, not the mayor.

477
00:42:48,185 --> 00:42:48,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

478
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:49,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say the chief of police?

479
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:50,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

480
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, then I apologize wholeheartedly to you.

481
00:42:56,107 --> 00:43:01,849
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say that we do have a city that I've talked to people in Wellington, and they have relatives in North Medford.

482
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:05,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a city that's kind of divided by sections or segments.

483
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:13,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And the folks that live in North Medford aren't as thrilled about the parking permit program, because they don't have as many problems with it.

484
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:28,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thought that they might get ticketed, or have to shuffle things around, or have to pay for a permit parking pass, they're not as thrilled about it as the people who need relief, like the people in South Medford, West Medford near the commuter rail, or Wellington near Wellington Circle.

485
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:31,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to put that out there,

486
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:34,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to have to be a joint effort.

487
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,715
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to apologize then, because I misheard you.

488
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad I misheard you.

489
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:39,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

490
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:40,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

491
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, ma'am.

492
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:43,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

493
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:50,360
[SPEAKER_03]: On that subject matter, I believe it was one of the topics that was brought up today at the Traffic Commission meeting this afternoon.

494
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make a request on these boards and these commission meetings, just as an aside.

495
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:58,843
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people who would have liked to have attended, but they can't go at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

496
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:11,561
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, either that or televise it or what have you, but to have it in an afternoon and knowing how important of an issue this is, and now as it is escalating into another part of the issue.

497
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:29,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, from last week to this week, once again, I happened to, again, have contact with people, especially in the West Method area, and I think they were the majority of the people at the meeting today, voicing not only their concerns but their objections to this whole kiosk program and how it's hurting their business.

498
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they can say whatever they want when the mayor makes the comment, he hasn't received one complaint.

499
00:44:35,158 --> 00:44:43,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they know that that's not true because either they've either called or they couldn't get through or that's nothing but good PR for what he wants to believe.

500
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:59,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as of March 5th of this week, and once again, we have pitches of this wonderful Republic truck from Tennessee going out and according to page 11 of the contract, it states in

501
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:04,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Operator's Vehicles Part B, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent stops.

502
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:08,207
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no sign indicating frequent stops.

503
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:21,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, each and every week, this has been going on since January, what does it take for this company, more importantly, what does it take for this man to understand that this company from Tennessee is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing?

504
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:28,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not honoring the contract, and it's not working out to the best of abilities for everybody.

505
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:33,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks, you asked, I think it was two weeks ago, when does 8-6 start?

506
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody gotten that answer yet?

507
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:36,582
[SPEAKER_03]: They passed it today.

508
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:38,804
[SPEAKER_03]: So 8-6 becomes effective when?

509
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:45,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that's the case, then when does the three-hour parking in the municipal lots go up?

510
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And when do all the signs that are bolted to the trees around the city, when do those things change?

511
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:55,436
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a whole host of issues that revolve around this, and I'm not so

512
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say it again, and as I said it before, I just think the whole thing is anti-business.

513
00:45:59,954 --> 00:46:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it serves any purpose of doing anything to enhance business here in the city of Medford.

514
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,421
[SPEAKER_03]: The complaints are just too numerous.

515
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:15,488
[SPEAKER_03]: One lady in particular, unfortunately, two weeks ago or thereabouts, if not longer, falling down, trying to put money in a kiosk, getting rushed to a hospital.

516
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: They parking in front of meters and hydrants, they can violate the law and they have to be told not to.

517
00:46:21,768 --> 00:46:23,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, you're right, Gene, you have to tell the chief.

518
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:24,950
[SPEAKER_03]: The chief has to go and tell them.

519
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,472
[SPEAKER_03]: These people know what the rules are and whatever it might be.

520
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:34,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're getting pretty close to the point that I think I probably would be moving pretty soon that we just end this contract.

521
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:48,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the best approximately $900,000 this city could spend to get rid of this company and then stick your head to the grindstone and figure out an enforcement program that makes sense here in the city of Medford, hiring people on a part-time basis,

522
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:50,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people would acknowledge that.

523
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, and the alternative, as Councilor Camuso, you alluded to it in the beginning, if they put meters out there in the beginning, people would have understood it.

524
00:46:57,674 --> 00:47:00,555
[SPEAKER_03]: They would understand seeing a meter, putting the money in the meter, and so be it.

525
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:02,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's too discombobulated.

526
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:04,035
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no uniformity.

527
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:10,697
[SPEAKER_03]: When they thought they were going to make a clean killing on Playstead Road from people from Winchester parking all day there for $5 a day,

528
00:47:11,507 --> 00:47:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nobody there.

529
00:47:12,267 --> 00:47:13,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one car.

530
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:14,508
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nobody there.

531
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever they thought they were going to accomplish, they're not accomplishing.

532
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And changing from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6, it's 12 hours a week.

533
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:23,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 48 hours a month.

534
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:24,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

535
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I was Republican, I'd be running out of town and saying, hey, this isn't worth it for me.

536
00:47:29,315 --> 00:47:30,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

537
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my comment as an aside to what you folks talked about right now.

538
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's obvious.

539
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the problems continue to exist.

540
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: with the McGlynn Traffic Enforcement Program, it's just not working.

541
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:44,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

542
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:45,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

543
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

544
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the situation that we're seeing down off of Yale Street and Berwick and Benton and Bradford is really a failure of the street-by-street permitting system.

545
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: If I live on Bradford Road and I have a permit to park on that road and, you know, you're only allowed to park on one side of the street,

546
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:15,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, say, 20 spots, but there's 50 cars on Bradford Road, 50 cars with permits to park on Bradford Road.

547
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't park on Bradford Road.

548
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:19,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Where am I going to go?

549
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to the next street over.

550
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:22,973
[SPEAKER_04]: However, that street's permitted for residents that just live on that street.

551
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time I find a parking spot, I'm going to be down in Alexander's, walking all the way up the street to Main and Ovid.

552
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:36,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the street-by-street permitting system that we have in place is not appropriate.

553
00:48:37,690 --> 00:49:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: situations like this highlighted, that coupled with the fact that it's been brought to my attention, and I'm doing some research to figure out if it's the case, is that Bradford, Benton, and Berwick historically were granted a variance to be allowed to park along Yale as well as Bradford, Berwick, and Benton when the permitting parking went into place some four years ago down there.

554
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Republic

555
00:49:05,004 --> 00:49:08,966
[SPEAKER_04]: is tasked with the job of enforcing our current ordinance.

556
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:17,471
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had an ordinance that's on place, and because of the lack of enforcement, we're now seeing a lot of the problems that are coming up, Mr. President.

557
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:31,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's very important to note to the individuals that right now are in a situation where they're going to get tickets, and they're going to continue to get tickets, that they need to go before the Traffic Commission and petition for a variance to be allowed to park on Boynton or Yale Street

558
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: The chief is well aware of the situation.

559
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,520
[SPEAKER_04]: The commission is well aware of the situation.

560
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And the members of this council are working towards a resolve as evident by the discussion that we're having here this evening, Mr. President.

561
00:49:42,203 --> 00:49:52,729
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I think that one of the things that we're seeing is a number of abuses that are coming out of renters in these streets with visitor's parking permits.

562
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:54,890
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not registering their car in Massachusetts.

563
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have five people living in a small apartment.

564
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,414
[SPEAKER_04]: They're registering three cars in Medford getting three

565
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,773
[SPEAKER_04]: resident parking permits and two visitor passes.

566
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:17,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So on a street that has 48 spots, not in a snow emergency, that's taken down to 20 spots in a snow emergency on one side of the road for 50 cars, and then of those 50 cars, we're seeing another 10 of them with visitor passes.

567
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's creating a real, real problem, Mr. President.

568
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:24,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I certainly commend the work of Councilor Marksley on this.

569
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to do my part.

570
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:34,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to talk to the chief as well and see if we can't find out whether or not this variance is available for the residents that live down there on what I've referred to as the three B's.

571
00:50:35,377 --> 00:50:37,018
[SPEAKER_04]: off of Yale Street at this point in time.

572
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:41,499
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really think that going forward, this is something that needs to be considered.

573
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,620
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good policy.

574
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to break it down by ward.

575
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:58,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to break it down by ward and precinct, for that matter, if, in fact, we have concerns about people coming from the north part of the city and parking at the train station, or people going from the west part of the city and parking close to the bus to get the bus.

576
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:04,468
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really think that this is just an example of how the street-by-street permitting system can fail.

577
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:08,180
[SPEAKER_04]: because it just pushes the problem to the next street, and to the next street, and to the next street.

578
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:14,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have folks that are in a situation where they're going to have to take a taxi from their car, where they parked, to get to their house.

579
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:27,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like a report back from the Traffic Commission, and I've already made this request privately, as to whether or not there is a variance or a grandfathered exemption for the three Bs off of Yale Street.

580
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:30,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.

581
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,917
[SPEAKER_07]: not on this after we dispose of this, just announcement.

582
00:51:34,277 --> 00:51:37,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

583
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

584
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:51,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of the issue that I failed to mention was that, uh, prior to this new parking program, uh, residents that got resident permit parking, uh, permits would put a sticker on their windshield.

585
00:51:52,288 --> 00:51:59,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you lived on a street, you'd be able to see on the street who had a resident permit parking and who was parked illegal.

586
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they did away with the stickers, so if you need to call in and say, you know, this person's illegal on the street, there's no indication now.

587
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a huge concern.

588
00:52:12,288 --> 00:52:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the weekends and at nights, if your street's packed with cars, you're not gonna be able to look for a sticker anymore.

589
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:26,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to know because the cars go by that do the vehicle identification reading by the plates, and they can tell if you have a sticker or not.

590
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really wipes away

591
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:34,739
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that activity from residents that can call in and say, Hey, these particular cars are parked illegal.

592
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an issue that wasn't well thought out.

593
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I know the intention was all, uh, uh, well-purposed, uh, doing away with stickers.

594
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, you know, if, if the enforcement's not out there and residents want to call, what do they call on?

595
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:51,249
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no indication anymore.

596
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing that,

597
00:52:53,749 --> 00:53:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: When the chief gets together, and I have every faith and confidence in the chief, and I know the chief will involve the community, he'll involve the business districts, he'll involve everyone and come to a consensus, unlike some other people in this community that came to the consensus dealing with their three or four department heads and had no involvement at all.

598
00:53:19,828 --> 00:53:22,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I know whatever the Chief does, it'll be well thought out.

599
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just ask that this take place quicker than later, Mr. President.

600
00:53:29,935 --> 00:53:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the main motion as amended, offered by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

601
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

602
00:53:35,598 --> 00:53:36,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta?

603
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:38,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick.

604
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,543
[SPEAKER_03]: You just alluded to the word consensus, and I just want to highlight the fact that I thank you for bringing that up.

605
00:53:44,364 --> 00:53:46,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Mayor of Boston should be complimented.

606
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:55,520
[SPEAKER_03]: for him asking the citizens of Boston and anyone what their thoughts might be for the expansion or the upgrading of the City Hall Plaza down there.

607
00:53:56,081 --> 00:53:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just a great way to get people involved when you do that.

608
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:02,506
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shame that that doesn't take place in this community.

609
00:54:03,147 --> 00:54:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And this administration is so close-knit on everything that they do.

610
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been nothing that talks about, nothing that talks about complete community interaction.

611
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you for bringing that up.

612
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:14,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope, you know,

613
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:22,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be interesting if we put a budget item, a line item in the budget for community expansion by way of advertising.

614
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:34,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So when something comes up of a great magnitude, the people of this community, everyone will be notified in advance and they'll have a chance to participate rather than the clothes shop that apparently operates right now in a vacuum.

615
00:54:35,144 --> 00:54:35,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a vacuum.

616
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:36,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

617
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:36,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

618
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:39,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of a Councilor,

619
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:44,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Marks, as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Marks.

620
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

621
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

622
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:47,179
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

623
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

624
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

625
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

626
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,681
[SPEAKER_07]: If I just may, I'd like to make a community announcement.

627
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

628
00:54:55,761 --> 00:55:05,862
[SPEAKER_07]: This Thursday, Mayor McGlynn, in conjunction with Senator Markey, as well as Representative Catherine Clark, will be holding a fundraiser for the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Garden.

629
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:07,623
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be this Thursday, March 12, 2015,

630
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:11,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be from 5.30 p.m.

631
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,169
[SPEAKER_07]: to 7.30 p.m.

632
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,229
[SPEAKER_07]: at 200 Rivers Edge Drive.

633
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:16,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $50 per person.

634
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:21,231
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone that can't make it that would like to participate financially can do so at medford.org.

635
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:31,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first 200 donors will get a copy of Bill Brett's, who's a famous photographer in the Boston area, new book, Boston Irish.

636
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So the mayor, I got to give him a compliment for this.

637
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:37,114
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing a nice job in the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

638
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:44,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is for the upkeep of the garden after the construction has taken place.

639
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:45,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

640
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:47,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that important announcement.

641
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:52,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso to revert back to the regular order of business, all those in favour?

642
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:53,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

643
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:57,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Petitions, presentations and similar matters.

644
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:02,996
[SPEAKER_06]: 15-092 petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford

645
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:06,680
[SPEAKER_06]: to address the, uh, council on people's forum.

646
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:29,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, before I begin, uh, uh, it was, uh, the dish, this was a bit of an edit to the, uh, petition that was submitted to the clerk because I would imagine it mentions people's names and because it does so, um, uh, in a, in a manner that might not be consistent, that isn't consistent with the rules of the city council.

647
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:32,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to rule that this petition is out of order.

648
00:56:33,142 --> 00:56:47,070
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, as it, uh, uh, isn't, uh, consistent with, uh, uh, the manner of I've removed the name, sir, and I have gone into a different direction with this petition.

649
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:57,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take this opportunity to remind you, uh, to, uh, in your remarks to, uh, do so in a manner that, uh, isn't disparaging of others.

650
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:58,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, sir.

651
00:56:58,757 --> 00:57:01,118
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could please state your name and address for the record.

652
00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:04,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield, Medford Mass.

653
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:12,276
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a reverse 911 or a CTY connect about the People's Forum every week.

654
00:57:12,436 --> 00:57:21,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I think every week this city needs a topic of discussion that is brought to the attention of the public prior to a council meeting.

655
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:27,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I look behind me and there are five other people in the room in a city of 57,000.

656
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:27,688
[SPEAKER_08]: That's staggering.

657
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:34,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is the community involvement?

658
00:57:36,976 --> 00:57:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the duty of this council because it is the people's forum, and the people are making an investment they might not be aware of.

659
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:53,806
[SPEAKER_08]: The ratepayers are putting about 200 grand into the broadcasts, or cablecasts, sorry, the cablecasts, and the salaries of the city councilors.

660
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,109
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an investment by the public.

661
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:01,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we have a lot of topics in the city, and some great topics were brought up tonight.

662
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:09,090
[SPEAKER_08]: The potholes, the chevalier, cable bills, empty storefronts.

663
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:13,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an opportunity for the city to come together.

664
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:17,497
[SPEAKER_08]: There has to be more than six people in attendance.

665
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:22,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's disrespectful to the city council to not have an audience that's vibrant.

666
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:31,367
[SPEAKER_08]: The drug issue is very important, and last week we saw that the people came up here and discussed that.

667
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:48,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important that the public have an opportunity to speak, the council listen, and then after all the public has had its voice heard, then the council can bring in all the points of information that they want to.

668
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:58,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But my goal here tonight is to foster more public discussion with the public because you councils are hearing it.

669
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:02,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You're hearing all the compliments, you're hearing all the complaints.

670
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:08,777
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get that into a forum where it's on a fixed media, and then maybe it goes onto the internet.

671
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:15,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if we don't have an access station right now, we take the government channel and we put that on Made in Medford.

672
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's basically what I wanted to say today.

673
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:31,368
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could use Captain Clementi's Reverse 911, or CTY Connect, whatever they call it these days, to bring one issue a week, one issue a week to the attention of the city,

674
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:36,300
[SPEAKER_08]: where people know they can come and speak on that issue, skating rinks, sports.

675
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would do a lot for you city councilors.

676
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would do a lot for the community.

677
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:45,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is basically the gist of what I had to say.

678
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:48,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, sir.

679
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:54,612
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion of council night that the people be received him.

680
00:59:58,075 --> 00:59:58,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question.

681
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:05,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

682
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:08,850
[SPEAKER_03]: You used the term, if we could do it and put it on Maiden Medford.

683
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:10,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Maiden Medford?

684
01:00:10,271 --> 01:00:10,771
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

685
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:13,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Maiden Medford is one of Comcast's platforms.

686
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:24,796
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, they have the Every Block platform, and they have this Maiden Medford platform, which was supposed to be an addition to public access, which is in six cities in the country.

687
01:00:25,536 --> 01:00:28,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is considered the test site, but in St.

688
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:29,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Petersburg and

689
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:39,718
[SPEAKER_08]: five other communities, they have a full Made in Medford site, which is Comcast trying to satisfy the FCC because they purchased NBC.

690
01:00:40,398 --> 01:00:48,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they purchased NBC, they had to make a deal with the FCC to supplement public access where it wasn't happening.

691
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:57,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So Medford is one of those cities where it wasn't happening, although the former TV station was bragging, saying, hey, look, we're one of the only ones in the country because we're doing such a great job.

692
01:00:57,732 --> 01:01:03,655
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they were doing a poor job, and in order to satisfy the FCC, Comcast had to give us something else.

693
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:12,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that's on the web, and as many of you know, there is a unit you can buy at stores to access the web and not have cable or satellite.

694
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:20,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know people that are already employing this device, where they get Hulu, they get the NFL, and it is all going there.

695
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It is all going to go there, and I think it's going to happen sooner than later.

696
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:25,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a prediction.

697
01:01:25,773 --> 01:01:33,079
[SPEAKER_08]: three and a half to four years, you're going to see people buying their programming from these Internet sites, and cable knows this.

698
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So, a la carte is certainly the way it's going to go.

699
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:46,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Public access will have a voice there, but how it fits in and if it will cluster, we don't know.

700
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:50,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But to answer your question, this Maiden Medford thing is

701
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:52,438
[SPEAKER_08]: something Mayor McGlynn brought in.

702
01:01:52,478 --> 01:01:53,439
[SPEAKER_08]: He was very proud of it.

703
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,440
[SPEAKER_08]: He got his FaceTime on all those commercials, and he used it liberally.

704
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was during a campaign time, too, but, you know, the point is, it's for the people, Your Honor.

705
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:05,702
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't for you.

706
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:09,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And you should have had just John Q. Public that had never been on TV.

707
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:15,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Not me, not anyone in this room, but people from out there that have never been on TV before.

708
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:20,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's introduce them to public access, because outreach is what is missing

709
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:26,422
[SPEAKER_08]: from the component that City Hall is obligated to give the public outreach.

710
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:28,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And this mayor has not done it.

711
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:31,283
[SPEAKER_08]: He has not told us what Maiden Medford is.

712
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:34,064
[SPEAKER_08]: He has not told us that we have an access TV station.

713
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:35,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for asking.

714
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:45,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I could, while the gentleman was up there before he leaves, you referred to every block.

715
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:49,770
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also a tool where residents can communicate with

716
01:02:50,860 --> 01:03:00,765
[SPEAKER_08]: It's difficult because it's an app for your phone, but then it might take a lot of your contacts, so you might not be willing to give up in order to get.

717
01:03:01,565 --> 01:03:03,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm still unclear on every block.

718
01:03:03,466 --> 01:03:08,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was at the press meeting with Councilor Caraviello, and Alex Rupenthal was there.

719
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:13,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we were there at this press conference, I don't get it still.

720
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:16,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've asked them, Comcast directly, and they've given me information.

721
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:21,071
[SPEAKER_08]: But where is this EveryBlock, and why hasn't the mayor advertised it so that we know?

722
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:22,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I was there, and I don't know.

723
01:03:23,253 --> 01:03:34,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, maybe we should get a representative from Comcast to come and inform this council on what EveryBlock does and how it would impact the lives of residents of this community.

724
01:03:37,485 --> 01:03:39,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an announcement after this is finished.

725
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:41,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just real quick.

726
01:03:44,728 --> 01:03:46,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to, Gene Martington, Cumming Street.

727
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:58,281
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did like about what he said while he was talking, I was thinking about we get these robocalls by telephone, but a lot of people today, you know, get email notices or whatever.

728
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:02,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get email notices when there's a storm or parking or anything like that.

729
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:07,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering maybe we should think about that because everybody, I'm sorry?

730
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:09,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that's great.

731
01:04:10,044 --> 01:04:15,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is I like the idea of putting up the council meetings on the computer.

732
01:04:15,688 --> 01:04:18,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a way to put the council meetings on a computer program?

733
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,471
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask for that, yes.

734
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:31,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That matter was discussed previously and I believe we're going to be holding a rules committee meeting on the 18th of this month to discuss papers and committee, one of them being that.

735
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

736
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, along with the Crystal Campbell, which was already announced, that fundraiser.

737
01:04:56,883 --> 01:04:59,564
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a fundraiser for children's hospital.

738
01:04:59,685 --> 01:05:04,708
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the second annual 5k leprechaun race, which is Saturday, March 14.

739
01:05:05,854 --> 01:05:07,475
[SPEAKER_00]: this coming Saturday at 1030.

740
01:05:08,355 --> 01:05:09,136
[SPEAKER_00]: The race starts at 1030.

741
01:05:09,436 --> 01:05:12,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be held at the Elks in Medford.

742
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:13,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's on Washington Street.

743
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:16,099
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge hit last year.

744
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:17,740
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton of people, a ton of fun.

745
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,761
[SPEAKER_00]: So just encourage anybody who wants to get out.

746
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:22,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's a nice spring day.

747
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:23,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great race.

748
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:25,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Raises a lot of money for Children's Hospital.

749
01:05:28,705 --> 01:05:33,048
[SPEAKER_06]: The records, the tabled records of February 17.

750
01:05:34,423 --> 01:05:42,168
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll pass to Councilor Caraviello on the motion of Councilor Camuso that those remain on the table until Councilor Caraviello's recuperation.

751
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:48,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mr. Clerk, allow it if you would.

752
01:05:49,553 --> 01:05:53,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Note that the temperature in this chamber is 65 degrees tonight.

753
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:56,758
[SPEAKER_06]: The tabled records of February 24th.

754
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: On motion of Councilor Knight, that those be tabled.

755
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:03,682
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor, all those opposed,

756
01:06:03,968 --> 01:06:07,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta, on that matter?

757
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would like to discuss the minutes of 224 if they're relative to me.

758
01:06:11,854 --> 01:06:14,076
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're relative to something else, that's a different story.

759
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So those minutes remain tabled.

760
01:06:18,379 --> 01:06:21,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And the records of March 3, 2015 were passed

761
01:06:29,797 --> 01:06:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: To Councilor Marks, does anybody find anything in order?

762
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,201
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

763
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:36,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually read the records, find them to be in order and move approval.

764
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:40,348
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

765
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:40,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

766
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:42,050
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

767
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,593
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of council to adjourn?

768
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:46,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Adjourned.

769
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:47,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.
