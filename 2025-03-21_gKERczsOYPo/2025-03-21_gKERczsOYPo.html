    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=351.567s">So</a>  the ordinance before you reflects the agreement that was reached with the firefighters union and representatives of the firefighters union are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=358.991s">Um,</a>  the contract is now negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=361.732s">It</a>  is a one year and three year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=365.354s">So</a>  the first year is the first year of the contract, which was fiscal year 2014 and the last, um, the end of the contract will be through June 30th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=377.781s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=392.392s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=394.374s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=394.574s">Miller,</a>  you said it's good through June 30, 2017?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=401.759s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=402.14s">It's</a>  actually a total of four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=406.663s">So</a>  the contract had stood unresolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=411.142s">since</a>  2013.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=415.465s">So</a>  is the one million, that's going to cover us through June 30th, 2016, but then obviously we're going to have it in the new budget for 2000, um, fiscal year, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=425.751s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=426.491s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=431.494s">Thank</a>  you for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=432.194s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=434.576s">Councilor</a>  Knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=437.765s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=439.686s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=440.186s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=440.367s">Miller,</a>  it's my understanding that this matter was in negotiations for quite a bit of time and was approaching the stages of arbitration?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=448.09s">Yes,</a>  it was.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=449.251s">And</a>  the parties were able to sit down and negotiate this agreement, and both sides are comfortable with it?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=454.113s">I</a>  believe so.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=455.514s">And</a>  has the membership of Local 1032 ratified this contract at this point in time?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=462.157s">They</a>  have, and they are here if they would like to speak to it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=466.246s">I'd</a>  move for approval of the matter, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=468.287s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, do members of the Firefighters Union, IAFF, Local 1032, wish to address us?</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=479.052s">Yes,</a>  just good evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=481.653s">Bill</a>  O'Brien, Local President of 1032 Firefighters, offices at 340 Senior Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=487.956s">After</a>  two and a half years, we did negotiate what we believe is a fair contract, and we just asked the Councilors to move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=500.428s">We</a>  have a motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=504.53s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=512.193s">Mr.</a>  President, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=513.294s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=515.675s">We'll</a>  wait for the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=518.216s">On</a>  the motion for approval for a first reading, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=524.058s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=525.899s">Where</a>  we have a representative from the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=528.748s">and</a>  also members of the firefighters union, there are a couple of outstanding issues that I am very concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=535.991s">One</a>  being the promised turnout gear, second pair of turnout gear that was promised and budgeted back, I believe it was a year and a half, two years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=547.294s">And</a>  I'm not sure if the firefighters can speak to that, but I'd like someone from the administration to speak to the fact that this turnout gear that was promised <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=557.911s">and</a>  much needed has not been received by the firefighters as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=564.797s">Can</a>  you speak to that?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=565.918s">I</a>  am not aware of an appropriation for a second set of turnout gear.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=569.902s">Can</a>  you?</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=571.884s">I</a>  don't believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=573.385s">Miller</a>  was on the job, so to say, when this went to approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=577.368s">I</a>  believe this was done at a budget hearing when the firefighters made a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=581.742s">about</a>  the concerns that we have of cancer-causing agents that get attached to our bunker gear even after they're washed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=589.472s">We</a>  transport them from station to station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=592.195s">People</a>  move around all the time before shifts, and they're not at the same station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=597.625s">So</a>  they have to put in their vehicles and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=599.665s">So</a>  we do have a wash and dry machine down at headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=603.726s">I</a>  mean, it would be optimal to have wash and dry machines at every station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=607.267s">But</a>  the other case is that we have a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=611.108s">Because</a>  what happens in the last fire we had at Sagamore Ave, it was contaminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=617.469s">And</a>  it goes out to a special cleaner, and it comes back, and the recommendation is you gotta take this turnout gear out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=624.483s">So</a>  it's beneficial to us and our families that we have a second set of turnout here.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=631.647s">And</a>  that was approved by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=635.649s">And</a>  maybe you could follow up on that to see where that stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=639.991s">It's</a>  been, I believe, a year and a half, two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=642.832s">I</a>  certainly will. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=644.333s">And</a>  my other question was regarding the work that was done over the past year to many of the stations throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=654.321s">there</a>  was some concern about shoddy workmanship in some of the stations regarding the floor, regarding heating and air conditioning and ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=665.684s">Has</a>  any of those issues been resolved or has the city neglected to move forward on any of those issues?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=676.406s">Again,</a>  I have not been provided with <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=678.931s">any</a>  issues at the fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=681.772s">I</a>  recently, um, actually had someone go to all the fire stations in order to put together a maintenance contract for the HVAC where the pH of the water has to be adjusted every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=693.697s">And</a>  I, it once again, wasn't made aware of any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=697.358s">I</a>  don't know if anyone else.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=698.759s">This</a>  is specifically around the work that took place, um, back, I believe it was a year, year and a half ago, uh, regarding, uh, the floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=708.276s">at</a>  one of the stations regarding the HVAC system at one of the stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=713.92s">And</a>  I know the city said they were looking into it, but I have yet to hear anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=720.324s">Can</a>  that be another issue that you check on?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=722.506s">I</a>  certainly will follow up with that.</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=725.646s">I</a>  believe with the council referring to the floor down at engine four that was kind of pitched the wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=733.614s">We</a>  brought the concerns to the administration at the time and it falls on the chief and the administration to monitor that equipment and if there's any workmanship issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=745.892s">that</a>  we brought it to their attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=747.093s">It's</a>  up to them to investigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=748.935s">And,</a>  uh, I don't know what the warranty is on, on some of this stuff, as far as heating systems and, and, uh, the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=755.501s">And</a>  that's up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=757.383s">The</a>  administration holds all that paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=759.024s">We</a>  don't, we don't hold that paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=760.506s">If</a>  we have issues or we think that the building is insufficient or the heat doesn't work, we send a communication to the chief and that's his job to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=770.895s">And</a>  some of the stuff, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=772.422s">is</a>  fixed, they have replaced HVA systems at engine four, engine five. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=778.09s">They</a>  don't run optimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=779.812s">Do</a>  they work? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=780.594s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=781.255s">Do</a>  they break down? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=782.456s">Yes,</a>  they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=784.119s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=784.319s">Miller</a>  did actually sign a <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=787.579s">Yeah,</a>  she brought in a maintenance person, which has helped, but it gets too hot, it gets too cold, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=796.405s">It</a>  should be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=797.226s">It</a>  should be running at an optimal level.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=798.586s">Well,</a>  that's the reason why I bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=800.428s">There</a>  was a punch list that was circulated back some time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=803.129s">I</a>  think it was by Jack Buckley at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=809.093s">I</a>  can't recall, but it was a punch list that before the city was going to sign off on the contract, that there was a list of items that had to be <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=816.625s">uh,</a>  addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=817.866s">And</a>  I have yet to hear back from the administration regarding these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=821.349s">And</a>  I'm hoping because that was brought up in a timely fashion where it would be still under warranty. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=826.813s">I'm</a>  hoping that, uh, at least these items will fall through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=830.096s">It</a>  doesn't sound like the floor was followed through.</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=832.278s">Um,</a>  so my, my, uh, if you have any questions about that stuff, I would probably target them to the chief.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=839.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=840.244s">And</a>  just my, my last issue was that, uh, and this is an issue that council longer was brought up on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=846.863s">uh,</a>  regarding email and communication, uh, with all departments, but in particular with, uh, the fire department, has there been any discussion between the, the fire department and the administration regarding setting up email accounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=860.468s">No,</a>  there has not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=862.469s">Is</a>  there a reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=863.469s">Is</a>  there a reason why?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=864.35s">Unless</a>  it's brought to us by the fire department, we weren't aware that we needed to initiate anything regarding emails, but there was a council resolution.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=876.037s">Uh,</a>  by this council, I believe it was unanimously supported at least on two occasions that I can remember requesting that, uh, email, uh, be looked into, uh, to, for the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=888.321s">And</a>  it just seems archaic that, uh, the response we received is that they go based on a notice that's put on, uh, you know, of things happening within the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=899.464s">So</a>  it's a paper notice that's posted similar to what the clerk does downstairs about notifying, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=905.736s">about</a>  public meetings and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=907.957s">So</a>  again, once again, and I don't want to, I know this is something Council Longo has been working on for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=913.498s">I</a>  would ask that the administration go back and check out why email is not part of, not just for the fire department across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=921.359s">It</a>  seems like a very simple way of communicating a mass email. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=925.44s">You</a>  can read, you can reach every city employee through, through one email and everyone be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=931.822s">So</a>  it just doesn't make any sense why we're still, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=934.761s">not</a>  moving forward with that.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=936.062s">Okay,</a>  I certainly will bring that back to the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=938.924s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=939.824s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello for the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=944.747s">Mr.</a>  Clark, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=953.292s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=954.553s">Motion</a>  to waive the three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=956.754s">Motion</a>  to waive the three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=959.131s">by</a>  Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=961.212s">On</a>  the motion to waive the three readings by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=965.593s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1182.892s">Just</a>  if we could take a formal roll call vote with regards to the interdepartmental email system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1189.096s">That's</a>  something we've been talking about for two or three years, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1192.499s">And</a>  Mayor Burke, at the time, when we discussed it in committee of the whole meetings for budget hearings, was the budget director at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1202.926s">So</a>  I know she must be aware of the situation and the need for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1208.73s">And</a>  posting something on a bulletin board obviously is not good enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1213.1s">So</a>  hopefully he, she's very busy, but if we could move, move on that and she can discuss it with the chief of fire and get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=1219.902s">Um,</a>  I'd like to take a roll call vote on that request.</p>
