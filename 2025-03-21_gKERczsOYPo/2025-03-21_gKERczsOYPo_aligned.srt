Present.

With three absent and four present, please rise and join me in the salute to the flag.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,359
I believe we have some of the council members tied up in a committee meeting.

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm sure they'll be here forthwith.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,060
We'll begin.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,902
16-096 offered by Vice President Longo Kern.

18
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:58,386
Why don't we do this one first while we started reading?

19
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,774
Suspension of the rules, Councilor.

20
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:14,156
A request for suspension of the rules offered by Councilor Marks.

21
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:14,976
All those in favor?

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,376
All those opposed?

23
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,177
Motion carries.

24
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:25,619
Councilor, state your reason for suspension.

25
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:25,659
16-295.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,460
All those in favor?

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,440
All those opposed?

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,260
Motion carries.

29
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:32,782
Communications from the Mayor to the Honorable President, to members of the Memphis City Council,

30
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,374

00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:29,768
Fire Captain, Public Safety 4, Fire Deputy Chief, Public Safety 5, Chief.

44
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:36,630
This agreement is requested due to recently negotiated agreement with Local 1032 IAFF, the Firefighters Union.

45
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,890
I have attached a proposed classification plan for your review.

46
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:50,293
It is estimated that the contract will cost approximately $1 million through June 30th, 2015, which includes retroactive payments beginning January 1st, 2014,

47
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:55,483
and includes payments to retirees who retired after January 1st, 2014.

48
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:02,785
Retroactive payments prior to fiscal year 2016 were made once ordained by your honorable body.

49
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:09,306
Separate transfer paper from negotiated salary count and free cash is on the agenda for your consideration.

50
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:14,388
Very truly yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

51
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:20,149
We have attached to this an outline that gives the steps

52
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:26,551
detailed amounts for each year, for each percent, for all of these matters.

53
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:47,527
And we have here to report before us Louise Miller, our Honorable Director of Budgeting and Purchasing, and who was instrumental in the negotiation process and formation of this very good contract.

54
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:48,308
Ms.

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,049
Miller, if you would.

56
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:58,130
So the ordinance before you reflects the agreement that was reached with the firefighters union and representatives of the firefighters union are here.

57
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,712
Um, the contract is now negotiated.

58
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:05,334
It is a one year and three year contract.

59
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:17,701
So the first year is the first year of the contract, which was fiscal year 2014 and the last, um, the end of the contract will be through June 30th, 2017.

60
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,021
Very good.

61
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:25,767
Mr. Clerk, would you mark present Councilors Falco, Knight, and Scampelli.

62
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:26,728
Thank you.

63
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:28,849
Councilors, any questions?

64
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:31,892
Madam Vice President.

65
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,793
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

66
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:34,534
Ms.

67
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:39,878
Miller, you said it's good through June 30, 2017?

68
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,059
Yes.

69
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,442
It's actually a total of four years.

70
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:50,486
So the contract had stood unresolved.

71
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,663
since 2013.

72
00:06:55,465 --> 00:07:05,511
So is the one million, that's going to cover us through June 30th, 2016, but then obviously we're going to have it in the new budget for 2000, um, fiscal year, 2017.

73
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,471
That is correct.

74
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:10,994
Okay.

75
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:12,134
Thank you for now.

76
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:12,535
Thank you.

77
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:16,277
Councilor Knife.

78
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,626
Mr. President, thank you very much, and through you to Ms.

79
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:20,146
Miller.

80
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:20,327
Ms.

81
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:26,409
Miller, it's my understanding that this matter was in negotiations for quite a bit of time and was approaching the stages of arbitration?

82
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,631
Yes, it was.

83
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:33,073
And the parties were able to sit down and negotiate this agreement, and both sides are comfortable with it?

84
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:34,994
I believe so.

85
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:41,477
And has the membership of Local 1032 ratified this contract at this point in time?

86
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:45,619
They have, and they are here if they would like to speak to it.

87
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,727
I'd move for approval of the matter, Mr. President.

88
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:58,572
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, do members of the Firefighters Union, IAFF, Local 1032, wish to address us?

89
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,913
Yes, just good evening, Councilors.

90
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:07,776
Bill O'Brien, Local President of 1032 Firefighters, offices at 340 Senior Street.

91
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:14,199
After two and a half years, we did negotiate what we believe is a fair contract, and we just asked the Councilors to move for approval.

92
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:24,150
We have a motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

93
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,430
Councilor Scarpelli.

94
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:33,193
Mr. President, very good.

95
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:33,914
Councilor Knight.

96
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,095
We'll wait for the vote.

97
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:42,698
On the motion for approval for a first reading, Councilor Marks.

98
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,019
Thank you, Mr. President.

99
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,200
Where we have a representative from the administration,

100
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:55,190
and also members of the firefighters union, there are a couple of outstanding issues that I am very concerned about.

101
00:08:55,991 --> 00:09:06,374
One being the promised turnout gear, second pair of turnout gear that was promised and budgeted back, I believe it was a year and a half, two years ago now.

102
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:17,458
And I'm not sure if the firefighters can speak to that, but I'd like someone from the administration to speak to the fact that this turnout gear that was promised

103
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:22,575
and much needed has not been received by the firefighters as of yet.

104
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,698
Can you speak to that?

105
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:28,921
I am not aware of an appropriation for a second set of turnout gear.

106
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,323
Can you?

107
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,345
I don't believe Ms.

108
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:37,328
Miller was on the job, so to say, when this went to approval.

109
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,312
I believe this was done at a budget hearing when the firefighters made a presentation.

110
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:48,831
about the concerns that we have of cancer-causing agents that get attached to our bunker gear even after they're washed.

111
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,354
We transport them from station to station.

112
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:56,861
People move around all the time before shifts, and they're not at the same station.

113
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,645
So they have to put in their vehicles and so on and so forth.

114
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,326
So we do have a wash and dry machine down at headquarters.

115
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:06,867
I mean, it would be optimal to have wash and dry machines at every station.

116
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:10,127
But the other case is that we have a second set of turnout gear.

117
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:17,129
Because what happens in the last fire we had at Sagamore Ave, it was contaminated.

118
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:23,910
And it goes out to a special cleaner, and it comes back, and the recommendation is you gotta take this turnout gear out of service.

119
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:30,226
So it's beneficial to us and our families that we have a second set of turnout here.

120
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,508
And that was approved by the Memphis City Council.

121
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,971
And maybe you could follow up on that to see where that stands.

122
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,092
It's been, I believe, a year and a half, two years now.

123
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:43,513
I certainly will.

124
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:52,937
And my other question was regarding the work that was done over the past year to many of the stations throughout the community.

125
00:10:54,321 --> 00:11:04,964
there was some concern about shoddy workmanship in some of the stations regarding the floor, regarding heating and air conditioning and ventilation.

126
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:13,366
Has any of those issues been resolved or has the city neglected to move forward on any of those issues?

127
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,427
Again, I have not been provided with

128
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:21,672
any issues at the fire stations.

129
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:33,397
I recently, um, actually had someone go to all the fire stations in order to put together a maintenance contract for the HVAC where the pH of the water has to be adjusted every year.

130
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:37,158
And I, it once again, wasn't made aware of any issues.

131
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,539
I don't know if anyone else.

132
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:47,282
This is specifically around the work that took place, um, back, I believe it was a year, year and a half ago, uh, regarding, uh, the floor,

133
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:53,180
at one of the stations regarding the HVAC system at one of the stations.

134
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,264
And I know the city said they were looking into it, but I have yet to hear anything about that.

135
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:02,026
Can that be another issue that you check on?

136
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:03,927
I certainly will follow up with that.

137
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:12,973
I believe with the council referring to the floor down at engine four that was kind of pitched the wrong way.

138
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:25,505
We brought the concerns to the administration at the time and it falls on the chief and the administration to monitor that equipment and if there's any workmanship issues.

139
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,073
that we brought it to their attention.

140
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,434
It's up to them to investigate it.

141
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:35,441
And, uh, I don't know what the warranty is on, on some of this stuff, as far as heating systems and, and, uh, the floor.

142
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,283
And that's up to that.

143
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,984
The administration holds all that paperwork.

144
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,446
We don't, we don't hold that paperwork.

145
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:50,415
If we have issues or we think that the building is insufficient or the heat doesn't work, we send a communication to the chief and that's his job to fix it.

146
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,496
And some of the stuff,

147
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:57,609
is fixed, they have replaced HVA systems at engine four, engine five.

148
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,232
They don't run optimal.

149
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,373
Do they work?

150
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:00,854
Yes.

151
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:01,956
Do they break down?

152
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,358
Yes, they do.

153
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:04,279
Ms.

154
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,761
Miller did actually sign a

155
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:15,124
Yeah, she brought in a maintenance person, which has helped, but it gets too hot, it gets too cold, stuff like that.

156
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:17,166
It should be fixed.

157
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,526
It should be running at an optimal level.

158
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,408
Well, that's the reason why I bring this up.

159
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:23,109
There was a punch list that was circulated back some time ago.

160
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,572
I think it was by Jack Buckley at the time.

161
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:36,098
I can't recall, but it was a punch list that before the city was going to sign off on the contract, that there was a list of items that had to be

162
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,165
uh, addressed.

163
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,728
And I have yet to hear back from the administration regarding these items.

164
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:46,333
And I'm hoping because that was brought up in a timely fashion where it would be still under warranty.

165
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:50,076
I'm hoping that, uh, at least these items will fall through.

166
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,258
It doesn't sound like the floor was followed through.

167
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:59,043
Um, so my, my, uh, if you have any questions about that stuff, I would probably target them to the chief.

168
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,064
Right.

169
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:06,209
And just my, my last issue was that, uh, and this is an issue that council longer was brought up on many occasions.

170
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:19,848
uh, regarding email and communication, uh, with all departments, but in particular with, uh, the fire department, has there been any discussion between the, the fire department and the administration regarding setting up email accounts?

171
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,749
No, there has not.

172
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:23,149
Is there a reason?

173
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,330
Is there a reason why?

174
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:35,234
Unless it's brought to us by the fire department, we weren't aware that we needed to initiate anything regarding emails, but there was a council resolution.

175
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:47,481
Uh, by this council, I believe it was unanimously supported at least on two occasions that I can remember requesting that, uh, email, uh, be looked into, uh, to, for the fire department.

176
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:59,064
And it just seems archaic that, uh, the response we received is that they go based on a notice that's put on, uh, you know, of things happening within the department.

177
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:05,066
So it's a paper notice that's posted similar to what the clerk does downstairs about notifying,

178
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,316
about public meetings and so forth.

179
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:13,178
So again, once again, and I don't want to, I know this is something Council Longo has been working on for some time.

180
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:21,319
I would ask that the administration go back and check out why email is not part of, not just for the fire department across the city.

181
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:25,080
It seems like a very simple way of communicating a mass email.

182
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,762
You can read, you can reach every city employee through, through one email and everyone be on the same page.

183
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,922
So it just doesn't make any sense why we're still,

184
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:35,862
not moving forward with that.

185
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,423
Okay, I certainly will bring that back to the mayor's office.

186
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:39,164
Thank you.

187
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:44,447
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello for the first reading.

188
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:46,128
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

189
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,272
Councilor Caviello.

190
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,093
Motion to waive the three readings.

191
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,615
Motion to waive the three readings.

192
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:00,671
by Councilor Caviello.

193
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:04,552
On the motion to waive the three readings by Councilor Caviello.

194
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:08,113
Councilor Mox.

195
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:23,577
Based on my vote that I took several weeks back when the administration came forward with the creation of new positions, I would ask that it be recorded in opposition to the waiving of the three readings, just because I feel strongly that it does away with public participation.

196
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:24,237
Thank you.

197
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:27,038
On the motion of Councilor Caviello,

198
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:31,144
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll of the waiving of the three readings.

199
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:33,426
Councilor Caviello?

200
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:33,726
Yes.

201
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,047
Councilor Felco?

202
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:35,367
Yes.

203
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:36,427
Councilor Knight?

204
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:36,768
Yes.

205
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,289
Vice President Lennon-Curran?

206
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:38,369
No.

207
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,530
Councilor Mox?

208
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,112
Record me in opposition.

209
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:44,933
Voting no.

210
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:45,573
Right.

211
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,235
Councilor Scarpelli?

212
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:48,535
Yes.

213
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,096
President Del Rosso?

214
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:50,376
No.

215
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,799
With the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

216
00:16:56,735 --> 00:17:11,409
On the main motion, for all three readings, you have to have to vote in the affirmative.

217
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,293
So for the first reading, this will be for the first reading.

218
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:20,284
because there was not a, uh, unanimous consent to waive all three readings.

219
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:27,845
Uh, we will, uh, follow the standard procedure with any ordinance, and this will be subjected to three readings.

220
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:38,407
Therefore, we will have the first reading vote now on the motion of approval by counselor Knight as seconded by counselor Caviello.

221
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:45,028
Mr. Clerk, just before you call the, um, I had a discussion with the clerk today.

222
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:57,168
And knowing that, um, the last time, uh, the motion came up to suspend the three readings, uh, the mayor's papers appeared back on the calendar within, I believe it was three weeks.

223
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,550
Um, so the process went rather quickly.

224
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,872
So I just want the firefighters that are here tonight to know that, um, you know, we want to push this forward.

225
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:10,094
We want to make sure there's transparency and open public dialogue.

226
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:13,176
Uh, and it's, it's about a three week process.

227
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:17,699
So I anticipate to have the paper back like any sign within three weeks.

228
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:18,159
Yes.

229
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,720
Mr. President, can I speak please?

230
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:20,780
Go ahead.

231
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:26,903
Um, our members, we've negotiated in good faith for two and a half years.

232
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,985
We've had many meetings.

233
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,186
We were on the brink of jail MC.

234
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:37,089
We have spent countless hours of attorneys, manpower accountants.

235
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:42,011
These members, men and women of my membership have waited two and a half years for a race.

236
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:43,502
We can't strike.

237
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:45,123
We go to work every day.

238
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:46,444
We do the job.

239
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:51,866
This city has the best men and women in the commonwealth, in the commonwealth.

240
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,947
We deserve that raise.

241
00:18:55,748 --> 00:19:01,890
And I would ask the council to reconsider your vote to get these men and women their money as soon as possible.

242
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:03,411
Thank you.

243
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:12,635
For the first reading, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

244
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:15,472
Councilor Caviello?

245
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:15,852
Yes.

246
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,313
Councilor Felco?

247
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:17,653
Yes.

248
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:18,713
Councilor Knight?

249
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:19,134
Yes.

250
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:20,654
Vice President Longo Kern?

251
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:20,794
Yes.

252
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:22,455
Councilor Mox?

253
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:22,915
Yes.

254
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:24,475
Councilor Scarpelli?

255
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:24,936
Yes.

256
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,256
President Del Rosso?

257
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:26,696
Yes.

258
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,897
We vote seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

259
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,458
The matter passes its first reading.

260
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:32,518
Congratulations.

261
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,820
While we're under suspension, Madam Vice President.

262
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:49,076
Just if we could take a formal roll call vote with regards to the interdepartmental email system.

263
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,778
That's something we've been talking about for two or three years, I believe.

264
00:19:52,499 --> 00:20:02,846
And Mayor Burke, at the time, when we discussed it in committee of the whole meetings for budget hearings, was the budget director at the time.

265
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:08,530
So I know she must be aware of the situation and the need for it.

266
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,353
And posting something on a bulletin board obviously is not good enough.

267
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,882
So hopefully he, she's very busy, but if we could move, move on that and she can discuss it with the chief of fire and get that done.

268
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,142
Um, I'd like to take a roll call vote on that request.

269
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:23,263
No vice president.

270
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:27,784
I'll go current that the mayor established an email system for the fire department.

271
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:32,365
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll point of information.

272
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:33,005
Counselor night.

273
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:38,907
I think the, the men and women of the Medford fight apartment in local 10 32, uh,

274
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:45,682
more concerned about getting their cost of living adjustment than they are about getting an email account right now, Mr. President.

275
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:51,307
I think the matter that's before this council is whether or not we feel as though they do their raise, and we can waive these three readings.

276
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,786
Mr. Counselor, we just voted in approval of the erasers.

277
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:59,067
All right.

278
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,268
The email issue, though, Ms.

279
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,029
Miller said she was going to bring it back to the administration.

280
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,970
So I don't know what more we need to do.

281
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,712
I mean, why do we need to take a roll call vote on an issue that we've already sent them three times and we have the word from the budget?

282
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,093
It's been over 90 days.

283
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:13,514
It's been over 90 days.

284
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:19,577
I think it just sent in a message that it's important to the council as the erasers are.

285
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:20,337
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

286
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:23,848
Councilor Caviello?

287
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:24,088
Yes.

288
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:25,489
Yes.

289
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:26,149
Yes.

290
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:27,830
Councilor Felco?

291
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,350
Yes.

292
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,410
Councilor Knight?

293
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:29,750
No.

294
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,531
Vice President Lionel Curran?

295
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:31,811
Yes.

296
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,371
Councilor Moxley?

297
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:33,691
Yes.

298
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:35,032
Councilor Scarpelli?

299
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:35,552
Yes.

300
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:37,313
President Del Rosso?

301
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:37,693
No.

302
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:40,954
Vote 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

303
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:41,934
Motion carries.

304
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,755
While we're on to suspension.

305
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:55,037
16-296, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and counselors.

306
00:21:55,597 --> 00:22:06,205
In regards to the paper before you this evening regarding the proposed increases to the Fighters Union, amendment to chapter 66, article 2, section 66.40, please transfer $554,000 from negotiated salary account

307
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:17,590
to account 010-220-5110, and please transfer $446,000 from certified free cash to account 1010-220-5110.

308
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:25,793
This will provide funding for the recently negotiated contract with local 1032 International Association of Firefighters, which is effective until June 30, 2017.

309
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:49,992
Before us to explain this paper is the Director of Budget, Ms.

310
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:50,312
Miller.

311
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:59,759
So before you is a paper to actually fund the firefighters contract.

312
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:07,745
And this would be retroactive to January 1, 2014, and would provide for all the raises

313
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:10,829
through the end of this fiscal year.

314
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:21,454
There was a certain amount of funds that was set aside both this year and in prior years for the negotiation of bargaining contracts, bargaining unit contracts.

315
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:31,078
We would use the entire balance in order to fund this contract as well as propose that $446,000 of certified free cash be used to fund the difference.

316
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,398
Balance in the certified free cash account is $9,623,000.

317
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:43,338
Chair awaits a motion.

318
00:23:43,418 --> 00:23:44,099
Move.

319
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:53,862
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

320
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,242
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

321
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:57,763
Councilor Caviello?

322
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:58,103
Yes.

323
00:23:59,023 --> 00:23:59,764
Councilor Felco?

324
00:23:59,784 --> 00:23:59,844
Yes.

325
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:01,424
Councilor Knight?

326
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:01,884
Yes.

327
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:03,545
Vice President Long and Kern?

328
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:03,665
Yes.

329
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:04,885
Councilor Mox?

330
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:05,005
Yes.

331
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:06,906
Councilor Scarpelli?

332
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:07,026
Yes.

333
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:08,738
President Del Russo.

334
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:09,238
Yes.

335
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:11,800
With the vote of seven, the affirmative, none in the negative.

336
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,561
The motion carries.

337
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:22,106
While we're under suspension, 16 to 97 to the honorable president, members of the metric city council, city hall method, Nassau to one five five.

338
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:31,973
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $190,000.

339
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:55,742
for design development, final design and construction documents, and construction administration for repairs and improvements to the city hall roof, parapet and cornices, cupola repairs, repairs to the council chamber ceiling, and associated molding repairs and main entrance repairs and improvements.

340
00:24:56,122 --> 00:25:03,728
Louise Miller, Director of Budget and Chief Procurement Officer, will be in attendance to answer any questions you have.

341
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:04,249
Ms.

342
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:04,529
Miller.

343
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:18,344
So, um, this particular paper follows on the work that was done recently to evaluate the roof, the parapet, the council chamber ceiling, as well as the front entrance of city hall.

344
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:29,714
Um, this would allow for the architect fees to go forward with basically everything on the roof, the parapet and the cupola.

345
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:40,342
The entire ceiling in this building with some work on the wood veneer in the walls where they were damaged by some water coming down.

346
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:43,222
And then the front entrance to this building.

347
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:53,764
We had a lengthy explanation on this matter to us from the mayor herself at a recent Committee of the Whole meeting with her.

348
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:57,565
So chair recommends a motion.

349
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,205
Chair awaits a motion.

350
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:02,437
Madam Vice President.

351
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:04,158
Ms.

352
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,860
Miller, do you have any breakdown of the $190,000?

353
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,664
Unfortunately, I did not bring it with me today.

354
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:16,929
I didn't bring it with me today.

355
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:17,650
I apologize.

356
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,371
I can provide you with that information.

357
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:23,495
So could you further explain?

358
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:29,140
So the $190,000 will just go to the architectural fees for those six projects?

359
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:35,319
Yes, it is the full design of all the projects, putting together the construction documents, the bidding documents.

360
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,943
It is also for all the construction supervision that would be required as part of the design work.

361
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:52,848
It also includes any asbestos and other environmental work that might need to be done and landscape architect for the front entrance of the city hall.

362
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,189
So where did we come up with the 190,000?

363
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:57,110
Is that something that was bid on?

364
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:11,375
Yes, we had a request for qualifications from an architect, and the architect developed for us a cost estimate of what it would cost to do the design, bidding documents, and construction estimate.

365
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:24,940
This actually is quite a reasonable cost estimate based upon the amount of work that's going to be required, and a lot of that is structural work, not just design-type work.

366
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:32,497
In request for qualifications, did we only get an answer from one architect?

367
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:32,978
Oh, no.

368
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,099
We received many architects' statements of qualifications.

369
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,820
So five.

370
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,660
Do you know how many?

371
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,182
No, I don't recall exactly how many.

372
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:51,826
This particular firm that we selected, Russo Bar, actually specializes in exterior envelope work, which is why we selected them.

373
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,907
And they've done historical work as well.

374
00:27:55,768 --> 00:28:00,711
So they have the combination of both the exterior work and the historical work.

375
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:20,443
Okay, if we could get a breakdown of the 190,000, Mr. Finn, and then if we could also get the results, a copy of the results, whether on disk or hard copy of the architectural design work.

376
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,624
I'm sorry, once Russo bar is complete with their, you know, when their studies complete, can we get a copy of what they've come up with?

377
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:31,985
Oh, absolutely.

378
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:32,705
Yes.

379
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:41,649
And we will have to come back to council because once the design is complete, we're going to come back to council for the funding of the actual work that needs to be done.

380
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:49,973
And did, I think we asked in the committee of the whole meeting and estimate on that, that work that is going to be need to need to be done, but we didn't have an answer to that.

381
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,286
It's going to be in the $1.5 million to $2 million range.

382
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:59,508
But until the design is complete, all I can give you is that kind of a ballpark figure.

383
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,293
And based upon the preliminary work that was done on the parapet, almost all of it will have to be removed structurally.

384
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:17,055
And can you explain a little bit more about the roof problems that we have?

385
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:20,196
What type of leaks do we have now currently?

386
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:23,937
So the leaks, we didn't have any leaks right now.

387
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:30,402
We did some repair work and there were some leaks around the HV, the chiller HVAC units that are up at the top.

388
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:36,067
I'm probably saying it wrong, but there are some HVAC units up there and there were some leaks around that.

389
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:43,172
There also were some leaks along the flashing where the parapet actually touches the roof membrane.

390
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:47,936
It's a flat roof and that flashing has needed some repair.

391
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:50,278
We did some repair work to that as well.

392
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:52,820
Thank you.

393
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,885
Councilor, move approval, Mr. President.

394
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:01,167
On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

395
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:03,429
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll, if you would.

396
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,991
Councilor Caviello?

397
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:06,331
Yes.

398
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:07,452
Councilor Falco?

399
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:07,572
Yes.

400
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:09,013
Councilor Knight?

401
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:09,314
Yes.

402
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:10,935
Vice President Lemon-Kern?

403
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,055
Yes.

404
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:12,396
Councilor Mox?

405
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:12,556
Yes.

406
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:14,778
Councilor Scarpelli?

407
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:14,878
Yes.

408
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,499
President Del Russo?

409
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:16,980
Yes.

410
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,401
With a vote of six in the present,

411
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:19,806
and one absent.

412
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:20,987
Motion carries.

413
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:21,948
Congratulations.

414
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:29,274
While we're on to suspension, do you want to do one more here?

415
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,535
16293 while we're on to suspension.

416
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:30,535
16293.

417
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:43,185
Petition for common vigilance license by Colvin management incorporated doing business as

418
00:30:43,749 --> 00:31:10,114
Hotel by Marriott, station landing, 95, station landing, Medford, Mass., Leo Bazaras, CEO and Chairman, on file, business certificate number 291, building department, police, fire traffic impact, police traffic impact, health department treasurer, letter of compliance, tax identification, workman's compensation, and petition.

419
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,615
All seem to be before us.

420
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:18,150
And I believe the chairman for licensing is Counselor Caravaglio.

421
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,431
Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:24,275
Good evening, gentlemen.

423
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:25,095
Good evening.

424
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:27,277
Please state your name and address for the record.

425
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:27,617
Welcome.

426
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:29,758
Eben Tormey, XSS Hotels.

427
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:34,121
John Mitchell, general manager of the AC Hotel in Medford.

428
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:37,804
I'm here representing Leo Exeris, chairman of Column 1 Hotels.

429
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,926
If you gentlemen could just give a brief overview of

430
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,712
of what's happening there to the council so that we'd be up to speed to appreciate it.

431
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:52,280
Yes, it's a new 152 room AC hotel by Marriott just opened last week.

432
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,840
152 rooms.

433
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,062
We have a beautiful modern new facility.

434
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,606
We think the city of Medford will be very proud of what we've built for you here.

435
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:02,830
I think it's going to be a great lodging facility for the city for many years to come.

436
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:06,616
Is there a restaurant on the premises?

437
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:11,200
Yes, we serve a breakfast seven days a week, as well as dinner, and there is a bar.

438
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:13,081
It's very small.

439
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:15,023
And what about a functional facility?

440
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:20,607
Yes, we do have a meeting room divisible by two, as well as two small breakout spaces.

441
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:24,770
Meeting room serves about 120 comfortably.

442
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,334
We do have a patio terrace area off of the meeting room, as well as the breakfast dining area.

443
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,195
When do you anticipate opening?

444
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:33,643
We are open for business.

445
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:36,706
Yes, we are renting rooms for a week now.

446
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:39,408
We've had a wonderful response.

447
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:44,292
Mr. President, the papers appear to be in order and I recommend approval.

448
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,834
On the motion approved by Councilor Caviello.

449
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,837
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

450
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:51,198
All those in favor.

451
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:52,980
All those opposed.

452
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:55,642
Congratulations.

453
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:57,924
Thank you very much.

454
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,046
Motion passes, license granted.

455
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:15,610
While we're on to suspension, we have one more paper from the Mayor to the Honorable 16-298, Mr. Clark, to the Honorable President, to members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 155.

456
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:27,093
Excuse me, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $18,000

457
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:47,144
for investigating of the low slope roof at the Medford Public Library, including an existing conditions report and a structural analysis to determine, excuse me, whether an expansion of the second floor of the library over the area is possible.

458
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:56,869
Louise Miller, Director of Budget and Chief Procurement Officer, will be in attendance to answer any questions you may have, very truly yours,

459
00:33:57,497 --> 00:34:00,980
Stephanie M Burke mayor signature filed with paper.

460
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,201
Okay.

461
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:11,127
So this paper actually follows on an issue that arose this year at the library with leaks in the library roof.

462
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:15,250
Our building department went and investigated.

463
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:24,817
There were some maintenance work that was done to the gutters and following that we weren't able to identify the actual source of the leaks.

464
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,378
This would allow us to,

465
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:33,751
have an existing condition study done of that flat part of the roof that is leaking.

466
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:39,414
The structural analysis is to determine whether the second floor can be expanded.

467
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:53,682
There are some plans for trying to make the library more usable and more of the space more usable, and Barbara Kerr is here, the acting director of the library, and so this

468
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:57,070
simply as a structural analysis to see whether it is possible.

469
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,452
It doesn't mean that's what will happen.

470
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,434
It's just to see if it is even possible to do.

471
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:09,262
And again, we had a detailed explanation of this process and several others that are underway at a recent meeting with the mayor.

472
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,368
The acting director of the library is here.

473
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:15,969
Maybe she'd like to address us on the matter.

474
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:22,962
I'm Barbara Kerr.

475
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:24,443
I'm the acting director of the library.

476
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:25,883
I like directress, actually.

477
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:27,223
It's very 19th century.

478
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:29,684
We're very excited about this.

479
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:32,705
We've been wanting to expand to the second floor for years.

480
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:35,345
So it's a very exciting prospect.

481
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,105
I hope it can happen.

482
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:40,306
And we're very pleased that the new administration is so quickly responding to support for the library.

483
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:43,467
And we would very much like to put children and young adults upstairs.

484
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:50,789
Brian wanted to put them up there to get them out of his face, but we want them to be, we want a new, we would like a space that's tailored to that age group where they can,

485
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:56,336
enjoy their library experience instead of having to cohabitate with older people who might not be happy.

486
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,417
So we would love this to happen if it can.

487
00:35:58,437 --> 00:35:59,497
Awesome.

488
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:00,397
Thank you.

489
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:03,938
Motion for approval, Mr. President?

490
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:07,459
Motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

491
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
Is anybody wishing to speak?

492
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,100
Did anybody press their cues?

493
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,521
Why isn't mine lighting up here?

494
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:15,961
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:17,942
Did I press the wrong buttons?

496
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:24,593
Wow, now we're back in business.

497
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:25,974
Counselor Myers.

498
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:28,195
Thank you, Mr. President.

499
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:40,843
And it was mentioned we had a meeting just recently with Diane McLeod, our ADA compliance officer, that there's an issue with access to the second floor.

500
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:48,648
I appreciate the fact that the administration is moving forward on this structural analysis.

501
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:52,210
I think every member of this council has been promoting

502
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:05,757
not only a rehab of the library, but also an expansion, a possible expansion on the second floor with community space and potentially maybe even a place where you can have a scone and a coffee and so forth.

503
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:13,281
What is the current status of the ADA issue with the elevator up to the second floor?

504
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:21,686
The plan is to use CDBG funding to make the second floor of the library fully accessible, so we would

505
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:29,312
look at the elevator space right now, enlarge it, make it into a full elevator so that the second floor is fully accessible.

506
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:36,156
So is that a request that's going to be in this year's community block grant money or is that?

507
00:37:37,677 --> 00:37:41,600
Yes, it is going to be in this year's community block grant money, the CDBG.

508
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,120
Yes.

509
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,503
And that'll be a request coming from the administration or from, how has that happened?

510
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:53,941
I am actually not sure whether it comes from the director, the community development director, or from the administration.

511
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,022
I'll have to find out for you.

512
00:37:56,162 --> 00:38:02,366
But I know that that is what the proposed funding is and how we're going to be moving forward with that particular project.

513
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,908
And the funding would be for a design study or would it be for the actual?

514
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:09,109
For the entire project.

515
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:11,731
For design so that we can come up with good costs.

516
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,495
find out where it is feasible for an elevator to be.

517
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:21,298
It may be in exactly the spot that it's in and then the actual construction of the elevator.

518
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,860
So is there been a design study commissioned already?

519
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:25,941
There has not.

520
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:28,242
We were just talking about it.

521
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:31,965
So how will we know how much money to request in the community block grant money then?

522
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:37,568
I first have to do a request for qualifications for a designer to do that design.

523
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:40,630
And once we receive the proposals back, we will know how much that is.

524
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:47,195
And that that'll be based on what the recommendation that how I don't understand how this works.

525
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:51,916
I guess you're going to, you're going to do a request for qualifications.

526
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:52,417
Yes.

527
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:55,638
Someone will put out their qualifications.

528
00:38:56,638 --> 00:39:02,040
You will also request at that time, a design study with a complete cost analysis.

529
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:07,390
Yes, so what happens is we get proposals from different architects.

530
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:13,734
We interview them and then work out a fee schedule for the first stage of the design.

531
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:26,922
Once we have that fee schedule worked out, then we proceed with the first phase of the design and then find out whether or not it's a project that can or cannot be done and what the actual cost of the project would be.

532
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:30,745
And that will be included in the

533
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:31,468
Yes.

534
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:32,849
Community block grant money this year.

535
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:33,289
Yes.

536
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:33,929
Thank you.

537
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,430
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

538
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,191
The chair recognizes Vice President Juan Gocart.

539
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:40,551
Thank you.

540
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,432
Now that our machine is working properly.

541
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:44,973
Ms.

542
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:56,637
Miller, my question has to do with the evaluation of the existing, um, I know that 18,000 is going to, uh, evaluate what I'm, I guess my, what my question is,

543
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:59,397
will it evaluate the entire roof as a whole?

544
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:05,201
I know there was leaking in the children's section, then I got a couple calls that it was also leaking in other sections.

545
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,684
So will this evaluation cover the entire span of the roof?

546
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:19,852
So yes, of the flat roof, the building department went and looked at where the leaks were.

547
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:26,137
They had an opinion that they were on the flat part of the roof, but they just simply weren't able to identify precisely

548
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:31,336
what the cause of the leak or the actual location of the leak.

549
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:40,860
So this will, someone will come through, an architect, and actually give us a existing condition of every part of the flat roof.

550
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:48,784
So if there are some other areas that are about to start leaking, they will let us know and we can do the repair work there as well.

551
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:51,025
And we may decide to replace the whole roof.

552
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,366
I don't know until we have that.

553
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:56,794
So there is a sloped roof and a flat roof.

554
00:40:56,935 --> 00:41:00,516
It consists of two different types of roofing, I'm assuming?

555
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:01,817
Yes.

556
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:09,200
This is for the flat part where there used to be skylights, and the skylights were covered up.

557
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,042
So if you go up to the second floor of the library, you can see it out through the windows, that area.

558
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:14,383
That's where the leaks are coming from.

559
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:22,227
But water travels, so it's really hard to identify the exact location of the source of the leak.

560
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:30,343
And I know this first came about in December, and then $5,000 was put into the roof.

561
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,165
And I think, obviously, patches were put in place.

562
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:38,788
As of maybe three weeks ago, the last time I was in there, the roof was still leaking.

563
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:45,393
Did we do any more patching to at least get us through this process?

564
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:50,296
At this point in time, we cannot identify any other locations that need to be patched.

565
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:56,705
The leaks at this point is that there really are just a couple of drips when it rains.

566
00:41:56,865 --> 00:42:03,750
I mean, there was some major water coming in when we were initially notified of the leaks in the roof.

567
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:08,033
But at this point, I understand that it's certainly not at that level.

568
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:12,056
Yeah, Director Kerr, could we maybe get the director up just to answer that question?

569
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:16,860
I'm just, my concern comes from, if it's been leaking since

570
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:25,171
A little bit after the $5,000 patchwork, are we dealing with mold issues or any type of rot is a question that's out there.

571
00:42:25,351 --> 00:42:31,033
And I think we need to do a little bit more patching and spend this $18,000.

572
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:33,094
So is the roof still leaking?

573
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:35,755
And if so, how many spots are we talking?

574
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:37,956
It's much, much better.

575
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:43,738
When they came after the initial storm, Mr. Moki sent down a couple of crews.

576
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:45,199
They cleaned all the water off.

577
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,751
And they drained the roof, and then they came back and they did maintenance on the drains that are on the roof.

578
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:51,852
And since then, it has been much, much better.

579
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,892
There's one leak that always leaks in children's.

580
00:42:56,293 --> 00:42:58,793
There's, along the front windows, there's one place.

581
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:00,694
And then there's a couple others.

582
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:04,515
It depends, the children's ones always leaks when it rains or snows.

583
00:43:04,795 --> 00:43:11,156
The other ones depend on the wind direction and the kind of, you know, whether the sun is out or not.

584
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,757
But it is much, much better.

585
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,021
It is improved, but yes.

586
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,664
So I guess I have a two-prong question.

587
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,325
Are we going to do any patching in the meantime?

588
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,306
Or how long is this study going to take?

589
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:30,209
Because, I mean, we can't let it go on for a month or two months where it's still leaking in certain sections.

590
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,111
Are we going to do any more patching as well?

591
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:36,693
I am not aware of any more patching that we are going to be doing in the meantime.

592
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:40,435
The study is going to be completed in a matter of weeks, four weeks.

593
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,016
In four weeks.

594
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:41,516
Yeah.

595
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,179
once we have the funding in place.

596
00:43:46,121 --> 00:44:02,412
And then as far as mold, to the extent there would be any, mold remediation is not generally done until after the leaks are patched because there is really no point in doing them until then.

597
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:05,634
We're not aware of any air quality issue right now.

598
00:44:08,596 --> 00:44:08,997
Dust.

599
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:10,258
It's a library.

600
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:17,355
So with regards to doing the mold testing, is there a plan to do mold testing after this is fixed?

601
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:18,496
Yes, we will.

602
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:22,700
Oh, just make that a recommendation.

603
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,284
Make sure it's in writing that the city council is requesting mold testing.

604
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:35,232
And obviously an engineer will review any rot, so obviously just

605
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:42,305
within the RFQ if we could get, make sure we have an architect that can review and evaluate any type of rotting situation.

606
00:44:43,765 --> 00:45:03,269
And then my third recommendation would be that we do have, whether it's clean the drains again or do some patchwork, that we do some patchwork within the near future, you know, because this is, we say this is going to take four weeks, maybe, you know, a little bit more as things always run over time, and to have

607
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:11,070
like dripping in buckets and buckets all over the place and, you know, a leak near a window and near the children's section.

608
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:19,777
I just feel like if this was a house, we'd have somebody, you know, you'd have somebody patching immediately and I think that's what we need to do here.

609
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:30,865
I've spoken about it before and I think that needs to be done for the quality of the people who work in the library as well as anybody who's going in to visit or

610
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:39,792
do any work in there or take their kids in there to have buckets where it was, when I was in there, it was leaking over the bucket and the rug seemed wet.

611
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:43,074
So I just don't think that's acceptable to allow for.

612
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:54,459
Obviously it's been happening since January if it was fixed in December and it was still happening as of three weeks ago when I was in a library and it sounds like we still have some leaks today.

613
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,441
So we're going on three months now with really no resolve.

614
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:59,302
Um, I think that's,

615
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,822
We can't take another four weeks, and I don't think the library deserves another four weeks of leaking.

616
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:15,325
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, as seconded by Vice President Langel-Kern, and thrice amended by the same Councilor Knight.

617
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:17,786
Mr. President, thank you very much, and through you to Ms.

618
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:18,106
Miller.

619
00:46:18,786 --> 00:46:18,926
Ms.

620
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:24,748
Miller, this paper that's before us this evening was one of a couple of different options that the administration looked at, is that correct?

621
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:37,752
In terms of, I think at the Committee of the Whole, there were a couple of different options that were presented to us, whether or not we wanted to see if we could build up on the second floor, and whether or not we wanted to just look at repairing the roof and that was it.

622
00:46:38,392 --> 00:46:45,698
And this seems like this was, based on my conversations with the administration and the Committee of the Whole, this seemed like the way to go.

623
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,681
But Councillor Lungo does bring up a good point.

624
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:54,586
So you're saying that it would take four weeks from the date that we approved this money to get someone out there and get the report

625
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:59,061
For everything to be finalized, a report to be finalized, yes.

626
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:05,406
And then, say, we get a report back that says it's going to cost $50,000 to fix the roof of the library.

627
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:14,314
How long in your experience would that take to be taken care of, put out to bid, qualified bidder selected, and have construction staff?

628
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:22,821
So, well, it takes two weeks at least to put out a bid and advertise it.

629
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:26,814
And then it needs to be evaluated and the roofer has to be able to come in.

630
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:30,036
Um, so it's a pretty small job.

631
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:34,478
I'd say eight weeks from the time the report is done until all work is completed.

632
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:43,943
So with the approval of this funding tonight, we can expect to see, um, completion of the, I should say, start of the construction work at the library within the next three months.

633
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:45,644
Yes.

634
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:51,827
However, depending upon what the report shows, it could be, you know, substantial sum of money.

635
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:52,788
We just don't know yet.

636
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:59,615
And, um, perhaps at the report, as it's safe to say that we're not going to know what the situation is at the library until we get this done.

637
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:01,217
That's correct.

638
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:02,938
I mean, we've done some patching.

639
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:09,724
We spent a few thousand dollars doing some patching, but we really need an expert to come in and look at it at this point.

640
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,287
Um, Mr. President, I think I'd have to agree with Ms.

641
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:15,829
Miller that I would just throw in good money after bad over here.

642
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,713
And until we do an assessment to figure out what's going on with the roof, um, I think this is,

643
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,011
$18,000 that's wisely spent.

644
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:23,792
I'd a second the motion for approval.

645
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:26,213
Very good on that motion.

646
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:26,994
Councilor Falcone.

647
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:28,355
Thank you, Mr. President.

648
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,396
Um, I support this a hundred percent.

649
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,497
I think it's long overdue.

650
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:32,777
It needs to be done.

651
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:35,959
And I love the idea of possibly having a second floor in the library.

652
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:39,421
Uh, just a couple of quick questions with regard to the current leaking.

653
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:45,945
So in the areas where the leaking has stopped, are they still missing sailing tiles and the buckets on the ground and,

654
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,530
Yes and yes.

655
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,013
But there's some places where we just leave the buckets, because I don't know if it's damp out in weeks.

656
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:59,976
We've left the ceiling tiles off, because what's the point of putting them on if they're going to fall on the floor if they get wet?

657
00:48:59,996 --> 00:49:01,496
So yes, there are.

658
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:06,279
So at the point where it's been patched, but we're not confident that it's?

659
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:14,062
Well, rather than spend the money on the ceiling tiles, which are kind of pricey, we decided to just wait until the dry season and see what happens.

660
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:14,863
Yeah.

661
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:28,828
I mean, I just, um, well, I think that we're hoping that this investigation of the, uh, or evaluation of the roof is, uh, hopefully in a month's time we'll actually give us a good plan as to what we're going to do.

662
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:33,050
And then, um, I'd like to see the ceiling tiles at some point go up soon.

663
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:43,334
I think if you, especially if the, if the roof has been repaired, you know, I, I mean, I'd like to see the ceiling tiles go up just because, I mean, I think if you walk in,

664
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:44,636
I mean, it sends a message.

665
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:51,241
I mean, it really sends a message when people come in, especially from out of town, and this is their first, you know, view of Medford.

666
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,163
I mean, it really kind of doesn't send a good signal.

667
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:58,667
So, I mean, if the roof's been fixed in certain spots, I'd like to see the tiles go up.

668
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:10,777
But as far as the maintenance of the library, if we could get a report back from maybe the building department as far as what is the maintenance plan?

669
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,003
Is there any preventive maintenance being done in the building?

670
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:18,967
For instance, I mean the drip, the drains on the roof were a definite issue that caused the leaking.

671
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:23,630
Is someone going up on the roof on a yearly basis, looking at the drains, making sure they're cleaned out?

672
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:34,897
So if we can get some sort of a report back from the building department, uh, just letting us know what they do on a yearly basis or what they do on a monthly basis with regard to maintenance for the building, preventive maintenance.

673
00:50:35,277 --> 00:50:37,799
Uh, I think, uh, that would be, um,

674
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:48,753
a good start as to, uh, if we're going to be possibly putting on a new roof, we need to take a look at how we can maintain that building on a regular basis and conduct preventive maintenance as well.

675
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:49,614
Very good.

676
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:59,596
So on the motion of approved by council Caviello, uh, seconded by vice-president Lungo Kern, thrice amended by council Lungo Kern and once by councilor Falco.

677
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:01,316
All those in favor.

678
00:51:01,636 --> 00:51:02,577
No, we need a roll call.

679
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,657
Mr. Clerk, madam vice-president.

680
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:07,598
The last, the last amendment, if we could just read that back.

681
00:51:08,323 --> 00:51:10,744
The last amendment was Councilor Falco.

682
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:13,365
Sorry, my last, my last.

683
00:51:13,846 --> 00:51:26,291
Your last amendment was that the patchwork be done immediately to mitigate any extant leaks in there to prevent the continued problem.

684
00:51:27,332 --> 00:51:28,252
Yes, thank you.

685
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:29,593
I just think that's important.

686
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:37,056
I wanted to make sure that was in there because when we did get the information from the mayor's office, to replace the roof would cost

687
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:43,189
looks like if it's the low roof in this estimate, 110 to 130,000.

688
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:51,010
So I think patching it up within the next week or so is definitely a thousand or two is definitely worth it.

689
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:57,231
Um, when you talk about three to four months, it might, it might take to repair or replace, get it replaced.

690
00:51:59,212 --> 00:51:59,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

691
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:05,673
Hopefully, uh, you know, in the next two weeks, the commonwealth of the mass library building commission will be coming to our city.

692
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:08,750
and meeting with the library director and the mayor.

693
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,472
And hopefully they'll look favorably upon us.

694
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:20,795
They'll maybe generate, either give us a new library or at least money to repair that one and update it.

695
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:23,896
So I look forward to that happening.

696
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:25,757
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

697
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:27,601
Yes.

698
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:31,903
With the vote of seven, the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carried.

699
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:37,045
While we're on suspension, Mr. Counselor Knight, I'd like to take paper 16294 out of order.

700
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:38,186
16294, my thoughts exactly.

701
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:38,846
Petition by

702
00:52:59,186 --> 00:53:09,831
Virkamur Patel for NK Convenience, 562 High Street, Medford, Mass, for Keno To Go Monitor to be installed.

703
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:15,654
May I just say that in 52 minutes, the council spent $1,208,000.

704
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:16,574
Thank you all.

705
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,076
Councilor Caviello, Chairman of Licensing.

706
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,638
Thank you, Mr. President.

707
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,023
I reviewed the gentleman's papers here and they appear to be in order.

708
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:43,834
Our motion for acceptance is under the condition that we get the signed off by the building department, make sure it's correctly zoned.

709
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:44,955
Very good.

710
00:53:45,276 --> 00:53:50,841
And we have a, on these matters, we have to just state that we're not in opposition.

711
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,724
President, I'd like to be recorded in opposition to the paper.

712
00:53:54,178 --> 00:53:56,400
Councilor Knight is to be recorded in opposition.

713
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,543
Does the, uh, does the vitriol wish to speak and address the council at all?

714
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:02,425
Sure.

715
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:04,487
Please state your name and address.

716
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:16,697
My name is, uh, real Kumar Patel and, uh, I've been doing business there for 2006 and, uh, uh, we are, uh, very proud to serve the community as a convenience stores.

717
00:54:16,817 --> 00:54:22,982
And, uh, we have really good people coming there and we do our great job to base, to serve them.

718
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:24,504
Very nice.

719
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:26,346
I agree, Mr. President.

720
00:54:26,786 --> 00:54:31,029
I frequent that store myself, and their store is always clean and well maintained.

721
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:35,151
And they've been there for many years, and they are a good neighbor to the community.

722
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,013
Do we have to take a roll call on this?

723
00:54:37,753 --> 00:54:39,774
All those in non-opposition, say aye.

724
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:42,056
All those in opposition.

725
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:43,097
Aye.

726
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:45,819
The non-opposition has it.

727
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:47,720
Thank you, Mr. President.

728
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,580
Thank you, Mr. President.

729
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,921
Mr. President, are we on the suspension?

730
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:51,582
Yes, Councillor.

731
00:54:55,683 --> 00:55:11,393
back from Attorney Mark Rummer, the city solicitor, regarding the resolution that was offered for the city solicitor to create a home rule petition regarding the election of a charter commission in this community.

732
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:20,659
The city solicitor was very diligent and followed the instructions of the council last week on our

733
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:29,625
votes to remove the restrictions on the number of amendments that would be allowed under the home rule petition.

734
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:46,855
Also the increase of commission members from seven to nine and the removal of the periodic review so that the elected commission can decide if and when for future reference.

735
00:55:47,676 --> 00:55:49,937
when the charter will be reviewed, Mr. President.

736
00:55:50,398 --> 00:56:05,486
So I would ask that we vote a motion for approval of this home rule petition that was submitted dated March 3rd from the city solicitor, and ask that it be sent to the mayor for her approval, Mr. President.

737
00:56:06,106 --> 00:56:11,169
And I believe it also requires the signatures of the council.

738
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:16,712
We all received a copy, and on the back page, it requires signatures of the council.

739
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:26,248
So I would offer that, Mr. President, that we move approval on this and send the paper to the mayor for Mayor Burke's approval.

740
00:56:29,129 --> 00:56:29,969
On that motion.

741
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,191
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

742
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:39,792
Councilor Nettle.

743
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:43,233
Mr. President, if the solicitor is available, I just have a couple of questions for him.

744
00:56:47,063 --> 00:56:54,507
We welcome before us the author of this draft, the Right Honorable Mark E. Rumley, solicitor.

745
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:59,630
Mr. President, thank you very much, and through you to Mr. Rumley, thank you for being here this evening.

746
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:13,457
In reviewing this piece of proposed legislation, Mr. President, it's my understanding that by the council approving this matter, we would be bypassing the requirements to collect signatures to put this matter on the ballot, and we would also be erasing the question

747
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:18,362
of asking the voters as to whether or not they felt the charter review was appropriate.

748
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:18,963
Is that correct?

749
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:21,486
Yes, that's correct on both counts.

750
00:57:22,928 --> 00:57:26,392
Mr. President, I don't feel comfortable bypassing the electorate.

751
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:34,580
in this process whatsoever, and I'd ask to be recorded in opposition when this paper comes up for a vote.

752
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:45,310
I think when we look at historically what the council has done, Mr. President, it's when initiative petition matters have come before the council and there's been a request to ask that it be placed on the ballot.

753
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,573
Absent the signatures, the council was consistent in their

754
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,733
application of requiring signatures, and I, for one, feel as though that's the best practice, Mr. President.

755
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:56,635
I certainly feel as though chatter review is a noble cause.

756
00:57:57,036 --> 00:58:01,019
However, it's the process for which I am opposed and not the principal.

757
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,220
So with that being said, I rest, Mr. President.

758
00:58:05,842 --> 00:58:06,843
Thank you, Councilman.

759
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,046
The citizen before us wishes to speak.

760
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:12,667
Please state your name and address for the record.

761
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:13,027
Welcome.

762
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:14,628
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

763
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,230
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

764
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:21,094
When a teacher asks to review her syllabus, no one wonders why.

765
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:24,717
When a captain surveys his ship at night, no one asks him to what end.

766
00:58:25,517 --> 00:58:34,124
Yet as our group works to review the city's charter, the constitution for our city, some members of this council seem confused as to why we should go through the effort.

767
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:41,490
Some call our efforts at home on petition undemocratic or imply that this process is somehow seditious.

768
00:58:42,591 --> 00:58:47,315
Our group has collected, as of right now, over 1,800 signatures for one simple reason.

769
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:49,673
We want to review Medford's charter.

770
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:53,594
There's nothing demonic or undemocratic about what we hope to do.

771
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:59,135
Our goal is to simply involve you, the city council, Medford's finest, into this initiative.

772
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:03,356
A regular review, as almost everyone agrees, is healthy.

773
00:59:03,997 --> 00:59:05,557
But why do we ask for this review now?

774
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:09,318
Why not, as Councilor Knight says, just keep collecting the signatures?

775
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,198
Well, the mayor campaigned for a charter review.

776
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:13,459
It is in your power to ask for a charter review.

777
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:14,679
It's not undemocratic at all.

778
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:21,115
Most of the members of this council have been recorded on record as championing this process.

779
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:24,857
Beyond this, a lot has happened in the last 30 years since our last review.

780
00:59:25,497 --> 00:59:28,859
Our city has changed, and a new blueprint is needed for us to adapt.

781
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:36,662
But I've heard these words float about City Hall, I'm for charter review, but I want them to get the signatures, I want them to go through this process.

782
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:38,823
These words sound very politic to me.

783
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:44,725
How it is very easy to pretend to be for charter review, and then do nothing to actually help the process along.

784
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:57,716
I don't understand how individuals going to collect signatures to put an item on the ballot, which would be one of the purest forms of the democratic process, would be too much to ask.

785
00:59:58,597 --> 01:00:00,238
That's all I'm saying, Mr. President.

786
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:02,180
I feel as though there's a process in place.

787
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,782
Why are we going to tinker with one of the oldest constitutions in the country?

788
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:12,968
Why are we going to tinker with the Constitution of the United States of America that was based upon Massachusetts' Constitution to collect these signatures, to bypass them?

789
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:16,371
This process, Mr. President, I just have a real problem with this process, Mr. President.

790
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:17,532
It sounds like it's agenda-driven.

791
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,626
And I have a real problem with it, Mr. President.

792
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:21,187
That's why I'm voting in opposition.

793
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:23,029
I rest at that, Mr. President.

794
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:23,970
That's why I'm in opposition.

795
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,231
It's a process argument.

796
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,451
It's a process argument.

797
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:27,632
I don't like the process.

798
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,354
I feel as though we're bypassing the process.

799
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:35,859
And I think that the people should have the right to participate, and there should be full participation, Mr. President, full participation.

800
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:36,719
And that's where I'm coming from.

801
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,501
I don't want words to be put in my mouth.

802
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:43,174
I just want to respond to that question about the process.

803
01:00:43,594 --> 01:00:47,616
Many cities, most cities actually in Massachusetts, have regular charter reviews in their process.

804
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:48,617
It's built in the process.

805
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:52,159
I can assure you, Councilor Knight, that we're going to keep collecting signatures.

806
01:00:52,259 --> 01:00:53,980
We will reach our 6,000 signatures.

807
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,901
There's no question about it.

808
01:00:55,421 --> 01:01:00,444
We're not asking for the City of Medford to automatically accept these changes.

809
01:01:00,504 --> 01:01:05,547
This would be an elected body, and any changes that they make would have to be approved by the City of Medford.

810
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:10,850
trying to hold a gun to the city of Medford's head and ask for a ransom of some ridiculous amount.

811
01:01:12,331 --> 01:01:14,012
We will get these 6,000 signatures.

812
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:20,435
Councilor Marks presents this Home Rule petition to make the process of charter review as inclusive as possible.

813
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:24,697
He wants to involve every level of our government to move this charter review forward.

814
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,238
Our group could do it alone.

815
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:28,978
We can keep gathering signatures.

816
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,700
We could force City Hall to accept a review.

817
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:40,364
But wouldn't it be healthier if everyone in our city was involved in this change, from city council to the mayor's office to all the people in our city?

818
01:01:41,104 --> 01:01:45,546
A vote against this petition tonight is a vote against this type of reclusiveness.

819
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:48,067
All I ask is for everyone not to pretend.

820
01:01:48,528 --> 01:01:50,008
If you're against charter review, that's fine.

821
01:01:50,048 --> 01:01:52,910
That's your right as a citizen of Medford, and I respect that view.

822
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,285
But just state your position honestly.

823
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:59,908
It's one thing to say I'm for something and then not do anything to help the process along.

824
01:02:00,589 --> 01:02:01,149
So thank you.

825
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,070
Good evening.

826
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:03,490
Welcome.

827
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,352
Please state your name and address for the record, Jean.

828
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:07,333
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

829
01:02:07,653 --> 01:02:12,036
And you'll be amused to know that I was called pushy this week, so I kind of wear that as a badge now.

830
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:16,119
I was referred to as pushy.

831
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:20,762
But anyway, this is a representative democracy.

832
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:22,063
We don't have a pure democracy.

833
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:26,730
Pure democracy would be 50 plus 1 on any given item.

834
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,691
We elect you to represent us in many, many ways.

835
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:34,132
And so it's not a simple democracy.

836
01:02:35,693 --> 01:02:42,636
The reason why we have to do 30 years, let's get real, for 30 years the city has not had a charter review.

837
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:48,318
A review, again, does not mean that we have any change to the charter, it just means

838
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:57,349
that an elected body of the people, and I believe none of these folks behind the reel, can be a member of that charter review.

839
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:04,212
So it is up to the people, and it is up to the people to get involved once that body is elected.

840
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:13,776
But what happened over the 30 years is a complete breakdown of citizen participation in government.

841
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:21,097
They were involved in sports, and they were involved in the schools, and the people were involved in different aspects in the business community.

842
01:03:21,557 --> 01:03:37,088
But the one area that has not been a place where the people, the citizenry, have been involved is in the actual local government, how it works, input into it in a major way, unless they were directly affected by local government.

843
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,021
Those folks, they've been active in it.

844
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:42,384
But for the vast majority of people, they're afraid.

845
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:43,125
They don't know.

846
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:44,686
They're in a very passive position.

847
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:50,611
And this process will stimulate their ability to start to get involved.

848
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:55,835
And it has to be led by you guys, because they've been sheep for 30 years.

849
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:57,236
I know that sounds terrible.

850
01:03:57,276 --> 01:03:58,137
It sounds like an insult.

851
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,799
And I guess I earned my pushy word today.

852
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,202
But they've been sheep.

853
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:05,443
They've been passive.

854
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:07,439
participants in local government.

855
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:13,361
And we want them to be active, and we want to teach the kids to be active in their local government, and that's true.

856
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:17,802
So while I respect the petitioning process, this is not illegal to do it this way.

857
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:21,504
And we elected you to represent us.

858
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:26,746
I don't always agree with the way you guys vote, but you vote for the mass majority of the people.

859
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,667
Sometimes I don't agree with you.

860
01:04:29,847 --> 01:04:30,367
Sometimes I do.

861
01:04:31,173 --> 01:04:32,153
But I have to accept that.

862
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:33,514
You guys vote for me.

863
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:34,914
You represent me.

864
01:04:35,215 --> 01:04:37,916
And this is a legal avenue to do a charter review.

865
01:04:38,256 --> 01:04:39,916
So don't be afraid of it.

866
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:41,397
Just don't be afraid of it.

867
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:42,938
The people don't know.

868
01:04:42,998 --> 01:04:44,898
It's new to them for 30 years.

869
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:46,699
I can't stress that enough.

870
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:52,341
What's it going to take for this city to just look at its own constitution, the way we run ourselves?

871
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:53,322
Thank you.

872
01:04:55,823 --> 01:04:56,403
Thank you, Jean.

873
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,063
Good evening.

874
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,684
Please state your name and address for the record.

875
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:01,042
Thank you, Mr. President.

876
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:03,603
I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

877
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:07,685
I want to fully concur with the last speaker, Jean Martin.

878
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:11,006
This is not a democracy.

879
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:13,968
We live in a representative republic.

880
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:29,454
To be clear, and I definitely want to congratulate and acknowledge the point that Councillor Knight is making about the voters having a say on this by petition.

881
01:05:30,147 --> 01:05:34,249
I hope he'll feel the same way on an upcoming agenda, but that's another item.

882
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:47,517
But to be sure, this proposal, if I can ask a question, this is not a charter review we're talking about here for this particular agenda item.

883
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:53,260
What we're talking about is reviewing just plan a or making amendments to it or keeping it.

884
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,340
Is that not correct?

885
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:57,442
We're looking at

886
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:07,778
If I can so we're looking at just either amending the plan a we have or keeping the plan a that we have Is that correct under this agenda item?

887
01:06:08,438 --> 01:06:19,141
so then Under plan a so if one of the amendments is to go to a plan C. That's not an option That's correct.

888
01:06:19,161 --> 01:06:21,841
So then what we're doing is we're not doing charter review.

889
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:24,842
We're doing one particular

890
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:28,616
I think this is the problem.

891
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:29,696
This is the problem.

892
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:30,436
This is where I'm coming from.

893
01:06:30,456 --> 01:06:31,457
People don't know what we're doing.

894
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:32,297
What are we doing?

895
01:06:32,717 --> 01:06:33,398
What are we doing?

896
01:06:33,578 --> 01:06:34,058
He doesn't know.

897
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:35,059
He's been to every single meeting.

898
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:35,879
He ran charter review.

899
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,920
He ran, he ran a caucus for charter review here, Mr. President.

900
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,782
He doesn't even know what the paper that's coming out and he's just speaking in favor of it.

901
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:45,183
This is why we need to collect the signatures and we need to go through the process.

902
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:46,244
This is why.

903
01:06:46,364 --> 01:06:49,305
So people can get their questions answered so they can be full participation.

904
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:53,007
And Mr. Mr. President, if I could, please, it's,

905
01:06:53,600 --> 01:07:01,762
It's that I do know what's happening here, that I wanted it to make clear through a question for the people in the audience and the people watching at home.

906
01:07:01,782 --> 01:07:02,502
It's not that I don't know.

907
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:04,743
So we call that a rhetorical question then?

908
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:22,788
It's a question to bring clarity so that everybody in this audience and everybody sitting at home watching knows full well that this is not a full charter review with the option of going to another charter.

909
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:26,184
It's either accepting Plan A or amending it, and that's it.

910
01:07:26,644 --> 01:07:27,524
Thank you, Mr. President.

911
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:29,125
Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

912
01:07:29,786 --> 01:07:30,286
Good evening.

913
01:07:30,406 --> 01:07:32,187
Please state your name and address for the record.

914
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:32,567
Welcome.

915
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:33,948
Thank you, Council President.

916
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:36,969
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

917
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:41,872
I want to thank Gene Martin and Robert Capucci for eloquent speaking on this matter.

918
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:43,513
It's been 30 years.

919
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:49,716
You know, if a home rule petition gets people a pay raise,

920
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:55,580
Why can't we have a home rule petition to expedite charter review, charter change?

921
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,900
This is a very important thing.

922
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:05,842
And I want the viewers out there to just look at the records of the councilors who vote on certain issues and see the ones screaming the loudest who do the least amount of work.

923
01:08:06,303 --> 01:08:06,683
Thank you.

924
01:08:09,743 --> 01:08:10,243
Good evening.

925
01:08:10,283 --> 01:08:10,643
Welcome.

926
01:08:10,663 --> 01:08:12,424
Please state your name and address for the record.

927
01:08:12,824 --> 01:08:15,545
Joyce Paul, A Mason Street, Medford, Mass.

928
01:08:16,085 --> 01:08:17,345
And I support this

929
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:21,067
getting more information, I think it's a good idea.

930
01:08:21,427 --> 01:08:22,208
And just look at it.

931
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:23,309
Thank you.

932
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,252
Good evening citizen.

933
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:29,534
Please state your name and address for the record.

934
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:29,894
Greetings.

935
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:31,376
Counselor, counselors.

936
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:35,419
Um, Andrew Castaneda, Cushman street in Beth.

937
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:41,764
I simply have a mathematical point of information, the mathematics only.

938
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:46,248
And I believe the CPA, the community preservation act,

939
01:08:48,560 --> 01:09:00,103
When they started that process, I believe they acquired less signatures than what is presently acquired here at 1800 or so.

940
01:09:01,323 --> 01:09:13,086
And as one of the counselors had brought up, through the process, through the signature process, you would need, well, I believe it's 20% of the registered voters.

941
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:14,966
And that's probably over 4,000, 5,000, almost 6,000.

942
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:23,424
and they have to be certified and make sure that they are totally legitimate.

943
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:28,586
So it's almost, it's not impossible, mathematically speaking.

944
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:41,750
However, it's nearly impossible in the real world, and I'm not sure if it's ever been done in this community, to gather that many signatures to do such a thing.

945
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,192
Simply the math, if there's a shortcut on a Home Rule petition,

946
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:54,624
And if it goes forward to the ballot, the people will be able to decide regardless.

947
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:55,364
Thank you.

948
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:57,105
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

949
01:09:58,306 --> 01:09:58,806
Good evening.

950
01:09:58,966 --> 01:09:59,327
Welcome.

951
01:09:59,407 --> 01:10:01,028
Please state your name and address for the record.

952
01:10:01,608 --> 01:10:01,908
Hello.

953
01:10:02,929 --> 01:10:04,149
I'm Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

954
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:11,897
Nobody has called me pushy yet this week, but it is only Tuesday, so the night is still young.

955
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,140
I have some questions, actually.

956
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:24,762
I'm a little confused, Councillor Knight, because I, hold up, that is a bunch of feedback.

957
01:10:24,802 --> 01:10:26,463
I don't know where it came from.

958
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:33,108
I think, am I remembering totally wrong that a few weeks ago at a council meeting?

959
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,330
Oh, I have to address through you, don't I?

960
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:36,231
Sorry.

961
01:10:37,773 --> 01:10:48,203
So, hypothetically, a few weeks ago, Councillor Knight, I vaguely recall saying that collecting signatures wasn't working.

962
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:55,627
And now I think I heard him say that we should go with collecting the signatures.

963
01:10:56,028 --> 01:11:04,553
I don't know if there's been a significant change in the information that's come forward since then, but I feel like both processes can go on at the same time.

964
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:19,123
It's my understanding that one of them doesn't necessarily cancel out the other one, and that, in fact, if anything, the signatures do, the proposal of the signatures does, it has more

965
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:29,062
more flexibility in terms of what you can look at, but actually both processes can go on parallel and they're not necessarily at this time a threat to one another.

966
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:42,045
So it is possible that people could continue collecting signatures and still be okay with exploring this particular avenue.

967
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,605
And that wouldn't be

968
01:11:44,617 --> 01:11:45,718
unconstitutional at all.

969
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:47,619
Actually, I don't know of anything in the U.S.

970
01:11:47,659 --> 01:12:08,612
Constitution that addresses this, but it's my understanding that, in fact, it's perfectly legal to have both things going on at the same time, and that ultimately, if it comes down to it, the one done with signatures, which are totally doable, I think it actually won't be a problem getting the signatures.

971
01:12:08,653 --> 01:12:09,253
People are really

972
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:16,912
putting an effort into that, and there have been people who have expressed a desire to help with that, and that there's been some effort around that.

973
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:29,179
So I don't think that one process is a danger to the other, and it's my understanding that the one where we gather signatures actually could preclude

974
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:39,119
what you're voting on here today if people decided that that was a thing.

975
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:49,647
But it's only March, so there's still plenty of room for an exchange of ideas on both options.

976
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:55,652
And I don't think that's necessarily confusing to folks if people are really clear about both options.

977
01:12:56,173 --> 01:13:01,677
It would be really helpful to have a frequently asked questions or a plain language document

978
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:13,815
out there on both the options, I think that that would be really useful because, of course, not everybody who's voting or who's looking at these things is a scholar of governmental processes.

979
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:28,121
But if the people who are behind each of these efforts would be willing to do that, I think that that would, it would be perfectly fine for both processes to go on at the same time, and that would give people more options, not fewer.

980
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:29,741
Thank you.

981
01:13:32,428 --> 01:13:32,968
Good evening.

982
01:13:33,048 --> 01:13:34,649
Please state your name and address for the record.

983
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:40,271
Judith Beatrice, 49 Wyman Street in Medford, lifelong resident of the city.

984
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:41,851
I have two things.

985
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:48,094
Number one, as I said, the first time I spoke that the matter of having a trust charter review is a matter of trust.

986
01:13:48,454 --> 01:13:49,774
It's a matter of trustworthiness.

987
01:13:49,814 --> 01:13:51,675
First of those of all, he will going to put it through.

988
01:13:51,715 --> 01:13:54,056
You can't trust anybody if you don't trust yourselves.

989
01:13:54,616 --> 01:14:00,618
Number two, it's a matter of trust on the part of our citizens that we trust that those who we're going to elect and those of you who hear

990
01:14:00,943 --> 01:14:05,404
that we're all working for the betterment of the city of Medford and for the council and for the whole city.

991
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:13,627
No review in 30 years has really been detrimental from my perspective of not representing the new population and people that we have coming to the city.

992
01:14:13,687 --> 01:14:15,228
So from my perspective, it's needed.

993
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:16,968
However, a point of interest.

994
01:14:17,548 --> 01:14:20,449
I believe the last time the council voted, it was a four to three.

995
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:28,552
So even if the home rule petition goes on a four to three, my understanding is that from here, it has to go to the legislature and the legislature has to approve it.

996
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:41,709
Quite frankly, gentlemen, I had, sorry, gentlemen and ladies, I have some very concerns that in reality this may not pass in a democratic legislature, that we may get stuck in committee with a home rule petition and we may never see the light of day.

997
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:47,253
So I would encourage those of you who are also looking to go both ways in terms of continue to collect the signatures.

998
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:51,656
It is absolutely imperative that both processes continue at the same time.

999
01:14:52,136 --> 01:14:58,401
I think your goodwill and your trust in us, the citizens of Medford, not me personally,

1000
01:14:59,176 --> 01:15:12,003
would give you an opportunity to say that even though we may get downed at the legislature level, there is a real ferment on the part of the city for us to do a honest charter review for no specific purpose than just to review it.

1001
01:15:12,483 --> 01:15:12,804
Thank you.

1002
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:25,111
The motion, the resolution of 16-072 is before us on the floor.

1003
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,661
And there's a motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

1004
01:15:31,002 --> 01:15:31,722
Did you want to speak?

1005
01:15:33,383 --> 01:15:34,343
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1006
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:34,824
Please do.

1007
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:44,989
I just want to make sure that people viewing this realize the intent of this is truly to create a citizen-driven decision-making process.

1008
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:53,554
So this is not a process in which an elected body goes behind closed doors and decides what the chart is going to be.

1009
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:57,916
This is going to be an elected body of the people, elected by the people,

1010
01:15:58,343 --> 01:16:04,327
that will eventually put any recommendations, if there are any, on the ballot for a vote of the people.

1011
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:08,610
I can't see any more of a democratic process than that, Mr. President.

1012
01:16:09,211 --> 01:16:17,957
And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that I thank all my colleagues for the spirited dialogue and debate on this.

1013
01:16:18,797 --> 01:16:21,539
Dialogue and debate is very healthy on any issue.

1014
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,643
And I'm hoping that, through all the discussion we had, this is the fourth time

1015
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,662
This has been on the council agenda or before the council.

1016
01:16:31,402 --> 01:16:42,246
And, uh, I think over that period of time, uh, we actually came out with a document through recommendations of this body and through citizens that I believe is a much better document.

1017
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:47,529
And I am a little more optimistic that this will go through the state legislature.

1018
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:54,872
I had a conversation with representative Donato recently, and he said there are currently five or six

1019
01:16:55,772 --> 01:17:02,598
home rule petitions currently right now making its way through the state legislature for the creation of a charter commission.

1020
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:04,880
So we're not the only ones trying to do this.

1021
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:07,407
and help expedite the process.

1022
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:17,069
We may be the only community that waited 30 years, but by no stretch are we the only community that is trying to work on behalf of the citizens.

1023
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:25,732
If I can make this an easier process, rather than having people go out and try to obtain 5,000 signatures, that's my job to listen to the public.

1024
01:17:26,132 --> 01:17:28,092
And I've listened to them over the last several years.

1025
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:30,013
And I hear the outcry.

1026
01:17:30,342 --> 01:17:35,246
This is not a very sexy issue to talk about, but it's needed in our community.

1027
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:51,619
And maybe there isn't an outcry that you hear walking down the street, but in my opinion, uh, you know, anytime that, uh, we can act on behalf of the citizens, I think we're doing everyone, um, uh, a good thing in this community.

1028
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:59,666
And I just want to say, uh, from the start, the city solicitor, uh, spent a lot of time and effort, uh, helping craft,

1029
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:14,445
the language, helping put forth language that would be acceptable to the state legislature, reaching out to the legal counsel in the state legislature to find out how it has to be worded and so forth.

1030
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:25,534
So I really would like, you know, a lot of times he goes unnoticed, but I'd like to thank City Solicitor Rumley for his efforts on putting together a document.

1031
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:28,937
It was only last week that we asked him to craft this home rule petition.

1032
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,959
And I know he has a lot of other things on his plate.

1033
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:40,341
And to come out with such a document really is a tribute to this city and to the work that Mr. Rumley does as city solicitor.

1034
01:18:40,661 --> 01:18:46,803
And again, I want to thank my colleagues and the general public that have come up and voiced their opinion on this.

1035
01:18:47,643 --> 01:18:55,225
And I'm hoping, Mr. President, within the next several months that we're going to get approval from the state legislature

1036
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:57,325
and start working on the second half.

1037
01:18:57,605 --> 01:18:58,726
I agree with some of the speakers.

1038
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:03,186
We need to put together a document that shows the process for running.

1039
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:04,627
How does one run?

1040
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,187
How many signatures do you need?

1041
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:11,008
And I think this will take place, but we have to take one step at a time.

1042
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:24,850
And I think that notification through Reverse 911, through literature, through using public access, the PEG stations, we can get that message out to the public.

1043
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,027
and anyone that is interested in serving on the Charter Commission.

1044
01:19:28,327 --> 01:19:29,669
So again, I want to thank my colleagues.

1045
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:34,596
This is not a very easy issue to vote for, but I think it's the right thing to do, Mr. President.

1046
01:19:34,616 --> 01:19:35,877
Thank you.

1047
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:39,723
If you wish to address us, good evening and welcome.

1048
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:41,345
Please state your name and address for the record.

1049
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:43,592
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1050
01:19:43,973 --> 01:19:59,224
I think Councilor Marks probably just said what I was going to say, that I think the most important thing, either way we go, signatures or home rule petition, is to make sure that we get this out, that people know what this is, because I can't tell you how many people thought I was collecting signatures to open a charter school.

1051
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:01,626
They have no idea what a charter is.

1052
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:02,707
They don't know what's in it.

1053
01:20:02,767 --> 01:20:04,368
They don't know why they would want to change it.

1054
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:08,772
And I think it's the responsibility of the city to

1055
01:20:09,348 --> 01:20:10,508
help get that information out.

1056
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:18,411
It's nice that small groups are having little meetings, but it has to come from the city to educate and let people know what's really happening.

1057
01:20:19,772 --> 01:20:20,692
Thank you very much.

1058
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:31,015
So on the motion for approval by councillor marks it to that this be forwarded to the mayor for approval and then onto the legislature.

1059
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:35,017
So on that motion,

1060
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:40,371
As seconded by Vice President Lago-Kern, roll call has been requested.

1061
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:41,732
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1062
01:20:44,113 --> 01:20:44,994
Councilor Cavill?

1063
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:45,334
No.

1064
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:47,055
Councilor Falco?

1065
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:47,516
Yes.

1066
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:48,736
Councilor Knight?

1067
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:49,197
No.

1068
01:20:49,817 --> 01:20:50,798
Vice President Lago-Kern?

1069
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:51,218
Yes.

1070
01:20:51,718 --> 01:20:52,279
Councilor Monk?

1071
01:20:52,799 --> 01:20:53,119
Yes.

1072
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:54,240
Councilor Scott Pelli?

1073
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,580
Yes.

1074
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,381
President Del Rosso?

1075
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:56,842
No.

1076
01:20:57,042 --> 01:21:01,685
With the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion carries.

1077
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:08,354
Did we get everybody?

1078
01:21:08,374 --> 01:21:09,355
We got one more piece.

1079
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:14,059
We're going to invite a applicant for a taxicab driver's license.

1080
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:21,265
President, is Mr. Hickam Hamdi present from Revere?

1081
01:21:21,285 --> 01:21:24,808
148 on the motion of Councilor Caviello to take the motion matter off the table.

1082
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:25,829
All those in favor?

1083
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:27,991
All those opposed?

1084
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,612
The applicant is before us.

1085
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:33,095
Welcome, Mr. Councilor.

1086
01:21:33,215 --> 01:21:35,057
You are the chairman of the committee.

1087
01:21:36,985 --> 01:21:37,605
of taxis.

1088
01:22:11,124 --> 01:22:14,065
On the motion approved by Councillor Caviello, all those in favour?

1089
01:22:15,065 --> 01:22:15,905
All those opposed?

1090
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:19,866
Congratulations, you are a licensed cab driver in the city of Medford, sir.

1091
01:22:19,986 --> 01:22:20,626
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:21,186
Congratulations.

1093
01:22:21,206 --> 01:22:22,146
You have a good name.

1094
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:26,447
Thank you.

1095
01:22:26,467 --> 01:22:28,348
Now, back to the regular order of business.

1096
01:22:28,508 --> 01:22:32,429
On that motion by Vice-President Klunko-Kern, all those in favour?

1097
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:33,889
All those opposed?

1098
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,589
Motion carries 16-096.

1099
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:44,241
offered by Vice President Lago-Curran, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council Committee of the Whole meetings be televised.

1100
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:46,162
Madam Vice President, please, if you would.

1101
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:48,082
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1102
01:22:48,102 --> 01:22:49,862
I'll be brief on this one.

1103
01:22:50,062 --> 01:22:57,103
We had a committee of the whole meeting two to three weeks ago with regards to the, actually regards to the charter review.

1104
01:22:57,924 --> 01:23:00,464
It was in this council chambers.

1105
01:23:00,504 --> 01:23:04,645
I believe it started at 530 or six o'clock and it was televised.

1106
01:23:05,265 --> 01:23:06,225
Since that time,

1107
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:23,089
I've gotten a lot of people stating how happy they were to be able to watch a Committee of the Whole meeting at home instead of having someone take notes or somebody having to read minutes or us having to explain what we discussed in room 207.

1108
01:23:23,129 --> 01:23:36,195
I think it would make for a much more transparent process if we could have all of our Committee of the Whole meetings televised, whether we have to do it in this room or some way we can figure out how to do it in room 207, where I know it's

1109
01:23:36,752 --> 01:23:43,636
little bit more of a relaxed atmosphere, but I think it's worth paying videographers to do that.

1110
01:23:43,736 --> 01:23:45,997
I think it's definitely more transparent.

1111
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:53,381
It's a way for people that can't make it here on any given night or at all to be able to see what we're discussing on a weekly basis.

1112
01:23:54,022 --> 01:23:57,423
We usually have committee of the whole meetings, sometimes every week.

1113
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:59,064
I know there was one at 6 o'clock.

1114
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:02,026
There's a committee meeting tomorrow, subcommittee meeting.

1115
01:24:03,095 --> 01:24:10,899
But I think it's just a great way to go, and I think it's going to go along with what the mayor is doing with regards to getting more stuff up on our website.

1116
01:24:10,919 --> 01:24:27,706
I think that it's definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that we can make that happen with regards to, especially committee of the whole meetings, but also any type of subcommittee meetings to make it transparent and open to the public as much as possible.

1117
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:29,347
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1118
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,532
Mr. President, I think this is a great resolve, a great resolution.

1119
01:24:32,993 --> 01:24:34,994
The Subcommittee on Rules will be meeting tomorrow evening.

1120
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:38,095
I'd ask that the paper be referred to the Subcommittee on Rules for deliberation.

1121
01:24:38,876 --> 01:24:44,939
On the motion that this paper be sent to the Subcommittee on Rules by Councilor Knight.

1122
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:48,781
Madam Vice President.

1123
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:56,325
I'd like to make the recommendation to the Subcommittee on Rules, but I'd also like a roll call vote on the actual paper.

1124
01:24:57,106 --> 01:24:57,406
Thank you.

1125
01:24:58,667 --> 01:24:59,327
Councilor Cavillo.

1126
01:24:59,814 --> 01:25:00,734
Thank you, Mr. President.

1127
01:25:01,274 --> 01:25:02,835
I agree with my vice presidents.

1128
01:25:04,315 --> 01:25:16,800
I would hope that the mayor has the foresight to put this in the budget for next year so we could either pay for some cameras in the other room or pay for staff to do it in this room.

1129
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:21,101
Because currently, I don't think that's in our budget for staffing for this year.

1130
01:25:22,902 --> 01:25:26,063
Or maybe find some money to pay people to come in now and do it.

1131
01:25:26,323 --> 01:25:27,183
But I say I would hope the mayor.

1132
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,861
puts it in the budget for next year's budget for next year.

1133
01:25:30,261 --> 01:25:30,601
Very good.

1134
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:45,628
So on the motion of Vice President Longo Kern for approval and that it be sent to the subcommittee on rules as seconded by Councilor Knight or as moved by Councilor Knight as well.

1135
01:25:45,668 --> 01:25:46,888
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1136
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:52,510
Councilor Canvio?

1137
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:52,931
Yes.

1138
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:54,331
Councilor Fevella?

1139
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:54,691
Yes.

1140
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:55,712
Councilor Knight?

1141
01:25:55,772 --> 01:25:55,972
Yes.

1142
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,560
Vice President Lundell-Curran?

1143
01:25:57,661 --> 01:25:57,941
Yes.

1144
01:25:58,381 --> 01:25:58,921
Councillor Martins?

1145
01:25:59,201 --> 01:25:59,481
Yes.

1146
01:26:00,342 --> 01:26:01,022
Councillor Scott-Pelley?

1147
01:26:01,062 --> 01:26:01,342
Yes.

1148
01:26:01,362 --> 01:26:02,963
President Dela Cruz?

1149
01:26:03,043 --> 01:26:03,223
No.

1150
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:05,665
The vote is six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1151
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:06,385
The motion carries.

1152
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:07,185
Congratulations.

1153
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:25,035
16-098 offered by Vice President Lundell-Curran be it resolved that the Medford Police Department along with the City of Medford come up with a plan on how to better address notification and warning to residents with regards to break-ins and other crimes, especially in those neighborhoods that have had multiple incidents

1154
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:27,728
as of recent.

1155
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:28,769
Madam Vice President.

1156
01:26:29,089 --> 01:26:30,609
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1157
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:37,031
I think this kind of goes along with my last discussion with regards to just televised meetings.

1158
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:50,956
I know the chief of police and a number of officers, detectives, I've actually been to a community meeting where there were probably six or seven officers and detectives present at the Medford Police Department.

1159
01:26:51,236 --> 01:26:53,677
Now those happen, I believe, once a month and they

1160
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:59,913
evening meetings, I think we need to do something.

1161
01:26:59,973 --> 01:27:11,878
We need to make recommendations to not only the administration within City Hall, but also our police department and our chief of police, because people have serious questions with regards to what's going on.

1162
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:21,042
Within the last few weeks, month or so, there's been some break-ins, and it's happening in a few different areas in Medford.

1163
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:32,010
people more are starting to complain about notification and lack of notification to surrounding homes and neighborhoods.

1164
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:47,696
Obviously, if there's a break-in, letting people know on the street and the surrounding streets what's going on, what has been brought forward, what do the police know, what can the police divulge, obviously, and how do they protect their homes and make them safe, and what should people be worried about.

1165
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:58,009
It's something that we lack in the city, and I think that we need to really work on better notification.

1166
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:13,116
The complaints obviously were with break-ins, which is why I put that on, but we've also got emails within the last couple days with regards to drug activity in certain neighborhoods.

1167
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:15,757
I believe one email came from the Salem Street neighborhood.

1168
01:28:16,177 --> 01:28:17,938
I know that when we discussed the new

1169
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:21,050
Chinese restaurant that went in on Salem Street.

1170
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:26,433
There were a number of residents who were concerned and had questions and wanted them answered.

1171
01:28:26,793 --> 01:28:32,497
At that time, we did bring up the public safety summit, which I know Council Member Axe is going to discuss later on in the meeting.

1172
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:35,499
And that is another thing that is very important.

1173
01:28:35,599 --> 01:28:42,523
But I think that the meetings within the police department have to maybe be televised, or they have to

1174
01:28:43,155 --> 01:28:55,406
just discuss or let people know that they're going to be discussing certain issues such as break-ins in the West Medford area, which I know was a complaint, or drug activity in the Salem Street area, which I know was another complaint.

1175
01:28:56,226 --> 01:29:05,414
We need to let the public know what's going on and how we can improve it, whether we do, you know, safety committees within the city or watch groups.

1176
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:08,617
We need to do something, and we need to notify the public better.

1177
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:14,852
And we need to make sure that people are able to keep their homes safe and know what's going on in the area.

1178
01:29:14,952 --> 01:29:24,136
I would like to know always what's going on in my neighborhood, as we all would like to, to be able to keep our homes safe, our families safe, and our cars safe.

1179
01:29:24,216 --> 01:29:26,277
Because that was another one, car break-ins.

1180
01:29:27,037 --> 01:29:34,780
So if we could ask the chief of police to work with the mayor and figure out a way that we can notify the public better.

1181
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,461
And I think one avenue is that.

1182
01:29:36,945 --> 01:29:44,731
meeting that the chief of police has with the, you know, whatever residents are willing to, you know, and able to make it to the meetings.

1183
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:46,472
I think that is one way to start.

1184
01:29:46,933 --> 01:29:50,776
The community meeting that the police chief has every couple of weeks.

1185
01:29:51,456 --> 01:30:01,424
It was just approached by Councilor Marks that we merge his item, which is 16-100 and with yours since they're similar matters.

1186
01:30:01,924 --> 01:30:03,565
So if you have no problem with that.

1187
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:04,786
I have no problem.

1188
01:30:04,826 --> 01:30:05,587
And actually when I,

1189
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:11,728
respond to these emails or posts or however people are discussing with me.

1190
01:30:11,768 --> 01:30:16,010
I think I was approached twice within the last few weeks with regards to this type of issue.

1191
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:17,270
I bring that up.

1192
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:24,833
I bring up, um, I know that council marks and the rest of the council has voted, I think twice, maybe three times to have a public safety summit.

1193
01:30:24,893 --> 01:30:30,935
So definitely I think it's relative and, um, completely related to this topic.

1194
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:34,336
Um, and it's just something we need to do better.

1195
01:30:34,356 --> 01:30:37,097
We need more transparency with, you know,

1196
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,421
crime going on in our community.

1197
01:30:40,882 --> 01:30:42,463
Thank you very much, madam vice president.

1198
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:44,564
Chair recognizes councilor Scott Peller.

1199
01:30:45,544 --> 01:30:48,926
I thank my colleague for bringing that up, this topic up.

1200
01:30:49,427 --> 01:31:05,676
It also reinforces what we've talked about when I've been talking to constituents with the safety summit, talking about getting the people out and listening to more community policing and possible substations around the community.

1201
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:32,066
There is an outcry to support the chief and the police department in making sure that we give them the tools that they need to make sure that this all falls into fruition with notification and more feet on the ground and looking at different locations where those hotspots are.

1202
01:31:32,346 --> 01:31:34,408
One of the conversations talking about the T,

1203
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:45,457
mechanic building on the end of, uh, on Salem street, looking at being, being a great idea for a, for a substation.

1204
01:31:46,078 --> 01:32:00,782
And the word from that neighborhood is looking at the, um, crime rate in that area and looking to use that to subdue, subdue the, the, the, um, the, the fair and that area.

1205
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:01,922
So thank you.

1206
01:32:02,443 --> 01:32:03,563
Thank you, Mr. Counselor.

1207
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,641
Councilor Falco.

1208
01:32:04,821 --> 01:32:05,741
Thank you, Mr. President.

1209
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:08,223
Um, I support this, uh, resolution a hundred percent.

1210
01:32:08,243 --> 01:32:09,164
I think it's a great idea.

1211
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:15,989
And I think that, you know, communication is always the key in communicating with the various neighborhoods, especially with regards to crime.

1212
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:23,395
And you know, the more people in a specific neighborhood that know about an issue, you know, everybody can keep an eye out for each other.

1213
01:32:23,415 --> 01:32:31,161
And I think one of the, uh, you know, I did a little bit of research when I saw the resolution because the, you know, the different things that different communities do.

1214
01:32:31,221 --> 01:32:33,403
And I noticed one, one community does, um,

1215
01:32:34,207 --> 01:32:37,269
I think there's an email application, I think it's called Next Door.

1216
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:40,050
And so it's set up by a neighborhood.

1217
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:45,073
And basically, I belong to the North Medford neighborhood.

1218
01:32:45,933 --> 01:33:00,542
And so what the police department could do is send an email blast to that group and say, OK, there's issues in North Medford, or whatever part of Medford you want it to be, and say there's been break-ins, car break-ins, house break-ins.

1219
01:33:00,582 --> 01:33:03,083
But at least they could notify.

1220
01:33:04,837 --> 01:33:14,479
The public, it's a low cost option, I think, and I think it would be quite useful and everybody would at least be on the same page and get official word from the police department.

1221
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:16,640
So I think this is, it's a really good resolution.

1222
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:17,960
I think communication is the key.

1223
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,440
I think that's one option that we could go with.

1224
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:29,502
I think updating the, I'm not sure if we have the, you know, the, the, you know, enough officers to do this, but actually, um,

1225
01:33:30,047 --> 01:33:34,009
updating the website on a regular basis with regard to issues that are going on in the community.

1226
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:45,573
Um, I looked at another town that actually had maps of the city and literally had, you know, uh, you know, like pins where there were various issues throughout the community.

1227
01:33:46,074 --> 01:33:47,634
Um, so that's another way of looking at it.

1228
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:51,456
So there were options that I think that can, that, uh, that the city could use.

1229
01:33:51,476 --> 01:33:56,078
I think there are low cost options and I think this is something that needs to be looked at and needs to be addressed.

1230
01:33:56,438 --> 01:33:57,238
And I supported this.

1231
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:57,999
So thank you.

1232
01:33:58,219 --> 01:33:58,999
Thank you very much.

1233
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,130
Councilor Marks.

1234
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:02,331
Thank you, Mr. President.

1235
01:34:02,491 --> 01:34:06,673
And I want to thank Councilor Longo for bringing up this issue.

1236
01:34:07,293 --> 01:34:07,853
And she's right.

1237
01:34:08,253 --> 01:34:17,456
The councilors over the last two or three years has voted at least three occasions unanimously to set up a public safety summit in this community.

1238
01:34:17,937 --> 01:34:27,460
And it's based on issues throughout the community, throughout all the neighborhoods on public safety and ways we can improve public safety in our community.

1239
01:34:27,857 --> 01:34:32,781
Councilor Scott Pelly hit the nail on the head, and I believe it was discussed last week about community policing.

1240
01:34:33,721 --> 01:34:43,268
Because of a lack of grants and so forth, this community has moved away from community policing, and I think that it's detrimental.

1241
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:57,258
I believe having an officer on beat, whether it's on a bicycle, on foot, whatever it may be, in a neighborhood, in a business district, I think serves this community well, and I'd like to see community policing come back again.

1242
01:34:58,032 --> 01:34:58,773
in our community.

1243
01:34:59,513 --> 01:35:03,835
I'd also like to see the police department do some crime data reporting.

1244
01:35:04,835 --> 01:35:12,079
I mean, it's like pulling teeth trying to figure out the number of robberies in this city, armed robberies, house break-ins, car vandalism.

1245
01:35:12,459 --> 01:35:15,040
It's very difficult to get this data.

1246
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:23,604
And to me, we should be able to go on the police site or city hall website and be able to bring up the police department and see the number of break-ins.

1247
01:35:23,967 --> 01:35:35,976
and then see a comparison over the years and maybe be able to see where the hotspots are and be able to tell residents that, you know, we noticed that there's a lot of car break-ins in your particular area.

1248
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,417
This is what you should do.

1249
01:35:38,058 --> 01:35:40,660
You should leave your light on at your house, your front porch light.

1250
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,662
You should make it look like there's activity in the area.

1251
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:46,024
You know, just helpful hints.

1252
01:35:46,464 --> 01:35:52,669
And I never hear any of that within this community on how to protect yourself, your family,

1253
01:35:53,202 --> 01:35:54,003
and your property.

1254
01:35:54,743 --> 01:35:59,106
And you very seldom hear that within our city, but I think it's needed.

1255
01:35:59,347 --> 01:36:06,412
You know, we're not a dangerous community by any stretch of the imagination, but like any city, we have our fear of concerns and trouble.

1256
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:11,716
And brushing it under the rug or pretending it doesn't exist just doesn't work.

1257
01:36:12,556 --> 01:36:15,158
And, you know, I think we're finding that out the hard way.

1258
01:36:15,578 --> 01:36:21,903
Additionally, Mr. President, if there's a rash of robberies or break-ins in West Meffitt area, I live in Wellington.

1259
01:36:22,438 --> 01:36:24,898
But I think I should receive a call, too, saying, you know what?

1260
01:36:25,218 --> 01:36:26,719
There's been a rash in West Meffitt.

1261
01:36:26,999 --> 01:36:28,079
Guess what, Mr. President?

1262
01:36:28,119 --> 01:36:31,420
These people that are robbing, they're going to get wise to it, because they're crooks.

1263
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:32,600
And they're going to say, you know what?

1264
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,080
We already hit up West Meffitt enough.

1265
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,660
Let's head over to North Meffitt.

1266
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,160
Well, let's head over to South Meffitt.

1267
01:36:37,681 --> 01:36:43,161
We should be allowing residents to make that decision and know what's going on.

1268
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:52,043
Because if I didn't see Channel 7, the news, or I didn't read in the local paper, I wouldn't know there's the rash of robberies, home break-ins.

1269
01:36:52,395 --> 01:36:53,196
in this community.

1270
01:36:53,716 --> 01:36:56,659
And therefore, I wouldn't be vigilant and I wouldn't be looking out for it.

1271
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:06,707
My second point, Mr. President, years ago, I remember when I first ran for office, there used to be a neighborhood crime watch group in almost every section of this community.

1272
01:37:07,368 --> 01:37:13,393
And they got together, and what best to have a thousand set of eyes in a neighborhood looking out?

1273
01:37:13,433 --> 01:37:15,975
You know how you have the nosy neighbor that lives across the street?

1274
01:37:16,355 --> 01:37:16,756
Guess what?

1275
01:37:16,796 --> 01:37:18,037
That nosy neighbor can help

1276
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:21,893
prevent your home from being broken into, your car vandalized.

1277
01:37:22,373 --> 01:37:25,135
And these are the type of things that we want to encourage in the community.

1278
01:37:25,475 --> 01:37:33,441
We want people to talk amongst themselves and also have dialogue with the different neighborhoods and say, what do you experience in North Meffitt?

1279
01:37:33,661 --> 01:37:35,242
Are we seeing the same in Haines Square?

1280
01:37:35,442 --> 01:37:37,064
Are we seeing the same up at the hillside?

1281
01:37:37,404 --> 01:37:42,628
You know, these are the discussions that I was hoping to summit three times, Mr. President.

1282
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:47,051
I didn't get any feedback at all other than the paper going to the administration.

1283
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,025
And it's not just the recent administration.

1284
01:37:49,305 --> 01:37:55,328
It went to the old administration, saying that they forwarded the paper to the chief of police.

1285
01:37:56,028 --> 01:37:57,389
And then we never heard back again.

1286
01:37:58,209 --> 01:37:59,169
We never heard back again.

1287
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:07,913
I think it would be very helpful to have a public safety summit where we invite everyone to discuss the issues, Mr. President, things that they're seeing.

1288
01:38:08,253 --> 01:38:16,117
And we're not going to let out any secret recipe on how we're combating this, but we're going to get together and have a discussion and dialogue on

1289
01:38:16,638 --> 01:38:18,379
What ways can we communicate better?

1290
01:38:18,419 --> 01:38:21,420
What ways can we do to prevent?

1291
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:29,865
You know, what can residents do to help assist the police in trying to get the message out there in this community?

1292
01:38:29,905 --> 01:38:41,390
So I'm hoping, and you just mentioned to me, Mr. President, and I appreciate your work on this, that you're trying to gather all the different chiefs and department heads for this public safety summit.

1293
01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:46,293
And I'm hoping that helps us at least move forward on the issue.

1294
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:52,744
And let residents know, because the emails I'm receiving is people are concerned that they're not getting any communication.

1295
01:38:53,925 --> 01:38:55,806
And I think that's the concern.

1296
01:38:55,826 --> 01:39:08,694
And maybe if we said, you know what, next Tuesday, we're going to have a Committee of the Whole meeting where the chief is going to be up here and every other interested party to discuss this important issue, people know that the city is being proactive.

1297
01:39:09,495 --> 01:39:10,776
And right now, you don't see any of that.

1298
01:39:11,336 --> 01:39:15,719
So I want to thank Councilor Longo for putting this on, and my colleagues for bringing up

1299
01:39:16,349 --> 01:39:17,510
their concerns, Mr. President.

1300
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,891
Thank you very much, Counselor.

1301
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:19,991
Counselor Caravaglia.

1302
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,012
Thank you, Mr. President.

1303
01:39:21,493 --> 01:39:25,695
Being the victim of a daytime home break-in, I understand where this is coming from.

1304
01:39:26,376 --> 01:39:30,699
My house got broken into about a year and a half ago, 1130 in the morning.

1305
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:36,443
So I understand when you come home and you see your back door broken down and your house ransacked, I know what it feels like.

1306
01:39:36,463 --> 01:39:45,349
Part of the problem is with a police facility that's outdated and understaffed,

1307
01:39:47,661 --> 01:39:50,562
There's no way for these policemen to get the message out.

1308
01:39:51,142 --> 01:39:55,744
I don't know if the station has a media officer.

1309
01:39:57,265 --> 01:40:02,347
If the station even has a webpage to get the messages out to people.

1310
01:40:03,608 --> 01:40:06,989
Again, they're busting out the seams over there.

1311
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,630
The chief does his best.

1312
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,591
I've been to a lot of the Wednesday meetings.

1313
01:40:11,508 --> 01:40:15,310
You know, there's 20, 30 people there, but again, you know, they're jammed in that little room.

1314
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:18,511
There's no multimedia accessibility to anything.

1315
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:26,974
And let's say nowadays, you know, everybody's tied into their cell phone or their computer, and that's how the message has to get out, along with, you know, you see something, say something.

1316
01:40:28,115 --> 01:40:35,778
So again, you know, it's a, I, you know, I wish I had an answer for the people, but, you know, I would think,

1317
01:40:37,302 --> 01:40:44,384
getting our police station up and going and maybe hiring a media officer to address these issues would be a good start.

1318
01:40:45,564 --> 01:40:45,964
Very good.

1319
01:40:46,324 --> 01:40:47,604
Councilor Falco.

1320
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:48,445
Thank you, Mr. President.

1321
01:40:48,745 --> 01:40:56,146
Councilor Marks had mentioned a good point a couple of minutes ago with regard to statistics and crime data.

1322
01:40:56,747 --> 01:41:04,808
And I've only been on the council now for a short time, but can we like to request a report from the chief of police actually with regard to 2015 crime data just to

1323
01:41:07,362 --> 01:41:09,162
It would be interesting to see what we're dealing with.

1324
01:41:09,282 --> 01:41:15,844
But I'm not sure if the council has received reporting in the past, but I think it's something that we should get.

1325
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:19,645
It's something we should be aware of, and we should get on a regular basis.

1326
01:41:19,685 --> 01:41:25,986
But if we could start off with looking at 2015 data, I think that we'd be heading in the right direction by looking at that.

1327
01:41:26,106 --> 01:41:30,147
So item number 016-098 and 100, which we've moved the two of them together.

1328
01:41:36,033 --> 01:41:47,983
Motion approval on that as amended by Councilor Falco to have a 2015 crime statistics report presented by the Chief to the City Council.

1329
01:41:49,084 --> 01:41:50,505
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1330
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,407
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1331
01:41:52,767 --> 01:41:56,791
And piggybacking on Councilor Falco's amendment, Mr. President, I'd ask that

1332
01:41:57,703 --> 01:42:05,926
Also, any data related to overdoses, opiate overdoses be provided with the crime data.

1333
01:42:07,106 --> 01:42:19,850
The community has access to a GIS mapping system, and I think it might make sense for us to begin to mapping, to begin to start mapping where our crimes are occurring and where our high concentration of drug overdoses are to see if there's a trend, Mr. President.

1334
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:21,831
So I might ask that that information be included.

1335
01:42:23,812 --> 01:42:24,212
Very good.

1336
01:42:24,252 --> 01:42:25,833
It's further amended by Councilor Knight.

1337
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:27,113
Councilor Scott-Peller.

1338
01:42:27,633 --> 01:42:38,869
If I can't follow up with this, I think it's very important research-driven policymaking.

1339
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:44,737
I think what other communities are doing are using interns and

1340
01:42:45,199 --> 01:43:14,380
One thing that's been pretty consistent with our committee is a lot of it is looking to support efforts, whether it be DPW, police, fire, drug addiction issues, looking into the mayor possibly putting together a data team that would work for the city and that will collect data to support what we're trying to do throughout our community, not just with

1341
01:43:15,345 --> 01:43:19,186
with the police department, but this, this brings, brings it to light.

1342
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:44,730
I know that just today, um, at my summer stat meeting, I sat in front of, um, the mayor and, and he, we went through, um, about a 12, um, 12 page, uh, report about my department that, that supported or didn't support our numbers in recreation.

1343
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:54,795
And that helps us understand where we need to fix some deficiencies and then carry on with our positive issues.

1344
01:43:54,875 --> 01:44:11,863
So I think that if we can maybe reach out to the mayor and see if she can look into possibly researching what other communities are doing and collecting data, not just for one department, for all departments to support the needs of our community.

1345
01:44:11,923 --> 01:44:12,883
So thank you.

1346
01:44:13,344 --> 01:44:13,644
Thank you.

1347
01:44:14,587 --> 01:44:18,950
So on the motion for approval, as amended by Councillors Falco, Scarpelli, and Knight.

1348
01:44:19,831 --> 01:44:20,892
Mr. Citizen, welcome.

1349
01:44:20,932 --> 01:44:22,473
Please state your name and address for the record.

1350
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:23,974
Thank you, Mr. President.

1351
01:44:24,034 --> 01:44:25,915
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1352
01:44:26,436 --> 01:44:30,439
I want to thank Councillors Longo, Kern, and Marks for bringing up these topics.

1353
01:44:30,959 --> 01:44:36,103
I'm of the humble opinion that government's first duty is protection of the citizens.

1354
01:44:36,984 --> 01:44:40,306
Councillor Carviello, I think hit it right on the head.

1355
01:44:40,783 --> 01:44:49,170
I do attend the first Wednesday of the month police chief town hall meetings where there are sergeants and detectives.

1356
01:44:49,611 --> 01:44:51,893
It's every first Wednesday of the month at 7 o'clock.

1357
01:44:54,095 --> 01:45:00,661
We need to fully staff our police force and we need to get them a better station.

1358
01:45:00,841 --> 01:45:05,585
On March 18th, four officers will be graduating from the academy.

1359
01:45:06,022 --> 01:45:13,545
given us a total of 105 offices in Medford, putting us about 25 offices short for a city of our size.

1360
01:45:14,066 --> 01:45:22,889
Now, these informational meetings, I would encourage people to go that might be watching and listening to me right now.

1361
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:24,790
They have refreshments there.

1362
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:26,351
You can ask any questions.

1363
01:45:27,151 --> 01:45:30,993
The things you find out are very pertinent.

1364
01:45:34,048 --> 01:45:43,494
Like what I found out at the last meeting was, with just an additional 10 officers, they could be able to be doing so much more for the citizens of Medford.

1365
01:45:43,994 --> 01:45:45,475
They just got a Twitter account.

1366
01:45:46,076 --> 01:45:48,097
I'm pretty sure it's at medfordpolice.com.

1367
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:51,792
But I would either Bing or Google search that to make sure.

1368
01:45:52,893 --> 01:46:04,041
But one of the reactions of having this Twitter account now is that the media will be asking them questions about different things that they're working on.

1369
01:46:04,621 --> 01:46:12,107
And this takes a lot of time away from the officers to be able to do their duty.

1370
01:46:12,847 --> 01:46:16,610
They're making about one arrest a week on drug charges.

1371
01:46:17,566 --> 01:46:25,951
There's somebody else going around the city now targeting Hondas, stealing the tire right off the car using a silent drill.

1372
01:46:26,191 --> 01:46:30,834
There's a lot going on, and there's a lot that can be learned at this informational meeting.

1373
01:46:31,154 --> 01:46:39,859
But as Councillor Riccabiello pointed out, they need the offices to be able to have good communication with the people, to be able to be in every

1374
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:48,093
neighborhood of our city to be enforcing the law and having a much stronger and sounder public safety.

1375
01:46:48,353 --> 01:46:49,495
But they need the officers.

1376
01:46:50,076 --> 01:46:52,879
Just 10 more officers would do a world of good for Medford.

1377
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,743
And as far as communication goes,

1378
01:46:57,188 --> 01:47:03,310
This city is sitting on almost a half a million dollars in collected fees from the Verizon and Comcast accounts.

1379
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:07,712
It's long past due that we open up our TV3 station.

1380
01:47:07,952 --> 01:47:09,072
We could be talking about this.

1381
01:47:09,332 --> 01:47:12,053
We could be talking about the charter review and explaining it to people.

1382
01:47:12,393 --> 01:47:14,154
As Councilor Knight points out, people don't know.

1383
01:47:14,514 --> 01:47:16,955
Well, let's really open up the doors of communication.

1384
01:47:17,215 --> 01:47:20,016
The chief could have his own show on TV3.

1385
01:47:21,116 --> 01:47:25,738
We could be doing a lot more for communication in this city and a lot more for public

1386
01:47:26,178 --> 01:47:26,598
safety.

1387
01:47:27,219 --> 01:47:28,660
You're sitting on the funds to do it.

1388
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:34,725
I would respectfully ask you to please get the ball rolling in that area.

1389
01:47:34,845 --> 01:47:40,409
And I thank you again for bringing this up, and I thank the councillors for their input.

1390
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:43,532
And again, Councillor Kerrio hit it right on the head.

1391
01:47:43,572 --> 01:47:44,893
Thank you, Mr. President.

1392
01:47:44,913 --> 01:47:46,414
Thank you very much, Mr. Kibushi.

1393
01:47:46,514 --> 01:47:47,194
Good evening, ma'am.

1394
01:47:47,215 --> 01:47:48,976
Please state your name and address for the record, Jean.

1395
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:50,837
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1396
01:47:51,078 --> 01:47:54,040
Just one thing, I'm all for the statistics program.

1397
01:47:54,485 --> 01:47:56,086
that we need to have that out in the open.

1398
01:47:56,507 --> 01:48:02,992
What I don't want to see is a link between the numbers of officers we hire and crime statistics, and I'll tell you why.

1399
01:48:03,933 --> 01:48:13,982
If you're doing a good job and you determine crime because you have a lot of police officers on the street, they're friendly, they're getting out there, they know what's going on, the neighborhood crime goes down.

1400
01:48:14,442 --> 01:48:20,187
Well, if you deplete them because the crime level goes down, your crime level is going to go back up.

1401
01:48:20,743 --> 01:48:22,564
So I just wanted to make, do you understand what I'm saying?

1402
01:48:22,664 --> 01:48:23,284
No, I guess not.

1403
01:48:23,484 --> 01:48:25,585
I see some questions in there, in the faces.

1404
01:48:26,306 --> 01:48:35,550
If the police officers, if we increase it by 10, and we have people walking the streets, police officers are walking the streets, crime is actually going to go down.

1405
01:48:36,851 --> 01:48:48,957
And if it goes down, and we link crime statistics to the amount of officers, then what you don't want to do is delete the officers because crime is down, because the reason why it's

1406
01:48:50,132 --> 01:48:55,395
up why crime is doing well, I mean not doing well, is because there's presence out there.

1407
01:48:55,735 --> 01:48:58,737
So we want to increase them by 10, which I'm all for, you know that.

1408
01:48:59,598 --> 01:49:04,861
But I don't want to link the data of crime statistics to the numbers of officers we need.

1409
01:49:05,601 --> 01:49:07,803
We need to base it on presence.

1410
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:15,007
And if they get out there, they're friendly, they're getting to know everybody, they know what areas are, you know, I want to see them walking the beat, I really do.

1411
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:17,268
I think that's the best thing, to deter crime.

1412
01:49:17,989 --> 01:49:19,770
Officers walking the beat in large numbers.

1413
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:21,342
so that they feel supported.

1414
01:49:23,043 --> 01:49:29,008
But I don't want to link the two, because what happens is, as we know, well, we're doing great.

1415
01:49:29,649 --> 01:49:30,269
Crime is down.

1416
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:36,474
Let's change out these officers for police, for fire, or DPW workers, or something else.

1417
01:49:36,855 --> 01:49:39,617
And then your police officers will, the crime will go up again.

1418
01:49:40,037 --> 01:49:40,518
So thank you.

1419
01:49:40,758 --> 01:49:41,238
Thank you.

1420
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:43,200
Good evening.

1421
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,741
Please state your name and address for the record.

1422
01:49:45,922 --> 01:49:46,222
Hi there.

1423
01:49:46,743 --> 01:49:49,125
Still Rachel Tannenhaus, still live at 26 Pearl Street.

1424
01:49:52,071 --> 01:49:54,011
So, two things.

1425
01:49:54,311 --> 01:50:10,096
One, just to build on what Gene said, I don't know if an analogy would be useful, but I, in the public health world, we sometimes have a problem with programs working so well that they put themselves out of business, and then the problem gets bad again.

1426
01:50:11,076 --> 01:50:20,039
This has happened in particular, work with me here, this has happened in particular with programs to prevent HIV and AIDS,

1427
01:50:20,578 --> 01:50:38,215
where in areas that were well-funded for that, they did a really great job, and then the rate of HIV went down, and they were no longer a crisis area, and the programs no longer got funded, and then as soon as they got defunded, because the money went to crisis areas, and then as soon as they got defunded, the numbers went back up again.

1428
01:50:38,875 --> 01:50:45,822
So it's a similar sort of thing where, you know, I can see what you're saying with

1429
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:59,866
If you're basing the number of officers you've got on what the crime statistics are right then, it may wind up being a cycle that continues feeding itself.

1430
01:51:00,806 --> 01:51:14,272
But the other thing is that if you're having this public safety summit, I think it's really important to make sure that you do outreach to every possible community and take a look at who's not at the table and make sure that

1431
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:19,466
You're making note of that and making sure that they can come to the table.

1432
01:51:19,966 --> 01:51:32,336
I say this because while in a lot of cases neighborhood watches do help with safety, sometimes what they help with is keeping areas, keeping homogeneity in an area.

1433
01:51:35,915 --> 01:51:43,638
Every now and then, things go wrong with the Neighborhood Watch program, and it turns into, help, I just saw someone who's browner than I am.

1434
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,299
And we do not want that to happen.

1435
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:50,401
We want these things to be, and it's not even necessarily on purpose.

1436
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:52,762
The person may not be thinking about that consciously.

1437
01:51:53,962 --> 01:51:55,343
But we don't want it to be like that.

1438
01:51:55,383 --> 01:52:04,166
We want it to be something that actually deals with safety and doesn't deal with, hey, I don't feel like that person belongs here because they're different from me.

1439
01:52:06,133 --> 01:52:31,175
So please make sure that all impacted communities, including those who sometimes have had, lately there are people with disabilities, for example, sometimes have not always the greatest relationship with law enforcement because sometimes there's misunderstandings about what the needs of particular populations are.

1440
01:52:31,942 --> 01:52:34,324
Um, so you want to make sure that's an example.

1441
01:52:34,384 --> 01:52:36,986
You want to make sure that communities of color are represented.

1442
01:52:37,046 --> 01:52:46,112
You want to, I mean, you want to make sure that folks from all different socioeconomic, uh, groups are at the table at this, um, summit.

1443
01:52:46,533 --> 01:52:50,375
So just please make sure you take a look around and say, who's not at the table yet.

1444
01:52:50,475 --> 01:52:51,836
Let's make sure we can get them here.

1445
01:52:52,377 --> 01:52:52,697
Thank you.

1446
01:52:54,918 --> 01:52:55,499
Thank you, Mr. President.

1447
01:52:55,519 --> 01:53:01,263
You know, um, council Scott Pelley and, um, and Councilor Falco mentioned about data collection.

1448
01:53:02,477 --> 01:53:04,478
and facts and figures for the police.

1449
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:10,922
I was doing a little work a couple of weeks ago, and I was looking at some of the cities and towns.

1450
01:53:12,723 --> 01:53:17,205
Our capability of collecting data over here is minimal.

1451
01:53:17,705 --> 01:53:26,390
I mean, a small town down the Cape, which is probably 20% the size of us, has an IT department.

1452
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:29,592
They have five people on their IT department gathering things.

1453
01:53:30,072 --> 01:53:31,893
We have one person in the city,

1454
01:53:33,127 --> 01:53:34,828
for our IT department to gather things.

1455
01:53:35,328 --> 01:53:40,891
That's a real concern where we, you know, don't know how to get these things.

1456
01:53:41,251 --> 01:53:45,034
I mean, we have computer equipment that's antiquated.

1457
01:53:45,914 --> 01:53:50,417
Councilor Falco just handed me a list over something that Cambridge has.

1458
01:53:52,037 --> 01:54:00,162
They have nice facts and figure sheets for a month, for a one-month period that they hand out that's on their web sheet.

1459
01:54:01,213 --> 01:54:04,896
I would say he doesn't have the capabilities of doing these.

1460
01:54:04,956 --> 01:54:18,807
I mean, it's time we step up into the new generation and get more people that do more jobs that are more computer driven versus paper people.

1461
01:54:20,028 --> 01:54:29,916
So again, I think every week we sit here, we ask for things, we ask for things, but we don't have any people to do anything, to do the jobs that are needed.

1462
01:54:31,954 --> 01:54:32,875
I mean, I'm around the city.

1463
01:54:32,895 --> 01:54:33,895
I go to the police department.

1464
01:54:34,395 --> 01:54:35,736
I see the computers they have in there.

1465
01:54:36,016 --> 01:54:37,176
They're antiquated.

1466
01:54:37,196 --> 01:54:39,077
They don't even have a phone system in the police department.

1467
01:54:39,817 --> 01:54:45,259
If you want to call the chief on the main number, you have to hang up and they have to use another phone to call the chief.

1468
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:54,422
So, I mean, I think the whole police station, and again, it goes back to the fact that we don't have a modern police station with modern equipment.

1469
01:54:56,042 --> 01:54:57,463
And that's where it all stems from, Mr. President.

1470
01:54:58,226 --> 01:54:59,987
on the motion for approval as amended.

1471
01:55:00,007 --> 01:55:00,887
All those in favor?

1472
01:55:03,608 --> 01:55:03,768
Huh?

1473
01:55:06,369 --> 01:55:06,569
Huh?

1474
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:09,350
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1475
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:13,212
I just want to wrap it up and agree with my colleagues.

1476
01:55:13,272 --> 01:55:19,714
We need, and obviously the public that has spoken, we've discussed it many, many times before, we need a new police station.

1477
01:55:19,754 --> 01:55:20,794
We need more officers.

1478
01:55:21,455 --> 01:55:24,516
It's always been discussed, we need revolving new,

1479
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:27,571
police cars out on the roads.

1480
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:30,632
I think that's all, we all agree with that.

1481
01:55:30,752 --> 01:55:42,557
But in the time being, since that's not gonna happen overnight, and I think communication needs to happen immediately, I ask that the chief of police and the mayor get together and brainstorm some ideas on how to get communication out.

1482
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:55,243
And it can be as simple as the police department starting a Facebook page or Twitter, which I guess they've done, and letting the people know that at the next community policing meeting,

1483
01:55:55,862 --> 01:56:15,069
They're going to discuss A, B, and C. I mean, a way to get the agenda out and a way to get people to understand and know what's going to be discussed and for the discussion to be had, not only how can things be prevented, but what are the target areas, what areas do we need to look at, and how can we make it, obviously, safer.

1484
01:56:15,489 --> 01:56:22,452
So I just wanted to wrap it up and agree with my colleagues, but something needs to be done with regards to communication immediately.

1485
01:56:23,417 --> 01:56:23,757
Thank you.

1486
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:30,141
On that motion as amended, all those in favor?

1487
01:56:38,445 --> 01:56:39,606
All those opposed?

1488
01:56:39,626 --> 01:56:39,966
16-099.

1489
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:50,011
On the motion for council remarks for suspension of the rules, all those in favor?

1490
01:56:51,652 --> 01:56:52,653
All those opposed?

1491
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:56,011
Suspension of the rules is granted.

1492
01:56:57,471 --> 01:57:00,273
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1493
01:57:00,913 --> 01:57:02,013
Thank you, Councillor.

1494
01:57:02,133 --> 01:57:03,134
My name is Ed Serino.

1495
01:57:03,154 --> 01:57:06,695
I live at 49 Bradshaw Street in Medford, Mass.

1496
01:57:06,735 --> 01:57:10,957
And for the exception of a few years, I've been a 50-year resident of Medford.

1497
01:57:11,778 --> 01:57:18,381
I also have been with Anheuser-Busch for 31 years, one of the city's largest taxpayers, and I would say one of their best corporate neighbors.

1498
01:57:20,321 --> 01:57:21,562
I am here for parking.

1499
01:57:22,312 --> 01:57:24,513
I actually went to the traffic committee today.

1500
01:57:24,573 --> 01:57:32,635
I tried to get a parking permit for the side street next to the corner where I live, which I've gotten for years, and visitor's passes.

1501
01:57:32,695 --> 01:57:40,277
When I went up to Republic a few weeks ago, I was told by the people there that I couldn't get visitor's passes, even though I had them last year.

1502
01:57:41,117 --> 01:57:44,778
And to get them, I had to go see the chief of police, which I thought the woman was joking.

1503
01:57:45,519 --> 01:57:50,580
And I said to her, I would hope to God that the chief of police has something better to do than give me a visitor's pass.

1504
01:57:51,701 --> 01:57:54,183
And I went down to the station, like I was told.

1505
01:57:54,203 --> 01:57:56,645
Of course, the officers got to chuck a lot of it.

1506
01:57:57,126 --> 01:57:57,887
He wasn't available.

1507
01:57:57,907 --> 01:57:58,947
I talked to his secretary.

1508
01:57:59,648 --> 01:58:04,773
I was told I had to get on an agenda for some traffic meeting, which I just said, no, I just went up.

1509
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:05,413
I went up today.

1510
01:58:06,174 --> 01:58:08,856
And I had a long talk with Chief Sacco.

1511
01:58:09,317 --> 01:58:11,298
And it's not about me getting the passes.

1512
01:58:11,398 --> 01:58:14,241
Anybody can do what they have to do as a resident.

1513
01:58:14,301 --> 01:58:15,842
And I'm not going to bore you with Republic.

1514
01:58:15,922 --> 01:58:18,885
Everybody in the city knows what that is and what it has been.

1515
01:58:19,793 --> 01:58:24,377
I mean, first of all, they, as a company, need to train their people in customer service.

1516
01:58:24,897 --> 01:58:28,821
I get tagged three times last year for a permit that I paid for.

1517
01:58:28,841 --> 01:58:34,566
So those are the three episodes I had to go up and argue, which I don't have the time or will or inclination to do.

1518
01:58:35,607 --> 01:58:37,188
And the parking's getting worse in this city.

1519
01:58:37,228 --> 01:58:42,052
Where I live, the streets on both sides of me are permanent, residential.

1520
01:58:42,072 --> 01:58:43,013
I have no idea why.

1521
01:58:43,693 --> 01:58:45,915
Spring Street, people come to my street to park.

1522
01:58:46,376 --> 01:58:47,977
People from the projects come up to park.

1523
01:58:48,439 --> 01:58:50,419
People from the condos in Riverside come up to park.

1524
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,880
And the neighborhood, there's a lot more renters.

1525
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,901
It's not years ago where a two-bedroom was rented out to a family of four.

1526
01:58:56,941 --> 01:58:59,381
You might have five to six students living in there.

1527
01:59:00,001 --> 01:59:01,522
They don't need to have a TV room.

1528
01:59:01,542 --> 01:59:02,642
They have their iPads.

1529
01:59:03,122 --> 01:59:06,463
I have an absentee landlord across the street from me, who's a nice guy.

1530
01:59:06,483 --> 01:59:07,243
I've talked to him a lot.

1531
01:59:07,263 --> 01:59:09,083
He's got about 15 kids in the building.

1532
01:59:09,543 --> 01:59:13,104
I said, go up to the Traffic Commission and try to get parking right here.

1533
01:59:13,344 --> 01:59:14,544
Get people up.

1534
01:59:14,625 --> 01:59:15,025
And they should.

1535
01:59:15,085 --> 01:59:15,865
I asked the chief today.

1536
01:59:15,885 --> 01:59:16,885
He said, out of ignorance.

1537
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:19,811
Is there a law on the books where you have to park in a driveway?

1538
01:59:20,251 --> 01:59:21,572
I have a one car driveway.

1539
01:59:22,092 --> 01:59:29,174
I went up to the city five years ago and they were cutting curbs in my street to get my driveway extended towards my front porch, not towards my neighbor.

1540
01:59:29,855 --> 01:59:30,675
The city denied me.

1541
01:59:30,955 --> 01:59:32,796
I was trying to get a car off the street.

1542
01:59:33,796 --> 01:59:38,958
And to me, it's, it's, listen, I fully expect that this city will go towards Somerville sooner than later.

1543
01:59:38,998 --> 01:59:40,539
We're probably going to go to zone parking.

1544
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,440
You know, if they're going to do that, I'd like to see people look ahead.

1545
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:46,461
Maybe instead of charging 10, maybe you charge five.

1546
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:50,592
Maybe you put on people's taxes and force people using driveways.

1547
01:59:50,632 --> 01:59:55,295
But I just think there is such a lack of common sense that it's mind-blowing.

1548
01:59:55,415 --> 01:59:56,396
It's absolutely mind-blowing.

1549
01:59:56,816 --> 01:59:59,738
And as I told the chief today, I'm getting older, I'm getting crankier.

1550
02:00:00,258 --> 02:00:01,819
But I am proud to live in the city.

1551
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:05,161
I had opportunities to take my daughter out of the city for education.

1552
02:00:05,181 --> 02:00:06,782
She goes knock on wood, she's a great student.

1553
02:00:07,282 --> 02:00:09,624
She's a senior graduate from Medford High in the AP program.

1554
02:00:10,064 --> 02:00:10,725
I'm involved.

1555
02:00:10,825 --> 02:00:16,328
I mentioned Budweiser because I was always a political liaison for the company and the city, especially when Mayor McGlynn was here.

1556
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:20,733
There was stuff that we did for the neighbors behind us that, legally, we didn't have to do.

1557
02:00:21,414 --> 02:00:22,875
We were there before it was our rights.

1558
02:00:22,935 --> 02:00:28,439
We spent a lot of money on cutting down the intercom, all the stuff with people and landscaping.

1559
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,942
And I would go over to the neighborhoods, because I literally grew up in that neighborhood.

1560
02:00:32,503 --> 02:00:39,368
And it meant a lot to me, and it means a lot to me, to work for a company that's a good partner, especially when it comes to transportation and parking.

1561
02:00:39,388 --> 02:00:41,110
Those trucks run through the city left and right.

1562
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,491
I get calls a lot.

1563
02:00:42,511 --> 02:00:46,254
When I talked to Councilor Marks last week, I had a few people on Park Street call me up.

1564
02:00:46,645 --> 02:00:48,026
Because trucks, a lot of the drivers are new.

1565
02:00:48,046 --> 02:00:48,446
They don't know.

1566
02:00:48,586 --> 02:00:49,407
They go the wrong way.

1567
02:00:49,887 --> 02:00:52,289
And obviously, seeing a big truck come down your street is scary.

1568
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:57,232
I had, two years ago, Carolina Street, street over from me, there's a nail salon on the bottom of Riverside Ave.

1569
02:00:57,752 --> 02:00:58,673
It's very dangerous.

1570
02:00:58,813 --> 02:00:59,513
People park.

1571
02:00:59,553 --> 02:01:00,234
You can't get through.

1572
02:01:00,694 --> 02:01:03,996
A tractor trailer had his GPS wrong and came up on a most rammed a lady.

1573
02:01:04,497 --> 02:01:06,358
And I literally get out of my car to try to help.

1574
02:01:06,418 --> 02:01:11,361
But I think that, you know, obviously, parking is very, very territorial, especially in a bad winter.

1575
02:01:12,085 --> 02:01:16,127
Last winter was no fun, and I've had arguments with neighbors that I never argue with.

1576
02:01:16,207 --> 02:01:17,508
And I try to be a good neighbor.

1577
02:01:17,968 --> 02:01:19,108
We fixed our property.

1578
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:22,290
I've taken financial hits from my neighbors, cutting down trees, helping them out.

1579
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:26,012
But where we're going with parking, it can't be a reactionary thing.

1580
02:01:26,052 --> 02:01:27,152
It can't be a stall thing.

1581
02:01:27,212 --> 02:01:30,494
It should be, I don't know legally if the council can get involved.

1582
02:01:30,554 --> 02:01:33,215
The way that the chief explained to me today, it's going to go to the parking commission.

1583
02:01:33,636 --> 02:01:35,997
But I think there's got to be foresight way ahead of time.

1584
02:01:36,457 --> 02:01:37,217
Where do we want to go?

1585
02:01:37,317 --> 02:01:38,138
What do we want to do?

1586
02:01:38,933 --> 02:01:39,673
What makes sense?

1587
02:01:39,814 --> 02:01:41,054
Does it make sense to go zone?

1588
02:01:41,074 --> 02:01:41,755
Does it make sense?

1589
02:01:42,175 --> 02:01:43,836
Listen, nobody wants to pay any more money.

1590
02:01:44,416 --> 02:01:45,096
Everybody alive.

1591
02:01:45,197 --> 02:01:45,977
Nobody wants to do that.

1592
02:01:46,017 --> 02:01:46,877
Nobody enjoys that.

1593
02:01:47,798 --> 02:01:54,922
But I just think that it overall, and I was listening to a lot of people tonight on various topics and it seems to me a lot of it's communication.

1594
02:01:55,462 --> 02:01:59,464
Maybe the city needs to hire a chief content officer that runs communication for everything.

1595
02:02:00,565 --> 02:02:03,907
The city hall, this department's education, everybody, the world's changing.

1596
02:02:04,631 --> 02:02:06,012
I mean, I have a teenage daughter.

1597
02:02:06,032 --> 02:02:12,736
She thinks I'm nuts for reading the newspaper, for coming up and for doing, if it's not in her hand, she ain't, that's the world now.

1598
02:02:13,656 --> 02:02:16,018
But I just, you know, wanted to just take the time.

1599
02:02:16,738 --> 02:02:18,659
Listen, I went today, I got done what I had to get done.

1600
02:02:19,259 --> 02:02:27,924
They voted to give me the passes that I've had for years, which didn't make any sense, you know, and I missed a couple hours for work to my boss's chagrin, but it is what it is.

1601
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:34,068
But I just, you know, after speaking to Chief Sacco today, I got a little bit heated for a minute,

1602
02:02:35,127 --> 02:02:38,830
call myself after a while of talking to him, I would hope to God he's got better stuff to do.

1603
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:45,075
And I know that's his role as chief, but I just think it's not gonna get worse, excuse me, it's not gonna get better in the city.

1604
02:02:45,595 --> 02:02:54,002
There's a lot of commercial development coming in, Wegmans is coming in, Total Wine's going to have it, I fully expect Mystic Ave will be a matter of when, not if, when that blows up commercially.

1605
02:02:54,582 --> 02:02:58,185
It's not gonna, the parking's gonna get more and more and more, it's not gonna get less and less and less.

1606
02:02:58,745 --> 02:03:04,730
And I'm sure all of you get phone calls and emails beyond belief over stuff, so.

1607
02:03:06,157 --> 02:03:06,798
I'll shut up now.

1608
02:03:07,798 --> 02:03:08,159
Thank you.

1609
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:10,681
Thank you, Mr. President.

1610
02:03:12,062 --> 02:03:31,177
Going by what this gentleman said about the parking, I think about three or four weeks ago I asked for a meeting with Republic and our group in a subcommittee hearing so we can go over their policies and practices and training procedures and where the parking program is going in the future.

1611
02:03:31,818 --> 02:03:33,499
And we haven't heard back from them.

1612
02:03:34,693 --> 02:03:40,954
So, Mr. President, if we could ask that happen again, this will be the second request for this.

1613
02:03:41,955 --> 02:03:46,716
On that second request of Councilor Caviello to Republican Party.

1614
02:03:47,996 --> 02:03:49,056
Oh, please do, Councilor.

1615
02:03:49,657 --> 02:03:50,437
Thank you, Mr. President.

1616
02:03:50,477 --> 02:03:53,737
I want to thank Mr. Serino for coming up tonight.

1617
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:57,218
Very active in our community and makes a lot of sense.

1618
02:03:57,898 --> 02:04:01,919
And, you know, we had this discussion back, I think it was three years ago with the chief.

1619
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,260
It's clear to me.

1620
02:04:04,812 --> 02:04:12,074
the resident permit parking process to get resident permit parking on your street is not working in this community.

1621
02:04:12,975 --> 02:04:28,920
All it's doing is one street will get resident permit parking and they'll alleviate the issue they had with people parking there and jumping on the express bus or people parking there and walking to their favorite restaurant and they're pushing the problem over to the next street that doesn't have permit parking.

1622
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:34,002
The chief assured us back, this is three years and I realize he was busy implementing

1623
02:04:34,782 --> 02:04:47,124
the mayor's pay-to-park program, but he said he was working on a citywide parking permit program that would address a lot of the concerns that you mentioned about being able to park.

1624
02:04:47,384 --> 02:04:58,886
You happen to live on a corner, so you can't park, even though the frontage of your house is on one street, you can't park on the street that has the other frontage on the side of your house.

1625
02:04:59,086 --> 02:05:02,007
Or visitors, which to me makes no sense at all.

1626
02:05:03,318 --> 02:05:04,619
Not after the taxes you're paying.

1627
02:05:04,659 --> 02:05:12,724
So I think we should, when we discuss the issue with the chief, Mr. President, this will be one of the issues that I bring up.

1628
02:05:13,264 --> 02:05:23,711
And maybe it's about time we take this off the chief's plate and create a commission or an ad hoc committee like you've been doing, Mr. President, to look into some of these issues.

1629
02:05:24,231 --> 02:05:30,815
And citywide permit parking is definitely not working right now the way it's done, the piecemeal approach.

1630
02:05:31,473 --> 02:05:36,256
And I would ask that, uh, that the issue be taken up, but I appreciate Mr. Serino coming up tonight.

1631
02:05:36,636 --> 02:05:37,017
Thank you.

1632
02:05:37,117 --> 02:05:37,617
We all do.

1633
02:05:37,637 --> 02:05:39,018
Uh, counselor night.

1634
02:05:39,558 --> 02:05:41,139
Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1635
02:05:41,179 --> 02:05:42,880
And Mr. Serino, thank you for being here.

1636
02:05:43,221 --> 02:05:50,025
Um, I can attest to the good work that Budweiser does with its neighbors and I can certainly attest to the good work that you do in the community.

1637
02:05:50,065 --> 02:05:51,426
So thank you very much for being here.

1638
02:05:52,106 --> 02:05:55,328
Um, this council passed a resolution one five dash seven, eight, nine.

1639
02:05:55,368 --> 02:05:57,970
And in our packets this week was a response from the chief of police.

1640
02:05:58,733 --> 02:06:06,939
and that resolution was requesting that they made revisions to the resident parking permit process and implemented zones or went citywide.

1641
02:06:07,459 --> 02:06:11,982
And the response reads that we've been discussing revisions to the resident permit parking program.

1642
02:06:12,582 --> 02:06:16,165
Before anything is implemented, we will hold public meetings in order to seek input.

1643
02:06:16,705 --> 02:06:23,290
In the meantime, we're using a common sense approach so that residents of adjoining permit parking streets are allowed to park on other permit parking streets in the neighborhood.

1644
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:26,552
Some initial feedback to citywide permit parking has been negative.

1645
02:06:26,983 --> 02:06:31,484
Not every neighborhood has the same parking issues, so formalizing the neighborhood approach may be the appropriate steps.

1646
02:06:32,884 --> 02:06:40,686
I tend to agree with Councilor Marks that the process that we have in place right now, it served a purpose and it met a need, but that need has evolved.

1647
02:06:41,006 --> 02:06:53,529
And I think it's time for us to step up into the 21st century and to, as Mr. Serino said, be proactive and be visionary and have the foresight to figure out what we see coming down the line.

1648
02:06:54,260 --> 02:07:01,185
So with that being said, Mr. President, the Chief is looking to seek public input and maybe get some suggestions.

1649
02:07:01,805 --> 02:07:19,677
So I'm wholeheartedly in support of Councilor Marks' idea to maybe begin to have some hearings or a committee or put something together for us to gather some information to share with the Traffic Commission to make this process a little bit quicker, more expedient, and also so that we can all participate in it, Mr. President.

1650
02:07:20,405 --> 02:07:23,447
So with that being said, thank you very much Councilor Moxley for bringing it up.

1651
02:07:23,487 --> 02:07:24,788
I think it's a great idea.

1652
02:07:24,948 --> 02:07:35,975
And Mr. Serino, I'm sorry it was at your expense, but it looks like, you know, this is something that I certainly feel strongly about and I'd be supporting going forward.

1653
02:07:36,475 --> 02:07:40,037
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilors Moxley and Knight.

1654
02:07:40,557 --> 02:07:41,278
All those in favor?

1655
02:07:41,298 --> 02:07:42,939
Opposed?

1656
02:07:42,979 --> 02:07:43,559
Congratulations.

1657
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,861
Thank you, Mr. Serino for coming tonight.

1658
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:48,002
You're always welcome here.

1659
02:07:49,931 --> 02:07:53,272
We forward back to the regular order of business offered by Councillor Scott Bally.

1660
02:07:53,312 --> 02:07:53,952
All those in favour?

1661
02:07:54,252 --> 02:07:54,833
All those opposed?

1662
02:07:54,893 --> 02:07:55,593
Motion carries.

1663
02:07:55,613 --> 02:07:58,514
16-099 offered by Councillor Marx.

1664
02:07:58,894 --> 02:08:17,999
Whereas Oakland Street is used as a cut-through during weekday mornings, posing a safety concern for area residents and children attending the Oakland Park Children's Centre, and whereas existing street signage was taken down during sidewalk replacement back in 1998 and never replaced then,

1665
02:08:18,578 --> 02:08:23,179
be it resolved that the Traffic Commission post resident-only signage from 7 a.m.

1666
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:24,380
to 9.30 a.m.

1667
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:34,263
Monday through Friday in slow school zone and speed limit signage be replaced on the interest of public safety.

1668
02:08:34,303 --> 02:08:35,043
Councilor Marks.

1669
02:08:36,063 --> 02:08:37,064
Thank you, Mr. President.

1670
02:08:37,104 --> 02:08:40,385
We also have an area resident here that would like to speak.

1671
02:08:41,885 --> 02:08:44,466
You know, we all know where Oakland is.

1672
02:08:44,526 --> 02:08:47,707
It's directly across next to the old Tony Lucci's.

1673
02:08:48,504 --> 02:08:54,205
across here from City Hall, and it's fast becoming a major cut-through.

1674
02:08:55,306 --> 02:09:01,327
If you come here in the morning, you'll notice coming down Salem Street, all the cars queue up at the set of lights across from City Hall.

1675
02:09:01,347 --> 02:09:10,189
If I may interrupt, Councillor, it's been reported that the patch up there in the ceiling seems to be giving way at this moment.

1676
02:09:10,671 --> 02:09:19,654
We ask that all the citizens seated on that side of the chamber to move over to this side of the chamber in the interest of your life.

1677
02:09:20,475 --> 02:09:21,835
Counselor, if you would continue.

1678
02:09:29,658 --> 02:09:30,579
Thank you, Mr. President.

1679
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:39,482
So Oakland Street is fast becoming a major cut through in the area, and it's causing a real public safety concern

1680
02:09:40,158 --> 02:10:00,246
not only for the Oakland Park Children's Center, but area residents that are trying to get out in the morning, go to work, go to church, do whatever their daily activity is, they're having a tough time on the street because cars are trying to circumvent coming down Salem and bypassing the light.

1681
02:10:00,666 --> 02:10:08,929
So they're coming down Water Street, taking a left off onto Oakland Street, and coming down Oakland to bypass the set of lights.

1682
02:10:09,748 --> 02:10:11,709
And it really is causing a concern.

1683
02:10:12,089 --> 02:10:21,594
There was, for a period of time, when the sidewalks were done in 1998, a slow school zone and speed limit sign on the street.

1684
02:10:22,014 --> 02:10:25,236
But after they repaired the sidewalk, they never put back the signage.

1685
02:10:26,417 --> 02:10:37,763
Now we're asking not only to replace the slow school zone and speed sign, but also to place a resident-only sign there, Mr. President, between the hours of 7 a.m.

1686
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:42,081
and 9.30 a.m., Monday through Friday.

1687
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:47,041
And that should help alleviate this cut-through traffic in the morning.

1688
02:10:47,642 --> 02:10:52,822
And naturally, we need enforcement, because a sign doesn't cause or create enforcement.

1689
02:10:53,163 --> 02:10:54,163
It just creates a sign.

1690
02:10:54,803 --> 02:11:06,185
And we're hoping that most logical people would see the sign and say, I can't go down this road between this period of time and not go down and choose to use that as a cut-through, Mr. President.

1691
02:11:07,362 --> 02:11:10,483
This is a long-standing issue for area residents.

1692
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:17,065
And, you know, it's great we have the new chicken and rice guys that just opened up around the corner from Oakland.

1693
02:11:17,525 --> 02:11:18,985
I've went to the restaurant a few times.

1694
02:11:19,025 --> 02:11:19,745
I wish them well.

1695
02:11:20,246 --> 02:11:24,067
But that's also creating some additional need for parking.

1696
02:11:24,527 --> 02:11:25,627
And guess where they're parking?

1697
02:11:26,267 --> 02:11:26,867
Oakland Street.

1698
02:11:27,428 --> 02:11:33,829
So we're seeing cars of employees that are parking on Oakland Street for five, six, seven, eight hours at a time.

1699
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,590
And I know

1700
02:11:36,421 --> 02:11:48,226
Diane Musto that's here tonight is circulating a petition in the neighborhood for resident permit parking in that particular street, which will eventually go to the traffic commission.

1701
02:11:48,586 --> 02:12:03,372
And I think that will go a long way to keeping some of the business district parking off your street and also some of the commuters that are grabbing the bus in the square off your street and bring it back to a neighborhood street, which it really should be.

1702
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:05,660
That's how it used to be.

1703
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,760
And that's your neighborhood.

1704
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:08,401
You pay the taxes there.

1705
02:12:08,961 --> 02:12:14,922
And, really, the residents shouldn't be burdened with the overflow and cut-through traffic, Mr. President.

1706
02:12:14,942 --> 02:12:19,863
So, at this time, I'd like to hear from Diane on her concerns, Mr. President.

1707
02:12:19,923 --> 02:12:20,983
We will in due time.

1708
02:12:21,003 --> 02:12:23,264
We're going to hear from Councilors Caviello and Knight.

1709
02:12:23,344 --> 02:12:24,164
I'll yield to the young lady.

1710
02:12:24,184 --> 02:12:24,664
Councilor Knight.

1711
02:12:25,484 --> 02:12:27,865
What she has to say is far more important than what I have to say, Mr. President.

1712
02:12:27,885 --> 02:12:29,545
She's the one that has to live with it, so I'll be happy to

1713
02:12:31,895 --> 02:12:33,095
My name's Diane Musto.

1714
02:12:33,135 --> 02:12:34,336
I live at 18 Oakland Street.

1715
02:12:34,636 --> 02:12:36,017
I've been there for 33 years.

1716
02:12:36,037 --> 02:12:40,418
And it used to be a nice, quiet neighborhood back in the day.

1717
02:12:40,818 --> 02:12:46,020
But as you can tell, the last few years have been tremendously, it's horrible.

1718
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,481
The traffic, as Councilman Marks said,

1719
02:12:49,197 --> 02:12:50,098
is ridiculous.

1720
02:12:50,798 --> 02:12:54,120
Trying to get off the street in the morning is impossible.

1721
02:12:55,341 --> 02:13:01,926
My son walks my grandson to school because he gets there quicker walking than taking the car.

1722
02:13:02,626 --> 02:13:07,229
My daughter last week was trying to get out of the spot.

1723
02:13:07,289 --> 02:13:13,253
She makes her way down to the end of the street, and there was cars coming from both sides of Water Street.

1724
02:13:14,074 --> 02:13:15,595
There was traffic behind her.

1725
02:13:16,055 --> 02:13:17,156
She couldn't take the turn.

1726
02:13:17,595 --> 02:13:23,921
A gentleman behind her was honking to the point where he got out, flipped the finger, started screaming at her.

1727
02:13:24,402 --> 02:13:25,222
She was petrified.

1728
02:13:26,183 --> 02:13:26,944
It's ridiculous.

1729
02:13:27,585 --> 02:13:36,753
And any given day, hundreds, I'm talking between 300 to 500 cars come down that street in a matter of two hours.

1730
02:13:37,374 --> 02:13:39,376
You can put someone out there and count them.

1731
02:13:40,056 --> 02:13:40,517
It's crazy.

1732
02:13:41,096 --> 02:13:50,179
My husband has gone out there to try to slow down the cars so that the kids can get out of their sports and head to work, almost getting run over.

1733
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:51,419
They have no respect.

1734
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,400
It's like a speedway.

1735
02:13:53,780 --> 02:14:00,622
They fly down there because there's no speed signs that say slow down, school zone, or what the speed limit is.

1736
02:14:01,862 --> 02:14:04,083
It's definitely a public safety issue.

1737
02:14:04,203 --> 02:14:06,664
Someone's going to seriously hurt, if not killed,

1738
02:14:07,208 --> 02:14:08,709
if something doesn't happen.

1739
02:14:09,069 --> 02:14:10,270
There's no crosswalks.

1740
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:14,292
My grandson used to go to the Oakland Park School there last year.

1741
02:14:14,992 --> 02:14:18,194
Walking him across the street was no easy job.

1742
02:14:18,234 --> 02:14:19,155
I mean, you dodged cars.

1743
02:14:19,175 --> 02:14:19,415
It's crazy.

1744
02:14:25,999 --> 02:14:35,707
Something has to be done, whether you make it a one-way going up Oakland Street or you put a no through, you know, you can't cut through Oakland Street or something.

1745
02:14:35,807 --> 02:14:41,912
Something has to be done because the amount of traffic that comes down there in the morning is, you know, I've never seen it.

1746
02:14:42,032 --> 02:14:43,513
I've never seen it that bad in my life.

1747
02:14:45,295 --> 02:14:49,158
The other concern we have right now is the parking situation on Oakland Street.

1748
02:14:49,970 --> 02:14:54,074
We've got all these new businesses that are coming into Memphis Square with the new kiosks in.

1749
02:14:54,094 --> 02:14:55,955
No one wants to pay to park.

1750
02:14:56,696 --> 02:15:00,579
They found their new home in front of 18 Oakland Street.

1751
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,103
You find four to five cars at a time that don't live there.

1752
02:15:05,123 --> 02:15:06,064
They're not residents.

1753
02:15:07,425 --> 02:15:09,827
They park from morning to sometimes 11 at night.

1754
02:15:11,338 --> 02:15:13,780
And when we come home from work, where do we park?

1755
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,181
We don't have a driveway.

1756
02:15:15,781 --> 02:15:20,644
So now we're like circling the block trying to find a spot to park.

1757
02:15:22,685 --> 02:15:23,386
It's just ridiculous.

1758
02:15:23,406 --> 02:15:26,788
People from out of the city come there to park that don't live there.

1759
02:15:27,148 --> 02:15:27,969
They park all day.

1760
02:15:28,009 --> 02:15:28,689
They take the bus.

1761
02:15:28,709 --> 02:15:29,750
They go into Boston.

1762
02:15:30,491 --> 02:15:32,452
They come home at nighttime, hop in their car, go.

1763
02:15:34,173 --> 02:15:34,953
Something's got to be done.

1764
02:15:35,033 --> 02:15:40,297
I did get a majority of the neighbors on Oakland Street and Garden Street to sign the petition.

1765
02:15:40,838 --> 02:15:42,659
I think I have the majority of the signatures.

1766
02:15:42,939 --> 02:15:48,043
And so now my next step is to get on next month's agenda with the traffic commission.

1767
02:15:48,143 --> 02:15:53,186
So hopefully that goes through, but, um, yeah, something needs to be resolved.

1768
02:15:53,246 --> 02:16:05,234
Cause it's definitely a public safety issue as far as all the cars coming down, no speed limit, you know, school zone, you know, so, and I want to thank you counsel Knox for bringing this to everyone's attention.

1769
02:16:07,517 --> 02:16:08,437
Thank you very much.

1770
02:16:08,517 --> 02:16:11,859
On the motion of Councilor Marks for approval, Councilor Knight.

1771
02:16:12,699 --> 02:16:13,780
Um, yes, Mr. President.

1772
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:33,908
Um, so through you to Councilor Marks, uh, the street has never been resident in the past, and this would be an effort to make it resident because what I've seen, um, work in other neighborhoods is resident access only signs between certain hours, as opposed to restricting the parking on the street between seven and nine.

1773
02:16:34,402 --> 02:16:37,203
I don't know what's going to work best in this neighborhood, Mr. President.

1774
02:16:37,263 --> 02:16:38,083
I don't.

1775
02:16:38,103 --> 02:16:39,343
Just another option that's out there.

1776
02:16:39,363 --> 02:16:44,024
But if you drive down, say, Winthrop Street, and you get to Rural Ave.

1777
02:16:44,144 --> 02:16:44,524
Rural Ave.

1778
02:16:44,564 --> 02:16:48,565
has a sign that says, no right turn between the hours of 4 p.m.

1779
02:16:48,585 --> 02:16:49,325
and 6 p.m.

1780
02:16:49,665 --> 02:16:55,807
Maybe that's another option that we can look at if there's no success with the petition in seeking.

1781
02:16:57,927 --> 02:16:58,607
The request is to?

1782
02:16:59,707 --> 02:17:02,108
There's only access.

1783
02:17:02,128 --> 02:17:02,548
I'm sorry.

1784
02:17:03,329 --> 02:17:03,729
I'm sorry.

1785
02:17:03,769 --> 02:17:06,571
I got tied up with the permitting because of the last conversation we had.

1786
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:09,853
I'm saying we just, they get, they're going through the process to get the permitting.

1787
02:17:09,893 --> 02:17:10,093
Okay.

1788
02:17:10,113 --> 02:17:10,633
I'm sorry.

1789
02:17:10,673 --> 02:17:11,574
I missed that.

1790
02:17:11,634 --> 02:17:12,094
I missed that.

1791
02:17:12,714 --> 02:17:14,435
Um, move approval, Mr. President.

1792
02:17:14,495 --> 02:17:15,396
Motion for approval.

1793
02:17:15,436 --> 02:17:16,196
Councilor Caviello.

1794
02:17:16,456 --> 02:17:17,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

1795
02:17:17,117 --> 02:17:20,499
You know, council marks brings up a good point here about the cutthroat.

1796
02:17:20,779 --> 02:17:22,160
Our whole city has turned into a cutthroat.

1797
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:24,181
I mean, that's really what it is.

1798
02:17:24,921 --> 02:17:29,764
I mean, um, I don't know if you ever tried to traverse the city at eight o'clock in the morning, seven days in the morning,

1799
02:17:30,174 --> 02:17:30,954
It's next to impossible.

1800
02:17:31,414 --> 02:17:33,635
I don't know where people think when they cut through, they're going to go.

1801
02:17:33,655 --> 02:17:38,856
I mean, you see Forest Street gets backed up almost along this road most mornings, and I know why.

1802
02:17:38,876 --> 02:17:45,337
They're coming down Forest Street, and they're cutting down water so they can get to 93, and they get back on the highway.

1803
02:17:45,657 --> 02:17:46,998
And that's all backing up.

1804
02:17:47,038 --> 02:17:48,018
That's where all the cars are going.

1805
02:17:48,038 --> 02:17:53,959
You know, Route 38 on High Street, West Bedford, backs up almost to the school.

1806
02:17:54,219 --> 02:17:58,000
I mean, I don't know what the answer is.

1807
02:17:58,804 --> 02:18:01,446
But they say more and more cars are coming, and they're going here.

1808
02:18:02,427 --> 02:18:03,388
They're parking on the streets.

1809
02:18:04,529 --> 02:18:10,834
At the commuter lot in West Medford, the team just started charging to park there, and they went up on the parking rate.

1810
02:18:11,275 --> 02:18:13,657
Nobody parks there anymore, because they went up $1.50.

1811
02:18:14,778 --> 02:18:18,421
So now the cars that were parking there for less are now parking on the side streets.

1812
02:18:20,162 --> 02:18:21,683
And the lot stays empty now for the mornings.

1813
02:18:22,744 --> 02:18:27,288
Again, we could put up all the signs we want, but unless we have a policeman there,

1814
02:18:28,221 --> 02:18:28,841
to enforce them.

1815
02:18:29,502 --> 02:18:31,183
It's, it's, it's a hard thing to do.

1816
02:18:31,563 --> 02:18:37,608
I mean, I live on a street and occasionally the state police will be there enforcing it, but you know, they're there maybe once a month.

1817
02:18:38,508 --> 02:18:47,414
So again, I, I, I, you know, I support council marks as resolution there, but again, you know, it's just the whole city has turned into a cutthroat on the motion of council.

1818
02:18:47,494 --> 02:18:51,177
Marks is seconded by councilor night council marks.

1819
02:18:51,417 --> 02:18:56,721
So just for clarification, Mr. President, we're going to ask for approval of the traffic commission to erect

1820
02:18:57,489 --> 02:19:04,777
slow school zone sign on Oakland and also speed limit sign, whatever the speed limit is on Oakland.

1821
02:19:05,818 --> 02:19:12,746
And I believe at the corner of Brookside Parkway and Water Street, resident access only.

1822
02:19:12,926 --> 02:19:17,431
So that way, if they're coming down from Brookside, is that is that where you want it?

1823
02:19:17,451 --> 02:19:18,612
Because if you put on water,

1824
02:19:21,934 --> 02:19:24,376
they take water, and then they come down Oakland.

1825
02:19:25,016 --> 02:19:27,358
Or they come down forest, water, Oakland.

1826
02:19:27,398 --> 02:19:33,982
So now if you've got cars coming from both angles, no one on Oakland Street, if they want to make the turn, they can't go nowhere.

1827
02:19:34,022 --> 02:19:37,704
There's too much traffic coming at both ends, from both sides.

1828
02:19:38,445 --> 02:19:46,790
So I don't know somehow whether you make Water Street one way all the way through, you know what I'm saying?

1829
02:19:47,851 --> 02:19:51,153
Or Oakland Street one way going up, and then you'd have to take the turn.

1830
02:19:52,595 --> 02:19:54,536
So no cars can come down Oakland Street.

1831
02:19:54,556 --> 02:19:58,138
So where would be a suggestion for the resident-only access?

1832
02:19:58,738 --> 02:19:59,998
Where would you like to place that sign?

1833
02:20:00,018 --> 02:20:07,222
If you place it at the corner of Water and Oakland, by that time, they've already made the left if they're coming down Brookside.

1834
02:20:07,242 --> 02:20:11,524
And they're going to end up going down there anyways, because they can't go any further.

1835
02:20:11,784 --> 02:20:15,806
So I think if you put it on Brookside, at least you'll deter them from coming down.

1836
02:20:15,926 --> 02:20:16,506
Right, true.

1837
02:20:17,027 --> 02:20:22,193
And then maybe we can also request as a council that the traffic commission look into making it a one-way.

1838
02:20:22,213 --> 02:20:23,514
I don't disagree with you.

1839
02:20:23,554 --> 02:20:25,256
That would be really nice.

1840
02:20:25,336 --> 02:20:30,101
I mean, if you made it a one-way going up, everyone always comes up the street to get to their houses.

1841
02:20:30,502 --> 02:20:33,425
And if you have to get off Oakland, you go down water and you get to the rotary.

1842
02:20:34,992 --> 02:20:38,293
Very rarely people that live on Oakland come through that way to come down.

1843
02:20:39,093 --> 02:20:40,173
Come through which way, Brookside?

1844
02:20:40,193 --> 02:20:42,094
Brookside, yeah, to Water and down.

1845
02:20:42,354 --> 02:20:48,956
Very rarely they do that, because if they're coming off the highway, they go right to the set of lights right here and come up Oakland.

1846
02:20:49,216 --> 02:20:54,397
And anyone letting the kids off at Oakland Park, the Children's Center, you're coming up Oakland.

1847
02:20:54,537 --> 02:20:58,538
They park, let the kids off, then they go down Water and back and around.

1848
02:20:59,058 --> 02:21:01,239
So it makes sense to go one way up the street.

1849
02:21:03,184 --> 02:21:19,879
So, Mr. President, those two signs that we spoke about and also a sign at the corner of Brookside Parkway and Water Street resident access only between the hours of between the hours of seven and nine a.m.

1850
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,341
Monday through Friday.

1851
02:21:24,023 --> 02:21:28,487
And then if the traffic commission wants to look at whatever recommendations

1852
02:21:29,730 --> 02:21:31,831
on making Water Street a one-way.

1853
02:21:31,931 --> 02:21:33,972
Let them go out and view the site.

1854
02:21:34,032 --> 02:21:34,372
Yeah.

1855
02:21:35,932 --> 02:21:38,333
I don't know why they didn't make it one-way all the way through.

1856
02:21:38,393 --> 02:21:39,774
I mean, it doesn't make no sense.

1857
02:21:39,794 --> 02:21:43,695
You make a one-way and stop it at Oakland, and then this end is a two-way.

1858
02:21:43,875 --> 02:21:45,576
It just doesn't make sense, especially when there's parking.

1859
02:21:45,596 --> 02:21:46,776
I mean, it's tough to get through.

1860
02:21:47,216 --> 02:21:54,379
If all the cars are parked there, you either have to back up to let this car, and then you can't.

1861
02:21:54,499 --> 02:21:55,179
It's ridiculous.

1862
02:21:55,239 --> 02:21:55,879
It's difficult.

1863
02:21:55,899 --> 02:21:57,740
So we'll make those recommendations to the Traffic Commission.

1864
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:57,980
All right.

1865
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,320
Thank you.

1866
02:22:01,504 --> 02:22:06,126
Yeah, and again, I apologize for getting confused there, resident only.

1867
02:22:06,166 --> 02:22:09,507
I was thinking resident parking only as opposed to resident access only.

1868
02:22:09,968 --> 02:22:15,890
But one reason I think this is a great idea, Mr. President, is because if, in fact, there is enforcement there, it is a surchargeable offense.

1869
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:21,652
If you go down the road when those restrictions are in place, it's the same thing as driving down a do not enter street.

1870
02:22:21,712 --> 02:22:26,995
So it's going to be a surchargeable offense, and people will get the picture relatively quickly when they get a $700 surcharge.

1871
02:22:29,486 --> 02:22:30,627
Thank you very much, Counselor.

1872
02:22:31,187 --> 02:22:31,868
Madam Citizen.

1873
02:22:32,328 --> 02:22:33,769
Sorry, Gene Martin.

1874
02:22:33,809 --> 02:22:34,469
I'll try to be quick.

1875
02:22:34,749 --> 02:22:44,095
But I wanted to address something that someone said, which is there's two issues, parking enforcement and moving violations, which are two different issues.

1876
02:22:44,676 --> 02:22:53,401
The Republic can be expanded to take in the whole city, as far as I'm concerned, because I think it's a waste of police personnel to do ticketing for parked cars.

1877
02:22:53,862 --> 02:22:54,362
That's number one.

1878
02:22:54,382 --> 02:22:58,805
But number two, moving violations should be under the direct

1879
02:22:59,777 --> 02:23:01,818
responsibility of the police and only the police.

1880
02:23:02,518 --> 02:23:15,240
And since there's no appetite in this city by the mayor in this coming cycle of two years, and I'm not putting her down, but she has no appetite to build out a new police station in the next two years.

1881
02:23:15,841 --> 02:23:18,021
I didn't get that from the meeting.

1882
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:26,363
So if she's not going to build out a new police station, then maybe she can put 10 cops on the payroll for now, at least.

1883
02:23:26,907 --> 02:23:29,328
so that we can do more moving violations.

1884
02:23:29,688 --> 02:23:31,949
Because if they don't get a ticket, they don't get a surcharge.

1885
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:35,851
So if there's no enforcement, then they don't get a surcharge on their insurance.

1886
02:23:36,411 --> 02:23:44,275
So, and I'm not putting down the mayor, but I got the sense that she doesn't have a plan to put in a new police department in the next two years.

1887
02:23:44,655 --> 02:23:46,276
Maybe it's four, maybe it's seven, I don't know.

1888
02:23:47,036 --> 02:23:50,498
But in lieu of that, the least she can do to

1889
02:23:51,768 --> 02:23:57,989
be good to the police force, who is, you know, way behind on 100 different levels.

1890
02:23:58,889 --> 02:24:02,870
Before we renovate the library, I'm all for the new roof on the library.

1891
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:03,830
I know I'm getting off topic.

1892
02:24:04,731 --> 02:24:08,311
But before we renovate the library, we need to think about putting more cops on the street.

1893
02:24:08,751 --> 02:24:09,071
Thank you.

1894
02:24:09,612 --> 02:24:11,952
On the motion as amended, all those in favor?

1895
02:24:12,432 --> 02:24:13,152
All those opposed?

1896
02:24:13,232 --> 02:24:15,553
Motion carries.

1897
02:24:15,653 --> 02:24:18,773
On the motion of Councilor Caviello to take the papers in the hand of the clerk.

1898
02:24:19,154 --> 02:24:19,994
All those in favor?

1899
02:24:20,014 --> 02:24:20,814
All those opposed?

1900
02:24:20,854 --> 02:24:21,514
Motion carries.

1901
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:43,827
16-299 offered by councillor scarpelli be resolved at the metric City Council request an update From the mayor on the possible loss of the La Conte rink to a private organization Be it further resolved that the metric City Council requests support from our state delegation on the possible loss of the La Conte rink to a private Organization council scarpelli.

1902
02:24:44,167 --> 02:24:44,467
Thank you.

1903
02:24:44,507 --> 02:24:45,187
Mr. President.

1904
02:24:45,307 --> 02:24:48,268
I I think that some it's a I

1905
02:24:49,985 --> 02:25:00,130
people don't realize that the DCR has just put on an RFP to take over the ranks that we saved for them over the past somewhat years.

1906
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:07,373
We now know how important recreational facilities are in our community and what it offers our constituents.

1907
02:25:07,813 --> 02:25:17,337
And especially during the coldest months and having the opportunity to have the control of that facility.

1908
02:25:17,837 --> 02:25:23,619
and keeping costs down for our youth organizations and their programming is very important.

1909
02:25:24,199 --> 02:25:45,625
I think that what the new governor and his administration is doing by sending the new director of the DCR out and going from neighborhood to neighborhood and trying to take back their ranks for quote unquote to raise funding for that department now, which

1910
02:25:46,394 --> 02:25:51,141
It's not going to happen, at least the way the format's set up now.

1911
02:25:52,222 --> 02:26:00,594
My fear is that with an RFP, any private organization can come in to Medford, take over not just the La Conte rink, but the Flynn rink.

1912
02:26:03,113 --> 02:26:07,696
do what they may with it and to support their own pocketbook.

1913
02:26:07,756 --> 02:26:11,659
So I think we need to get on board with this before it's too late.

1914
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:23,708
People don't realize they're actively, there are private organizations walking the rinks now and ready to put bids on our rink.

1915
02:26:24,228 --> 02:26:32,814
And the ramifications, I think, would be devastating to our recreational landscape and our youth organizations, both with

1916
02:26:33,728 --> 02:26:45,798
learn to skate and learn to play for our youngest kids, our youth hockey organizations, our girls and boys high school hockey program, and our social skating, which is the open skate.

1917
02:26:46,279 --> 02:27:01,411
So I think that we need to be apprised of what's going on, and we need to really push our state delegates to start knocking on the governor's door and saying, hey, the decision that's coming out, that came out this week,

1918
02:27:02,043 --> 02:27:03,624
needs to be halted immediately.

1919
02:27:03,924 --> 02:27:04,445
So thank you.

1920
02:27:09,208 --> 02:27:09,909
Thank you, Mr. President.

1921
02:27:09,969 --> 02:27:12,090
I commend Councilor Scarpelli for this.

1922
02:27:12,491 --> 02:27:21,417
You know, I've been an advocate for the state to have a rink for over 30 years, being a past president of the Methodist Hockey Association.

1923
02:27:21,877 --> 02:27:23,899
And, you know, these groups come and go.

1924
02:27:24,059 --> 02:27:29,122
Every time the state thinks, you know, they don't want the rink, they want to pawn it off to the city.

1925
02:27:29,443 --> 02:27:31,264
Now, all of a sudden, they see the rink is starting to do well.

1926
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:32,851
Now they want to take it back again.

1927
02:27:33,231 --> 02:27:35,593
I mean, this has been going on for many, many years.

1928
02:27:36,294 --> 02:27:47,222
And again, our city has had, you know, I was on demand many years ago to buy this for years, but from then to the MDC, and I'm glad we have it now.

1929
02:27:51,385 --> 02:27:58,571
I would think for this city to lose control of that rink for the thousands of kids that go there would be devastating.

1930
02:27:59,171 --> 02:27:59,812
And I agree that,

1931
02:28:00,945 --> 02:28:06,647
Everybody should be calling our state delegation to have this stopped, Mr. President.

1932
02:28:09,488 --> 02:28:10,328
Thank you, Counselor.

1933
02:28:11,589 --> 02:28:12,069
Counselor?

1934
02:28:13,469 --> 02:28:15,030
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1935
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:20,731
I'd like to amend the paper to ask the administration to report back when the current operating contract ends.

1936
02:28:21,192 --> 02:28:28,834
It's my understanding that the administration and the DCR entered into an operating contract that was a defined term of either three or five years.

1937
02:28:29,221 --> 02:28:31,542
And I think that that's coming up on expiration, Mr. President.

1938
02:28:32,863 --> 02:28:52,992
Also, I'd like to ask the administration whether or not they're going to be pursuing a response to the RFP, and whether or not this RFP would contain language that allows the city to retain a right of first refusal as to whether or not they want to be the operator.

1939
02:28:55,033 --> 02:28:58,255
On the motion for approval as amended by Councillor Knight, all those in favour?

1940
02:28:59,889 --> 02:29:00,609
All those opposed?

1941
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:01,990
Motion carries.

1942
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:19,216
Offered by Councilor Scott Peli, be it resolved that the mayor's office contact the Department of Transportation to assist the Medford City Council in scheduling an onsite meeting with the Department of Transportation for removing or relocating two bus stops.

1943
02:29:19,597 --> 02:29:21,257
Councilor Scott Peli.

1944
02:29:21,277 --> 02:29:22,057
Thank you, Mr. President.

1945
02:29:22,097 --> 02:29:25,959
Again, uh, subcommittee on transportation met a few weeks back.

1946
02:29:26,430 --> 02:29:41,282
and had a very productive meeting with both the powers to be here at City Hall and constituents to talk about issues both on both ends of Main Street.

1947
02:29:41,822 --> 02:29:55,733
And we've reached out, I know the city clerk has reached out numerous times to get in touch with the liaison from the T that can answer some very important questions so we can move forward

1948
02:29:56,355 --> 02:29:59,236
and making a decision.

1949
02:29:59,976 --> 02:30:06,738
And I've made two phone calls myself today and still haven't gotten any information.

1950
02:30:06,778 --> 02:30:19,922
So we need to move on this because this is where people get frustrated, where we've done our due diligence, but where other organizations are dragging their feet and halting our business moving forward.

1951
02:30:19,982 --> 02:30:24,863
So if we can reach out and find some other avenue to contact

1952
02:30:25,375 --> 02:30:26,516
Department of Transportation.

1953
02:30:27,096 --> 02:30:35,503
If that person can't do that job, then maybe we'd need to speak to a supervisor and get that done.

1954
02:30:35,603 --> 02:30:36,384
So, thank you.

1955
02:30:36,844 --> 02:30:38,145
On that motion, all those in favor?

1956
02:30:38,165 --> 02:30:39,626
Councilor Marks.

1957
02:30:40,787 --> 02:30:52,417
I just want to thank, this has been an ongoing issue with the bus stop in front of Carol's Restaurant in the square, and also the bus stop in front of the Oasis on Main Street in South Meffitt.

1958
02:30:52,817 --> 02:30:54,979
And I want to personally thank Councilor Scott Pelli,

1959
02:30:55,577 --> 02:31:01,541
and Councilor Caviello for the wise questions they asked her in the meeting and for moving this forward.

1960
02:31:01,681 --> 02:31:06,524
This is truly a public safety concern and it was a very productive meeting.

1961
02:31:06,564 --> 02:31:11,607
And again, I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Councilor Scarpelli for his insight.

1962
02:31:12,528 --> 02:31:14,249
On the motion for approval, all those in favor.

1963
02:31:14,609 --> 02:31:15,269
All those opposed.

1964
02:31:15,329 --> 02:31:16,090
Motion carries.

1965
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:23,975
Offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the message board at the corner of Winthrop street and high street be removed.

1966
02:31:24,095 --> 02:31:24,495
Councilor.

1967
02:31:25,322 --> 02:31:29,245
Mr. President, as many of you are aware, I reside on the corner of Winthrop Street and High Street.

1968
02:31:29,465 --> 02:31:39,233
And every time I go to get my mail, I've received a number of questions about this message board that's been sitting there for six, maybe eight months.

1969
02:31:39,253 --> 02:31:42,936
At one point, it was flashing and said something, but that was so long ago, I can't remember what.

1970
02:31:44,417 --> 02:31:51,883
So I would like to ask the administration to take the appropriate steps to have it removed in the interest of public safety, quality of life, and neighborhood beautification.

1971
02:31:52,358 --> 02:31:58,200
It was for the street sweeping, and so they just thought they'd leave it up so that every six months it would be relevant.

1972
02:32:00,081 --> 02:32:09,225
Oh, on that note, Mr. President, I did receive a call from my highway superintendent, Mr. Tanaglia, who said that the DPW is open for business and are soliciting requests for pothole repairs.

1973
02:32:09,285 --> 02:32:12,927
So if anybody has any, uh, I swear to God, he really did call and ask me to do this.

1974
02:32:13,387 --> 02:32:20,310
Um, but I, Mr. Tanaglia did ask for anybody that has any concerns about, uh, potholes or any potholes that have been identified to either use C click fix.

1975
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:20,930
I'll give them a call.

1976
02:32:22,202 --> 02:32:22,662
Very good.

1977
02:32:23,523 --> 02:32:23,923
Counselor.

1978
02:32:24,383 --> 02:32:33,827
Mr. President, while counsel and I brought that up about the circle there, there's a plate that's been there for some time now that seems to be sticking up on one end.

1979
02:32:33,887 --> 02:32:34,387
It's sinking.

1980
02:32:35,208 --> 02:32:36,348
Whose responsibility is that?

1981
02:32:36,408 --> 02:32:36,708
Is that?

1982
02:32:36,748 --> 02:32:44,212
There's a plate that's right over by where the message board, across from the message board, that's sticking up on one end.

1983
02:32:44,732 --> 02:32:46,032
And whose responsibility is that?

1984
02:32:46,092 --> 02:32:47,633
Is that the construction company?

1985
02:32:47,673 --> 02:32:48,473
Is that a city plate?

1986
02:32:48,934 --> 02:32:49,574
Can we have an answer?

1987
02:32:50,593 --> 02:32:51,534
Why the plate is there?

1988
02:32:52,174 --> 02:32:55,496
Plate at Winthrop and High Street being examined.

1989
02:32:55,817 --> 02:32:59,779
And you see it's sinking into the ground and sticking up on it.

1990
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:05,703
So that it stopped sinking in one corner.

1991
02:33:06,003 --> 02:33:08,964
And Mr. President, who's responsible for fixing that hole?

1992
02:33:09,025 --> 02:33:12,967
Is that a city problem or is that left over from the construction?

1993
02:33:13,287 --> 02:33:16,989
And who is responsible for the repair of that said sinkhole?

1994
02:33:18,498 --> 02:33:20,199
Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

1995
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:39,153
I was also informed that a port-a-party has been placed in the area in recent days, so there is the potential that construction might be beginning again there or some type of work might be going on, but there is a new Throne Depot box that's also on the corner there that has arrived within the last day or two.

1996
02:33:40,314 --> 02:33:43,837
As amended by Councilor Knight to indicate that there is a port-a-party at the area.

1997
02:33:45,353 --> 02:33:47,094
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1998
02:33:47,694 --> 02:33:48,535
All those opposed?

1999
02:33:48,715 --> 02:33:50,036
Motion passes.

2000
02:33:51,256 --> 02:33:51,757
Counselor?

2001
02:33:54,598 --> 02:33:58,640
If I can, I had my first faux pas as a city council member.

2002
02:33:58,981 --> 02:33:59,421
Heavens.

2003
02:33:59,681 --> 02:34:00,241
Heavens forbid.

2004
02:34:00,541 --> 02:34:02,383
But I just wanted to make sure I clarified this.

2005
02:34:03,123 --> 02:34:09,907
The John Howard event, first of all, went fabulously for John and

2006
02:34:10,983 --> 02:34:12,244
It shows how great Medford is.

2007
02:34:12,404 --> 02:34:20,271
He had over 500, 600 people coming through the doors at the Irish American celebrating what he's doing for his young student.

2008
02:34:20,971 --> 02:34:34,523
The mistake I made was my daughter was very angry with me when I got home and said, Dad, it wasn't John who gave me the lead, one of the lead songs, but it was Aaron Keefe, one of my former students.

2009
02:34:35,090 --> 02:34:39,093
And so I got yelled at, and if I didn't correct that tonight, I'd hear it tomorrow morning.

2010
02:34:39,153 --> 02:34:40,715
So please forgive me, Aaron.

2011
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:44,278
And again, congratulations, John, again, for a wonderful evening.

2012
02:34:44,678 --> 02:34:44,998
Thank you.

2013
02:34:45,018 --> 02:34:50,303
Mr. Clerk, if you would, make sure the records indicate that correction.

2014
02:34:51,083 --> 02:34:51,504
Thank you.

2015
02:34:52,104 --> 02:34:57,749
And the records, speaking of records, of the meeting of the 23rd were passed to Counselor Falco.

2016
02:34:58,269 --> 02:35:00,411
Counselor Falco, how did you find those records?

2017
02:35:00,872 --> 02:35:03,594
Mr. President, there's one update.

2018
02:35:04,637 --> 02:35:05,937
one edit that needs to be made.

2019
02:35:06,578 --> 02:35:32,184
And that is, uh, on page 47, the, uh, and a 16 dash zero eight seven item B says it says amended by council and I, that community development in the traffic commission provide input to the council on the possibility of increasing the fines throughout the city on the violation of sidewalk parking.

2020
02:35:32,404 --> 02:35:33,504
And after that, it should say,

2021
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:37,521
and restricting allowable delivery times.

2022
02:35:37,821 --> 02:35:44,043
I can allow the clerk and you can, uh, I can give him a hard copy of the edit and as amended.

2023
02:35:44,163 --> 02:35:46,024
So you motion their approval as amended.

2024
02:35:46,144 --> 02:35:46,804
Yes, as amended.

2025
02:35:46,864 --> 02:35:48,205
And you'll make that correction with this.

2026
02:35:48,325 --> 02:35:49,345
Excellent.

2027
02:35:49,705 --> 02:35:50,526
All those in favor.

2028
02:35:50,966 --> 02:35:54,607
All those opposed on the motion for dismissal.

2029
02:35:56,808 --> 02:36:03,270
Just before we adjourn council marks, I just want to recognize a longtime member of the board of trustees,

2030
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:12,865
for the cemetery, who is resigning after 25 years of service on the Cemetery Board of Trustees.

2031
02:36:12,945 --> 02:36:26,394
Susan D., who did a remarkable job serving the residents, and the reason why the cemetery looks the way it does, because of her due diligence on that board for so many years.

2032
02:36:26,434 --> 02:36:28,635
So I want to wish her well, Mr. President.

2033
02:36:28,955 --> 02:36:31,977
And on behalf of this entire community, I want to thank Susan D.,

2034
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:38,998
And if we could send her a council citation for 25 years of service to the Board of, Cemetery Board of Trustees.

2035
02:36:39,358 --> 02:36:39,779
Thank you.

2036
02:36:40,539 --> 02:36:45,345
On the motion for adjournment by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

2037
02:36:45,806 --> 02:36:46,426
All those opposed?

2038
02:36:46,466 --> 02:36:46,987
Meeting adjourned.
