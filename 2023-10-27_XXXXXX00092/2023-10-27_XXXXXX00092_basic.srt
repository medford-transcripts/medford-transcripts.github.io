Squid Games? Attorney Wu? Crash Landing on You? All of Us Are Dead? Maybe you've watched some of these, or maybe like a lot of people, you're wondering, what are all these Korean dramas that are all the rage right now?

00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:39,687
Laura, what gets people hooked on Korean dramas anyway? Fashion is amazing, even when I'm wondering where are they storaging all those coats. Everybody dresses so well, there is true love, the pinkies touching, but when are they gonna kiss? There is the happily ever after, and drama, and who doesn't like drama?

In the end, what's definitely certain is that K-drama is winning hearts and eyeballs because it has a little bit of something for everybody. We'll be discussing the tropes of K-drama, the archetypes, what the stock characters are, the plot arcs, and ask what do people get out of watching K-drama and who benefits or loses when we

Tune in and buy in. Why is the South Korean government trying so hard to get you to watch Korean dramas anyway? Listen to kdramarama to find out more about these and other questions. So Serena, if you think kdramas are so toxic, what do you like to watch? Well, I'm slightly embarrassed, but I watch The Real Housewives, to be honest. Is it still recording?
