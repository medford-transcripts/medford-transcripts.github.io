1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,010
Squid Games?

2
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:02,132
Attorney Wu?

3
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:03,834
Crash Landing on You?

4
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,076
All of Us Are Dead?

5
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:13,007
Maybe you've watched some of these, or maybe like a lot of people, you're wondering, what are all these Korean dramas that are all the rage right now?

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,496
Laura, what gets people hooked on Korean dramas anyway?

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,899
Fashion is amazing, even when I'm wondering where are they storaging all those coats.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,564
Everybody dresses so well, there is true love, the pinkies touching, but when are they gonna kiss?

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:39,347
There is the happily ever after, and drama, and who doesn't like drama?

10
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,372
I mean, how much time do you have in a day?

11
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,233
How much time do I have to invest in something like this?

12
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:49,974
And then I hear people, they always die at the end.

13
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:53,656
After you've invested all this time, then they die.

14
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:56,917
And these extremes, I don't understand what the big deal is.

15
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:01,000
something less toxic in your life?

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,182
Are these realistic standards of beauty okay?

17
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:12,790
Do kids just think you just have an inordinate amount of money and wardrobe and makeup and skincare regimen?

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,351
This is terrifying to young girls.

19
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:19,252
And why do people get so sucked into these with all these fan vids and fandoms?

20
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:20,873
Is this a new type of cult?

21
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,634
That's a fair question, Emma.

22
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:28,615
In the end, what's definitely certain is that K-drama is winning hearts and eyeballs because it has a little bit of something for everybody.

23
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:40,119
We'll be discussing the tropes of K-drama, the archetypes, what the stock characters are, the plot arcs, and ask what do people get out of watching K-drama and who benefits or loses when we

24
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,700
Tune in and buy in.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,141
Why is the South Korean government trying so hard to get you to watch Korean dramas anyway?

26
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:50,783
Listen to kdramarama to find out more about these and other questions.

27
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:57,445
So Serena, if you think kdramas are so toxic, what do you like to watch?

28
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:03,928
Well, I'm slightly embarrassed, but I watch The Real Housewives, to be honest.

29
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,969
Is it still recording?

30
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:17,181

43
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:30,958

Anyway, he is a disgruntled, also known as disgruntled dwarf.

46
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,184
Disgruntled, stop messing with those chains.

47
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,466
I can get out of these.

48
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,169
Don't get out of them.

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,490
Freedom!

00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,253
Okay, can someone put him back in?

51
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:53,135
But seriously.
