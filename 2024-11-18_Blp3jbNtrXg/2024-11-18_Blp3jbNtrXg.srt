00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,560

00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,581

57
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:01,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?

58
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,145

00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:13,750

64
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

65
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have no discussion on the particulars of the petition.

66
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:47,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just ask the clerk to coordinate with, I would guess the building department, or maybe this is all in the clerk's office, just to make sure that our legal notices have the updated sections and language for the new zoning ordinance going forward.

67
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:48,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

68
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:50,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

69
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:52,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

70
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:54,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, looking at this application is before us.

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,101
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a couple things that I'd like to point out.

72
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,845
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, there was no place in the city of Medford at 11 o'clock at night we get a good cookie.

73
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is certainly a need that we have here in the community.

74
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:10,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, when you look at the application is before us, the gentleman's only asking for Fridays and Saturdays, it's only asking for one additional hour.

75
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,074
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think this is really.

76
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,216
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not asking for much.

77
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:17,540
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a brand new business, it's been very successful, a lot of talk about it.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:26,210
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I understand, a state representative has already broken the record for the most crumbled points that you can get in a month or something like that.

79
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,175
[SPEAKER_09]: But in all seriousness, I think this is a good proposal that's before us here.

80
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:32,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I just ask that the

81
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:37,424
[SPEAKER_09]: license go with the business and not the address should it be approved.

82
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:40,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd be happy to motion for approval of the papers before us this evening.

83
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:40,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

84
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knights.

85
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:48,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

86
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:53,708
[SPEAKER_22]: A couple of weeks ago, business was very brisk and I'm happy for the gentleman.

87
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:57,269
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, they made a huge investment in the place.

88
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,090
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of the equipment is just all state of the art.

89
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,567
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish him well and I wish he should have brought some cookies tonight.

90
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

91
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:05,348
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought about it.

92
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,508
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't know if it was appropriate.

93
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:07,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smart that you did not.

94
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect that.

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:17,435
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't say he does only take out.

96
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,316
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, it shouldn't be an issue to anybody.

97
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,898
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think a lot of it is the delivery services too.

98
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

99
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,201
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight.

100
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:32,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to note that the newly adopted rules state that following a public hearing, a six calendar day public comment period shall commence.

101
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Public comments shall be submitted writing to the city clerk.

102
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:42,548
[SPEAKER_13]: The council shall neither approve nor deny any matter requiring public hearing until the conclusion of the public comment period, unless waived by a majority vote of the council.

103
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:51,131
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the six day waiting requirement, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

104
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,082
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be the motion to waive and approve.

105
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

106
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:05,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And the approval is with the condition that the permit go with the business now with the others, correct?

107
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:06,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

108
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:11,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

109
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:12,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

110
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:13,595

111
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:13,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

112
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

113
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:15,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

114
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:16,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

115
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:16,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:17,977

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

118
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

119
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:20,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,820
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell.

121
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, seven in favor, zero in the negative.

122
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,231
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes and the extended hours are approved.

123
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:27,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

124
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:27,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

125
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:28,274
[SPEAKER_22]: Good job.

[SPEAKER_22]: Madam President, while we're under suspension, if we could take two, two, three, four, eight, common pictures license.

00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,007
[SPEAKER_13]: All are under suspension.

129
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:51,468
[SPEAKER_13]: 22-348, petition for a common victor license by Barry Rafferty, 51 Crocker Road, Medford, for Mystic Dining, LLC, the Ford 61 Locust Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

130
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:59,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Rafferty, if you could tell us about the petition.

131
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, and thank you for having me.

132
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:17,013
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ford's Tavern is located on 61 Lotus Street in Medford, and it's been something we've been working on for four years, and we're very close to opening it at this point.

133
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,514
[SPEAKER_08]: The licensing hours are 11am, I believe, or 10.30am until 1am.

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 120 seater restaurant bar.

135
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:33,625
[SPEAKER_08]: We have under our employment at this point, very close to 50 staff.

136
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:38,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been considerable contributor to the local economy.

137
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our general manager Heath Landry behind me.

138
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:49,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a very senior experienced team and we're looking forward to serving Medford community.

139
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Aberdey.

140
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to licensing chair, Councilor Scarpelli.

141
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't review it, so I apologize.

142
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe any of us did receive the packet.

143
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:07,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I also did not receive the packet.

144
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:14,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we didn't get the appropriate approval.

145
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get any approvals.

146
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:22,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it in the electronic version?

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,581
[SPEAKER_07]: That's different.

148
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the electronic version.

149
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:51,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's going to be a great Italian restaurant.

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But it won't be an Irish restaurant.

151
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:59,764
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be an American restaurant.

152
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,346
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I like to hear.

153
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:02,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem voting for this.

154
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither.

155
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,448
[SPEAKER_09]: He answers one question.

156
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:12,175
[SPEAKER_09]: When is El Tecuba going to open?

157
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:13,456
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been waiting eight years for them.

158
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We're only waiting four for you.

159
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:25,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly don't have any any problem with the project I just don't want to, I just don't want to vote on it without having the paperwork reviewed.

160
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sorry about that Barry, we just like there's a little snafu with us getting the right paperwork to review.

161
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,822
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll defer to Councilor Scarpelli.

162
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:52,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we, if like, again, we've done this in the past with petitions that we could ask any questions that we normally ask and then revert back to if the clerk could send us so we could table it for one week and then vote.

163
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,232
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be in next week, but we can vote on it.

164
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, is the paperwork downstairs?

165
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the agenda, but it's not.

166
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the agenda.

167
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I just read something, so it's not on the agenda.

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 22-348, petition convict to license for Barry Rafferty, 51 Crocker Road.

169
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:17,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right there.

170
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:18,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Page five.

171
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's been advertised, but yeah.

172
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I. Yeah.

173
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:36,174
[SPEAKER_07]: to move on to the next step.

174
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,695
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to hesitate either.

175
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:40,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Believe me, I don't know if he's going to mix.

176
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:45,657
[SPEAKER_22]: If he's going to miss the meeting at the liquor commission.

177
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:46,738
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what that is?

178
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:51,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't answer that either.

179
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:56,480
[SPEAKER_09]: We need your common fix license to go apply for the liquor commission to get your liquor license.

180
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you get your liquor license.

181
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:58,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

182
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:09,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we got a local 2021, it's going to be renewed next week.

183
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:16,657
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a change of the channel manager going through, so they don't have to come back before us for extended hours.

184
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you need a special permit from 11 to 1.

185
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:28,258
[SPEAKER_09]: For 11 to 1, even if they lick the licenses to 1 AM at the state level, you have to come back to us for the extended hours permit.

186
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's any opportunity for us to further vet this, it's going to be coming before us, I think.

187
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

188
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see this being harmful, but I would defer to the council.

189
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:41,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I'll make a motion to remove approval.

190
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:46,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make a motion to remove approval.

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,042
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the, the, uh, the proper paperwork be reviewed.

192
00:12:54,962 --> 00:13:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the next week's meeting, I know that, um, again, I, I can't approve anything.

193
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have in front of me.

194
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know nothing.

195
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mr. Raft.

196
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:07,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to move forward myself, but, um, common practices.

197
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: We reviewed the paper, the documents, make sure that all the departments have signed off on it.

198
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, you know, if we can look back on, there was a

199
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:22,780
[SPEAKER_03]: a tequila restaurant that was supposed to open that didn't have paperwork that was signed.

200
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence, now we have a delay.

201
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that we have that paperwork documented.

202
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would move forward with it.

203
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:41,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could send us the copy of the documents with all department heads clearing this, I would move forward with it.

204
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I do see Victor Schrader on the call.

205
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:47,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if his hand up if he could offer anything to the conversation.

206
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:52,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Councilors, Victor Schrader, economic development director for the city.

207
00:13:54,095 --> 00:14:00,900
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been working closely with Barry throughout this process and appreciate you considering the common victual or this evening.

208
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:04,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Barry if I'm not correct here.

209
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,322
[SPEAKER_12]: You are hoping to open next week, is that right?

210
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:13,303
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been working hard to schedule an inspection with the health department.

211
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen some of the paperwork.

212
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:26,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to, in the interest of supporting this business, ask if there was any way that it could be produced this evening for the Councilors.

213
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:32,149
[SPEAKER_12]: and reviewed just to keep Perry on track.

214
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:41,335
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a significant investment, and I know he's been working hard, but if that's not possible, of course, we'll accommodate, but I just wanted to suggest that.

215
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a motion for a 10-minute recess.

216
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a motion for Senator Bears for a 10-minute recess.

217
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:47,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take your 10.

218
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:47,898
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less.

219
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:48,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

220
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:04,819
[SPEAKER_13]: second call the roll on the motion of vice president bears for 10 minute recess seconded by a Councilor Knight.

221
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm calling everyone in favor.

222
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:13,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I recess as the clerk tries to track down this paperwork so we can move forward on this tonight.

223
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:14,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being with us.

224
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's done inside.

225
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like done inside.

226
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:44,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

227
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a kitchen?

228
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's already in the kitchen.

229
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,817
I thought they were going to build a hallway.

230
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:11,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary.

231
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:26,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

232
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

233
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:26,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

234
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:14,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get them out of here.

235
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:15,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

236
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want a minute so you can read it?

237
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:45,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

238
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

239
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,071
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've recessed.

240
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:46,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

241
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:13,596
[SPEAKER_04]: 735 ish.

242
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:15,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

243
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:18,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

244
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Bears and night to recess.

245
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:20,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

246
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:20,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

247
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we just voice voted, which maybe was illegal, but you weren't here to stop us.

248
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:31,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not complaining.

249
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:11,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's some people that want to review it.

250
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't think you've, you haven't resumed from recess yet.

251
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You're fine.

252
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,226
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one.

253
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's going to require a special permit, that part.

254
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:13,459
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the bottom line, I think.

255
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, yes.

256
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:33,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.

257
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:33,889
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello to reconvene.

258
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

259
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:38,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

260
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:45,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting is resumed.

261
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

262
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:53,809
[SPEAKER_03]: needed.

263
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,733
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked at all the documentation.

264
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is in order.

265
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:04,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just the only thing is that the extended hours of operation is through special permit.

266
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So other than that, I find everything in order.

267
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And after my colleagues' questions, I would move approval.

268
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:24,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would just add specifically those that you can stay up until 11pm right now and then 11pm to 1am would be what the special permit would require.

269
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I already seconded it.

270
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

271
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:35,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on that motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

272
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

273
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:36,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

274
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

276
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:37,970

277
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,310

278
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

279
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

280
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:41,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

281
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:42,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

282
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

283
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

284
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:43,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

285
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:45,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

286
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,200
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell.

287
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, seven in front of zero in the negative the motion passes.

288
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:50,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

289
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:51,222

[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to note that in the time since this was first tabled, we did get a requested resume circulated to the council for Ms.

301
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:06,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Amami.

302
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Any discussion from the council?

303
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:11,463
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can.

304
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:12,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

305
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:23,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that as we looked at other, the only question that I had that was brought to my attention was the voting record for municipal elections.

306
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that's weighed as we, as the mayor processes?

307
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:38,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know that that wasn't a concern with other applicants.

308
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:52,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, I know that they shared her voting history and obviously she's a strong supporter of the four year elections, but in the two year elections, and this is,

309
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,731
[SPEAKER_03]: a very important piece of our process here at Medford.

310
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can get some.

311
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, thank you.

312
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:14,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, the only stipulation for being on the election commission is a two-year look back for what your party affiliation is.

313
00:26:14,462 --> 00:26:16,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Your voting history does not come into that.

314
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:21,566
[SPEAKER_01]: She was given a thorough look back for the last 13 years.

315
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:25,268
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been in the same party for that time period.

316
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I only say that because it was shared, so.

317
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Senator.

318
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:29,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

319
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

320
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:35,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Favrella.

321
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:41,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Their resume is a stellar resume, but I'm a little concerned that she hasn't participated in the local municipal elections also.

322
00:26:43,454 --> 00:26:46,276
[SPEAKER_22]: For us, this is what we do.

323
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:47,997
[SPEAKER_22]: We're the municipal body.

324
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:55,562
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a concern of mine that in all the cities that she's lived in, she's never participated in the municipal part.

325
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:58,965
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a concern I have.

326
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:02,216
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know her personally and her resume.

327
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:06,683
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an outstanding resume, but the voting record is a little suspect to me.

328
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:08,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

329
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:08,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

330
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:14,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate the questions that my fellow Councilors have brought up so far.

331
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Since we have our election coordinator here, I'm interested to hear from Coordinator Gale on her perspective on the appointment.

332
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:31,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that the election commission is going to be under her purview, so that's kind of a perspective that I think is valuable here.

333
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:32,530
[SPEAKER_21]: I do want to say,

334
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:43,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Clearly, robust participation in municipal elections is extremely important for somebody who can be serving on a board where that is the whole point.

335
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:50,065
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we live in an environment where participation in municipal elections is at a baseline, incredibly low.

336
00:27:50,165 --> 00:28:04,990
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that there's perhaps something to be said about this candidate bringing a perspective that could help us to, you know, look at that problem and perhaps, you know, bring the perspective of somebody who's been less involved and looking to get more involved and shed some light on that.

337
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,331
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, we'd love to hear from Coordinator Gale on this.

338
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:08,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

339
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:10,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

340
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:13,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Collins.

341
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:22,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Community involvement or being involved with the necessary functions of a commissioner, it is a time commitment.

342
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:27,484
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, that doesn't mean that Ms.

343
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:30,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Imani won't be involved in those commitments.

344
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not spoken to her personally, but there are commitments that we make in the community that we have to show up for and do.

345
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:46,149
[SPEAKER_01]: The commissioners are responsible for all registration drives.

346
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,912
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have a registration drive at the high school last Friday.

347
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:59,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Commissioner Milron and myself were there and we got 52 new registrations from Medford High School students.

348
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a very good success.

349
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:08,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with the education program last night out at West Medford Community College.

350
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:11,289
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good turnout with the commissioners there as well.

351
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:18,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things that do happen that the commissioners are going to have to commit their time to.

352
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:26,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, especially going into state election season, there are a lot of things.

353
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:32,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reviewing the calendar with a colleague earlier this week and we were looking at

354
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of days that we have to stay open till five o'clock to meet deadlines.

355
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:42,807
[SPEAKER_01]: These things happen on Fridays, they happen on Tuesdays, they happen all days of the week.

356
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:57,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a commitment and the commissioners are required to be at early voting, which we know we're going to have seven days of early voting for the primary election prior to September 6th.

357
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least between 10 and 12 days,

358
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,503
[SPEAKER_01]: for the general on November the 8th.

359
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:08,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So their responsibility is to participate in those.

360
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that they can't rotate the schedule.

361
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:20,030
[SPEAKER_01]: They all four do not have to be there at the same time, but they also handle things like the provisional ballots.

362
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,513
[SPEAKER_01]: They're required to be at a monthly meeting so that we can make the appropriate plans

363
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:32,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see the voter turnout in next year's municipal election be up around the 50% level.

364
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:42,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if it's driven home hard enough and we can get the word out that your voice is loudest in your own backyard, I believe we can reach that 50% goal.

365
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:48,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the jest of a commissioner.

366
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a time commitment.

367
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will agree, Ms.

368
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:56,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Imani has a stellar

369
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:57,763
[SPEAKER_01]: resume.

370
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:01,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It is absolutely phenomenal as far as the resume goes.

371
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:04,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Coordinator Gale.

372
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

373
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just add to the point

374
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: of Councilor Collins, you know, 60 to 70% of residents don't vote in the municipal elections.

375
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:39,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think having the perspective of someone who, you know, from the records that we got has moved around quite a bit, but has now decided to, as far as I can tell, purchase and settle here, submit an application, requesting to be on boards and commissions, you know, now planting those roots now, someone who wants to be more involved, that that perspective could aid the elections department.

376
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:45,458
[SPEAKER_02]: in that outreach and in that work to raise turnout in our local elections.

377
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that perspective would be valued and I would move to approve.

378
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:52,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

379
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Saik.

380
00:31:54,982 --> 00:32:04,286
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand the concerns, but I think I'm of a similar mind when it comes to this issue as my colleagues, Councilor Collins and Councilor Bears.

381
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:09,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important that our boards and commissions look at like our community and

382
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:19,859
[SPEAKER_18]: know, unfortunately, it is a fact that our, you know, the majority of our community doesn't vote in municipal elections.

383
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,463
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's important to get the answer why.

384
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:30,469
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's important to see why people who maybe moved to Medford in the last 10 years, maybe why, just to see why they haven't

385
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:36,866
[SPEAKER_18]: why turnout might not be as high, right, with that specific subset.

386
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:47,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Or why, you know, why turnout isn't as high in general with anyone who lives in Medford but is registered to vote here.

387
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:50,110
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important to have that perspective.

388
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,191
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it'll make our city stronger in this case.

389
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:59,792
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, it's my hope that we have more

390
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:13,277
[SPEAKER_18]: residents like, um, like the candidate that we're talking about tonight where, you know, they've decided to put down roots in our city and they've decided to sign up to participate more deeply and engage more deeply with our civic life.

391
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:25,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I think in order to have, um, residents like that, we need models, um, and we need to support those models when they, when they try to engage with our democratic process.

392
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,744
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, um,

393
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:44,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm okay with appointing with convert with voting to confirm this appointment tonight, because I think it's important to show those who want to get more involved in our city's politics and cities affairs that they'll be supported when they try to do so.

394
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:46,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

395
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:49,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Further discussion.

396
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, I think it was my father that told me this a long time ago 90% of life is showing up.

397
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how can we put somebody in the election commission as a vote?

398
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:02,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

399
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:06,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty much, I never did this before, but now I want to do it.

400
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:13,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So put me on a commission and we have a line of people that have participated every day that want to be vocal members of our community and vocal members of boards and commissions that get bypassed.

401
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think she's a good candidate just based upon the fact that she's seeking a job on the election commission and doesn't vote locally.

402
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a local appointment to a local board.

403
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:25,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't make sense to me.

404
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:27,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't make sense to me.

405
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:33,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure that she's a great person.

406
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I Councilor Tseng said that, you know, the people in our boards of commission should look like the people live in our community.

407
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what this mommy looks like because I've never seen her before.

408
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Since this application has come in, I've never seen or heard from her.

409
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never gotten asked if I have any questions about her.

410
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:49,055
[SPEAKER_09]: She's never reached out to me and said, I'd like your vote.

411
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any concerns or questions?

412
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:51,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never got any of that.

413
00:34:53,209 --> 00:35:01,496
[SPEAKER_09]: which is normal practice when you have an applicant that comes before this board, they usually reach out to you and ask for your vote, and they ask if they have any questions or concerns before this type of event happens.

414
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, as one Councilor, can't support this.

415
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:06,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, 90% of life is showing up.

416
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes 30 seconds to vote.

417
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:11,283
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes 30 seconds to vote.

418
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,925
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you go from not voting to saying, I want to be an elections commissioner?

419
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:15,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes 30 seconds to do it.

420
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:18,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

421
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:19,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

422
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President.

423
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Vice-President Rhoads.

424
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again.

425
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to reiterate, I appreciate that somebody new to our community wants to get involved.

426
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:31,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

427
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,465
[SPEAKER_03]: There are multiple.

428
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:40,216
[SPEAKER_03]: positions that are open right now that would probably be a better fit considering she does have a stellar resume.

429
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:45,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's a very talented individual and someone that could really provide a benefit to the city.

430
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:56,667
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said earlier, we were given the, to be honest with you, I wouldn't, I saw her voting record and Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head.

431
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually voting for a commissioner and it's nice that people want to do it, but it's a commissioner that's never voted

432
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,578
[SPEAKER_03]: in a two year election.

433
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't see how we can support it legitimately.

434
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

435
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:25,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think by the logic that was just outlined, 65% of the city is excluded from being on the, you know, that 35% of the city should get priority to be on boards and commissions and 65% should be second fiddle.

436
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that's a fair logic.

437
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand, I understand it.

438
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:32,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the position.

439
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want people who voted in every election.

440
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:38,919
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people who have gone above and beyond, you know, voting in every election.

441
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:40,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one perspective.

442
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't do that in this city.

443
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have to question why.

444
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:52,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that having someone with the perspective who understands the answer to the question why could help us change

445
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: that reality that we've had for a very long time, even in the most contentious elections in the past few years, 34%.

446
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better than 25% or 20%, which we were getting 10 years ago.

447
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:05,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

448
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:11,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we didn't receive the voting histories for any other appointments we made here.

449
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:15,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to leave it and to Councilor Knight's point about

450
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:23,527
[SPEAKER_02]: being properly educated as to the process of applying, you know, being an applicant to a board or commission and working with confirmation of the council.

451
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:25,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're well aware.

452
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:36,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, I didn't receive a call from, I haven't received a call, I don't think in two years, except for maybe one exception from a mayoral appointee who needed to be confirmed by this council.

453
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that the fault of the applicant or a fault of the appointing authority?

454
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:42,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it at that.

455
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:43,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

456
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:50,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, voting is your voice, but voting also shows that you're invested in the community that you live in.

457
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:54,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

458
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

459
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,575
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Vice President, Councilor Tseng.

460
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:00,136
[SPEAKER_18]: President Marlowe.

461
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

462
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:03,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Could I?

463
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:05,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Councilor Tseng.

464
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:06,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

465
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:08,463
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to

466
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:18,214
[SPEAKER_18]: clarify that when I said that our applicants should look like our community, it's, you know, when I say things like that, it's not just racial, it's everything, right?

467
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:23,956
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about your life experience and whether it matches the experiences of the people who live on the ground here.

468
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:37,021
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we're, I agree with Councilor Bears, if we're excluding 65% of our population from being considered equal participants in our civic processes, I think that logic is faulty.

469
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:38,762
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important

470
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:50,774
[SPEAKER_18]: to understand that voting, you know, while I think for a lot of people does take 30 seconds for, for many people takes a lot of planning as to, you know, whether to leave a workplace, right.

471
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,456
[SPEAKER_18]: To take a day off of work, whether you need to.

472
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:54,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm president.

473
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand this because I have a job.

474
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:56,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two kids.

475
00:38:56,897 --> 00:39:02,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I have actually three jobs and two kids, but I still go out and vote.

476
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:02,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

477
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:03,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor.

478
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:04,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I vote too.

479
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,540
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

480
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:04,820
[SPEAKER_18]: And I,

481
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:09,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a student, I spend the whole day on campus on Tuesdays, right?

482
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:13,290
[SPEAKER_18]: On election days, taking classes and doing work and doing meetings, right?

483
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,832
[SPEAKER_18]: But everyone's situation is different.

484
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:25,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's too much for us to make an assumption about the difficulties that someone might encounter when it comes to making a vote.

485
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's just, we shouldn't speculate too much on that.

486
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:31,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Sai.

487
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:39,127
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of vice president bear seconded by second Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

488
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:44,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

489
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:45,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

490
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:45,892
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

491
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:46,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

492
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:46,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

493
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:59,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

494
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're under suspension, Madam President, motion to take 22-349 and 22-350.

495
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:14,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President, I have a guest who wants to speak on 22, who's behind the poll for 22-350.

496
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:24,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I did have Councilor, I apologize, Vice Mayor Barrett, Councilor Tseng did send us a chat, just because he's delayed,

497
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper 22-350.

498
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:28,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, 22-350.

499
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:30,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what you asked for?

500
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:30,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

501
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:31,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so 349 and 239.

502
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we will take them in order.

503
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

504
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,582
[SPEAKER_18]: The lag is making things confusing.

505
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:42,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I'm... Okay, so you want 22349 and 239?

506
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:50,057
[SPEAKER_13]: 22-349 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

507
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:55,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the mayor appoint a task force to examine future development in West Medford Square.

508
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

509
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,242
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President.

510
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:10,929
[SPEAKER_22]: For those of you who were present at the West Medford Community Center legislative breakfast a couple of weeks ago, this is one of the concerns that they had down there was the lack of anything happening in West Medford Square.

511
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Being resident of that area,

512
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:20,875
[SPEAKER_22]: part of the part of the fault of what's going on down there was just really nothing is our fault, the city's fault.

513
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:33,810
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we had a, we had a project that was that wanted to get done on Canal Street, and the gentleman needed some relief to put in some apartments back there a few years ago, and he was denied.

514
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:38,455
[SPEAKER_22]: We have Sincari Funeral Home that closed up.

515
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:39,196
[SPEAKER_22]: People bought it.

516
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:44,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Historical Commission deemed it historical, so made them wait 18 months.

517
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,744
[SPEAKER_22]: The group has now gone bankrupt.

518
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:54,056
[SPEAKER_22]: These are polyathletes and that's been sitting there for three years in blight.

519
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:57,998
[SPEAKER_22]: And you've got stores down there in blight because again, there's no people down there.

520
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:05,403
[SPEAKER_22]: West Webbing Square is kind of unique because it has areas that can do some small development.

521
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:10,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Like I said, we've got that funeral home that's been sitting there for three years, just growing weeds.

522
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,787
[SPEAKER_22]: You got two parcels on Canal Street.

523
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:15,986
[SPEAKER_22]: that are ripe for a small development.

524
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:25,373
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got a parcel on Harvard Avenue, ripe for development, and you've got some buildings there that can maybe add another floor or two.

525
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:34,941
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm asking the mayor to appoint a task force, but I want the task force to be the property owners, the stakeholders in the game.

526
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:47,932
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, what we do in this community is we appoint these committees and these commissions, and they all go out with these great ideas for other people's property, and we never go out and talk to the property owners.

527
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:52,035
[SPEAKER_22]: I want this task force to be the property owners.

528
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,575
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what we can do for them.

529
00:42:54,716 --> 00:42:58,098
[SPEAKER_22]: What is it going to take them to upgrade their property?

530
00:42:58,138 --> 00:42:59,018
[SPEAKER_22]: What kind of development?

531
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:00,499
[SPEAKER_22]: How can we help them get funding?

532
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,423
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, this is an easy, it's an easy task force they can build.

533
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:12,285
[SPEAKER_22]: I've already talked to some of the property owners down there that they're interested in getting on board.

534
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,506
[SPEAKER_22]: So if they make it, do that.

535
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:19,949
[SPEAKER_22]: But I say, I'm asking that the task force be with the property owners and get them on board.

536
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:24,031
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what we can do and get that part of the town moving.

537
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's get rid of those empty stores there.

538
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:30,828
[SPEAKER_22]: and bring some people down there and bring business down there.

539
00:43:30,848 --> 00:43:37,015
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, businesses want to come where there's people and there's no people, there's no walking traffic down there.

540
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:41,401
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I'll wait for any of my other councilors to have any discussion on that.

541
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:42,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

542
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:44,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

543
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:45,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion approved.

544
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:51,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I do, so is the hope that they would work, because there's the West Medford, there's the business association as well.

545
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:59,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it the hope that they would work with them or this would be something- Well, the business association, but the property owners, the people who have stake in the game.

546
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:04,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's get them on board here, see what they want to do, see what help they want to do.

547
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:14,282
[SPEAKER_22]: And if the city, and I talked to Victor today about this, if our group, if our board can help them either get funding or give them some ideas of what to do.

548
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:15,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

549
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,787
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, second by- Second.

550
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:19,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

551
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

552
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Bears.

553
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:27,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

554
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:28,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

555
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:29,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

556
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:30,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

557
00:44:30,152 --> 00:44:30,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

558
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

559
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:32,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

560
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:33,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

561
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:34,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

562
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:36,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

563
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

564
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell.

565
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:38,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

566
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:39,656
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

567
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:54,862
[SPEAKER_13]: 22-350 offered by Councilor Tseng, whereas the 2022 spring edition of the Harvard youth poll found that nearly half, 45% of LGBTQ youth feel under attack a lot because of their sexual orientation.

568
00:44:55,342 --> 00:45:06,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas approximately three fifths, 59% of young black Americans, 43% of AAPI youth and 37% of Hispanics believe people of their racial background are under a lot of attack in America.

569
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:21,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas a majority of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 52% report feelings of depression or hopelessness and 24% report thoughts of self harm, a feeling particularly prevalent in young Americans who are black 35% API 33% female 26% LGBTQ 39%, and in a bad financial position 35%.

570
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:52,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And whereas the Surgeon General has issued an advisory which calls for a swift and coordinated response to this mental health crisis as the nation continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, be it resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration and School Department to study youth mental health in Medford and to prepare an action plan to address the mental health epidemic, both for children within the Medford public school system and youth living in Medford more generally.

571
00:45:52,987 --> 00:46:06,590
[SPEAKER_13]: and be it also resolved that the Subcommittee on Public Health and Community Safety invite relevant city officials, experts on youth mental health and Medford's youth leaders to discuss steps the city can take to address challenges to our youth population and mental health.

572
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

573
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

574
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:16,472
[SPEAKER_18]: This agenda item was inspired by the Harvard Youth Poll, which just came out a few weeks ago.

575
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:18,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I will let

576
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:28,925
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe the chair of the Harvard Youth Poll is on the Zoom call tonight, so I will let him talk a little bit about the poll itself and how they came to these questions and conclusions.

577
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:39,594
[SPEAKER_18]: But these results very much line up with my experience talking to young people living in Medford, both those in our school system and those who graduated and are just, you know, young residents of our city.

578
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:59,976
[SPEAKER_18]: We live in a difficult time today, of course, with problems exacerbated by COVID, by inflation, by economic worries that cause young people to face more mental health challenges now than they have in years past.

579
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:01,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of the

580
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:05,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, attempts to resolve this have not been successful.

581
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:15,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see, I want to make sure that our city is moving forward on these items is, uh, is making sure that all of our residents feel included and involved in our city.

582
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:21,811
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and to, to let, um, our young people here have people that they can turn to.

583
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:31,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and places that they can turn to, um, to help them, uh, to help them grow and to help them thrive in terms of living in the city.

584
00:47:32,548 --> 00:47:39,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Medford is a city that's younger than the county average than the state average.

585
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:44,593
[SPEAKER_18]: And so these results, I think, have tremendous implications for us.

586
00:47:46,427 --> 00:48:00,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Just walking through the resolution itself, I included the first part of the resolution, which asks the city administration and the public school system to study youth mental health in our city, because I believe that, you know, every city is different.

587
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Every municipality is different.

588
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:08,545
[SPEAKER_18]: And for us to tackle Medford's problems, we will also need to know what is going on in our city better.

589
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I've actually had school committee members reach out to me

590
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:14,435
[SPEAKER_18]: and want to cooperate on this issue.

591
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:20,113
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm optimistic that we can make progress on these issues going forward.

592
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:43,514
[SPEAKER_18]: The second part of the resolution is asking our public health and community safety commission to meet and to invite relevant city officials, to invite experts, to invite youth leaders, to invite those working at Tufts and Harvard who have been studying this issue for a very long time, to help us as a city council see what is actionable and what

593
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:53,402
[SPEAKER_18]: what are the steps that our city can take when it comes to those, especially when it comes to those young residents who fall outside of the public schools purview.

594
00:48:54,743 --> 00:49:07,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm thinking especially of our residents who are from the ages of 18 to 29, and to see what are some basic steps that our city can take to improve the mental health of young people living here.

595
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:23,643
[SPEAKER_18]: And this itself will lead to both a more prosperous and more thriving community, but also safer community as well, where we're openly discussing mental health and openly discussing things that will make our streets in our city safer.

596
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:27,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll finish my comments there.

597
00:49:27,324 --> 00:49:34,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe after any Councilors want to say anything, the chair of the Harvard Public Union Project is with us tonight.

598
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:36,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

599
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:39,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Any discussion from the council before we hear Vice President Bears?

600
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:41,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

601
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:43,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna say thank you to Councilor Tseng for putting this forward.

602
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:54,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all know, well, number one, A, I technically count as a young person by this definition, so I appreciate that.

603
00:49:54,222 --> 00:50:04,927
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we all know people who are in our community here in Medford, young people who have lost their life too early.

604
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,571
[SPEAKER_02]: because of mental health crisis or substance use disorder stemming from mental health crisis.

605
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the

606
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:19,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really tough.

607
00:50:19,723 --> 00:50:30,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I have someone I know very closely who just entered a 30 day program, young person, successful college graduate, still just really struggling through these issues.

608
00:50:31,485 --> 00:50:34,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just essential that we do everything we can.

609
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:44,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the great work of our prevention and outreach team and in partnership with so many city departments and folks has done a lot of work, especially relative to the substance use,

610
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of this.

611
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:57,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But as has been noted, COVID and economic crises and whatever else it may be really have exacerbated general mental health issues for young people.

612
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:10,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever we can do as a city, as a mayoral administration, city council, Medford public schools, and just a community in general and all of the private agencies and

613
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:26,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Organizations like the universities, whatever we can come together and do to keep people safe, to keep people in, make sure people can access the care that they need and deserve is something we should do.

614
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:36,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So I strongly support the efforts of this council, Councilor Tseng, and our city to look out for one another when it comes to this.

615
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:36,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

616
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:38,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

617
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:39,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

618
00:51:40,883 --> 00:51:44,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Morell and I want to thank Councilor Tseng for putting this on the agenda tonight.

619
00:51:44,447 --> 00:52:00,147
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we're, this council is, you know, enriched by his proximity to the youth community here in Medford and it's always by his proximity to the data, the numbers, because of course, you know, this systemic look at the issue, you know, is exactly what should be guiding our

620
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:19,529
[SPEAKER_21]: resources as a city, our policy directions as a city, and, you know, I think that the city administration in conjunction, put emphasis on, you know, in conjunction with the school department is exactly who I'd like to hear from on this issue from those involved with the Medford Public Schools community and see how we might design policies

621
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:47,223
[SPEAKER_21]: um to go forward from here you know I think it it doesn't need repeating but I think especially with the issue of mental health mental health crisis which I think over time you know our society like all American societies is coming to reframe it's an issue that has been for a very long time individualized it's been atomized it's been made to feel like people have to deal with this on a very individual level but I think um probably all of our

622
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:55,143
[SPEAKER_21]: lived and anecdotal experience reveals that this is a systemic community wide problem.

623
00:52:55,503 --> 00:53:00,825
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, that's how we have to be addressing it if we want to be taking care of our whole community.

624
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:01,866
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

625
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:03,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

626
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from the Council?

627
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:05,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Naik.

628
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:06,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

629
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:21,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with all my colleagues, and I think that's why last term, this council voted to pass the ordinance to promote prevent and support behavioral health and establish a commission to do all these things that this ordinance before this proposal before us this evening is asking for.

630
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,573
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look at that ordinance that was passed on three to 21 and established a series of goals.

631
00:53:26,914 --> 00:53:31,297
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those goals was to set community wide goals to create a strategic plan

632
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:37,242
[SPEAKER_09]: achieving mental well being for all of that residents, and I think that that's really what speaks with this paper speaks to this evening.

633
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:52,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we look at the composition of this commission will see that it has the director of the Board of Health, the police chief or his designee the fire chief or his designee superintendent of schools or a designee, the manager of prevention and outreach the director of diversity,

634
00:53:52,812 --> 00:54:07,720
[SPEAKER_09]: The director of the senior center the director of veterans services or a designee designees from our EMS provider, the director of school counseling and behavioral health behavioral health specialist from Tufts, a behavioral health health specialist from Lawrence Mural Hospital, and three community members appointed by the map.

635
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:10,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's clear, Madam President, when this paper first came out.

636
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:18,572
[SPEAKER_09]: We as a body made sure that there was more of a focus on the students in our schools and the young people in this community.

637
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:24,295
[SPEAKER_09]: If you remember what the first paper looked like when Mayor Burke put the paper out, Madam President, I did a little bit of work.

638
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:33,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And through the subcommittee and committee process, actually, we were able to meet on a number of occasions and really hash out the details in this paper.

639
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:35,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And we came up with a nice document here.

640
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, if you're looking for what Councilor Tseng's asking for,

641
00:54:40,692 --> 00:54:43,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And what this ordinance calls for, it's the same thing.

642
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:55,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And where this matter passed on 3-2-21, and the commission is required to file an annual report with the mayor and the city clerk, it looks like probably within the next 60 days, we should be seeing what their annual report says.

643
00:54:56,218 --> 00:54:57,498
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something I'm looking forward to.

644
00:54:57,538 --> 00:55:08,343
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to amend the paper and add that as a request that the administration provide us with a copy of the behavioral health commission's annual report, whereas the commission has been up and running now for a period of about 14, 15 months.

645
00:55:11,483 --> 00:55:12,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

646
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:13,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

647
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:17,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw Alan Zhang on the call.

648
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to speak?

649
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll unmute you and just name and address for the record, please.

650
00:55:23,552 --> 00:55:24,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

651
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:25,334
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Alan Zhang.

652
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:30,879
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have my address as 58 Plimpton Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138.

653
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:37,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a sophomore at Harvard, and I'm serving as the chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project.

654
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:42,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just here to briefly give some more context on the numbers mentioned in the resolution.

655
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,393
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to say, Councilors, thank you for your time.

656
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:59,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that this is a pressing issue facing tens of millions of young Americans across the nation, but what we also see is this is really an issue at the local level.

657
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:06,953
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue that affects our schools, affects our local communities, affects those around us, our friends, our parents, our children.

658
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:11,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding with these numbers, both in our focus groups and in

659
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:19,757
[SPEAKER_00]: our national poll, which is referenced in the resolution, is that we have a crisis that is going on.

660
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:28,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And this crisis, we first started looking at these numbers around this time last year, and the numbers have stayed consistently high.

661
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:40,325
[SPEAKER_00]: At the national level, we see more than half of young Americans are consistently having thoughts of being depressed, being hopeless, and roughly a quarter of young Americans have thoughts of self-harm.

662
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,161
[SPEAKER_00]: and thoughts of hurting themselves and being better off dead.

663
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:48,607
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are strikingly consistent across demographic lines.

664
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:51,851
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are strikingly consistent across geographic lines, too.

665
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:55,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt that these numbers are just as true in Massachusetts and Medford.

666
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:09,250
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to point out is a lot of young Americans are looking for support, and they're looking for just a sign from their elected officials.

667
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:16,836
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for a sign from those in power, from those who have the power to make decisions, that they're actually looking out for them.

668
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,360
[SPEAKER_00]: The Surgeon General declared this a crisis, issued a special statement.

669
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I have to concur with that.

670
00:57:24,763 --> 00:57:26,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on our conversations that based on our research.

671
00:57:28,264 --> 00:57:34,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that we believe should be acted on, and it's something that we believe should be a priority.

672
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:45,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. saying any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Collins.

833
01:08:27,254 --> 01:08:34,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's my thought too.

834
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:39,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

835
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:40,237
[SPEAKER_09]: President for me.

836
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:41,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Council night.

837
01:08:42,237 --> 01:08:50,299
[SPEAKER_09]: This application is before us is endorsed by our superintendent lines, who in my opinion is probably one of the best department heads that we have here in City Hall.

838
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:53,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Randazzo does an excellent job.

839
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,598
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done a great job with his budget.

840
01:08:54,618 --> 01:09:01,424
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been able to cut his budget by about $400,000 when we transferred two LED lights and took over the maintenance of our streetlights.

841
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:07,068
[SPEAKER_09]: He's quite a department head and he's laid out a pretty nice plan there from what I can see in the application that's before us.

842
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:19,118
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when we look at this stretch of area, for probably the better part of the last five years, the residents in this neighborhood, and I know you wouldn't know anything about this, Madam President, at all,

843
01:09:19,885 --> 01:09:24,869
[SPEAKER_09]: have had to deal with the Eversource project and have had to deal with the blasting project for quite a bit of time.

844
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:36,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The conditions of the Eversource project call for significant restorations and sidewalk installation at Lorraine Road and Winthrop Street, as well as curb-to-curb paving for the whole stretch of Winthrop Street.

845
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:48,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Coordination of these projects is key in order for us to make sure that when we get curb-to-curb paving, five days later, we don't have an application for someone to have a granite location for a ground opening to come in

846
01:09:49,073 --> 01:09:51,476
[SPEAKER_09]: and say we need to go and lay these telephone wires down now.

847
01:09:52,157 --> 01:10:01,829
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's in our best interest to conditionally approve this paper right now so that the city engineer's office can coordinate with Eversource because, you know, it's only been like half a decade.

848
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:05,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So this project should be almost done, you know, maybe before, you know, 2029 or so.

849
01:10:07,756 --> 01:10:22,766
[SPEAKER_09]: But ultimately, you know, in placing my trust in the department head that we have here, Mr. Medazzo, and also looking at the circumstances that are before us and the damage that could be done should this grant location not be offered, I think a conditional permit is warranted at this point.

850
01:10:24,227 --> 01:10:27,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on the motion?

851
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:35,314
[SPEAKER_03]: President, maybe we lost the petitioner, but I just find it, I find it bothersome that again,

852
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:39,221
[SPEAKER_03]: utilities, we seem to have the biggest issues with utilities.

853
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:43,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not here to represent on this petition.

854
01:10:44,025 --> 01:10:47,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do understand Council nights.

855
01:10:49,128 --> 01:10:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Support of Mr. Randazzo is probably one of the best in the city.

856
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I would say I trust him wholeheartedly.

857
01:10:56,033 --> 01:11:00,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are questions that I would like to ask the petitioner that is

858
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:09,083
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be very important for the residents of that area to make sure they're going to follow through what is asked for in this petition.

859
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is what was asked by the by the director, but until I have a representative from National Grid that I can talk to, I wouldn't support this tonight.

860
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:21,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Apologize, but no further discussion.

861
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:31,692
[SPEAKER_13]: until the petitioner is present.

862
01:11:31,752 --> 01:11:33,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

863
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:35,053

900
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:27,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanna note before the discussion that the council has met a number of committees of the whole, as well as the rules and ordinances subcommittee met on these proposed changes a number of times.

901
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:29,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

902
01:14:29,677 --> 01:14:30,377
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for approval.

903
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:35,679
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Knight.

904
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:36,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

905
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

906
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:38,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I would,

907
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:47,892
[SPEAKER_03]: hope that my fellow Councilors would reconsider their vote for making these changes.

908
01:14:49,112 --> 01:15:04,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard from numerous residents of the community and the negative impact it will have for the members of our community to have an opportunity for a voice

909
01:15:05,578 --> 01:15:10,001
[SPEAKER_03]: publicly is something that would be detrimental to the growth of our community.

910
01:15:10,662 --> 01:15:19,849
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, again, I reiterate the council's made some great points of our subcommittees and our subcommittees have done some great work.

911
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:24,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that you are correct with that.

912
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:25,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still think

913
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:40,974
[SPEAKER_03]: that we haven't done our due diligence to see what our lives would look like by adding subcommittees on the other days, other than Tuesdays and Wednesdays, to see if we can still maintain the Tuesday night regular meetings.

914
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:59,726
[SPEAKER_03]: for the sake of the public and having that voice as an open forum to share any concerns or discussions they might want to have shared to this council and for any issues that represent our residents.

915
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:02,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope we can reconsider.

916
01:16:02,547 --> 01:16:10,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've had dialogue, we've had open dialogue, we've shared our concerns,

917
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:19,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We've agreed to disagree, but I would just hope that we can reconsider and realize how important these Tuesday nights are to our whole community.

918
01:16:20,436 --> 01:16:20,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

919
01:16:21,197 --> 01:16:22,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

920
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:22,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviellol.

921
01:16:22,998 --> 01:16:24,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President.

922
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,661
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with my fellow councilors, but you know, change is good.

923
01:16:28,741 --> 01:16:30,421
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to tell you it's not.

924
01:16:31,422 --> 01:16:38,325
[SPEAKER_22]: We do need to have change on occasion, but I don't like wholesale change.

925
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:48,086
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this community has gone through a lot of change in the last couple of years on a lot of different issues.

926
01:16:48,966 --> 01:16:55,969
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is where the pushback comes from the residents.

927
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:06,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Every Tuesday we've met here for many, many years and this is where the people come and this is what people look for is these meetings on Tuesday nights.

928
01:17:08,093 --> 01:17:12,255
[SPEAKER_22]: where, okay, I mean, we don't even have that big of a thing there, and we're already at 8.40.

929
01:17:14,516 --> 01:17:22,860
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're gonna put two meetings into one, and we're gonna be sitting here at 11 o'clock making stupid decisions because we've been here too long.

930
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:28,602
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been on this council for 10 years, and I see what happens at 10.30 and 10, 11 o'clock.

931
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:35,225
[SPEAKER_22]: People do things because they wanna rush things through because they have to get up for work in the morning.

932
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:37,928
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a big issue.

933
01:17:40,471 --> 01:17:45,937
[SPEAKER_22]: Subcommittees are a big thing, but how many subcommittee meetings are we going to continue to have?

934
01:17:45,997 --> 01:17:50,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this city isn't that giant that we're going to continue to have subcommittee and subcommittee.

935
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:55,568
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we've made a whole bunch of new subcommittees, but how many subcommittee meetings do we want to have?

936
01:17:56,419 --> 01:17:59,941
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we met tonight, we were supposed to meet tomorrow night.

937
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:06,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I don't see what the issue is, is doing what we've been doing for the past year.

938
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:13,027
[SPEAKER_22]: We meet on Tuesday early if we have to, we meet on Wednesday if we need to, we meet on other days that we have to.

939
01:18:13,047 --> 01:18:15,449
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, is change good?

940
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:15,969
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, it is.

941
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Is wholesale change good?

942
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,090
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's not.

943
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:22,372
[SPEAKER_22]: And this community has had a lot of wholesale change jammed down their throats this year.

944
01:18:22,992 --> 01:18:24,093
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I would hope that

945
01:18:24,693 --> 01:18:32,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I mean, you know, that, uh, that our Councilors, uh, just, just reconsider, uh, changing the meeting time.

946
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

947
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:36,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

948
01:18:40,004 --> 01:18:40,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam president.

949
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:41,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

950
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, in my time on this council for about nine years now, um, I think we've had some great successes and I'm very proud of my track record and the track record that, um, when we've been able to work together.

951
01:18:53,053 --> 01:18:54,374
[SPEAKER_09]: the things we've been able to accomplish.

952
01:18:55,334 --> 01:19:06,420
[SPEAKER_09]: When I look at our accomplishments and I look at the good work that we've done in the building of consensus on issues that impact our community, it always happens when we go through the process and we properly vet the process through the subcommittee and the committee of the whole process.

953
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that's really where our time is best spent.

954
01:19:10,462 --> 01:19:15,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about what our most successful endeavors have been, we talk about inclusionary zoning.

955
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:17,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about

956
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,707
[SPEAKER_09]: recartification of zoning.

957
01:19:20,307 --> 01:19:21,608
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about breweries.

958
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:25,468
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about the library, the new police station.

959
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:32,890
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about the responsible employer ordinance, the wage theft ordinance, the science labs and the media center at the high school.

960
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:34,210
[SPEAKER_09]: The list goes on and on.

961
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:38,811
[SPEAKER_09]: All that work was an idea that started on the council floor.

962
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:42,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it went through a very open, deliberate public process.

963
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:45,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And during that public process is where the progress was made.

964
01:19:46,853 --> 01:19:47,173
[SPEAKER_09]: During that

965
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:57,398
[SPEAKER_09]: public process and that vetting process in the subcommittee where we actually rolled up our sleeves and tackled the issue that was before us, we were able to produce great results.

966
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:07,546
[SPEAKER_09]: When the administration buys in and gives us the tools in the toolbox, when they give us a lawyer, we've done amazing work, amazing work.

967
01:20:07,586 --> 01:20:11,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all come through the subcommittee or the committee of the whole process.

968
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:15,833
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we look at our successes, we look at the Stanley cup and we see

969
01:20:16,598 --> 01:20:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: the names that are registered on it, right?

970
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:23,740
[SPEAKER_09]: The names that are registered on it are all the issues that have come through this proper vetting process, right?

971
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:31,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, I find that my time is far better spent in a subcommittee meeting or a committee of the whole than it is behind the rail on a Tuesday night.

972
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:35,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're not tackling issues behind the rail on Tuesday nights.

973
01:20:35,783 --> 01:20:42,024
[SPEAKER_09]: We're raising issues, we're throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and then we're kicking it across the hall to the administration.

974
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:43,905
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we own an issue,

975
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:49,588
[SPEAKER_09]: and we take it from the subcommittee to the committee of the whole and back to the floor, we make a difference in this community.

976
01:20:49,688 --> 01:20:51,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And the track record shows it.

977
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:58,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna say right now, Councilor Caraviello has asked for this West Medford revitalization group.

978
01:20:59,617 --> 01:21:01,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And he kicked it across, we've kicked it across all to the mayor's office.

979
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:03,300
[SPEAKER_09]: We said the mayor put it together.

980
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:10,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances, the subcommittee on ordinances met to establish a beautification committee.

981
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're gonna pass it and we're gonna own it.

982
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:15,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're gonna send it to the administration.

983
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,296
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor's either gonna sign it or she's not.

984
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:19,456
[SPEAKER_09]: She's gonna veto it and send it back.

985
01:21:19,756 --> 01:21:22,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's up to us to decide whether or not we wanna override it.

986
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:24,297
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're gonna own the issue.

987
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're gonna say, we're not happy with the curb appeal in this community.

988
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:30,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're putting together a beautification committee because we own the issue.

989
01:21:31,418 --> 01:21:34,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been able to do that because we've gone through this vetting process.

990
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:40,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, again, my experience tells me my time is best spent.

991
01:21:41,455 --> 01:21:42,596
[SPEAKER_09]: in the attack on the issues.

992
01:21:43,256 --> 01:21:46,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason I say that is because we have a work product to speak for.

993
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So Madam President I, my two closest friends on the council my two closest to my closest friends in life.

994
01:21:52,363 --> 01:21:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked with George and john I mean George and Rick for a number of years, and I've known them my whole life, right, I disagree with them on this issue.

995
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:03,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason I disagree is because I feel like our best work is done.

996
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:13,694
[SPEAKER_09]: When we're in there with our sleeves rolled up, when we're not choked up with the tie all the way around our necks, choking ourselves, worrying about what's going on in the camera, we're worrying about what's going on the issue right in front of us.

997
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:18,535
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done that work and we've managed to meet every week.

998
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And imagine how much more work we could get done if we were better utilizing our time.

999
01:22:22,797 --> 01:22:23,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

1000
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:25,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Come to Scar Valley.

1001
01:22:27,879 --> 01:22:29,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday, Wednesday,

1002
01:22:30,335 --> 01:22:38,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday, Friday, you could still have subcommittees on those other days, Madam President, thank you in the subcommittee check and call them whenever they want.

1003
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,202
[SPEAKER_10]: After they pull them after they pull after they pull the membership.

1004
01:22:42,842 --> 01:22:49,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Because meeting for the sake of meeting isn't accomplishing anything not a second meeting if it's for the community.

1005
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:51,107
[SPEAKER_10]: To do what?

1006
01:22:51,668 --> 01:22:52,848
[SPEAKER_10]: To discuss the items on the agenda?

1007
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:54,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

1008
01:22:55,330 --> 01:23:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight had mentioned that it started here and then it moved to subcommittee.

1009
01:23:00,692 --> 01:23:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, that's here.

1010
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:03,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're eliminating that for two weeks.

1011
01:23:04,434 --> 01:23:08,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what, and believe me, this is not personal.

1012
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:10,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I still love Councilor Knight.

1013
01:23:10,578 --> 01:23:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll always love Councilor Knight.

1014
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:15,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is just, again, we agree to disagree.

1015
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:19,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the vote will show and we move on.

1016
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we love our country.

1017
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1018
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:28,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Morell.

1019
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:33,803
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know we've talked about this many times in every type of convening body that we have so far.

1020
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:44,889
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't want to repeat myself, but I wouldn't want to give the impression to my fellow Councilors that I happen to disagree with or anybody who's tuning into this discussion that it's been anything less than a thoughtful process for me as well.

1021
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:54,755
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that, you know, especially as a newcomer to the council, respecting the process that predated me, you know, I thank everybody for their comments, for the perspective on this.

1022
01:23:55,715 --> 01:24:22,388
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, I think that when we talk about where we want to be growing as a community, like anticipating more growth in our community, you know, if we get our wish and Medford continues to evolve in positive ways and welcome more people and do all the things that I think we want our community to do to improve our curb appeal to continue to revise our zoning to keep pace with, you know, our evolving

1023
01:24:23,111 --> 01:24:26,175
[SPEAKER_21]: demographic trends and, you know, what an appealing community this is to live in.

1024
01:24:27,457 --> 01:24:36,730
[SPEAKER_21]: All of the things that we wish for our community require the substantial work that we do with, you know, this more targeted use of our time.

1025
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,712
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, when thinking about

1026
01:24:39,882 --> 01:24:45,184
[SPEAKER_21]: how I deal with the community members that come to me as a Councilor.

1027
01:24:45,204 --> 01:24:56,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I tend to hear from those constituents about issues that can be resolved through policies and ordinances.

1028
01:24:56,449 --> 01:25:06,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Just for me as one Councilor, the things that I hear from my constituents about the answer to their issues, if there is one that the council has authority over, the answers

1029
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:08,134
[SPEAKER_21]: typically an ordinance.

1030
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:18,599
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why my perspective on this has been so heavily weighted towards freeing up additional regular meeting times, reliable meeting times for subcommittee.

1031
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:20,059
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to put that on the record again.

1032
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:27,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Wouldn't wanna leave anybody with the impression that this was a less than deliberate decision process for me.

1033
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:28,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1034
01:25:29,364 --> 01:25:30,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1035
01:25:30,224 --> 01:25:31,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from the council?

1036
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:45,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Just as a member of the council I'm just going to speak from the chair as I've been relatively quiet on this just trying to manage debate but I, I support this because I do believe this reflects this the format of how work gets done in this council as Councilor Knight has spoken.

1037
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:49,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand the concerns of my fellow Councilors they're absolutely heated they're heard.

1038
01:25:50,523 --> 01:26:10,585
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, to counter Carlos point I understand along meetings but you know right now sometimes we'll have a meeting that starts at five we start with the committee the whole, and then we keep going so we're in meetings four or five hours even if we're not going late you've been meeting for a long time so allowing for, you know, more freedom with those meetings to to get the work done and not have things kind of running into each other as we did, did tonight and I think also.

1039
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:19,593
[SPEAKER_13]: The Committee of the whole the subcommittee structure does allow for for more voices to be heard for different voices because there are a lot of folks that are focused on a single issue.

1040
01:26:20,054 --> 01:26:27,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And they might not come to a council meeting, they might not have the time for that, but they're at that subcommittee they're at that committee the whole you can look back on recent meetings on different topics and

1041
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:39,642
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a lot of dialogue and there's a lot of folks that you might not see in a regular meeting, but will come out to that meeting and they will speak about their single issue, whether it's curb appeal or relief blowers or food trucks.

1042
01:26:40,242 --> 01:26:42,563
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is why it has my support.

1043
01:26:42,643 --> 01:26:49,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I absolutely do believe that this will facilitate the council to do the work that it does best and that it's statutory work.

1044
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:54,085
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's ordinances, it's policy, it's reviewing the budget, which we do in communities as a whole.

1045
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,363
[SPEAKER_13]: and just getting that work done.

1046
01:26:57,383 --> 01:27:03,145
[SPEAKER_13]: So this has my support and I just wanted to say that just to go on record and share that as I have been fairly quiet, just managing to be.

1047
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from my fellow councilors?

1048
01:27:06,686 --> 01:27:08,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we do have members of the public who would like to speak.

1049
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:12,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1050
01:27:15,209 --> 01:27:16,269
[SPEAKER_23]: Street Method Mass.

1051
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:23,712
[SPEAKER_23]: This is where the people come Tuesday night, every Tuesday night.

1052
01:27:23,732 --> 01:27:24,912
[SPEAKER_23]: It's always been,

1053
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,902
[SPEAKER_23]: Change is good, sometimes change is good.

1054
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:32,285
[SPEAKER_23]: You all have the job, you all took the job.

1055
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:37,610
[SPEAKER_23]: This is what it entailed when you took it, now we're gonna change it.

1056
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:45,176
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not even anywhere near the process and we're gonna change the process.

1057
01:27:46,497 --> 01:27:49,220
[SPEAKER_23]: So we get to come up here less, we get to speak less.

1058
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:53,941
[SPEAKER_23]: regardless of what anyone here says, okay?

1059
01:27:54,621 --> 01:28:05,026
[SPEAKER_23]: You're taking away our ability to bring up our situations, our problems, our concerns to this council.

1060
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:06,867
[SPEAKER_23]: This is where we've always come.

1061
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,929
[SPEAKER_23]: School committee's taken it away, okay?

1062
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:13,791
[SPEAKER_23]: The school committee has literally shut us down.

1063
01:28:15,027 --> 01:28:18,650
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, go around the city, you talk to people, talk to them.

1064
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,571
[SPEAKER_23]: The school committee shut us down.

1065
01:28:20,972 --> 01:28:30,039
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm gonna tell you, everyone I talk to, and it's a lot of people, are saying, well, now we're gonna get shut down by the city council.

1066
01:28:30,799 --> 01:28:41,848
[SPEAKER_23]: Regardless of whether your intentions are good, whatever they are, you are shutting people down in this city, and the people in this city

1067
01:28:42,488 --> 01:28:46,471
[SPEAKER_23]: feel like it's being done and it's being done on purpose, okay?

1068
01:28:48,432 --> 01:28:50,694
[SPEAKER_23]: It is, it's like you're doing it on purpose.

1069
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:52,795
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't wanna hear from us, we don't matter.

1070
01:28:53,676 --> 01:28:56,758
[SPEAKER_23]: City has a lot of problems, we have a lot of issues.

1071
01:28:57,758 --> 01:29:09,026
[SPEAKER_23]: We've gotten everything done from the past years ago, whatever, and I'm not saying we still can't, but shutting the people down, it's our tax money.

1072
01:29:10,422 --> 01:29:11,725
[SPEAKER_23]: that runs this city.

1073
01:29:12,506 --> 01:29:12,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Ours.

1074
01:29:13,268 --> 01:29:13,929
[SPEAKER_23]: We pay.

1075
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,192
[SPEAKER_23]: We pay the bills.

1076
01:29:16,847 --> 01:29:22,751
[SPEAKER_23]: It has to do with letting us come and speak.

1077
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:24,092
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what it has to do with.

1078
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:29,095
[SPEAKER_23]: Adam, please, will you don't go there with me.

1079
01:29:29,255 --> 01:29:31,096
[SPEAKER_23]: Just you know me, don't go there with me.

1080
01:29:31,476 --> 01:29:32,797
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not about me.

1081
01:29:33,337 --> 01:29:34,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing's ever been about me.

1082
01:29:34,898 --> 01:29:38,981
[SPEAKER_23]: So don't even start, don't even go near there with me.

1083
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:42,203
[SPEAKER_23]: I love this city, that's why I'm up here speaking.

1084
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:45,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I love this city.

1085
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:50,196
[SPEAKER_23]: It's got nothing to do with me, who voted for who, whatever.

1086
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:54,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, well, you're accusing me of something that you just did.

1087
01:29:55,278 --> 01:29:58,839
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't care if there's a camera and all, what does that have to do with anything?

1088
01:29:58,859 --> 01:30:06,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Focus comments to the chair, I understand there's- I mean, no, I'm just saying, it's our opportunity to come up here and speak, that's it.

1089
01:30:07,082 --> 01:30:08,783
[SPEAKER_23]: Camera has nothing to do with it.

1090
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:12,440
[SPEAKER_23]: We have the right to be here every Tuesday.

1091
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,741
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys took the job based on being here every Tuesday.

1092
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:18,342
[SPEAKER_23]: It's that simple.

1093
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:21,243
[SPEAKER_23]: I take a job, I signed a contract.

1094
01:30:21,723 --> 01:30:25,904
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to my boss three months later and said, hey, I want every Friday off.

1095
01:30:26,404 --> 01:30:28,365
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not gonna get paid for that Friday.

1096
01:30:29,605 --> 01:30:31,486
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what you're asking the city to do.

1097
01:30:33,902 --> 01:30:38,265
[SPEAKER_23]: You're asking us to pay you when you're not gonna be here every Tuesday night.

1098
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:39,626
[SPEAKER_23]: We can't speak.

1099
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:42,008
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a lot of things involved here.

1100
01:30:42,929 --> 01:30:45,911
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, there's ethics, there's morals, whatever.

1101
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:47,913
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys are gonna do what you wanna do.

1102
01:30:49,114 --> 01:30:49,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Vercella.

1103
01:30:50,615 --> 01:30:51,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1104
01:30:56,479 --> 01:30:57,520
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Robert Panto.

1105
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:01,483
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this August body for 36 years.

1106
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:08,360
[SPEAKER_20]: For the past 82 years in the city of Medford, you folks have had weekly council meetings.

1107
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:24,145
[SPEAKER_20]: I've served under both a plan A and a plan E form of government, and they held steadfast, not only to their weekly meetings, they held steadfast that this microphone, this podium right here was the people's voice on a weekly basis.

1108
01:31:25,506 --> 01:31:28,507
[SPEAKER_20]: We've gone through the years, situations,

1109
01:31:29,849 --> 01:31:40,018
[SPEAKER_20]: in the Wellington area, whereas if you were on every other week situation, the rat problem that took effect a few years ago, would have never got itself involved.

1110
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:49,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Then Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight can remember people coming from the Morrison Ave Park area regarding in the wintertime storms that took place.

1111
01:31:49,846 --> 01:31:55,071
[SPEAKER_20]: And if the people had to wait every other week to come down here, their problems would have been exacerbated.

1112
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:00,142
[SPEAKER_20]: You talked about making decisions as you relate of committee meetings.

1113
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:09,846
[SPEAKER_20]: If committee meetings are a result of what takes place here at a city council meeting and forwarded to a committee, and the committee does whatever it's work has to be.

1114
01:32:10,386 --> 01:32:15,048
[SPEAKER_20]: It still has to come back before the council, but it initiated itself right here in the city council.

1115
01:32:15,848 --> 01:32:17,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Tonight was a perfect example.

1116
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:19,069
[SPEAKER_20]: When the gentleman from the.

1117
01:32:20,555 --> 01:32:28,278
[SPEAKER_20]: front porch came down here and unfortunately all the papers weren't in order until the clerk went downstairs to get the papers.

1118
01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:33,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if the papers were not there, he would have had to wait two weeks if this process of two weeks took place.

1119
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:40,642
[SPEAKER_20]: That would have been a financial burdensome on that individual through no fault of his own because his papers were filed.

1120
01:32:41,002 --> 01:32:45,884
[SPEAKER_20]: And when the chairperson got the papers and he saw they weren't filed and they were signed off properly.

1121
01:32:46,744 --> 01:33:00,011
[SPEAKER_20]: When all of you folks ran for office like myself, I knew it was on a Tuesday night and I also knew that no matter what the day and the week was, was immaterial to the job and my responsibility to do the job.

1122
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:16,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if you folks wanna go to every other week with 18 committees that you have set up, and of those 18 committees, if you decide you wanna have three or four of them or five of them on every other week, and some of you are on the same committees, how is that gonna work during the same time?

1123
01:33:17,304 --> 01:33:18,945
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just impossible.

1124
01:33:19,645 --> 01:33:25,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, you can meet anywhere, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, you can go Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and you're meeting every week.

1125
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:29,435
[SPEAKER_20]: This podium is here for one particular reason.

1126
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:39,703
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the safeguard that a taxpaying citizen has to come here without having to wait, geez, I gotta wait two weeks because the pressing need is happening right now.

1127
01:33:40,923 --> 01:33:45,327
[SPEAKER_20]: You folks are getting paid $30,000 a year to do this job.

1128
01:33:45,807 --> 01:33:47,548
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know what the time commitment was.

1129
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And you also know what the dollar amount was to the salary.

1130
01:33:51,444 --> 01:33:58,568
[SPEAKER_20]: God forbid, if you ever go to every other week, you want to come in here and ask for a pay raise, you really will be adding insult to injury.

1131
01:33:58,588 --> 01:34:04,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that's just something that will never pass the muster of why you folks got elected.

1132
01:34:04,332 --> 01:34:08,915
[SPEAKER_20]: You got elected to do one thing, to represent the people the best way you could.

1133
01:34:09,755 --> 01:34:12,516
[SPEAKER_20]: And right now for 82 years it's been every Tuesday night.

1134
01:34:13,336 --> 01:34:19,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Now Councilor Caraviello says change is good, but all change at all times is not good.

1135
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:27,479
[SPEAKER_20]: The lack of community input to every other meeting, the lack of a community input as it relates to why are we making this change?

1136
01:34:27,979 --> 01:34:31,500
[SPEAKER_20]: You have two brand new city councils that just came on this term.

1137
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,421
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm quite sure when they were running for office, this was not an issue.

1138
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:39,222
[SPEAKER_20]: And since it wasn't an issue then, why is it an issue now?

1139
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:53,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Second of all, when you go into the meetings, you talk about the regular meetings of the city council shall be held every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 7pm, beginning the first Tuesday in January.

1140
01:34:54,507 --> 01:35:02,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Then in the last sentence, it turns around and says the following bit further resolve that these updates become effective on September 1 2022.

1141
01:35:04,742 --> 01:35:08,203
[SPEAKER_20]: So what is it, September 1st or is it January 1st of 2023?

1142
01:35:08,263 --> 01:35:13,884
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a mix of words there, something is wrong.

1143
01:35:14,364 --> 01:35:24,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Also you talk about here, an emergency meeting shall take place unless immediately undelayed action is deemed to be imperative.

1144
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:26,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, just think about it.

1145
01:35:27,267 --> 01:35:30,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Does any one of you know right now what an immediate action could be?

1146
01:35:31,588 --> 01:35:33,769
[SPEAKER_20]: What an emergency could be in somebody's life?

1147
01:35:34,705 --> 01:35:35,786
[SPEAKER_20]: or some business.

1148
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:38,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Pardon me?

1149
01:35:39,928 --> 01:35:42,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anybody know what an emergency could be?

1150
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:45,511
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't, and neither one of us know.

1151
01:35:45,691 --> 01:35:50,214
[SPEAKER_13]: In the past, we've actually met, we've had meetings where we need to get a food truck permit that needed to be approved.

1152
01:35:50,274 --> 01:35:54,477
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about the community interest for this to make this change.

1153
01:35:54,757 --> 01:35:58,399
[SPEAKER_13]: You folks, you folks maybe have met, you folks have met.

1154
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:00,340
[SPEAKER_13]: A food truck is a community interest.

1155
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.

1156
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:01,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

1157
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:04,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually not an amendment.

1158
01:36:04,662 --> 01:36:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what the current rule said, including the rules that you operated under for many years as a Councilor.

1159
01:36:09,047 --> 01:36:10,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So that section has not been changed at all.

1160
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:13,572
[SPEAKER_02]: The emergency meeting section has no amendments.

1161
01:36:14,743 --> 01:36:19,707
[SPEAKER_20]: You presented on the agenda for this evening, the word meetings, and this is a result of the change that took place.

1162
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:23,070
[SPEAKER_20]: So is it January 1st or is it September 1st?

1163
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:23,790
[SPEAKER_20]: What's it going to be?

1164
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:25,211
[SPEAKER_13]: It's September 1st as noted.

1165
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:30,095
[SPEAKER_20]: So if it's September 1st, then it does not become operative January 1st, but that's not the issue.

1166
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:33,017
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it is the issue.

1167
01:36:33,598 --> 01:36:37,641
[SPEAKER_02]: The phrase at the beginning that you referenced about January is also how the current rules read.

1168
01:36:39,057 --> 01:36:42,258
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch, this is an amendment to the existing rule two meetings.

1169
01:36:42,558 --> 01:36:47,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the content in this rules amendment is the current rules of the Medford City Council.

1170
01:36:48,379 --> 01:36:49,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not all brand new.

1171
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not all from, you know, come down from man on high, you know, the socialist demon.

1172
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally an amendment to the existing rules of the council rules, which you as a Councilor operated under for many years.

1173
01:37:02,581 --> 01:37:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You've cited two items that are not changing.

1174
01:37:06,235 --> 01:37:11,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It says that that first sentence in the current rule says tell me every Tuesday, starting on the first Tuesday in January.

1175
01:37:12,236 --> 01:37:14,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it says every two weeks, starting on the first Tuesday in January.

1176
01:37:15,017 --> 01:37:15,497
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it doesn't.

1177
01:37:15,557 --> 01:37:16,257
[SPEAKER_20]: It says in the bottom.

1178
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, September 1st.

1179
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:19,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So on September 1st, 2022.

1180
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:21,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna disagree.

1181
01:37:21,978 --> 01:37:24,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think this is no devil coming from the sky.

1182
01:37:26,059 --> 01:37:30,860
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly would not want the facts to dispute your opinion, and I understand that, and I will let you continue to speak.

1183
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1184
01:37:32,298 --> 01:37:33,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1185
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,561
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact of the matter is simply this.

1186
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:47,351
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason why we're here on a Tuesday night is whether, like last week, you folks only met for maybe 30, 35 minutes, and you've had a pretty easy go from January till now, but once the budget comes in and things start to pick up, okay, so be it.

1187
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:49,633
[SPEAKER_20]: But imagine if you had it every other week.

1188
01:37:50,474 --> 01:38:03,842
[SPEAKER_20]: And once the budget takes place and you start to get into every other week, and you're here four, five, six hours, and then you're going to put a time limit on because you're incapable of probably making an intelligent decision because it's kind of like late night.

1189
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:07,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do you want to disturb something that has worked?

1190
01:38:07,664 --> 01:38:13,388
[SPEAKER_20]: And more importantly, if you felt such a need for this, and if this council was

1191
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:21,291
[SPEAKER_20]: so engrossed in the fact that we had to change this, then why don't you just make it effective beginning September of the next election?

1192
01:38:21,572 --> 01:38:22,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would you do it?

1193
01:38:22,352 --> 01:38:23,753
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't even an election issue.

1194
01:38:23,993 --> 01:38:28,195
[SPEAKER_20]: So how did this become an issue right now, less than six months into the term?

1195
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:38,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just hard to understand information Council night, there's been a paper asking to reduce the number of council meetings to three per month that laid on the table for I have to say since 2012.

1196
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:48,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's never been discussed though it's not like this came out of the blue, this is something that's been discussed there's been there was a rules reform paper that came up previously.

1197
01:38:48,783 --> 01:38:55,907
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that, but it's been while it's been, it's not like it didn't come out of the, it came out of the blue, but while it's been discussed, it never got passed.

1198
01:38:56,107 --> 01:39:00,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question now, pardon me, until now, it's made it out of subcommittee and it's made, so it's made it out of subcommittee now.

1199
01:39:00,889 --> 01:39:09,894
[SPEAKER_20]: So the question is to the metric citizenry who are watching this, they're going to have to figure out, they only can come here every other week, but at the same time, at the same time, you have 18 committees.

1200
01:39:10,154 --> 01:39:16,858
[SPEAKER_20]: So are we going to say between the first week and the beginning of the second week, these 18 committees are going to work and your committee, the holes are going to work.

1201
01:39:18,512 --> 01:39:20,415
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, is that going to make any kind of sense.

1202
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:25,140
[SPEAKER_20]: There's 18 committees and there's only seven of you, and many of you are on the same committees.

1203
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:29,245
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, so how do you, how do you go through this, this process.

1204
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:35,623
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we did it before, Adam, it was we met every single Tuesday night.

1205
01:39:35,663 --> 01:39:35,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1206
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:39,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But we still had subcommittee structure, Bob, and we went through that.

1207
01:39:39,504 --> 01:39:41,044
[SPEAKER_09]: We still went through polling membership.

1208
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:42,064
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your schedule reflect?

1209
01:39:42,104 --> 01:39:42,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And when can we do it?

1210
01:39:42,765 --> 01:39:44,365
[SPEAKER_09]: All this is a minor scheduling issue.

1211
01:39:44,405 --> 01:39:46,506
[SPEAKER_09]: So turn this into like, you know what I mean?

1212
01:39:46,526 --> 01:39:50,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the end of the world or something, because you can't come down here and scream every every Tuesday instead every other Tuesday.

1213
01:39:51,247 --> 01:40:06,971
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean, it's the only place for a public forum, you've got your opinion, I have a forum on what it's a public forum for someone to come and speak on whatever the issue might be, it might be a neighborhood issue that doesn't find itself on the agenda, it might be an emergency that doesn't find itself on the agenda.

1214
01:40:07,071 --> 01:40:13,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have to wait every other week so much of an emergency that you're waiting for a Tuesday night to come here then there's something wrong, there's something really wrong with government.

1215
01:40:16,653 --> 01:40:17,974
[SPEAKER_20]: You have your opinion, I have mine.

1216
01:40:18,534 --> 01:40:21,796
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as that goes, Madam President, I said what I had to say.

1217
01:40:21,816 --> 01:40:28,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I just feel, like I said, it's been 82 years, it's operated under plan E, plan A. It's been every Tuesday night.

1218
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:31,462
[SPEAKER_20]: You never really know what the situation might be.

1219
01:40:31,482 --> 01:40:32,802
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you got elected, you knew.

1220
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:38,826
[SPEAKER_20]: You knew when you got elected, the meetings were going to be every Tuesday night and subcommittees were whenever they're going to take you.

1221
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:40,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And why should time?

1222
01:40:41,047 --> 01:40:42,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Why should time even be an issue?

1223
01:40:43,089 --> 01:40:47,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether you meet one night a week or whether you meet four times a week, that's what you got elected for.

1224
01:40:47,732 --> 01:40:50,134
[SPEAKER_20]: And whatever the issues are, they are.

1225
01:40:53,556 --> 01:40:58,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, being elected never bothered me to go to a meeting.

1226
01:40:59,175 --> 01:41:01,676
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it was every week, I went every week.

1227
01:41:01,976 --> 01:41:04,957
[SPEAKER_20]: If it was two or three times a week, we would meet two or three times a week.

1228
01:41:05,657 --> 01:41:07,438
[SPEAKER_20]: And let me just conclude by saying the following.

1229
01:41:08,078 --> 01:41:20,063
[SPEAKER_20]: If in fact, this council feels that they now want to change to every other week, please do not put anything on the agenda that asks for pay raise, because you would really be insulting the people of this community.

1230
01:41:25,184 --> 01:41:26,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Not from us to the administration and back.

1231
01:41:27,545 --> 01:41:28,865
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's not what I said.

1232
01:41:29,486 --> 01:41:42,090
[SPEAKER_20]: What I said is if you're going to make this vote to go to every other week, please don't come back and vote in support of a pay raise for yourself, because then $30,000 for every other week becomes overpaid.

1233
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:49,573
[SPEAKER_20]: And as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, when he made his comments two weeks ago, if you go to every other week, maybe you should reduce your salary from 30 to 15,000.

1234
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1235
01:41:51,693 --> 01:41:53,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Pente.

1236
01:41:54,514 --> 01:41:56,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Castagnetti on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

1237
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi Andrew Castagnetti, Method Mass.

1238
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:13,043
[SPEAKER_15]: To repeat myself from last week, it seems like after tens or hundreds of years that you want to change the rules in the middle of the game.

1239
01:42:13,403 --> 01:42:21,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't make good sense to me because if you're going to take off 20 meetings next year and

1240
01:42:23,114 --> 01:42:32,576
[SPEAKER_15]: He's still gonna get paid your $30,000 salary a year, plus expenses, and maybe even ask for a raise down the road.

1241
01:42:33,116 --> 01:42:39,717
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it's gonna be a huge mistake because you're handicapping against the people.

1242
01:42:40,858 --> 01:42:42,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish you would reconsider.

1243
01:42:42,098 --> 01:42:44,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for listening.

1244
01:42:46,539 --> 01:42:47,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1245
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Navarre, name and address for the record, please.

1246
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,060
[SPEAKER_19]: William Navarre, 108.

1247
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:56,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1248
01:42:56,943 --> 01:42:58,324
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm listening to these discussions.

1249
01:43:00,066 --> 01:43:06,231
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Penta and I have something in common in that we're part of a tiny minority of people who show up to a lot of these meetings.

1250
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:12,896
[SPEAKER_19]: The vast majority of the people, I think, when they vote, they're not thinking about, oh, this meeting, that meeting.

1251
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:17,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Even when it's really crowded in here, everybody can fit in this room.

1252
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:24,595
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a tiny minority of the voters that actually come here and are focused on what is the meeting schedule in order to be how they vote.

1253
01:43:24,915 --> 01:43:27,696
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't understand why we would need to worry about that.

1254
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:33,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that the councilors we've elected are able to judge probably correctly that that's not what the voters are thinking about.

1255
01:43:33,739 --> 01:43:34,840
[SPEAKER_19]: They're thinking about what gets done.

1256
01:43:35,963 --> 01:43:42,369
[SPEAKER_19]: more to the point, when you come and participate at something that's actually on the agenda, it's more likely to actually make a difference.

1257
01:43:42,849 --> 01:43:55,962
[SPEAKER_19]: And you'll have that opportunity during the subcommittee meeting, because generally at the end, or sometimes if you have something relevant to say, you contribute during that time to make a difference in policy, getting something done in the city, rather than just

1258
01:43:57,628 --> 01:44:00,870
[SPEAKER_19]: public participation at the end of the city council meeting.

1259
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,891
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, somebody's going this way, somebody's going that way.

1260
01:44:04,192 --> 01:44:10,235
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, that's sort of, you had some lady comes up about, you know, something that's totally else, worried about parking.

1261
01:44:10,455 --> 01:44:13,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's just so many things going on and none of it really gets addressed anyways.

1262
01:44:14,497 --> 01:44:25,343
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you have these meetings where you can show up, where something's got to be dealt with in depth, and you know, if you speak there, you can actually make a difference on the policy rather than just sort of complaining.

1263
01:44:26,495 --> 01:44:29,636
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually, I think, a really valuable thing that we're gonna have that opportunity.

1264
01:44:30,777 --> 01:44:40,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if the city isn't getting much done, the council isn't getting much done, you can give up your talk all you want, but it's not gonna make a lick of difference because the city council isn't getting anything done.

1265
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:52,806
[SPEAKER_19]: So for that reason, I actually think this is going to enable people to show up for things they actually care about, things that are actually gonna be acted upon.

1266
01:44:52,826 --> 01:44:54,887
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think,

1267
01:44:55,681 --> 01:44:57,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a big improvement.

1268
01:44:57,843 --> 01:45:02,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the voters, I don't think they're thinking about, they've never been in here except for maybe to vote earlier or something.

1269
01:45:03,747 --> 01:45:10,333
[SPEAKER_19]: So to me, it makes a lot of sense to make sure that we're focusing on things that are actually gonna get acted upon.

1270
01:45:10,353 --> 01:45:20,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight is always correctly saying, I always echo whatever he says, like, yes, because we should be focused on things within the purview of the city council.

1271
01:45:21,221 --> 01:45:23,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that happens at subcommittee.

1272
01:45:25,168 --> 01:45:26,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything's already been vetted.

1273
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:27,832
[SPEAKER_19]: It's something that they're actually gonna do.

1274
01:45:28,893 --> 01:45:30,255
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what I would have to say about that.

1275
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:30,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1276
01:45:31,157 --> 01:45:31,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Navarre.

1277
01:45:32,519 --> 01:45:33,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

1278
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:36,645
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, Vice President Bears.

1279
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:40,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say since I didn't speak before public comment.

1280
01:45:41,657 --> 01:45:51,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, thank you, Madam President, for your gracious administration allowing members of the public to speak beyond the, the way that the rules are are outlined.

1281
01:45:51,982 --> 01:45:54,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when possible that's a good thing.

1282
01:45:54,824 --> 01:45:56,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it every time that we can.

1283
01:45:57,385 --> 01:45:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that should be noted.

1284
01:46:00,697 --> 01:46:03,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I think former councilor Penta got it exactly right.

1285
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:07,163
[SPEAKER_02]: We were elected to represent the people the best way we think possible.

1286
01:46:07,764 --> 01:46:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, it seems to me that the majority of us think that this is the best way possible to serve the residents.

1287
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're doing this.

1288
01:46:16,112 --> 01:46:18,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we will see what the product is.

1289
01:46:19,976 --> 01:46:24,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said it last time and I said this time, all we can do is try.

1290
01:46:25,102 --> 01:46:26,643
[SPEAKER_02]: If we succeed, we succeed.

1291
01:46:26,903 --> 01:46:28,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we fail, we need to own up to it.

1292
01:46:29,043 --> 01:46:32,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I believe, what accountability looks like.

1293
01:46:33,045 --> 01:46:40,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, last meeting we discussed this, I'll be the first person to hold myself accountable if this doesn't go the way that we expect it to go.

1294
01:46:40,807 --> 01:46:46,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for your leadership of this meeting and of this council.

1295
01:46:46,829 --> 01:46:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to my colleagues for your discussion.

1296
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:52,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand we agree to disagree on this and we shall see what happens.

1297
01:46:52,911 --> 01:46:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1298
01:46:55,795 --> 01:46:59,816
[SPEAKER_18]: I also wanted to speak because I didn't speak before the public participation section.

1299
01:47:01,676 --> 01:47:04,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, very similar sentiments to Councilor bears.

1300
01:47:05,477 --> 01:47:24,641
[SPEAKER_18]: First, I am, you know, I think our debate has been reasonable, reasonable and our debate has been polite and civil, and I think this is you know, this is the path I want to see our city embracing when it comes to talking about controversial issues like this.

1301
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:39,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I do, you know, the way I view this issue is, I like Councilor where's I have to think about what the best way we can make change in Medford is, and in my experience, even though it's short.

1302
01:47:41,587 --> 01:47:44,389
[SPEAKER_18]: it's through subcommittee work we've gotten so much work done there.

1303
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:56,419
[SPEAKER_18]: We've gotten so we've, we've gotten around so many disagreements and we've converged on a lot of stances we've asked the hard questions, and that time in the subcommittee meeting allows us to do much more.

1304
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:05,767
[SPEAKER_18]: And it allows us to go deeper into the details, which I think is what ultimately will benefit the residents of our city.

1305
01:48:06,587 --> 01:48:09,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's an opportunity cost to this.

1306
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,371
[SPEAKER_18]: to not taking this decision as well.

1307
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:17,074
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we, we, we lose out.

1308
01:48:17,434 --> 01:48:25,458
[SPEAKER_18]: If we don't vote yes tonight because, in my opinion, because we were throwing away a chance to operate more efficiently and a chance to operate better.

1309
01:48:25,998 --> 01:48:30,361
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're in this is a mode of operation that many communities around us.

1310
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:31,530
[SPEAKER_18]: take.

1311
01:48:32,991 --> 01:48:49,317
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we're not reinventing the wheel here, we're just doing something that has worked for many, and something that we believe that will work for us, and if it doesn't work, we'll own the consequences and I'd be happy to revert back to our previous structure.

1312
01:48:49,537 --> 01:48:54,819
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do believe that this structure is worth trying, and it's worth a shot.

1313
01:48:55,719 --> 01:49:12,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I also wanted to clear up some, I think, some narratives that might not completely reflect, um, you know the the actual debate that the actual item that we're talking about when when when we, when we hear that we're cutting meetings in half that's just not true.

1314
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,842
[SPEAKER_18]: We're meeting the same amount if not more.

1315
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:36,002
[SPEAKER_18]: We're spending our time meeting in different formats, right, because we believe that those different formats will be more conducive to pushing more legislation out of the council to help to help us actually address issues that will tangibly improve the life of the lives of our citizens in our residents here in Medford.

1316
01:49:36,863 --> 01:49:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we Councilor Collins.

1317
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:45,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Last time we discussed this also put on an on an amendment that would have us meet throughout the summer.

1318
01:49:46,411 --> 01:49:53,837
[SPEAKER_18]: And that in itself, actually increases the amount of time that we are spending doing our jobs as city Councilors.

1319
01:49:54,578 --> 01:50:05,226
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, really, we, if anything, we are increasing the amount of work that we that we're taking on, and we're we're charging into it headfirst and optimistic.

1320
01:50:06,407 --> 01:50:10,588
[SPEAKER_18]: we'll be reflective and we'll be accepting of the consequences.

1321
01:50:11,128 --> 01:50:17,850
[SPEAKER_18]: But my morals tell me that as a Councilor, I have to vote for what I think is right.

1322
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:28,393
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, like I've always said, it would trouble me to not vote for something that I think could be a positive change.

1323
01:50:28,933 --> 01:50:34,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it ends up being a change that we might need to reverse, then we'll own that decision.

1324
01:50:35,235 --> 01:50:43,340
[SPEAKER_18]: But to me, I'll accept the consequences because I'm optimistic that the benefits will be worth it.

1325
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:47,223
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's in my moral code to vote for it.

1326
01:50:47,883 --> 01:50:51,705
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do understand where the other side is coming from on this debate.

1327
01:50:52,786 --> 01:50:53,266
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand.

1328
01:50:56,008 --> 01:51:02,770
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've said in meetings past that I found those points compelling as well and it was a difficult debate for me, myself to weigh.

1329
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:07,532
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is where I come, this is the conclusion I've come to.

1330
01:51:09,073 --> 01:51:24,558
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, like, like Councilor Bears and like other councillors on different sides of this issue of have said, I think we have to agree to disagree, and then reflect in a few months or in a year, and, and see where we're at.

1331
01:51:26,436 --> 01:51:27,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Council President.

1332
01:51:27,696 --> 01:51:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1333
01:51:29,157 --> 01:51:36,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Last thing, because I don't know if I missed something because we are all highly educated people behind this rail.

1334
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if I missed this along the way.

1335
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one of you can answer this.

1336
01:51:42,781 --> 01:51:49,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we at any time hindering the process of properly having subcommittees

1337
01:51:50,803 --> 01:51:55,684
[SPEAKER_03]: by not allowing a four-meeting month.

1338
01:51:56,704 --> 01:51:58,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something that I'm missing?

1339
01:51:58,685 --> 01:52:01,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody keeps saying that we're getting so much done in subcommittees.

1340
01:52:02,426 --> 01:52:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting so much done in subcommittees, and I totally agree, but I'm just a little confused.

1341
01:52:06,727 --> 01:52:07,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody keeps saying this.

1342
01:52:08,247 --> 01:52:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need clarification.

1343
01:52:09,227 --> 01:52:18,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I miss something in a document that said that we cannot have subcommittees any other day to perform this great work we're all doing?

1344
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:19,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I miss that?

1345
01:52:22,133 --> 01:52:22,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1346
01:52:25,995 --> 01:52:30,158
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1347
01:52:32,459 --> 01:52:33,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng yes.

1357

[SPEAKER_04]: President.

1358
01:52:48,309 --> 01:52:51,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, five in the affirmative to in the negative the motion passes.

1359
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,982
[SPEAKER_13]: We still have public participation.

1360
01:52:56,082 --> 01:52:58,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Any additional public participation, either on Zoom or in person?

1361
01:53:01,947 --> 01:53:04,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

1362
01:53:11,715 --> 01:53:12,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Should be able to unmute.

1363
01:53:16,298 --> 01:53:17,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

1364
01:53:17,939 --> 01:53:20,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have one question to you, the chair.

1365
01:53:21,862 --> 01:53:25,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there an important meeting tomorrow night at city hall?

1366
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:27,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I apologize.

1367
01:53:27,423 --> 01:53:29,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So we had to cancel due to illness.

1368
01:53:29,364 --> 01:53:31,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, we are looking to reschedule.

1369
01:53:31,384 --> 01:53:32,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to thank you for reminding me.

1370
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:36,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to note that, but the committee of the whole for tomorrow night has been canceled due to illness.

1371
01:53:36,365 --> 01:53:39,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, um, we are looking to reschedule.

1372
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:42,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1373
01:53:42,647 --> 01:53:43,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Who, who, who's ill?

1374
01:53:45,648 --> 01:53:46,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's personal.

1375
01:53:46,608 --> 01:53:47,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't tell that one.

1376
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:51,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't feel so sorry.

1377
01:53:52,582 --> 01:53:54,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I am so sorry.

1378
01:53:55,083 --> 01:53:55,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

1379
01:54:02,205 --> 01:54:02,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Uncle Albert.

1380
01:54:05,106 --> 01:54:06,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Casagnetti.

1381
01:54:07,686 --> 01:54:08,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, good luck.

1382
01:54:08,947 --> 01:54:11,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Address for the record, please.

1383
01:54:15,469 --> 01:54:19,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Russell Phillips from 75 Jerome Street here in town.

1384
01:54:21,283 --> 01:54:23,803
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not sure whether this is the venue for it.

1385
01:54:23,823 --> 01:54:26,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate your time, Madam President and all the Councilors.

1386
01:54:27,584 --> 01:54:39,326
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just wanted to say something about the Medford High Pool and to just make sure everybody here knows that I'm speaking just personally.

1387
01:54:40,006 --> 01:54:50,808
[SPEAKER_17]: It kept me sane and was so well run during the pandemic all the way through Rachel Perry and Sean Perry and

1388
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:58,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Dylan and Lauren were so helpful every day they kept us all alive they kept us all safe.

1389
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:13,817
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to make sure that the council knew what a great services is for so many citizens there were so many days that Rachel sent out.

1390
01:55:15,641 --> 01:55:22,444
[SPEAKER_17]: emails to everybody, letting people know whether we had lanes and now that the restrictions are off, it's just running great.

1391
01:55:23,524 --> 01:55:24,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1392
01:55:25,405 --> 01:55:26,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

1393
01:55:27,766 --> 01:55:29,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Phillips, thank you for checking in this evening.

1394
01:55:31,468 --> 01:55:38,630
[SPEAKER_09]: It suggests that you might give the superintendent of schools a call and let her know what a great job her athletic department is doing and her team over there at the community schools.

1395
01:55:38,891 --> 01:55:42,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Maloney, our athletic director, Rachel Perry, our assistant athletic director,

1396
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:44,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Our ACEs, they do a great job for us.

1397
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:54,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that the superintendent would love to hear that they did such a great job and what an impact that having the pool open for you meant to you during the COVID pandemic.

1398
01:55:54,132 --> 01:56:00,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could do that, I think that'd be a nice feather in Bobby and Rachel's cap as well as the rest of the staff over there.

1399
01:56:01,513 --> 01:56:02,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1400
01:56:02,313 --> 01:56:04,614
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, Mr. Phillips, thank you for your words.

1401
01:56:05,354 --> 01:56:07,654
[SPEAKER_13]: As someone swimming has kept me sane for most of my life.

1402
01:56:07,674 --> 01:56:09,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate your words on that.

1403
01:56:09,595 --> 01:56:11,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And I connect with that.

1404
01:56:11,515 --> 01:56:11,955
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1405
01:56:13,928 --> 01:56:14,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1406
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:17,090
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1407
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:20,552
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe a couple of weeks ago, this council passed two resolutions.

1408
01:56:20,693 --> 01:56:26,997
[SPEAKER_20]: One was a million dollars for new sidewalks, and I believe the second one was for $250,000 to remove tree stumps.

1409
01:56:27,497 --> 01:56:36,823
[SPEAKER_20]: But there was no identification of where the sidewalks were going to go over and beyond money for new panels, and there was no identification as to what tree stumps were going to go.

1410
01:56:37,404 --> 01:56:43,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, over the past few years, here in Medford, former public works director had one,

1411
01:56:43,688 --> 01:56:50,713
[SPEAKER_20]: two types of lists, one for tree stumps, and one for sidewalks, but unfortunately when the council passed at this time nobody asked that question.

1412
01:56:51,173 --> 01:56:57,777
[SPEAKER_20]: So as a citizen, the council did ask, they asked a question of where they're going to be located, the tree stumps, and the sidewalk.

1413
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:05,323
[SPEAKER_20]: So is there any way that that could be made a public disclosure, either on this, we don't have any city newspaper anymore.

1414
01:57:05,623 --> 01:57:12,408
[SPEAKER_20]: So method patch, or in the city web page could that go on there as soon as we get it, we can put it in, we have a dry folder.

1415
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:18,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, you say as soon as you get I understand that but you should have had it the night that you took the vote.

1416
01:57:19,733 --> 01:57:31,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Council night was a borrowing paper I believe requires three readings only reading the paper is going to come back to this council for further discussion and debate, because the bar paper so requires a third reading before the money gets.

1417
01:57:31,887 --> 01:57:34,290
[SPEAKER_20]: But, but is there a list right now that it is available.

1418
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:36,232
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not gotten that as of yet.

1419
01:57:37,331 --> 01:57:42,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I was also told, I believe earlier this week, that they're having a meeting about stumps to prioritize.

1420
01:57:43,536 --> 01:57:47,358
[SPEAKER_20]: So then just a very simple question, not to beg the issue, but maybe it is.

1421
01:57:47,498 --> 01:57:52,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you get something to vote on, especially tree stumps, much more than sidewalks.

1422
01:57:53,803 --> 01:57:55,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Those locations should have identified.

1423
01:57:55,484 --> 01:57:58,687
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the third time something like this has been presented to the council.

1424
01:57:59,207 --> 01:58:01,489
[SPEAKER_20]: So did you get the first two lists?

1425
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:05,472
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, have any of these lists

1426
01:58:06,187 --> 01:58:10,968
[SPEAKER_20]: tree stumps from the first of the second list even been taken care of some of them with duplicates especially on sidewalks.

1427
01:58:11,488 --> 01:58:13,909
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a thought because some residents are saying a million dollars.

1428
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:15,549
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of money for sidewalks.

1429
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:22,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding we lost the sidewalk contract last year because we couldn't get them to go out right so we appropriated the funds and the money went.

1430
01:58:22,791 --> 01:58:27,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we ever spent the money from last year sidewalks, because it's not carried over.

1431
01:58:28,122 --> 01:58:43,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Karen's was talking about how the construction market was hot and JD DiRenzo wasn't able to come out and perform the work and they will be contracted with, if I'm not mistaken, but I don't, I mean, we have a, we have a DPW commissioner now right.

1432
01:58:44,173 --> 01:58:44,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Tim.

1433
01:58:44,493 --> 01:58:46,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's Tim McGibbon, that's right.

1434
01:58:46,254 --> 01:58:48,275
[SPEAKER_09]: They shuffle around so much over there, I can't figure it out.

1435
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:51,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it possible, Madam President, you can just secure a list for both?

1436
01:58:51,377 --> 01:58:52,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I will follow up on it once more.

1437
01:58:53,097 --> 01:58:55,879
[SPEAKER_13]: It was part of the council that requested when we voted for it.

1438
01:58:55,939 --> 01:58:56,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I will follow up on it once more.

1439
01:58:57,139 --> 01:58:59,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it matters to us too.

1440
01:58:59,461 --> 01:58:59,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1441
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:00,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course.

1442
01:59:00,301 --> 01:59:00,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1443
01:59:02,662 --> 01:59:05,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else would like to speak for public participation?

1444
01:59:08,245 --> 01:59:09,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, he's gone.

1445
01:59:09,486 --> 01:59:10,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1446
01:59:10,846 --> 01:59:12,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I have a motion to adjourn?

1447
01:59:14,422 --> 01:59:19,346
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn seconded by Vice President Bears.

1448
01:59:19,907 --> 01:59:21,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1449
01:59:22,028 --> 01:59:22,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1450
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Council carriello.

[SPEAKER_04]: Council calls.

1453
01:59:29,574 --> 01:59:30,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Council night.

1454
01:59:33,678 --> 01:59:34,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to adjourn Council night.

1455
01:59:42,642 --> 01:59:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpella you're up.

1456
01:59:43,744 --> 01:59:46,327
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're talking about on Thursday and Friday and Monday.
