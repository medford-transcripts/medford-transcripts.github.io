00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:30,943
Present.

23
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:32,544
Mayor Longo-Kern?

24
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:34,505
Present.

25
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,567
Seven present, zero absent.

26
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:41,930
We can start out.

27
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:47,373
And I think we have a big birthday in the crowd, right, 50?

28
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:50,195
Well, happy birthday.

29
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,484
Thank you, I don't know what you're talking about.

30
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:54,505
Happy birthday.

31
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,528
We'll announce it at this meeting when not many people watch it.

32
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:58,168
Thank you.

33
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:02,972
Come on, 50's the best.

34
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,533
Best decade ever.

35
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,374
50's the new 40, right?

36
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:11,659
Wow, 50's when you like, I think, come into your own and you don't stop caring about what everybody thinks.

37
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:15,442
I think Paul doesn't care.

38
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,103
That's not new for me.

39
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:17,003
Paul's there already?

40
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:17,804
Yeah, well.

41
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:18,625
Yeah, just saying.

42
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,030
Yeah, no, I think we evolve.

43
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,351
I think it's a good decade.

44
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:31,733
I'm not sure if we have Mr. McLaughlin on, but I know we have the school administration.

45
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:34,294
I don't know if you wanna get us started and then we can ask questions.

46
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:43,876
Sure, Mayor, the superintendent will be joining momentarily, I think, but if you'd like me to just jump in, as the mayor said,

47
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:57,052
When the meeting was called to order, this is a discussion on the approximately $816,000 that was appropriated in September by the Medford City Council, drawn from two existing funding sources.

48
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:02,896
They were unused funds for two projects that were previously completed at Medford High School.

49
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:13,082
The council reclassified those funds, and at the time, the district sought the appropriation for those funds, and because we were under the impression at that point

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:36,294
that a lot of the HVAC repair work that it was becoming clear at that point was going to be important to complete in order for us to bring students and staff back into the buildings to a full capacity amid the heightened air quality standards that we were living under as a result of the pandemic.

51
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:40,177
And therefore we sought that funding so that we had essentially

52
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:45,728
a reservoir of funding that we could use for the projects that we largely then were able to complete.

53
00:03:46,528 --> 00:04:07,684
As our understanding and as the guidance evolved related to the external funding sources, specifically the CARES Act funding, as there was greater clarity with that, we were able to essentially charge most of the HVAC repair work that was completed for this school year, the emergency work as it were,

54
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,497
we were able to use those external funds for that.

55
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:14,840
So as a result, the 816,000 is still intact.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,866
And there's been a discussion in this forum and then in some of the subcommittees as to what the priorities of that funding will be.

57
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:35,857
Mayor, I do have a one slide deck that I could show if you'd like me to, to just give sort of a high level view of what are some of the potential priorities that have been identified.

58
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,437
There's only four or five of them.

59
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,218
So I'm happy to just discuss them as well.

60
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,259
But if you'd like the visual, I'm happy to put that up.

61
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,039
That'd be great.

62
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:42,399
Thank you.

63
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,981
Pretty sure this is it.

64
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:52,483
Right.

65
00:04:52,603 --> 00:05:04,887
So again, I don't think there's anything new here because we've had this discussion in various forums, but the sort of top five or so on our

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:21,723
on our list of things that if there are no restrictions and just things we think of that need to be done or should be done based on the fact that they've been discussed for some time within the community, it has to do with the restroom rehabilitation project.

67
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:33,125
I should say that in addition to the 816, there's approximately 160,000 or so remaining from an appropriation that was made, I believe in December of 2019,

68
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:42,127
It was a $300,000 appropriation, and there were three or four priorities within that allocation.

69
00:05:42,607 --> 00:06:00,493
The restroom project is the largest piece of that that has not yet been completed, and that's the one that we talked about a month or so ago that we've met with the architect that provided the initial quote, and we're preparing the RFP to put that out to bid in the hope that that work can be completed late spring, early summer.

70
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:07,868
There has been discussion here, and I assume there will be tonight, as to whether or not that should be expanded to encompass additional restrooms.

71
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:16,573
The $155,000 quote, and that's an approximation, it's somewhere between 150 and 160, is for one set of restrooms.

72
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:20,495
So one boys, one girls on the second floor of C building.

73
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:29,100
When we met with the architect, Mr. McLaughlin and I spoke about whether or not we could assume that would be proportional

74
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:39,708
In other words, if we were able to, if we were to say do all three restrooms that are stacked on top of each other in the building, could we multiply that quote by three and have an expectation that the cost would be, that would be about accurate.

75
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,171
We were told that that would be about accurate.

76
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:56,200
So I think obviously we have to, and he did say that there would be a need for new specifications to be drawn up for each set of restrooms due to even the slightest variability

77
00:06:56,724 --> 00:07:02,408
in the dimensions of the areas would require a specific specification.

78
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:12,354
So based on where they are in the building and the size of the rooms, the expectation is that the complexity of the project is pretty similar.

79
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,976
But I can't say definitively that it would be 155,000 times three.

80
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:23,009
There also did not seem to be the case that there would be any types of savings if we were to do all three.

81
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:44,068
That was sort of one of the things that we were asking about was if we were to commit to this to be a larger scale project and put it out to bid for say all three restrooms, could we anticipate savings because either through labor or materials and based on the scarcity of materials that's taking place in the world right now and the fact that only so much labor can be done at one time,

82
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:52,026
The indication was that there wouldn't be a significant amount of savings, but obviously that potential is there.

83
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:59,752
The front entrance rehabilitation project was a part of a conversation at the previous buildings and grounds subcommittee meeting.

84
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,212
I believe Ms.

85
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,695
Kretz reported on that at the last school committee meeting.

86
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:09,739
And I think everyone's familiar with that project and probably frankly, much more so than I am being relatively new.

87
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,126
The HVAC repair projects are a continuation.

88
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:17,589
We got a lot of work done this year.

89
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:22,593
Our HVAC systems, I think it's probably fair to say, are in better condition than they have been in some time.

90
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:31,380
But they were emergency work and there was some manipulation of systems that were done to make sure that we were meeting the heightened air quality standards.

91
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:39,327
But we were advised at the time that not every strategy that was employed would be sustainable over an extended period of time.

92
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:57,401
And so the manifestations of that, some folks, members of the community who may have been in Medford High School in recent months have probably noticed that there's a fluctuation in temperature that is not necessarily ideal or something that we want to make a permanent fixture in the facility.

93
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:08,267
And so there'll be additional work that has to happen in terms of adjusting dampers and making sure that all of our systems are aligned in a way that our coils are properly maintained in a way that

94
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:14,676
Hopefully we can have some more stability with it with regard to temperature, particularly during the winter months.

95
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:23,398
Our information technology category, and again, you see that we haven't put a specific amount here because it really depends on the scale that the committee would like to commit to.

96
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:35,362
We have some larger infrastructure projects that really could be of a very, very broad range that I think we'd have to take into account the lifespan of each individual building before committing to, and then some

97
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:48,035
smaller projects that still have large price tags, like rehabilitation of our virtual infrastructure and essentially our backup systems to make sure that if we have a significant crash of some kind, we're able to get right back online.

98
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:53,536
We do have specific numbers or quotes with regard to some of those smaller projects that I could detail for you if you'd like.

99
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,257
And again, same thing with security enhancements.

100
00:09:56,937 --> 00:10:03,878
This is, as I've said at the Buildings and Ground Subcommittee, and I stress here, particularly with a slightly larger audience, that there is no,

101
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,132
significant security liability that we are aware of.

102
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:14,697
But when we're talking about how do we make improvements with regard to infrastructure, security enhancements are always a piece of that.

103
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:31,672
And while you might not want to detail those in a public forum, I do want to reassure the committee that its inclusion on this list is not an indication that we have any specific concerns related to the security of any individual building, just something that we have to keep in mind as a strategic priority at all times.

104
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:32,353
So

105
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,857
Recap restroom rehabilitation at the high school.

106
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:36,737
It's definitely a priority.

107
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:45,442
It's just a question of scale and how, how much we want to do and when the front entrance, which has been, I know, a priority within the community for some time.

108
00:10:45,462 --> 00:11:00,771
HVAC repairs, which I think came to our attention as a result of the heightened air quality standards under which we're living, but really is something that I think is maybe a silver lining to some of the work we had to do is that we've been able to improve those systems for the time being.

109
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,492
And we want to make sure

110
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:03,428
that those improvements are sustainable.

111
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:15,177
Our information technology and security enhancements are things that are always going to be a priority and it's just a matter of making continuous progress on those fronts.

112
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:16,538
Thank you, Mayor.

113
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,241
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

114
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:20,822
Member Kratz?

115
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:30,089
Yes, so when we had our meeting for the building and ground subcommittee meeting, we had voted to

116
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:37,913
to make sure that the generator in Mifflin High School was a priority item on the upcoming capital improvement plan.

117
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,855
I don't see that here.

118
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:50,885
And, you know, what I recall from our meeting was that during our discussion about the front entrance, that it was recommended by

119
00:11:52,803 --> 00:12:01,250
Mr. Chris Andreessen, who is an architect that currently, legally, we would either leave it as is or have to do the whole project.

120
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,854
And we would need to hire, I guess, a structural engineer.

121
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:10,157
I think that's what he said.

122
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:13,199
So I was just curious about that.

123
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,181
Did anything change?

124
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,484
Did we get a new estimate on that work?

125
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:50,353
No specific estimate and nothing's changed materially other than it's my understanding that given the urgency of those, of the generator project in particular, that that's going to have to be moved up either as part of the existing capital improvements budget or potentially if, you know, in a worst case scenario, some other type of emergency funding priority, because you're right that that's not on this list, but this was a list that sort of predated the recognition of that

126
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,639
having to move up the list with regard to urgency.

127
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,440
So it may be more accurate, Ms.

128
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,941
Gretz, to incorporate that into this.

129
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:09,986
And so if that's misleading in any way, I apologize, but I can circle back with Mr. McLaughlin and get back to the committee as to where we think from a timeline perspective that that could be addressed.

130
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:16,189
With regard to the front entrance piece, I think there's some strategic decisions that have to be made there because there's,

131
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,561
sort of various price points we could potentially hit, depending on what the committee wants to do.

132
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:27,402
And I think we would defer to the committee as to what direction you want to take with regard to that.

133
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:32,923
Thank you.

134
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:34,583
Thank you, Member Kratz.

135
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,264
Member Rousseau?

136
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:41,285
Thank you very much.

137
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,826
You mentioned the temperature fluctuating in the high school, and I realized that

138
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,518
Mr. Murphy, you're relatively new to the district.

139
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:54,761
I just want you to know that that is not a new problem, it's an understatement.

140
00:13:56,261 --> 00:14:05,766
Kids that have to figure out where their class is and then figure out whether or not they need their mittens and coats in the winter in the high school is not new.

141
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:14,630
When you say, of course, I'm hoping that with all the work that went on over the last year,

142
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:26,948
when you talk about fluctuations, you're talking about it's a little too cold, it's a little too warm versus needing to get your snowmobile suit on in some classes and then get your swimsuit on in other classes.

143
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:29,848
Is that what you're saying is going on now?

144
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:37,590
Or are we still in a situation where parts of the high school are sort of ridiculously cold while other parts are sweltering?

145
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:44,452
Well, I think at times,

146
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:49,135
parts of the building are too cold and times parts of the building are too hot.

147
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,516
I think that's definitely true.

148
00:14:51,536 --> 00:15:06,742
I am not aware of any situations in which the temperature was at a point where it was prohibitive in terms of conducting business or having school, but I think there is a need to stabilize those systems as much as possible.

149
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:11,664
And you're correct, I'm not surprised to hear that it's not necessarily new,

150
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,110
I suspect that it's exacerbated.

151
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,231
Well, I know it's exacerbated.

152
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:17,672
We were told it was going to be exacerbated.

153
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:25,617
As someone with an office in the building, I can attest to the fact that it's been exacerbated from time to time as a result of the modifications that were made.

154
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:29,219
Okay, so the modifications that we, thank you.

155
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:38,044
The modification we've made really were focused on airflow, not temperature control of any sort, correct?

156
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:47,450
Yes, I mean, the intention is air quality, but as a way of doing that, the byproduct of that is fluctuation in temperature.

157
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,291
The intent was not to affect, it wasn't about climate control with regard to temperature.

158
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:56,592
That was merely a byproduct of bringing in more fresh air.

159
00:15:57,272 --> 00:16:03,694
And by doing that, the result in terms of how the systems respond was more fluctuation in temperatures.

160
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:06,475
And that's true both at the high school and at the outer buildings.

161
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:08,255
Thank you.

162
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:15,393
Earlier today, I sent you a copy of our capital improvement plan from our committee of the whole on April 3rd of 2019.

163
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,215
And I realized that you didn't create that.

164
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:31,902
And I also realized we had a pandemic apparently going on here that might've put those plans that we made kind of into complete free fall and turmoil.

165
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:36,484
One of the things in our regular meeting we have is the solar panel.

166
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,196
approval that's coming up at our regular meeting.

167
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:58,162
But I noticed that we also have in the old capital improvement plan from 2019 that we were going to spend a half a million dollars, pardon me, I'm wearing glasses, I can't read this, that we were going to redo the entire roof of the Andrews before we did the solar.

168
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,062
Did that happen already?

169
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,564
Dr. Cushing's saying yes, I'll take his word for it.

170
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:04,952
Excellent.

171
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:10,034
I just wanted to, I mean, when we had that meeting, we were kind of like, we're not gonna put solar on a roof that's not good, right?

172
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:11,634
So I'm glad to hear that.

173
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:24,519
And then the other thing that's on this plan, and it's for fiscal year 2020, and I get it, but like, whatever we planned in April of 2019 sort of went out the window to a large extent, it had to.

174
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
But I certainly see some,

175
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,482
as we all do probably on Facebook, commentary about the asphalt for the entire Andrews McGlynn complex.

176
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:43,965
We had indicated we were gonna spend $250,000 to redo the asphalt, essentially the entire complex.

177
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:49,906
My understanding is people are still losing entire parts of their cars in some of the potholes.

178
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,848
Is that on anybody's radar to spend that money

179
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,953
deal with, I mean, this is my fourth year on school committee and I'm kind of growing tired of the, you can't drive that way.

180
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:05,775
I mean, we should put some speed bumps in there, but that's a different conversation.

181
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,918
Freedom Way is, sorry.

182
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:12,719
Yes, Freedom Way is on the radar.

183
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:16,240
I'm trying to get a most recent update from City Engineer.

184
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,142
Thank you so much.

185
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:19,642
Great.

186
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,343
And if I may ask,

187
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:34,309
I remember from our 2019 conversation around the Freedomway was that the roadway is not a roadway.

188
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,670
It's just property on the school grounds.

189
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,091
And that limited the ability for the city to use regular roadway funding.

190
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:54,733
Has there been any progress on, I think there was some paper or something that had to be filed with somebody to convert that to an official roadway so that that could just move to the city, the DPW to deal with it like any other roadway.

191
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,306
do you notice anything going on with that?

192
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:11,657
The week of the 13th, we did repair all the potholes and I got an update that our city engineer is working to get Freedom Way accepted as a city of Medford Street so we can use chapter 90 funding to repair it.

193
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:14,699
So our city engineer is working on that.

194
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,061
Thank you, that's wonderful.

195
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,662
I'm happy to hear that, thank you.

196
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:20,583
That's all I have for the moment.

197
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,424
HAB-Juliette Boone, Moderatoring): Jenny has her hand.

198
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,473
HAB-Juliette Boone, Moderatoring): Yes, it Melanie I saw member McLaughlin the member Graham.

199
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:37,335
Thank you.

200
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,457
I guess just getting back to the cooling and heating.

201
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:59,410
I know, Dave, you weren't here for this, but a few years ago, we had to, prior to my being on school committee, we came to school committee, I came to school committee as a result of my daughter in the summer fun camp and who was getting really overheated with the summer fun camp.

202
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,394
And I had gone in there, we had actually several community members donated portable air conditioners

203
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,115
to help students in those environments.

204
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:17,297
They ended up having to go with like an administrative room that they created as sort of a cool down room for the kids because they were just getting super overheated.

205
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:26,218
My daughter has Down syndrome and gets overheated more quickly than neurotypical children, but still, and I would go into the building to pick her up or drop her off.

206
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:33,400
And the, I don't know what it is along the building, along the community school sort of aisle, but I did bring it to

207
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,593
the assistant superintendent's attention at the time, there were these look like radiators.

208
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,259
I don't know if that's what they are, but they were just like blowing heat.

209
00:20:42,944 --> 00:21:04,742
know in 90 100 degree weather and hot air was just coming out of them as well um but the administrative offices obviously were all air conditioned so the kids were just in this state of like real it was a couple of summers ago when we had that really bad heat wave so to remember russo's point i guess you know especially when we're you know having

210
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:10,434
know, younger vulnerable kids or any kids really sort of in that setting, especially when it's so hot.

211
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:19,926
I know that I've spoken with teachers in the past who have said that they can barely teach with the heat in their room and trying to figure out fans and what have you.

212
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:23,110
So I guess, again, to remember Rousseau's point, sort of

213
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,029
Is this on the radar?

214
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,170
And if so, how?

215
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:36,077
I know that, again, the HVAC stuff was primarily to assist with airflow for COVID, but this other issue has been a longstanding issue.

216
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:43,122
I think Dr. Cushing wants to respond, so I'll defer for the time being.

217
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:51,749
While not knowing the situation you mentioned several years ago, Medford High School, many parts of it are not actually set up for air conditioning as

218
00:21:53,855 --> 00:22:00,382
And the hot air coming in is when the unit ventilators are working just to do normal air exchange.

219
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:02,805
They're bringing air from the outside in.

220
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:14,398
And, you know, if there's hot water being passed through the unit ventilator in the wintertime, then that air being brought in over will then condition the room in a heated sense.

221
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:24,442
But there's no central cooling plant or central cooling to cool any large portion of the building.

222
00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:36,328
And that's why you see offices or other spaces that have window unit air conditioners in as opposed to a large scale cooling situation.

223
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:41,751
So I don't think there's, from my knowledge, ever been any research done on what it would cost

224
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:49,378
not only to install air conditioning in those situations, but to the electric bills.

225
00:22:49,438 --> 00:23:01,667
But you are right about the heat when educating in June and possibly in September now, and just the overall heat footprint of the building at times in those situations.

226
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:09,072
But there's no easy fix, no matter, you know, to retrofit for air conditioning,

227
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:24,690
in those rooms, with the exception of what you mentioned was community members donating those window units that could be, for all intents and purposes, jerry-rigged into the windows so that they can cool some spaces.

228
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:38,738
If I could just add to that very quickly, I think what we'll have to do, because as Dr. Cooking said, there really isn't a sustainable or even a potential plan for some type of large-scale air conditioning

229
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,743
installation at the high school.

230
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:52,886
I think we'd have to, if we have situations like the one member McLaughlin has described, we'll have to be thinking strategically about what venues are used for particular programs.

231
00:23:53,006 --> 00:24:06,651
And it may be the case that we have to make shifts and different determinations because it is, I mean, I think it should be clear that we can't have students, particularly students in some of our more vulnerable populations exposed to the types of elements that were described.

232
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:08,736
May I, Mayor?

233
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:09,797
Just respond.

234
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:10,958
Thank you.

235
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:11,258
Yes.

236
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:12,119
Thank you.

237
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:12,839
Yeah.

238
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,981
And that was, these were all suggestions.

239
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:23,667
I assume my colleagues here remember this conversation from a couple of years ago, but these were all discussions from a couple of years ago of things that could be done.

240
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:36,257
And so I would just say that, especially as we're looking toward the summer fund program and whatever else we're thinking about, you know, for over the summer for those buildings or anything else that we're thinking about this really thoughtfully because

241
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,798
it was just unbearable in the past.

242
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:43,401
And they did end up creating, like I said, one room that the students could go to, but it was sort of isolating as well.

243
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:52,265
And we literally were on the loading dock with like portable, you know, those ones that you wheel around, those air conditioners that you can wheel around to go into rooms.

244
00:24:52,305 --> 00:25:01,530
So alternately, you know, I don't know, potentially there's, you know, wheel around units that, you know, can be considered for people or what have you, but it's a big consideration.

245
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,953
And I know, you know, we'll talk about this at a future meeting on the vision committee

246
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,946
for the agenda, but I'm just putting that out there.

247
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,667
So folks remember that, thank you.

248
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:22,957
Member Griff, if I may just about the heating and cooling at the high school, has there ever been an evaluation or a feasibility study to get everything up and running accordingly?

249
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:27,541
In terms of air conditioning?

250
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:32,184
In heat, just an evaluation of what's working, what's not and what works at all?

251
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:52,790
I mean, to the best of my knowledge, the evaluations that we did this fall to identify what we needed to do in terms of filter replacement, coil cleaning, and all the other various systems that had to be fixed is probably the closest we've come.

252
00:25:54,511 --> 00:26:00,897
We did as part of that examine what our maintenance routines were on a yearly basis.

253
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:19,969
and whether those needed to be adjusted as a result either of new infrastructure, different types of filters being used, or whether there were instances in which the actual fidelity to the schedule that had been established was not necessarily optimal.

254
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:27,675
And so in assessing all of that, I think that's, as I said earlier, I think that's how we got to a better place in terms of systems operating.

255
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,837
But I think that I'm not aware of any,

256
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:37,253
specific examination of what it would take to add new systems.

257
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:57,847
I would say just from my own previous experience that the likelihood of there being a fiscally viable option with regard to incorporating systems that don't currently exist into a building that's already 50 plus years old is probably

258
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:06,495
I think the chances of that are somewhat remote, but I think we can we can look at anything the committee would like us to look at.

259
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:09,539
Member Graham.

260
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:16,328
So I'm looking at the capital plan from back in 2019.

261
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:33,230
In the first year of this capital plan, as it was defined, we were slated to install two new air compressors at the Brooks, five at the Columbus, two at the Roberts, and four at the McGlynn Complex.

262
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,851
Do we know if those air compressors were installed in 2019 or if they weren't?

263
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:41,191
They were?

264
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:44,692
I'll defer to Mr. Rousseau who's saying yes,

265
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:48,024
And I apologize for my lack of knowledge.

266
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:53,686
Yes, the compressors were updated to get them back online.

267
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:57,627
The Columbus, the Brooks, all the compressors had been repaired.

268
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:04,270
Repaired or replaced, because I think those are two totally different things.

269
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,351
Right?

270
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,191
Mayor, if I may.

271
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:10,412
Member Russo?

272
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:12,307
Thank you.

273
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,729
I did actually, I don't have it in front of me, but I did write it down so I remember it.

274
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,729
We did replace them.

275
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:22,792
They were actually, most of them were completely dead and were completely replaced.

276
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:27,114
I think one or two of them, if my memory is correct, actually were serviceable.

277
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:35,578
So, but they were all brought back up to, all the schools got all of them to be normal capacity.

278
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:41,594
And I think it took a little longer than we thought, but that definitely did happen.

279
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:47,759
And how many air compressors does each building have?

280
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,920
Do we know?

281
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,544
And how many of them are new and how many of them are X years old?

282
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:59,008
I'd be more comfortable getting back to you with that information at that level of specificity.

283
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:00,069
Okay.

284
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,791
And I guess I'm asking because if we like,

285
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:09,459
I guess it stands to reason right if the Columbus needed five new air compressors there's at least five on a given building.

286
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:23,830
But probably more and we've replaced in some buildings we replaced only two and at the Columbus we replaced five we replaced Fort McGlynn which I would assume has more air compressors so when we and none at the Andrews so.

287
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,317
I think my question is, how many does each building have?

288
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:33,057
How old are they and how long can we reasonably expect them to last or be repairable?

289
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:37,958
Are we doing the proper preventive maintenance to allow them to reach their full life?

290
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,439
Or have we ignored them like some of the other issues that we've had in the last year?

291
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:53,421
And what does that mean in terms of what we need to plan to spend this year, next year, the year after in terms of capital funds to replace

292
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,893
air compressors in the buildings that actually have functioning air systems.

293
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:00,135
I have information there.

294
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:03,458
Yes.

295
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:09,224
I know this is really elementary, and I hope people don't judge me for this, but can somebody tell me what air compressors do?

296
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:14,069
Because I imagine if I have this question, there must be people in the that are watching that would have this question.

297
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:17,252
So what do the air compressors actually do in the buildings?

298
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:24,124
I'd be happy to provide you a rudimentary.

299
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:29,327
I was going to offer a lay person definition, but Dr. Cushing spoke first, so I'm going to defer to him.

300
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:30,368
Oh, that's wonderful.

301
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:31,909
I wish I'd gone longer on the way.

302
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,310
I know, I know.

303
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,353
You got to let that awkward silence sit, Dr. Cushing.

304
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:46,860
So an air compressor related to air conditioning, think of it much like the compressor that's in your refrigerator.

305
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:58,750
quite literally, it's a piston, it, generally speaking, has oil and will drive the coolant through the air conditioning unit of the building to actually cool it.

306
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:13,663
So it is essentially a small electrically operated engine, well, depending on how big the air conditioning unit is, what it does is it pushes the freon and the cooling agent through in order to

307
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:21,513
condition the air, but in an air conditioned cooling sense, as opposed to the heat being pumped through the pipes.

308
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:27,774
So it's two very separate systems in the HVAC world.

309
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:33,596
And if there are any experts in the community who are watching this, I look forward to your emails to correct me in the future.

310
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:36,896
That was way, way better than I could have done.

311
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,837
But I will, could I just say in response to Ms.

312
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:43,978
Graham's question though, that I think that a more comprehensive

313
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:59,676
annual report detailing each of the constituent systems that make up the guts of our school facilities would be useful to the committee in terms of forecasting what the potential challenges are.

314
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:10,822
Because I think the key part of your question, in my view, is what is the shelf life and where in the intended shelf life are each of these systems and then

315
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:15,569
are we doing everything we need to do to make sure that we're maximizing that shelf life?

316
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:32,076
And for each of our schools, with one exception, actually, because there's one building we have that has fewer systems and is somewhat simpler, although it's also very challenged because of its age, there are all different systems that sort of make up the school facility.

317
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:39,340
And I think we could essentially produce a report on an annual basis that would essentially detail all of those systems and say, here's what the

318
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:45,029
the likelihood of survival is and what the forecast is going forward.

319
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:59,135
And then it would also give us the opportunity to sort of provide that as sort of a consistent resource for the committee to know exactly where we are in terms of what systems need maintenance and what systems need replacement and so on and so forth.

320
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:09,180
Yeah, and I think in past committees, there's been explicit asks for such a detail of the infrastructure and systems.

321
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,114
I think that would be really useful.

322
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:22,338
The other thing that I see on this in 2019 is spending $500,000 to replace the fire alarm ceiling system at the high school.

323
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,358
I don't know if that was ever completed.

324
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,039
Does anybody know?

325
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:32,201
I thought that it had been, but it's something I'd have to check on.

326
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:32,281
OK.

327
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:32,421
Mayor?

328
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:32,561
Yes.

329
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,649
Member Graham has a floor and then Member Van de Kloot.

330
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,910
Jenny, do you have a point of clarification?

331
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,091
Are you jumping in to respond to my question or?

332
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:56,012
Yeah, I just wanted to suggest that it would be a better use of our time rather than guessing at this.

333
00:33:56,753 --> 00:34:01,234
I know I've had very detailed conversations about the air compressors with John McLaughlin.

334
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:05,235
If he was here, he would be answering every one of our questions on this.

335
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:12,941
Um, and I remember when they were replaced, um, the same thing with the other, uh, the details along the fire extinguishers.

336
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:24,891
So it might be that we want to, um, hold the details and ask John for an update on the specifically on the, um, uh, what you're referring to the document you're referring to Jenny.

337
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:26,312
I will.

338
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,474
Can I just say, I think that makes a lot of sense.

339
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:30,015
And certainly, uh, John,

340
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:38,355
myself and the other members of the administration work together on a daily basis to try to make sure that we have the most coherent, organized and accurate responses possible.

341
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:47,462
We are attempting to get to a place where we can make sure that we have as much information available to you and make sure that it is as accurate as possible.

342
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:58,672
And also that our responses are organizationally coherent in a sense that I think we have had challenges in the past of

343
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:06,953
having departmental experts providing accurate information, but not always in the most coordinated way.

344
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:09,214
And that's one of the things that we're trying to improve on.

345
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:26,617
So if there's gaps in my own knowledge with regard to this, it's in part because Peter is more courageous than I am with regard to defining air compressors and I admire him for it, but this is part of our effort to try to be as coordinated as possible.

346
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,893
Do we expect John to be joining us later in the meeting?

347
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:38,375
He's always joining me by text all hours of the day, including right now.

348
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:43,057
So if that's something the committee would like, we certainly can arrange for that.

349
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:56,063
But as I said, as an administration, we're trying to be as coordinated as possible in terms of providing the committee with both accurate and coherent information.

350
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:58,556
Coherent meaning organizationally coherent.

351
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,659
I don't think anyone is speaking incoherently.

352
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:04,641
Was he unable to attend or is he on vacation?

353
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,602
I don't think he's on vacation.

354
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:07,563
I'm talking to him right now.

355
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,645
So I can check on that.

356
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:16,669
Well, I don't want to just hear John talk about numbers and things and how old they might be.

357
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:21,312
I want there to be an actual documented inventory

358
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:36,662
of the equipment for which we are responsible as the school committee to maintain and replace so that we can have a real capital plan that lays out the real things that are needed for school buildings to work and run.

359
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:46,610
So I frankly don't think it's enough for John to come and tell us about three air compressors that might need to be replaced.

360
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:54,476
I think this warrants and deserves a little bit more attention, and I think if it's gonna take some time to do that, I think all the better.

361
00:36:56,037 --> 00:37:11,560
But overall, this plan, and I remember the meeting well, we talked about, the committee, I was not on it at the time, talked about, for example, having multiple end of life roofs to contend with, and they were put on this capital plan as placeholders.

362
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:22,767
Now, I did not see them and the consultants from the city's capital plan confirmed that end-of-life groups were not part of the capital plan as it related to what they did.

363
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:44,004
So to me, there's a huge gap between what this plan written in 2019, which was a first step and better than the plan that didn't exist on paper before, and a plan on the city side, which is not comprehensive of all that the schools need.

364
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:49,349
there is a gap there that we have to fill and it's this committee's responsibility to do that.

365
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:57,635
So I wanna make sure that is prioritized and completed so that there can be no mistake about the things that our schools need to be functioning properly.

366
00:37:57,655 --> 00:38:01,939
And if that takes a little bit more time, I'm fine with that.

367
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:12,487
Frankly, a lot of the things on this list that I'm looking at, I would question significantly because they all revolve around incremental

368
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:21,413
spent relatively incremental spend in a building that I don't know that we've determined is viable as an ongoing concern.

369
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:29,640
So you know before we're going to spend $900,000 renovating the library we should probably decide if we're going to knock it down at some point soon.

370
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,762
And so to me that's

371
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:51,269
sort of back to the value of the vision committee and understanding what all the options are, but allowing and us all individually being open to the notion that the most expeditious and cost-effective way for us to do right by Medford High School may or may not be the thing that's in our brain as the best option.

372
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:57,711
And we have to be committed to doing that work before I can really endorse

373
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:04,793
you know, any of the spending that's on this list for the high school complex, unless it really has to do with immediate need for education.

374
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:13,936
So frankly, internet infrastructure is on my mind is something that is critically important for the high school building and is not going perfectly just yet.

375
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:25,019
So, but even, you know, discussions of the bathrooms, I have huge reservations spending what could be millions of dollars on bathrooms with no overall plan for that building.

376
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,180
Mayor, may I respond?

377
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:29,605
Mr. Murphy.

378
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:48,251
I think that what Miss Graham is envisioning with regard to a more comprehensive assessment that's built into the school committee's calendar, I think is a illustration of what I'm attempting to articulate in terms of needing to be more organizationally coherent.

379
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:58,655
When we just are testifying about individual questions, anyone on the call right now, John McLaughlin, any other department head,

380
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:02,149
we're putting information out that may be factually accurate.

381
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:15,693
And every time I've, I've, I've never heard anyone, frankly, from at the departmental level, provide information to the committee that's not factually accurate, but if it's not organizationally coherent, I think we run the risk that priorities become conflated.

382
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,394
And I think it's a disservice to the community because it becomes, it can be confusing.

383
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:24,195
But if we're able to develop a more thorough

384
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:36,785
in a system that produces more of not necessarily a plan or even priorities per se, because ultimately the committee has to make decisions as to what investments you want to make and what investments you want to defer on.

385
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:53,073
But I think providing that more comprehensive perspective through that type of system puts the school committee in a better position to make decisions and the administration in a better position to be able to execute on those decisions as opposed to sort of

386
00:40:54,188 --> 00:41:03,875
the more, not necessarily impromptu, but like the more ad hoc approach of this is a problem.

387
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:05,136
We all agree it's a problem.

388
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,857
Is it something we want to address right now?

389
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,439
Okay, how do we do that?

390
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:13,062
And so that's what I would urge us to, the direction for us to move in.

391
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:23,750
And I think at some point toward the close of this fiscal year, and certainly prior to the beginning of next school year, we would be in a position to really detail for you

392
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:43,368
our internal evaluation as to where our systems are currently, what is the expected shelf life, and where are situations in which, as a result of deferred maintenance or for whatever other reason, we are anticipating problems coming up in either the near-term or long-term, frankly.

393
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:52,953
And then I think from that point, that can help inform the committee's deliberations as to what the school department's capital priorities are, and I think also provide

394
00:41:53,535 --> 00:42:01,479
clearer messaging to the community at large as to what are the potential problems that they can anticipate hearing about in the years ahead.

395
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:17,006
And do you anticipate in order to build that, Mr. Murphy, that you will need funds from the school committee to allow you to work with people with expertise on these various things?

396
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:21,709
Like, do you need funding to be able to even create that

397
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:23,808
that base plan?

398
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:27,991
Or is that something that you have the skillset to do in-house?

399
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:37,298
Well, I think it depends a little bit because some of the systems vary in complexity in terms of information we have on them.

400
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:51,449
And so I would suspect that there could be a few instances, particularly in the information technology realm, that in order to flesh out all of the options that could be available, especially given some of the infrastructure

401
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:59,846
the pre-existing infrastructure challenges that you alluded to earlier, that might be something we'd want to retain experts on.

402
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:17,873
I think internally, through Mr. McLaughlin and his team, we're in a position to be able to identify, we have this many generators, we have this many air compressors, we have this many filters, whatever, and this is our maintenance routine, and this is what we understand best practices to be with regard to maintenance.

403
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,493
I think in large part, it can be done internally.

404
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:40,909
And then in some of the more complex parts and some of the parts that not just those of us as individuals, but as an institution, we don't necessarily have a built up knowledge of, those are the parts that we might wanna consult with some experts, but I wouldn't anticipate it being a astronomically high cost.

405
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:47,474
I think it's more about just being able to, frankly, I think it's about needing the time to thoroughly dive into it

406
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:49,994
and analyze what we have on our hands.

407
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:51,494
Okay.

408
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:52,514
Yeah.

409
00:43:52,554 --> 00:44:08,159
And I think if that requirement was for the school committee to allocate funds to allow you to seek the expertise that you need in certain areas, I would certainly be amenable to some of the capital funds going to support those efforts.

410
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Because I, you know,

411
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:21,912
I completely appreciate that John and his team can't be experts in every last thing about a building because it requires so many different expertises.

412
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:24,252
Like, is the roof too old to survive?

413
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:27,674
And has the air compressor been properly serviced?

414
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:32,655
Are two complete, you know, very, very different questions with different expertises required to know how to do that.

415
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:39,918
Yeah, and I think the more complex the infrastructure is the, you know, the more likely it is we would need to

416
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:42,695
lean on outside experts to do that.

417
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:52,302
And the other thing I would just say very briefly, I don't want to belabor this, but the answers to a lot of these questions change over time.

418
00:44:53,082 --> 00:45:08,514
And I think one of the most common challenges that communities face is that a set of questions gets asked, answers are provided at that time, and then it is presumed

419
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:11,569
that those answers are still accurate.

420
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:19,173
And that goes with regard to the shelf life of, or the relevance of certain types of infrastructure, especially in technology.

421
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,556
It can also be the case for the shelf life of buildings themselves.

422
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:34,962
And so I think it is advantageous for the committee and the community to understand that it is important sometimes for questions to be asked and then re-asked because

423
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,108
There are variables that change.

424
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,191
There are policies that change, particularly when we're talking about potential state funding.

425
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:52,199
And I think that our responsibility is to be zealous in pursuing information that is consistent with the time in which we're asking the questions.

426
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:01,666
And it would be a disservice to the community to shy away from examining some of these issues, even if they've been examined in recent memory.

427
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:16,318
And I think establishing that baseline plan is a good way to have a detailed capital planning discussion on an annualized basis that is grounded in the facts and the realities and all the things that change one year to the next.

428
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:23,802
So just because you didn't think an air compressor was going to give out in August doesn't mean it doesn't, right?

429
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:24,523
And so you have to

430
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:26,638
make those adjustments as they come.

431
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:29,579
So I do think that would be inordinately helpful.

432
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:48,067
I think it would allow us to have a much more robust capital plan on behalf of all of our buildings, as well as start to make some real decisions about what we can and cannot do with the buildings that we have among us.

433
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:51,239
Thank you, Member Graham.

434
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:57,182
I think it will be very helpful for the vision committee as well to see that prior to starting their discussions.

435
00:46:57,242 --> 00:46:57,723
Member Kratz.

436
00:46:58,603 --> 00:47:01,665
Yes, I just have a follow-up.

437
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:06,908
I have a different question, but then I'm going to just have another follow-up question regarding the front entrance.

438
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:18,515
So while we were talking, I just went back into the notes and it did what Mr. Andreessen said was that in order for the front entrance, we would have to

439
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:27,161
It would require a structural engineer to do the drawings and then we would get an idea of the scope of the project.

440
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:35,967
So my question is, is that what we're planning to do according to this, this

441
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:52,979
you know, this committee, it being on the agenda for the committee, you know, for the capital improvement plan, are we going to hire a structural engineer to do the drawing so that we can find out the scope of the project for the front entrance?

442
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,340
I think that's up to the committee.

443
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,901
I think that if that's the direction the committee would like us to take, then that's what we'll do.

444
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,762
But I don't have a position on it.

445
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,278
And I would.

446
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,799
Go ahead.

447
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,179
The other question is separate.

448
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:21,642
So on the city's project list for the capital improvement plan, it lists the Curtis burner, you know, as needing to get replaced.

449
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:26,763
So I didn't know if like that was something that that.

450
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:32,228
is maybe should be on the capital improvement plan where it's on the project.

451
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:36,329
It's listed with the amount of money that's, you know, the $816,000.

452
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:44,912
Let me just, I'm just trying to find, I think it's on page 38 of the capital, the city's plan.

453
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:46,592
Just getting there right now.

454
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:51,994
Could you remind me what the number is attached to that?

455
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,315
I just want to make sure I'm thinking of the same project.

456
00:48:55,092 --> 00:49:03,555
Yeah, so when I looked at the city's project, it says for schools, the one item for 2021, it says 816,183.

457
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:23,481
It has rehab, MHS bathrooms, replace boiler, ADA accessibility upgrades, security upgrades at Medford High School, repair, replace boiler at CTHS, which is Curtis Tufts High School.

458
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:51,339
Was there a so that that is similar to the generator one that may be a necessity that needs to be funded, regardless of what happens with the 816 that may Essentially supersede any other funding priorities based on necessity because there was, we did come close to what would have constituted a catastrophic failure there earlier this year and we were able to make some

459
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:58,660
repairs, but the situation got to the point where there were preliminary discussions about what would have to happen if we needed to relocate the program.

460
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,301
That turned out not to be necessary.

461
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:06,403
The system was repaired and we were able to be back in a position.

462
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:20,648
I think that part of this, if I remember correctly, happened over the winter recess, which was a fortuitous timing, but it is something that I expect will need to be done before

463
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,491
the next winter season.

464
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:24,992
Thank you.

465
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:32,557
Thank you, Mr. Murphy and school admin.

466
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:35,619
I don't know if anybody else has anything.

467
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,420
We have four more minutes before our regular meeting.

468
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,041
Member Van de Kloethe, member Rousseau.

469
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:47,786
Yeah, so I need to understand what we need to decide tonight, because clearly there's a much larger

470
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:55,281
question, which is to say, how much money are we going to put into the current Medford High School?

471
00:50:56,522 --> 00:51:03,805
If in fact, at some future time, we envision a rebuilding or something.

472
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:11,089
And so I need to know just tonight, what decision we need to make?

473
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:17,692
Was this brought to us because we're trying to make a decision about whether we're gonna expend the money for the bathrooms?

474
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:43,546
HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Health & Human Services

475
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:55,085
if there could be bids that would encompass more facilities, but we at least wanna know what the price is, what the bids would be for the one restrooms that were previously identified.

476
00:51:55,465 --> 00:52:05,752
And when those bids come in, we'll certainly take that back to the committee to make sure that you're fully informed about that and have the opportunity to weigh in, just determine whether you want us to do more than what was originally intended.

477
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:09,275
So that's in the works and is progressing.

478
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:13,278
Beyond that, I don't know of anything that,

479
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,864
you absolutely need to decide tonight.

480
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:24,188
Some of these projects, as we've talked about, there's an intention for us to move forward with some of this work prior to the beginning of the next school year.

481
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:28,711
And so we'll certainly return to the committee to provide you with that information.

482
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:36,875
And if we reach any other critical decision points, then we could certainly convene and discuss that.

483
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:40,117
But there are no deadlines that are looming

484
00:52:41,045 --> 00:52:44,789
that would require any specific action on the part of the committee right now.

485
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:46,510
Okay, thank you.

486
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,394
Member Russo?

487
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,395
I lost that.

488
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:52,796
Thank you.

489
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:54,737
Thank you.

490
00:52:55,658 --> 00:53:01,483
And I think a big decision we have to make is how much are we going to more we're going to put into this high school.

491
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:06,428
And for me, I mean, even if we do a brand new high school, it's going to take several years.

492
00:53:06,508 --> 00:53:07,629
And I feel like we need

493
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:14,317
a new sign and landscaping and the structural engineer to come out and say how much it will cost for ADA accessibility.

494
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:18,962
I feel like our students need updated bathrooms, even if it's two to four to six.

495
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:27,471
We really do need to move forward with that RFP because the next four or five years of students are going to be in that building because it's going to take quite a while to build

496
00:53:28,214 --> 00:53:33,397
if we can get an MSBA loan or funded in a brand new high school in another way.

497
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,539
I think it's important to make these upgrades.

498
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,801
We've spent millions on science labs and a new pool, new roofing.

499
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,923
We've had Leslie come in and do new gyms and a new TV station.

500
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,564
We need to continue that work.

501
00:53:45,024 --> 00:53:46,125
Do I'm talking millions?

502
00:53:46,645 --> 00:53:55,551
No, but we need to continue to upgrade it and continue to assess the needs of the heating and air conditioning because our students

503
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,212
students deserve it, the ones that are gonna be in there in the next five to 10 years.

504
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:01,334
So that's just my opinion.

505
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:04,776
Thank you for giving us time to think about it, Mr. Murphy.

506
00:54:04,836 --> 00:54:12,682
And I say, continue with the RFP and obviously come back to this committee for a vote before it's finalized so we can make a decision on how many bathrooms we'll do.

507
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:17,846
But I think this was a good start to discussing the capital needs of the district.

508
00:54:18,812 --> 00:54:24,375
Mayor, are we discussing the superintendent's contract now, or?

509
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,737
We're gonna exit out of this meeting.

510
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,819
Superintendent contract is in the next Zoom, 6 to 6.30.

511
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,381
Okay, motion to adjourn.

512
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:38,723
Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kratz.

513
00:54:38,783 --> 00:54:39,563
Roll call, please.

514
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:41,564
Member Graham.

515
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:42,225
Yes.

516
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:44,306
Member Kratz.

517
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:45,046
Yes.

518
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:47,187
Member McLaughlin, yes.

519
00:54:47,288 --> 00:54:47,968
Member Stone.

520
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:50,310
Yes.

521
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:52,474
Member Rousseau?

522
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:53,977
Yes.

523
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,081
Member Van de Kloet?

524
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:56,562
Yes.

525
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:58,446
Mayor Longo Kern?

526
00:54:59,568 --> 00:54:59,728
Yes.
