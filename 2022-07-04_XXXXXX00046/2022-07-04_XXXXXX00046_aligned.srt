00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey Medford Bites listeners, before we get into today's episode, I wanted to provide some updates from last week's City Council budget meeting, using the reports from both Councilor Behrs and Councilor Sang.

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:27,553
After hours of testimony from the public and negotiations between the council and the mayor, in addition to weeks of a budget process, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, the City Council approved the budget with some important adjustments.

3
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:35,695
These adjustments include $300,000 for the schools to help keep teachers whose jobs were threatened in the original budget.

4
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:41,570
$90,000 to keep the new library fully staffed with hopes to keep it open on Saturdays.

5
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:51,419
$50,000 for a zoning consultant to aid the council in supporting the housing crisis in Medford and to support business growth.

6
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,362
And $15,000 to support running smooth elections.

7
00:00:55,481 --> 00:01:01,985
There are many concerns expressed that although this was a big win, it is probably not a sustainable solution for the city's budget.

8
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:09,290
The mayor expressed her hope to continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and that city revenue will climb.

9
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:15,494
Others expressed a need for a tax override to ensure a better and more consistent revenue source for the city.

10
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,969
Today's episode includes an interview with friend and attorney Caitlin Ingleson.

11
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,973
We discuss what it means to be a same-sex parent in Massachusetts.

12
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:31,900
This episode was originally recorded before the reversal of Roe v. Wade, and some edits have been made to reflect these changes.

13
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,963
You may notice this in the audio.

14
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:38,607
Future episodes will address more about Roe v. Wade implications.

15
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:39,889
I hope you enjoy.

16
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:50,949
All right, thank you so much for being here with me today.

17
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,872
I'm lucky to be here with my good friend.

18
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:59,877
If you could introduce yourself and say your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

19
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:02,399
Sure, absolutely.

20
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,020
I'm thrilled to be here.

21
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:11,046
My name is Caitlin Eagleson, and my pronouns are she, her, hers.

22
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,607
And I am

23
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:15,469
a friend of yours.

24
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,612
I am my primary identity, Danielle's friend.

25
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:26,334
No, um, I am a family law attorney.

26
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:44,062
And I have a, I guess I would say focus or a strong commitment to serving LGBTQ clients and legal issues that come up for them.

27
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:49,789
But that's not my only practice, but that is an important part of my practice.

28
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,330
Thanks, Caitlin.

29
00:02:51,631 --> 00:03:02,320
So before we get a little more into why you're here today, I'm going to ask you the question of the podcast, which is what your favorite place is to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

30
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:04,522
Sure.

31
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:11,689
So is this here, is this a good time to reveal that I am not a Medford resident?

32
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,251
I think you could.

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:14,632
Yeah.

34
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,554
Well, I am unlike many of your guests.

35
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,756
I am not actually a Medford resident.

36
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:21,216
I do.

37
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,517
I do live close by.

38
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,299
I hope that this counts.

39
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:33,125
But my favorite place to get food from in Medford is Goldilocks bagels and the rosemary.

40
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,506
I think it's rosemary salt.

41
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:35,547
I don't know.

42
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:37,368
But that is my favorite bagel.

43
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,189
Yeah.

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:45,510
So you're not alone in that being your favorite place to eat in Medford a lot of people on the podcast, including myself would agree.

45
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:54,917
I think it's, I think, to just sort of describe how we know each other is, which will be sort of the topic for today is that we both.

46
00:03:55,817 --> 00:04:24,852
um have kids and we're part of sort of a group of other families that are uh like with queer parents uh and um I think it's something to highlight about Medford and um you know the surrounding cities is that there is a pretty um strong supportive network of queer families um and I'm sure we've all shared Goldilocks bagels at all the birthday parties we've hosted for our kids um yeah and so yeah yeah

47
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:31,124
Yeah, I feel I mean, I do feel really lucky for our group of friends.

48
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:39,628
And I think even just listening to your comment, you know, I, I think it's important to talk a little bit about language.

49
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:50,873
And I, you know, I think that this is going to come up a few different times during our conversation today, hearing you say, like, you know, we have a group of queer parents, which is absolutely true.

50
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:54,195
And you know, that's how I identify, I identify as queer.

51
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:57,563
that is the identity that really resonates with me.

52
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:14,086
And I find that I often will say, like in the intro when I was saying it's important to me to work on issues that affect LGBTQ families, I will sometimes say queer families instead.

53
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:21,807
And I'm trying to find that balance of knowing that the language that works for me may be imperfect for others.

54
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:38,147
Yeah, it's been wonderful for me and my family to have a strong group of friends where we all have similarly constructed families.

55
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:48,469
We all have donor-conceived kids, and it's important for me to be able to talk to other parents who are similarly situated.

56
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:52,410
And also, I'm so excited for my kid to have this

57
00:05:54,465 --> 00:06:08,435
group of people, or my kids, I have two now, to have a group of friends with whom they share this unique experience of parentage.

58
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:13,646
For sure, I think that we have similar family makeup.

59
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:16,469
We are two women who are raising two little boys.

60
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,253
I think queer is like a really encompassing term for a lot of folks.

61
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:38,747
I think too, what is nice about Medford is not only the number of queer families, but that there's like, so that families that are headed by same-sex partners, but also there's a lot of,

62
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,448
young queer people and who have really supportive parents.

63
00:06:43,028 --> 00:07:05,912
Um so a lot of families that have um some sort of queerness somewhere in the mix um and I it's funny and I think I really appreciate our group of friends for this reason and that we that my kids can see it's normalized for them right like until recently until I think my son started kindergarten and was like seeing other kids parents I don't think he realized that like

64
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,974
most kids don't have two moms, right?

65
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:14,399
And I think that there's something that I never expected him to have that experience and I'm really grateful for it.

66
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,787
But yeah, I think what we're hoping to talk about today is like all the things that go into being a queer parent.

67
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:30,173
I think as a young person, I thought that conceiving children in a same-sex relationship was

68
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:35,057
prohibitively expensive and that adoption was going to be the only choice for me.

69
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:40,841
I think there was a kid in my high school class who was conceived through IVF and we called it test tube babies.

70
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:46,704
I remember that term so well.

71
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:51,748
I remember being like, wow, they must be really doing well for themselves if they could do that.

72
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,310
I always thought adoption would be the only option for me.

73
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,072
My wife carried both of our kids.

74
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:07,077
And I think through various process, but I think that we've come a long way in terms of access to some of those things.

75
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:12,080
And yeah, and I think I'm hoping to talk a little bit about the legal side of things.

76
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,542
So what are the legal implications of being a parent in the same sex relationship?

77
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,787
Yeah, well, I do, you know, I think it's interesting.

78
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:38,596
I feel like I keep like reflecting back on what you say, but I do think it's really interesting that you said growing up, you thought of, you know, that adoption would be the way to have kids in your life or in a same sex relationship.

79
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:46,380
And, you know, while we've come a long way in terms of access, and that's true, and yet adoption was still part

80
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:50,251
of your journey for, for parentage.

81
00:08:50,431 --> 00:09:00,781
And part of my journey too, my family went through the second parent adoption process, which is, you know, I think a big part of what we're going to talk about today.

82
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,824
Um, so my family went through it, you went through it.

83
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:09,830
And also that is a legal service that my firm Eagleson and Sturgis provides.

84
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,651
Growing up, I, I

85
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:24,126
don't know that I thought of, I don't think I had the analysis that you did about the financial aspect of it.

86
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,848
I think I was kind of ignorant to that.

87
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:41,816
But I did, I think when I thought about family formation, and for my own self, I kind of always thought that maybe adoption would be an option.

88
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,226
And, uh,

89
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,294
Yeah, so I don't know.

90
00:09:47,995 --> 00:10:01,527
Yeah, I think and thank you for bringing up that point because we are going to talk about how adoption and the term you use second parent adoption applies to lots of us and I think even what our youngest was our oldest I was born in 2016.

91
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:11,236
And I didn't think at that point that was something that as a resident of Massachusetts where gay rights are really protected, I would have to do something like that right and.

92
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:16,021
And so could you explain like a little bit about what a second parent adoption is.

93
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:18,184
Yeah, absolutely.

94
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:29,418
A second parent adoption or co parent adoption legally secures the rights and responsibilities of a non gestational parent in a way that will be recognized across the country.

95
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:38,669
And I'm going to actually pause here just to explain a little bit about the language I use and the circumstances I'm talking about.

96
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,171
So gestational parent refers to the partner who carries the fetus to term and give birth.

97
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:50,273
And the non-gestational parent is the partner who does not.

98
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:59,436
And in the eyes of the law, the gestational parent is the one who has automatic legal parentage.

99
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:11,994
And I also want to know, I will sometimes default to saying same-sex couples when I describe this process, but it's important to note that not all folks going through a second parent adoption are same-sex couples.

100
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:16,697
Sometimes my clients are a cisgender woman and a transgender man.

101
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:21,119
So I may be imprecise in my language at times, and I want to acknowledge that.

102
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,202
I also tend to, again, use queer as an umbrella term.

103
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,504
Another thing I want to say is that at Eagleson and Sturgis,

104
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:43,028
The majority of our work is with same-sex, female-identified couples, although we certainly have worked with clients who do not identify as women and also with trans folks.

105
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,772
What I've not done is work with cisgender men who have used a surrogate.

106
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:54,379
There are plenty of great people who do that work, and I hope to someday, and I'm just going to put in a quick plug for

107
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:09,409
a law firm, Wilson, Marino, and Bonnevie, fantastic lawyers over there who have a more robust adoption practice, whereas I feel very confident and focused on this particular kind of second parent adoption.

108
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:20,096
So anyway, going back to the explanation of what it is, here in Massachusetts, when a child is born into a marriage, the two parties of that marriage

109
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:28,224
have a presumption of legal parentage to that child, even if the child is not biologically related to both of them.

110
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:32,667
And that's true for opposite sex heterosexual couples too.

111
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:45,258
When a cis man and woman are married and the woman gives birth to a child, her husband is presumed to be the legal father, whether or not he is the biological father.

112
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:56,552
So, that extends to same-sex couples here in Massachusetts and both parties can sign the birth certificate if the couple is married.

113
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:09,017
However, it's only a presumption and we still encourage married couples to complete a second parent adoption to secure the rights of both of them against any legal challenge to parentage and to ensure that both

114
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,864
parents have protection on a federal level.

115
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:22,971
While states are supposed to give full faith and credit to the laws of other states, what we know is that adoptions are federally recognized, and so it's just the safest bet.

116
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:27,693
Completing a second parent adoption will accomplish a number of things.

117
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,615
It will permanently terminate the rights of any donor.

118
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:35,238
It will, of course, protect your legal relationship to your child.

119
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,221
in other states that may be, you know, less accepting of or even hostile towards LGBTQ plus families.

120
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:50,202
And it will also protect your children's inheritance that may flow through the non-gestational parent's estate.

121
00:13:50,502 --> 00:14:06,405
So I know that was a very long answer, but I wanted to explain a little bit about what a second parent adoption is and also why, you know, even if I'm dealing with married folks in Massachusetts, I still recommend

122
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:07,863
that they get it done.

123
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:09,164
Thank you.

124
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:19,467
And I think in 2016, in particular, you know, you mentioned marriage being like, in a requirement for this, you know, extension of parental rights.

125
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:26,470
So in 2016, we were very worried about the new president at that time, like threatening

126
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:28,954
gay marriage, right?

127
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:36,581
So we were worried about what if our marriage is no longer legal, then I won't have any rights to my child, right?

128
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:42,586
And I think that was, I think before that, I was like, oh, well, I don't need to do this, but that's definitely was the push too.

129
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:48,892
And then, and I think now, especially too, I'm imagining folks are having some similar concerns.

130
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,694
Yes, I am definitely getting, yeah, I

131
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:58,179
see this ebb and flow for second parent adoption requests for our firm.

132
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,461
And there's definitely been an uptick.

133
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:08,507
So Supreme Court decision, which makes it very clear that, you know, all of our rights that we take for granted, we shouldn't.

134
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:15,472
And yeah, so definitely an uptick in requests for second parent adoption.

135
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:17,334
Now people are afraid.

136
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:18,981
And rightfully so.

137
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:28,265
You know, I think that as white, middle class, cis, queer people in Massachusetts, we will be okay.

138
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:34,448
I think that this kind of stripping of rights is going to affect a lot of other communities before us.

139
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:37,302
Sure.

140
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:56,287
And so one, just like to backpedal a little bit, you've mentioned, you've used the term cisgender a couple of times, and just want to clarify for folks that maybe haven't heard that term, or maybe hasn't been defined for them, what we're saying there is that someone's gender assigned at birth matches their current gender identity.

141
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:59,948
So I was assigned female at birth, I still identify as female.

142
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:03,389
So when we talk about cisgender heterosexual couples, that's,

143
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:16,926
someone who's assigned female at birth still identifies as female coupled with somebody assigned male at birth so identified as male and it sounds like the law reflects usually that those kinds of terms like male female things like that.

144
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,116
Absolutely.

145
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:29,323
And, um, and father and mother and paternity and GLAAD is spearheading advocacy and important legal work around changing that.

146
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:45,733
And there's pending legislation, which would change the wording in the laws, specifically in chapter 209 C, um, section six, which has to do with presumption of paternity to change that language so that it's parentage.

147
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:50,581
and to change some of the gendered pronouns in the law.

148
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,146
And he has really important advocacy right now.

149
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,610
Unfortunately, we are stuck with the language that we have.

150
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:08,859
And I just do also want to acknowledge through the course of this interview, you know, I also sometimes will

151
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,262
use language that, again, is imperfect.

152
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:32,620
And I find myself, because I'm talking about the law and we're talking about gendered language and gendered ideas of what makes a family and who can parents be, and, you know, that it's one man, one woman, all of that archaic, patriarchal, white supremacist BS, you know, that I will sometimes fall into that chase.

153
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:35,531
Thanks for acknowledging that.

154
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,392
And I am sure I'm guilty of the same.

155
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:44,920
So I think you mentioned what a second parent adoption is and why it's important.

156
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:51,287
And I know you and I have some differing sort of thoughts about

157
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:56,078
maybe on the more like emotional pieces of a second parent adoption.

158
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:05,062
And I think you, you know, you identifying as the gestational parent, I'm not, I think that is sort of two different sides of what the meaning of the second parent adoption.

159
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:11,645
I wonder if, I think it's changed, but if you could speak to like, what is involved in that process?

160
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,151
Oh, sure.

161
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:17,614
What is involved in the second parent adoption process itself?

162
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:18,155
Yes.

163
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,476
Yeah, sure.

164
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:28,765
OK, so to complete a second parent adoption, you file a petition for adoption with the family and probate court in the county where you live.

165
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:39,194
And there are a number of documents in support that go along with this petition, which affirm the intention of the couple to be two legally recognized parents to the child.

166
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:50,704
For the second parent adoption, you can ask the court to skip some of the more intrusive prerequisites of a typical adoption, including the requirements of notice to the donor.

167
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:57,165
Usually notice has to be given to any known or unknown father.

168
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:01,786
And so we ask that that requirement be waived when there is a donor.

169
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:08,748
We also ask that the court waive the requirement that a licensed home study be done.

170
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:18,990
And also when the kid is under six months, we ask that the requirement that a child who lives in your home for six months before an adoption be waived.

171
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,443
and those are all routinely granted.

172
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:33,909
In some counties here, if you're married, you do not even need to go to the court in person and the court can just grant the adoption administratively if that's what you choose.

173
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:43,973
Many of the documents that we submit include details about each family and the formation of that family and specifically the role of the non-gestational parent.

174
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:47,695
And I think that's the piece that sometimes hits

175
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:52,458
hits my clients in an emotional place.

176
00:19:53,479 --> 00:20:08,190
Because again, it's, it's, you know, our experience is we are two people who have decided to have a child together, we have both been equally participating in all of the steps to do that.

177
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:17,597
And then one person, the one who does not have, well, and let me just say, most of the time, the one the person who does not have

178
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:28,201
a biological connection to the child, has to put into writing, you know, kind of this plea of like, please accept me as a parent.

179
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:46,769
I just, I do want to point out that there's something called reciprocal IVF, whereby the child is conceived through donor sperm and the egg of one partner, but then the other partner carries

180
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:50,963
that fetus to term.

181
00:20:51,183 --> 00:21:00,745
So sometimes when I say gestational parent, I'm using that kind of as shorthand to mean the parent who has a biological connection to the child, but it's not always true.

182
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:12,587
And I still recommend to those clients who come to me and say, well, yeah, my partner carried, but it was my genetic material.

183
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:17,528
I say, we still do a second parent adoption and the law still looks at it as

184
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:24,817
The person who gave birth is the one with those protected legal rights automatically.

185
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:29,848
I don't know, does that?

186
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,429
Yeah.

187
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:32,190
Okay, sure.

188
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,052
And so you're speaking, so you need to hire a lawyer to help you with this process, right?

189
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,273
And then, so fill out this paperwork.

190
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:46,898
For me, personally, it also involved getting personal statements from friends and family as to why I was an acceptable parent to my then like, almost year old child.

191
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,720
And then we had to appear in court.

192
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,363
So we I mean, I think it was more of a like, just, you know, crossing the T's and dying the I's.

193
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,204
But I think

194
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:20,978
that was it's a lot of the thing it was like a financial burden for us for me personally it was like a bit of an emotional burden um i think really well-meaning family members wanted this to be a celebration and for me it was like partially that like yes like this is a protection and also like this kind of sucks right um i think and i think for me as like this was our first child a first-time parent

195
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:25,539
you know, looking, trying to figure out what is my role, right?

196
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:29,701
As like a mom, but also not the gestational parent, right?

197
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,763
How do we, how am I balancing like who I am to this child?

198
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:37,306
And then really having to justify that to the, to the government basically.

199
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:40,348
Yeah, I think made it an emotional process for sure.

200
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:41,388
Right.

201
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:48,152
And, oh my gosh, there are so many things I want to pick up on what you said, but I'll try to like limit it somewhat.

202
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,513
But I think that like,

203
00:22:50,355 --> 00:23:08,319
you know, what you just said really resonates because the last part, because I think the second parent adoption process, it, it highlights a this premium on biology, that is pervasive in our culture.

204
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:19,841
And so, you know, in same sex couples, we are faced with this so much, especially when I mean, when we become parents, right, we're faced with this

205
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:37,531
you know, well, who's the real mom, you know, so going back to my point, or the thing that I wanted to pick up from what you said is, yeah, just this, like, there is this pervasive thing in our culture of biology means something really important.

206
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:45,858
And so when you are not biologically connected to your children, that is less than I mean, adoptive parents,

207
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:53,276
go through this too, you know, being asked, you know, you know, is that child yours?

208
00:23:54,117 --> 00:24:04,022
No, but I mean, like, really yours, you know, or, you know, are your children siblings, you know, like adoptive parents who have multiple kids?

209
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:08,165
And it's like, well, yes, they are my children, you know.

210
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:15,409
So that so so anyway, I guess I just wanted to pick up on what you said, like, it's,

211
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:19,185
you're already facing that internally.

212
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:23,027
You know, what is my connection going to be to this child?

213
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:29,832
Because you've you've grown up kind of swimming in the sea where where biology has such a premium.

214
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:35,717
And then you have, you know, people externally saying to you, but who who's the real mom?

215
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:43,102
You know, and then you have this legal step, this other thing saying like, yeah, you're not really the real parent.

216
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:45,838
Yep.

217
00:24:47,561 --> 00:25:01,221
And I think, in addition to that, the models that you know the sort of traditional model for a family of mother father children, I think there's like a lot of assumptions about those roles right and there's not like a there's there's not a lot of like.

218
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:26,718
like uh what's like templates for like second other mom right like okay well like she feeds the baby she does you know like she does like all these things the baby like the baby needs her for these things so like what am i here for right and yeah and i think that's that's that was my definitely my emotional journey with the first one i think when the second one came there was just so much happening there was no time to worry about those things um yeah

219
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,411
But yeah, no, thank you.

220
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:40,358
Also, another thing that you said is that you had to get statements from friends and family affirming what a wonderful parent you were.

221
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,541
And in my practice, we don't do that.

222
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:55,349
And so I think that's another thing that's frustrating and another thing that GLAAD points out in their advocacy and in their trying to change the actual law is that

223
00:25:56,678 --> 00:26:00,982
you know, it varies practice to practice how we do it.

224
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:10,889
I mean, I, the way that I do my second parent adoptions is because, you know, a lovely friend and colleague, you know, many years ago was just like, Oh yeah, here are all my templates.

225
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:22,659
So I just kind of do those, but the, the various counties, there's also differences in, in which documents they want.

226
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:23,760
Um,

227
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:29,908
So you know I have a an excel spreadsheet with you know each county and then.

228
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:31,724
what is needed for that.

229
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,605
So there's just, there's not much a uniformity.

230
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,385
Yeah.

231
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:36,485
There was something too.

232
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:43,848
They told us in the first one about there was a potential to require a home study.

233
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,790
So like someone to come to our house, make sure it was, you know, make sure that we were suitable parents.

234
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:58,474
And I think that happens more commonly in other States that have maybe different advocacy around same-sex parents, but that was hard as well.

235
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:00,606
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:06,149
So in part of the documents, you know, part of the packet, two things we do.

237
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,251
One is a motion to waive the requirement for a home study.

238
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:20,516
And a home study is required in all adoptions, except when one of the parents is a biological parent.

239
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:28,140
And then another thing I do is a motion to waive notice to any biological father.

240
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:45,606
which is also usually a part of the adoption process, no matter, you know, who's doing it, that you have to give notice to any and all unknown, unnamed biological fathers.

241
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:54,314
And, you know, the way that that's handled in the second parent adoption process is, you know, we usually,

242
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:06,942
give a copy of the contract with either the sperm bank or a known donor and say, you know, this would be fruitless and it's not needed.

243
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:08,645
Great.

244
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,366
I had forgotten about that piece too.

245
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:10,506
Yeah.

246
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:12,248
Well, thank you.

247
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:29,519
I think I, so I, and I do recognize that for me, it was like an sort of an annoyance and maybe it made me like a little bit sad, but I think you've pointed out to me very graciously that it's, I think that it is a positive thing that we have this option, right?

248
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:34,302
That we can get, that I do have legal rights and legal protections over my children.

249
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:37,444
Yeah.

250
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,165
I, you know,

251
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:43,270
again, just like a much more personal take.

252
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,792
I do see it that way.

253
00:28:45,972 --> 00:29:02,462
I do see it as a we get to and and much less about we have to, you know, I think I in sharing that I think I really need to acknowledge that, you know, I am a gestational parent.

254
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:05,784
And I don't think that my voice needs to be

255
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,462
very loud in this conversation, because there is privilege that comes with that.

256
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:15,405
I mean, again, this premium on biology.

257
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:22,851
But yeah, I mean, I do.

258
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:34,500
I do think I am grateful that there was a process through which we could affirm my spouse's legal rights to our children.

259
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:47,558
you know, in this larger conversation, but, but, you know, the way that we form our families is different.

260
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:53,079
It's, it's different than what cis heterosexual people do.

261
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:59,641
And, and, you know, part of what I love about being queer is being queer and we are different.

262
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:05,302
And, you know, for me, part of the,

263
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:16,712
message in the marriage equality movement is we are just like you, you know, we are, you know, and it's kind of like this invitation to the heteronormative culture.

264
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:31,975
And, you know, I think, I think it's important for me, I'll just say for me as a white cis person to say, like, why am I being invited to that table?

265
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:38,756
And what does that mean once we've reached that equality?

266
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:53,523
You know, families are constructed in many ways, obviously single parent households, you know, children in blended families who have multiple parents, children being raised by different constellations of caregivers.

267
00:30:54,723 --> 00:31:01,306
And, you know, the law is kind of the gatekeeper for who gets to be recognized as legal parents.

268
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:02,627
And now, like,

269
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:08,031
queer married folks like we got to see that the table, you know, sure.

270
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:18,487
But I think we all need to be very aware of, you know, how, how we can then be kind of used as this idea of like a model minority.

271
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:20,269
Hmm.

272
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:21,949
I really appreciate that perspective.

273
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:26,611
And I think that there's a very wise man that's one of the podcast named David Harris.

274
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:33,334
He used a similar idea when we talked about like equity in terms of like race in our city.

275
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:37,496
And he used that idea of like bringing people to the table, right?

276
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:40,657
Like we can join this table, which we can maintain the status quo.

277
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:42,838
We're like, what does it mean to be a family?

278
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:47,940
We're joining that rather than dismantling this table and creating something totally different.

279
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,451
Totally.

280
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:50,431
Totally.

281
00:31:50,571 --> 00:32:04,641
And like disrupting that premium on, on biology and like, instead of like, we have to adopt, like we get to adopt adoption is a beautiful, wonderful thing that like many people really want to do.

282
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:16,909
And, and I mean, you know, not to say that that's not complicated too, because it is, and, and there's, you know, can be like trauma for, for, you know, involved, but everything is complicated, you know?

283
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:35,807
And I guess, I guess sometimes when I hear, and again, this is personally, and so, you know, I hope, you know, well, whatever, but I think this may mean that people don't come to me for my business, which is fine, but this is who I am, you know, personally, it's like, Oh, I have to adopt.

284
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,508
It's like, Oh man, we get to like, yeah.

285
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:41,269
You know what I think?

286
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,411
I think one other piece to put on the table is just like,

287
00:32:44,925 --> 00:33:04,016
You know, there's a lot of, because of this premium on biology, there's a lot of, of secrecy, you know, in the, in the kind of the history of IVF, like it was shrouded in secrecy and it was, you know, we can't let anybody know that this child is not made up of the genetic material of this married man and woman and, and same with adoption.

288
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:13,821
In law school, I was lucky to work on a project about original birth certificates of adoptees were sealed and those people couldn't even go and get it.

289
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:31,331
Um, you know, because in adoptions, once the adoption is finalized a new birth certificate issue, and it will name the adopt parents on it, which for us, you and I, because we were both able to sign the birth certificate in the hospital because we were married.

290
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:41,519
So our reissued birth certificates, our kids reissued birth certificates look identical to their first one, but for, um, you know, other folks.

291
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,403
it, it, once the adoption is finalized, you will now have the adoptive parents names on them.

292
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:50,544
I mean, that's a legal fiction.

293
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:51,545
Yeah.

294
00:33:52,405 --> 00:34:10,437
It's making me think about a lot more sort of personal stories that I probably shouldn't tell on the podcast, but I think that, that idea of like, well, yeah, the idea of secrecy and like what we tell our kids about how they were conceived and which I've, I've heard you have some good book recommendations for that, but, um,

295
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,518
Zach Safari.

296
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:14,279
Yeah.

297
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:14,820
Yeah.

298
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,182
And like, and even like how we choose a donor, right?

299
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,766
Do we choose them to be anonymous or do we choose them to be open?

300
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:24,732
Like, and for us, there was a big piece about like,

301
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:33,826
what physical attributes are important to this child or potentially this child that could make them look not totally different from me, right?

302
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:38,088
Which like, you know, I think is like a real privilege to be able to have that choice.

303
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:43,170
And like it, I didn't think about it in this, in the way you're describing, but it's really interesting.

304
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:53,415
Well, I think, I think it's, I think it's important to, to like really get comfortable holding duality.

305
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:54,844
in our mind.

306
00:34:55,044 --> 00:35:05,672
So like, understanding, I mean, and you know, my spouse and I certainly did the same thing, we tried to pick our donor based on characteristics that my spouse has.

307
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:09,515
Because again, like we are products of our environment.

308
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:21,304
And you know, this whole like, there is a part of, well, again, I'll just speak for myself, like me, that's like, right, we're trying to kind of ape that template, that heteronormative template of like,

309
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:27,421
two, you know, opposite sex gender folks contribute genetic material and make a baby.

310
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:31,562
And that's what we're trying to do too, you know, we're trying to get as close to it as possible.

311
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:32,963
And so, and that's okay.

312
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:38,185
Like there, there's nothing wrong with that, but then it's also like, okay, let's, let's dig into that.

313
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:39,566
Why are we trying to do that?

314
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,027
What is, what, what was the harm if we didn't?

315
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:43,248
But yeah.

316
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:50,011
And I mean, you know, I think the whole thing about choosing a donor, I think it's, it's a really,

317
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:54,773
personal and, um, you know, important topic.

318
00:35:55,133 --> 00:36:07,300
And it's probably like a discussion for a whole other podcast, but, um, Is there any advice that you have for, um, like queer people that are thinking about parenting?

319
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:13,543
Uh, it's amazing and really hard.

320
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:17,465
Um, I mean, just parenting in general.

321
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:23,561
Uh, I mean, I, you know, I stick to my line of like, I think second parent adoptions are really important.

322
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,203
Um, but yeah, I don't know.

323
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:28,023
Yeah.

324
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:34,367
I mean, get yourself a crew like we have, but it's pretty amazing.

325
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:36,008
Um, yeah.

326
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:41,812
And just, I guess, um, legally do your second parent adoption.

327
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:43,247
Yeah.

328
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:44,527
Oh, and wait, hold on.

329
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:45,368
I'm so sorry.

330
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:46,948
There is one other thing.

331
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:51,769
Like when we were talking about the cost of this and you were saying like, you have to hire a lawyer, blah, blah, blah.

332
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,790
I just want to say, you do not have to hire a lawyer.

333
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,351
And there are like, you can do it yourself.

334
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,811
And again, because the counties are really different.

335
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:09,913
Some of them are easier to deal with than others when you're just doing it yourself and like middle sex.

336
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:14,403
There's a wonderful, usually each county has like one person who does the adoptions.

337
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:17,903
They tend to be super nice.

338
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:25,965
And I've also seen like on Facebook groups and stuff, people are willing to share the paperwork they've done, they've used.

339
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:37,087
So I find that a lot of folks come to me because like many things when you're juggling small children, it's like, I'm just gonna outsource this and then I don't have to think about it.

340
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:52,485
So, and, you know, I don't, I really, I honestly don't mean this as a plug, but another thing that like our firm offers is we like for a much discounted rate, like to just review your paperwork if you've done it on your own.

341
00:37:52,905 --> 00:38:02,571
So I guess I just want to put it out there that like, if, if you are resourceful and have extra time and want to do it yourself, like go for it.

342
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:06,533
And I, and I tell everybody who consults with our firm that.

343
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:08,149
