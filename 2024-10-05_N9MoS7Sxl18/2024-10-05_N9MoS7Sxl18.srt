129
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,247

133
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's located along Broadway and Somerville.

134
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:48,910

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Tufts is over here.

136
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to orient yourself, this is the location here.

137
00:08:54,931 --> 00:09:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a existing five story residential building consisting of

138
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,189

139
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:11,430

140
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,171
[SPEAKER_07]: My client acquired this after construction in 2019.

141
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:31,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for a little more background, the original approvals for this back in 2015 by the Zoning Board of Appeal included ground floor retail, but did not sufficiently describe

142
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:34,812
[SPEAKER_07]: location.

143
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:42,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So as the building is now up and running, we've got this vacant retail space on the ground floor.

00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:48,595
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, this is what the Sphere Apartments looks like.

[SPEAKER_07]: This is facing towards Ball Square here.

146
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:58,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And the space is located here.

147
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:01,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a couple other plans I can show you.

148
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:08,916
[SPEAKER_07]: This also is a is a site plan showing the cafe look location along Boston Avenue here.

149
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:12,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And a question from Councilor Knight Councilor Knight.

150
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:23,585
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm hearing this correctly, I believe the gentleman just said that I'm sorry, I believe the gentleman just said this was, you know, look like it was going to be a purely residential project and then the reason they.

151
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:32,511
[SPEAKER_11]: developed with some sort of commercial component was based upon the wishes of the community of the city of Medford during the planning and development process.

152
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:33,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

153
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

154
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:43,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't there in 2015 when it was permitted, but the permits included retail space.

155
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:48,014
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wasn't described adequately to allow for a cafe now.

156
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:56,722
[SPEAKER_07]: that to, you know, to make clear what type of use we would like to see in this space.

157
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:08,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because I remember when when this went through, and I think that that was part of the deal was that the city was trying to promote this mixed use development and adding commercial components to residential structures.

158
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:12,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So ultimately, this vacant retail space is actually a creation of our own public policy.

159
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:16,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I see no reason why we should stand in the way and I'd move for approval on that.

160
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think this is an issue.

161
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this is a public hearing, but this is something I certainly don't have any problem

162
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:21,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

163
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:21,947

00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:47,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

230
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:48,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

231
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:48,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

232
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

233
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

234
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

235
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

236
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:50,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you

237
00:11:50,975 --> 00:12:02,064
[SPEAKER_06]: a little nervous about now the Uber Eats and all these delivery services, the park on front and run in, and what it would cause for that neighborhood.

238
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there parking there?

239
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:08,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Understood, Councilor, and that makes a lot of sense.

240
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:12,513
[SPEAKER_07]: There is now visitor parking along the street here.

241
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:17,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't recall how many spaces off the top of my head,

242
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:22,544
[SPEAKER_07]: We envision this as the transit-oriented development.

243
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:25,286
[SPEAKER_07]: We're right across the street from a tea station.

244
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:37,473
[SPEAKER_07]: We're thinking residents of the building and of the neighborhood stopping here for coffee on their way to work, or on their way to the tea, or back, or vice versa.

245
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of how we see it.

246
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's a great idea.

247
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:57,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand that if that was 10 years ago, but now with all these delivery services, that's something that when we look for these types of permits, it's something that I have to wait for the fact that they're not gonna park and then walk over.

248
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:02,125
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna put three or four deep and run in.

249
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:08,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would hate to put any limits on anybody in their business, but that's my concern right now.

250
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:10,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you, Councilor.

251
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

252
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:21,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that was, I think when the first opened up, that was a grocery store, if I'm correct.

253
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or a convenience store.

254
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:26,329
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if the attorney can verify that.

255
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what was in that space prior?

256
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a grocery store?

257
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

258
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:36,274
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've got Paul Spivak, he's the property manager on the line there as well.

259
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:37,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Paul can give us some info.

260
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:40,056
[SPEAKER_21]: I do recall that that's what was in there for a while there.

261
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:46,079
[SPEAKER_21]: And he did serve coffee and stuff, but it was more of a convenience store than an actual cafe originally.

262
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:47,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

263
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:48,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

264
00:13:50,284 --> 00:14:01,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President really I also just wanted to know this is I walked on this part of Boston have very frequently so I've seen what's you know was currently or was formerly in the space when it was a convenience store.

265
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:23,270
[SPEAKER_17]: This strikes me as if the narrative here is you know we're trying to figure out what to do with this ground floor level that has to be commercial we're trying to figure out how to make better use of the space you know I'm certainly willing to go ahead and approve this if you know the owner wants to try it as a cafe instead of a convenience store it is true I almost never saw anybody going into that convenience store.

266
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:31,095
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely hear Councilors Garpelli's concerns about parking I think that making sure that we're not obstructing the roadway to ensure the safety of the roadway is really really important.

267
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:36,359
[SPEAKER_17]: On the other hand, it's kind of hard for me to look at a potential commercial space and have it go underutilized.

268
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,423
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think that we see the issue of cars parked where they shouldn't be all over the city.

269
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,824
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, that's an enforcement issue.

270
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,966
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I don't want us to be tampering down on commercial development.

271
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:49,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd rather see rather CSB doing proper enforcement of where people shouldn't shouldn't be parking.

272
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

273
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

274
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Is there anything else that you want to share for your presentation?

275
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,475
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that pretty much does it in case anyone has any questions, but that's pretty much the overview.

276
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:02,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

277
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

278
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:09,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas this is a public hearing, I need to open it up.

279
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to open up this public hearing.

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper, please either come up to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

281
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:22,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be you as well, Mr. Hurtubise, saying you're in favor of this paper, I assume.

282
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, to go on the record, I'm in favor of this.

283
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:31,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

284
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:34,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else would like to speak in favor of this?

285
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

286
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:42,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone who would like to speak against this petition?

287
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Please come up to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

288
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed as well.

289
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:55,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have a motion to approve from Councilor Knights second.

290
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:07,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a second but sounds like my Councilor Carmel, but we did have something raised brought to our attention by director of planning development sustainability hunt today, and that our recent update to the zoning

291
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:16,823
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the process was changed to send special permit to this, the Community Development Board for opinion before voting on it by bears.

292
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:24,334
[SPEAKER_20]: In further review, we actually found that there was some conditions on that even prior to the reconfiguration so it's not just a reconfiguration thing.

293
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:40,017
[SPEAKER_20]: My recommendation would be twofold, would be to approve pending any comment or feedback from the Community Development Board, as well as the six day public comment period, if we can amend to that.

294
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:40,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

295
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And Director Hutt, is there anything you wanted to add to our very brief explanation?

296
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

297
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,602
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, sure.

298
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

299
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:20,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I was reviewing this and there are some criteria that's supposed to be reviewed about the social and economic community needs, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities and other public services, compatibility with the other structures in the neighborhood, impacts on the natural environment.

300
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,911
[SPEAKER_14]: and the proposals compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

301
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:34,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and so when this is referred to the development board we're happy to just reply back with that information.

302
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:41,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, there is the ability to put conditions on this but as this is already a completely built out location.

303
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not clear that any of these.

304
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:53,511
[SPEAKER_14]: conditions that are allowed under our zoning ordinances would be relevant for this, but the city council would be, or the, sorry, the city board would be happy to review it.

305
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:57,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to be clear, it doesn't require a public hearing.

306
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:06,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would just put it on the next available city board meeting, which I don't have that date in front of me, but it is not tomorrow night.

307
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:12,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Tomorrow night, there is a city board hearing, but we need to put it, we need 48 hours notice to put it on the agenda.

308
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:19,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we would get back to the city council with the letter with our recommendations.

309
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:29,089
[SPEAKER_14]: On first glance, it seems like it would be a lovely addition to the neighborhood and the benefit to the residents, but that's the city board will weigh in on that.

310
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:31,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

311
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So Councilor Knight, you had a motion and would you like to amend it?

312
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,308
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take it.

313
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:43,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the motion from Vice President Bears to approve pending comments from the Community Development Board and the six day public comment period.

314
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a second from Councilor Scarpelli.

315
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that language?

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

333
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So my initial, you know,

334
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:56,656
[SPEAKER_02]: want for the actual store itself is to provide a lot of different type of varieties, but mainly it's crystals.

335
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:06,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if they don't know exactly what it is, what crystal helps with what or whatnot, I do give information on that.

336
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:13,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually have a little bit of my own background of working with crystals and stones and energy for many clients.

337
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:34,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, the, the, for the agenda itself, you know, if somebody is interested in learning more, you know, on the backside of meditation and, you know, yoga, most likely that's something they want to do is a kind of not like a package, but a variety, you know, and energy.

338
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:43,211
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with, you know, for themselves or, you know, just to have fun or just to be a little bit more educated and background on it.

339
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:46,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do provide those services.

340
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:54,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But mainly the store itself would be, you know, crystals and some handmade jewelry and some arts and crafts and that nature.

341
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:54,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

342
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

343
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions from the council at this time?

344
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and some novelty.

345
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:06,775
[SPEAKER_02]: They're interested in some reading also some new readings.

346
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:08,336
[SPEAKER_06]: How many employees are employed?

347
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:09,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just myself.

348
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:09,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

349
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:14,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a business that runs successfully in neighboring communities, correct?

350
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that again?

351
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,680
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a business that also runs in a neighboring community?

352
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It can, yes.

353
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:31,193
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think this is something different and if it brings more people to the square, I think it's important.

354
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:38,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And I might find myself there one day.

355
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:39,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody can use some help.

356
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:45,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, so I wouldn't seek to move approval, but I know it's public hearing.

357
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

358
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

359
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,521
[SPEAKER_21]: So in reviewing this, we were looking at

360
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,020
[SPEAKER_21]: the definition of paranormal.

361
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:04,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And see, this is where we needed an attorney to give us a little guidance on exactly the meaning of what this is.

362
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,249
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, there's some language here that I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm a little confused with.

363
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:16,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I heard the paranormal licensing itself, I was a little bit confused because immediately my mind went to, you know, ghosts and whatnot.

364
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, wait a minute, but I guess

365
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:25,865
[SPEAKER_02]: from the works that I would do or provide as services, it falls under that.

366
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a variety of what is paranormal in that sense.

367
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:31,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still trying to understand it myself.

368
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

369
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:39,857
[SPEAKER_21]: See, if we had an attorney to give us a little, so I guess a little bit more clarity on what the definition is.

370
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you like my opinion, I believe it falls under like the act of arts in a sense, um, spiritually speaking, you know,

371
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:59,730
[SPEAKER_02]: For me to be working with stones and energy, it's a spiritual realm, so most people wouldn't know exactly how to, I guess, I don't label it, so it's under that, I mean, it's under the act of paranormal.

372
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand it 100% either, but it was interesting to me as well.

373
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:14,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just a little hesitant voting on something that I really have no knowledge of and no clarity on.

374
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything I can do to help?

375
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:33,188
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm just saying, before you came in, myself and the other council, we were looking at the definition of paranormal, and I was just a little confused on some of the definitions on what the meanings of the services that are provided under a definition of paranormal.

376
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:36,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

377
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:37,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President.

378
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:53,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being here to share more about your, your business and I was looking also at the definition of this type of retail establishment in our current setting code and I have to agree with my fellow Councilor or the definition that exists in our muni code is certainly outdated included some.

379
00:24:55,188 --> 00:25:06,253
[SPEAKER_17]: interesting references from whenever it was written, but in this case, you know, clearly from your description, it's a store that's providing services and retail of a spiritual inclination.

380
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:11,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli, I think this is going to bring an interesting flavor to Medford Square that doesn't currently exist there.

381
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:18,979
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, towards the goal of bringing more people of all different inclinations to our business districts.

382
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,840
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this could be a great thing for Medford.

383
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

384
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much.

385
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:37,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I think it is important to point out you know the term paranormal is a dated term that's included in a zoning act and the question isn't whether or not they're performing functions that are paranormal in nature it's, you know, whether or not this

386
00:25:38,970 --> 00:26:02,941
[SPEAKER_11]: function that they're performing where when it's best fit is underneath the zoning act right now that's what it falls under based upon the definitions that have been provided to us beforehand I certainly have no problem with the entrepreneur pursuing an opportunity to create a very successful business here in the city of Medford especially in a downtown district and that there is a market for this type of business I mean we see

387
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:09,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Salem Massachusetts for example with thrives on this type of business so I mean I wish you the best of luck and you certainly have my support.

388
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:11,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

389
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,540
[SPEAKER_20]: I was gonna say at least it's another bank.

390
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:29,202
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but on this specific motion after we open the public hearing I just, I would, I would like to make the same motion that we made on the prior special permit, but I'll wait for the public here to be open for the discussion accounts at this time.

391
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, as this is a public hearing we need to open up the public hearing so

392
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:39,213
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone who would like to speak in favor of this petition, please raise your hand on zoom or come to the podium.

408
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:23,559
[SPEAKER_16]: bring in some new energy as well as some new foot traffic.

409
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,000
[SPEAKER_16]: We definitely need it.

410
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:31,605
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and I think I'm very aware of spirituals and the crystals and I think it's a great thing to have.

411
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:34,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilors, comments on everything?

[SPEAKER_04]: So on a motion of Councilor Caraviello to suspend the rules and take two, three, zero.

[SPEAKER_20]: It's under reports to it's the elections manager and elections commission.

456
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:08,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's still gonna give me the number though.

457
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,623
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 23026, it's the last thing on the last page of the agenda.

458
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:21,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to suspend the rules and take paper 23026 off the table, seconded by- Second, could I amend the motion to also take 23285 after that?

459
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:23,285
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as 23285.

460
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,566
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing so well.

461
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:28,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running all over the place.

462
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:34,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Vice-Mayor Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

463
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:41,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

464
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,030
Yes.

465
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,150
Yes.

466
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:52,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

467
00:30:52,624 --> 00:31:05,814
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the first year, the negative the rules are suspended 23-026 election manager and Elections Commission's commission provide an update on the status of the 2022 elections after action report requested by the City Council last fall.

468
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:08,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I see we have Henry Miller in with us.

469
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:12,060
[SPEAKER_12]: A few other folks from the election as well.

470
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So just name it.

471
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:18,084
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Henry Moran, Election Commission room 102.

472
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:26,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Anthony Nadella, Election Commission, Room 102.

473
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:30,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Erin DiBenedetto, Elections Commission, Room 102.

474
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Melissa Ripley, Elections Commission 102, Election Manager.

475
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:47,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so we did, we submitted the report, but you know how it is, there's heavy traffic in city hall, it took longer than expected.

476
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:53,590
[SPEAKER_12]: But finally, we synchronized our time today, so we're gonna do the presentation and make it.

477
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:57,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe almost everything in here, you have seen it, you heard it.

478
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:04,456
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing is, we're trying to get the community on board to understand what we're trying.

479
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:14,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you have to remember, we are still in a transition mode, from one form of election office to another form of election office.

480
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:16,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you guys created that office anyway, right?

481
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:20,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're talking about complaint.

482
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:21,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Were there any complaint?

483
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:28,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, if you show me a good election, any election without a complaint, it won't be an election.

484
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:29,498
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be a selection.

485
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:32,339
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always issues.

486
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,280
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what you do with the issues that's more important.

487
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So for instance, one of the first thing, we had an issue with pole pads.

488
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,802
[SPEAKER_12]: We know what took place with the pole pads.

489
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,398
[SPEAKER_12]: that the

490
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Our spare, we had our spare, just in case.

491
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:08,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Because anything computerized, you can go, they take the electricity, you need to find your voters list.

492
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:14,354
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the thing that I personally, on November election, I stopped to 16%.

493
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:19,998
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason I didn't say 18, because two of them

494
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:22,046
[SPEAKER_12]: the same

495
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:39,896
[SPEAKER_12]: up and running, except for one, because we run into an issue at the former Columbus School because it was open lit.

496
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:44,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure some of you I spoke with on that day that we had an issue.

497
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:47,158
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to go through the firefighter.

498
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,139
[SPEAKER_12]: But we know how to deal with that the next time.

499
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,080
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to happen.

500
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,482
[SPEAKER_12]: As we speak right now, we have election coming up in September and November.

501
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't skip the early voting.

502
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:01,783
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a total

503
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:05,426
[SPEAKER_12]: different game, because it's going to be here.

504
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:13,895
[SPEAKER_12]: We already made contact with every location that we're going to have them.

505
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:17,299
[SPEAKER_12]: We confirmed everybody's going to be on board.

506
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we went a little bit further than that, OK?

507
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:23,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if I go there, you're not there.

508
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:24,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Who do I call?

509
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:27,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Backup number one.

510
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:31,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, suppose backup number one get into an accident coming here.

511
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Who do I call?

512
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Backup number three.

513
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,583
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we went from one tier to three level to get that in place.

514
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:46,048
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's one of the thing I think you guys should give us a medal for doing that because it makes things work faster, okay?

515
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,532
[SPEAKER_12]: There will, we had another issue that was the

516
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,216
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a terrible night.

517
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,239
[SPEAKER_12]: We run longer than expected.

518
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:06,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We have API sitting right here, okay, waiting for it.

519
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Unofficial is unofficial.

520
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:18,731
[SPEAKER_12]: That night, we tried to contact backup to guide us to what we were gonna do.

521
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:25,997
[SPEAKER_12]: We're realizing the time, it was gonna be the day after the election, we made a commission

522
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,452
[SPEAKER_12]: We said, we don't give them the commission, the numbers for today, the one that went to the poll.

523
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:38,514
[SPEAKER_12]: By tomorrow, we'll put everything together and give them still unofficial.

524
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:45,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Within two days, called by the Massachusetts General Law, we give you the official count.

525
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:46,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've done well.

526
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:48,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Will that ever happen again?

527
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:50,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt it.

528
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:58,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so because now we already contracted with LHS to be here on site with us.

529
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:03,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we were trying to save money, but I said, LHS, ah, you don't have to show up.

530
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,027
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do it.

531
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:06,908
[SPEAKER_12]: But things happen, you want them to be here.

532
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:10,310
[SPEAKER_12]: So the contract is there, signed, they will be with us.

533
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,111
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever happen, we'll take action towards.

534
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:15,031
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was the problem with this.

535
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:16,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Signage.

536
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:19,013
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people talk about signage.

537
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:24,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if any one of you remember, because I'm the oldest guy in the room right now.

538
00:36:24,843 --> 00:36:26,823
[SPEAKER_12]: You can say not, because I'm older than you.

539
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,724
[SPEAKER_12]: That day was really windy.

540
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:32,225
[SPEAKER_12]: It was windy like crazy.

541
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:37,086
[SPEAKER_12]: The signage we brought, we brought a bunch of new ones.

542
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:43,747
[SPEAKER_12]: You couldn't put them outside, because there's no place to anchor them on the concrete in front of the schools.

543
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if you put them,

544
00:36:48,545 --> 00:36:52,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Anywhere, you will have to tie them, and people won't see them.

545
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:55,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Signage was complete, it was okay.

546
00:36:57,276 --> 00:37:06,547
[SPEAKER_12]: I was dispatched by the election manager, if I do recall, to a specific place for signage, and I went there, we had it in place.

547
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:15,223
[SPEAKER_12]: that was something that came up because even I personally receive a lot of phone calls about payroll to people.

548
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,264
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something is going to happen.

549
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:18,125
[SPEAKER_12]: People don't see money.

550
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:19,006
[SPEAKER_12]: They go, they panic.

551
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:19,826
[SPEAKER_12]: They go crazy.

552
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:20,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

553
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:21,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Me, I don't see money.

554
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:22,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I relax.

555
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:26,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I have done this work here as a volunteer.

556
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,769
[SPEAKER_12]: It took them longer to pay me, but I know it's money now.

557
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,751
[SPEAKER_12]: The money is there, so I'll wait.

558
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:34,073
[SPEAKER_12]: But we work it out.

559
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I even spoke with some of the councils.

560
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:41,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I spoke with the branch of government here responsible to pay.

561
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Eventually, everybody got paid.

562
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,242
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, that was a done deal.

563
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:47,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost to the end.

564
00:37:48,864 --> 00:38:00,287
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the one that hurt me the most, because that transition was done, and I have no idea at the time I was in charge of a political organization, didn't know when that word was created.

565
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I found out the hard way.

566
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:06,768
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still trying to understand the logic behind it, the concept behind it.

567
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:10,309
[SPEAKER_12]: We have seven to A, we have six to A.

568
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:13,591
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lack of voter education.

569
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:19,756
[SPEAKER_12]: If most of you recall, in 2022, we took the entire month of May.

570
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:25,560
[SPEAKER_12]: We conducted voter education here with the high school, with the senior center.

571
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:28,243
[SPEAKER_12]: We did it at the West Medford Community Center.

572
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:35,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we hold ourselves responsible because our citizens are not fully educated on voters?

573
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:36,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say yes.

574
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:54,086
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can always say no, because me, as an intelligent voter, if I go to a polling station to vote for someone, I'm gonna find out everyone who walks to a polling station knows them well who they're gonna vote for.

575
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:59,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you look on that, their name is not there, you can always go back.

576
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:06,769
[SPEAKER_12]: and tell them, I think we worked this one out, we informed you, and you were happy, you sent us some good information.

577
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,494
[SPEAKER_12]: So the thing we're trying to do, we say, you know, how do we gonna stop that from ever happening again?

578
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:16,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know how it's gonna, when you walk, you're gonna know exactly where to go.

579
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:20,422
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're 62A, you're gonna go to 62A.

580
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:23,545
[SPEAKER_12]: That way you don't have to get any ballot from,

581
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:29,392
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the guy from six to just if I could, Madam President, really quickly.

582
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:36,421
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to clarify, this is because we created our priest, the state made it there, they did their redistricting after we did our reprieving thing.

583
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,702
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's some people who are in.

584
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:42,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, there's two legislative districts that overlap precinct boundaries inaccurately.

585
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:44,150
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a piece of a precinct

586
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,912
[SPEAKER_20]: in one state rep district and a piece of a precinct in another state rep district.

587
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:52,075
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's because they, I just wanted to clarify how we got here.

588
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:54,277
[SPEAKER_12]: We could have done better than that.

589
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:57,739
[SPEAKER_12]: We could have make it in a way where you isolate each other.

590
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,680
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I completely agree.

591
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,501
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate that.

592
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:06,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're working on that, but in the near future, on the next election, you know exactly where you're going to go.

593
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:07,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

594
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:09,066
[SPEAKER_12]: You 628, this is where you're going.

595
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,706
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in the process of looking for other avenue.

596
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:16,827
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be circling back to you guys to help us get site in Medford.

597
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,788
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one of our biggest challenge is ADA compliance.

598
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:26,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Not too many buildings that we can use have access to my friends, the elders, you know.

599
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was the issue.

600
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:31,951
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the solutions focus.

601
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,092
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted people to understand.

602
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:39,214
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the pandemic delay in the census that then the state house decided to force us to re-precinct before they redistricted.

603
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:45,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So for the first time in probably 200 years, we had legislative districts that didn't line up with precinct boundaries.

604
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:46,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not that old.

605
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:48,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

606
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're right, vice president.

607
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:53,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're going to do from there on,

608
00:40:55,815 --> 00:41:01,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Already we're talking in the election office about voter education, which is mandatory.

609
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:02,748
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to keep on doing it.

610
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:03,650
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta do it.

611
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:04,972
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working with...

612
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,947
[SPEAKER_12]: the school to see how we get it out.

613
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:13,309
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working with the elders to see how we get it out.

614
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:21,894
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're working about new ideas, how to put it in our website, how to get involved with reverse 911.

615
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:24,396
[SPEAKER_12]: We had never used that in the city.

616
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we gotta do that.

617
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:39,570
[SPEAKER_12]: something when you go, a flash information on your website when you go there so you know exactly when and where we have elections.

618
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,632
[SPEAKER_12]: So all these little things are in the process of happening.

619
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:45,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Challenge and issues.

620
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,800
[SPEAKER_12]: election workers.

621
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,321
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the biggest issues we face in Medford.

622
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, why?

623
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes we don't have enough people to do the work.

624
00:41:53,642 --> 00:41:53,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

625
00:41:54,362 --> 00:42:00,944
[SPEAKER_12]: You confirm with a guy or a lady who's gonna be here working with you tomorrow, and they don't show up.

626
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:02,384
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't show up.

627
00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:07,005
[SPEAKER_12]: When they don't show up, you have to drag the next person in line.

628
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,586
[SPEAKER_12]: But that next person in line had something else going on.

629
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,247
[SPEAKER_12]: So it makes it a little challenging to do it.

630
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:15,808
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now, we did an audit of the

631
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Workers, and we're trying to change their status to see if they can get them interested in what we're doing.

632
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:24,942
[SPEAKER_12]: And so far, it went well.

633
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:25,702
[SPEAKER_12]: It's working.

634
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:28,603
[SPEAKER_12]: New leadership.

635
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:34,845
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, anytime you change leadership, you have challenges, okay?

636
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been so happy.

637
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:40,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know the election manager until we start working together.

638
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the team works well together.

639
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:44,728
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sit down,

640
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:50,516
[SPEAKER_12]: iron what's not working, what is working, and make it better.

641
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:59,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we all have the same objective, make the election of Medford-Rothschild square and fair, and smooth too.

642
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,645
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys gonna be up this year, you probably see it.

643
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I had conversation with some of you about things that we're doing.

644
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,247
[SPEAKER_12]: You're aware of what we're doing.

645
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:16,550
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing I will recommend as I'm speaking, maybe my last chance, who knows, I'm an old guy, I may not see tomorrow.

646
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be afraid to make a phone call to find out what we're doing.

647
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:23,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people call me anytime they wanna call me, they do.

648
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And anytime I wanna call you guys, I do that.

649
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:29,375
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's have a conversation because we all want the same thing.

650
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:31,176
[SPEAKER_12]: for the city of Metro.

651
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:42,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, there's something we haven't seen in the city, okay?

652
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:47,411
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in the process of seeing how to utilize that pool.

653
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:55,779
[SPEAKER_12]: pole pads where the workers can remotely access them should there is a problem.

654
00:43:55,959 --> 00:44:03,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Because when you say computers, everybody shake in the city of Medford, even my wife, who is smarter than I am.

655
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:05,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, most of you knows my wife.

656
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,662
[SPEAKER_12]: When you say computers, she shake.

657
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:11,283
[SPEAKER_12]: And that goes for all our workers.

658
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,003
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working on that.

659
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:16,266
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about census.

660
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:22,172
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the key recommendation, there was a lot of question asked, are we going to do the following?

661
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:25,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of you receive your census the same way as everybody else.

662
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,818
[SPEAKER_12]: No one told us how we do it.

663
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:33,265
[SPEAKER_12]: It was up, the city, the election manager said, that's how we got to do it.

664
00:44:33,785 --> 00:44:34,826
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now we on,

665
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:44,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on top of our game with the census, we're working with the second wave of people who fail to send their confirmation back.

666
00:44:45,345 --> 00:44:49,748
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the key thing you got to remember, we have no control over the post office.

667
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:50,228
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't.

668
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:51,723
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't.

669
00:44:52,304 --> 00:45:06,358
[SPEAKER_12]: We made arrangements a few years back to make it smooth, because when you send a letter from Medford to Medford, from City Hall to Medford, it used to go from City Hall to Medford to Boston, then back to Medford.

670
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:07,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

671
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:13,092
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had to work that out with the, uh, Paul, uh, Paul master.

672
00:45:13,692 --> 00:45:17,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, okay, this is what we're going to do anything to do with election.

673
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,316
[SPEAKER_12]: It will go Medford to Medford.

674
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:21,917
[SPEAKER_12]: So we broke that thing.

675
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:23,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not our control.

676
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:24,178
[SPEAKER_12]: That's federal.

677
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:25,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

678
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:27,520
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is where we are.

679
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:29,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh,

680
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving forward, we're already moving forward.

681
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:39,154
[SPEAKER_12]: For those who doesn't know, because I spoke with one of you who didn't know, we had our election calendar already posted, okay?

682
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:42,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Because right now we're in a cycle of town election.

683
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:48,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And following town election, there'll be city election.

684
00:45:48,357 --> 00:45:52,319
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when informations are there for you.

685
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,180
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be happy after looking at it.

686
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't forget to send the, you know,

687
00:45:59,528 --> 00:46:07,792
[SPEAKER_12]: notes, because a lot of you will be happy what's been what took place and makes it easy to go through and avoid any error.

688
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:12,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I will rest my case unless you have any questions for any one of you.

689
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:16,355
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know I know he was gonna ask questions.

690
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:17,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Henry.

691
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:20,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight motion to receive in place a file, Madam President.

692
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:30,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President, I'll second Councilor nice motion I just want to say thank you to the elections manager the Elections Commission for coming down for putting together this report.

693
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:43,088
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the reasons I was hoping you guys would come down to present it is that I could read it but I don't have all the context that you all have that maybe in between it and I don't want to say something out of turn you know I requested this originally so I really appreciate appreciate this being presented.

694
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:47,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't want to read this and then not be able to answer a question from a colleague or

695
00:46:47,631 --> 00:47:04,062
[SPEAKER_20]: say something that maybe had there's been an update since the report was filed or anything like that but I really appreciate the thoroughness of this, it seems like, you know, a, the transition that there's a lot of work going into the transition and it's it's you know, identifying places where processes need to be addressed and improved.

696
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:09,506
[SPEAKER_20]: There were a few complaints from the last election there's a real solutions focused energy on getting all of that right this time.

697
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:11,748
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just I appreciate that.

698
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:40,044
[SPEAKER_20]: and I appreciate the open dialogue and I know it's you know formally us be it resolved that we request this and then be it resolved that you better get this back to us and come down and tell us about it it's a very formal process but I wanted it to be a dialogue I didn't want it to be written communications me reading something you saying something I felt like it was better if we could come down and if anyone had any questions or if there was additional context that you wanted to provide that you've been able to provide it so I really appreciate that and I know that thank you for the offer I'm sure that

699
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:45,306
[SPEAKER_20]: If we see anything as we lead up to the next election, we'll be sure to be in touch with the commission and the elections manager about it.

700
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:46,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Council.

701
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:49,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Bears.

702
00:47:49,187 --> 00:47:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

703
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:51,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

704
00:47:51,428 --> 00:47:57,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And Henry, especially in such a volatile time in our country when it comes to voting issues, I think

705
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:05,860
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, having you and your commissioners involved really put should put everybody at ease.

706
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: The commitment that all of you put in to such an important aspect of our process really should make everybody in the city proud and feel at ease in your efforts because I've known you many years and there isn't a more thorough

707
00:48:23,154 --> 00:48:31,124
[SPEAKER_06]: person or leader in our community so I thank you and the team behind you and all the supporters and helpers that you do have so thank you.

708
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:36,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Rowland.

709
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:39,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Henry, and to the rest of the Commission and Elections Manager for being here today.

710
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:54,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Really appreciate the thorough rundown, you know, as it's been stated, you know, I think we probably all heard from one or two constituents after the last election, sorry, after the last election with some concerns, you know, some confusions, and I think this really details the

711
00:48:54,509 --> 00:49:01,853
[SPEAKER_17]: commission is pretty forward looking being really proactive on, you know, making sure that every is dotted every T is crossed a couple times.

712
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:05,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's really great to hear and it's great to hear all the detail behind that.

713
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:08,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So clearly this is a team that's really good at working together.

714
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:09,117
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate that.

715
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, I'm sure we'll be in touch as September and November.

716
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:13,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Get closer to hand.

717
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:14,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

718
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

719
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

720
00:49:19,402 --> 00:49:20,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Henry and the entire thank you.

721
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

722
00:49:21,263 --> 00:49:21,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

723
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to take the role on this.

724
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight seconded by vice versa received place on file.

[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

726
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:47,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative and then I gave motion passes.

00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:51,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So person bears that are requested 23285 next and do you have somewhere else you want to go as well?

[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

729
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will go next to 23285.

730
00:49:55,507 --> 00:50:09,513
[SPEAKER_04]: 23285 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding Community Preservation Committee appropriation requests.

734
00:50:38,555 --> 00:50:39,675

738
00:51:13,757 --> 00:51:28,680
[SPEAKER_04]: The redevelopment of Walkling Court provides a vital opportunity to provide replacement units in a high quality, sustainable, and accessible mid-rise development with elevator access and a flexible community space, which will allow seniors to age in place in the transit accessible hillside neighborhood.

739
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:39,201
[SPEAKER_04]: This project addresses the urgent need for affordable housing in the city of Medford by adding 94 deeply affordable units, 54 new additional senior units, and 40 new additional family units.

740
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Eligibility is the community housing slash creation

741
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:46,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The project will create 94 new public housing units.

742
00:51:46,811 --> 00:52:01,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommendation on March 14, 2023, the City of Medford Community Preservation Committee, CPC, voted 5-0-0 to recommend the City Council that the Medford Housing Authority, MHA, be awarded $800,000 of Community Preservation Act funds for the Walkland Court redevelopment project.

743
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:09,586
[SPEAKER_04]: In reaching their decision, the CPC found that the project meets the CPA objective of funding generation of new affordable housing units at Walkland Court.

744
00:52:10,146 --> 00:52:20,791
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions of approval one as CPA funds can only fund new units not replacement units, the percentage of the contribution of the CPA funds to pre development costs must be equal to or less than the percentage of new units.

745
00:52:21,331 --> 00:52:32,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the CPA funds are to be structured as a forgivable loan that will convert to a grant upon their quest zoning approvals to construct 54 new units in addition to the 144 replacement units in phase one.

746
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:37,584
[SPEAKER_04]: If fewer than 54 new units are permitted, the grant will be proportional as stated above.

747
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:40,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta Cameron, Chair, Community Preservation Committee.

748
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:43,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

749
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:44,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

750
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:46,590
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a project I'm very excited about.

751
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:59,999
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that I think dates back to the Burke administration, and it's something that the director, the executive director, Director Driscoll has been keeping us very well apprised of over the years in terms of the progress that's being made in this project.

752
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to commend him for the work that he's done.

753
00:53:03,622 --> 00:53:10,428
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of many funding sources that the Housing Authority has been able to utilize to renovate and revitalize the passes over there.

754
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:17,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And this project is going to be good for our community, good for our seniors, and it's going to be good in addressing some of the affordable housing shortages that we have here in the community.

755
00:53:18,315 --> 00:53:20,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those reasons, I'll be supporting this paper this evening.

756
00:53:21,317 --> 00:53:28,023
[SPEAKER_11]: When we look back at the application that's before us, what comes to mind for me is the

757
00:53:31,063 --> 00:53:39,613
[SPEAKER_11]: multiple, five, six public meetings that we've had on this previously already to discuss what's going on, prepare us for what's going on.

758
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:44,278
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way that financial management should take place in a municipality, especially one of this size.

759
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:47,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, I commend Executive Director Driscoll.

760
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:53,883
[SPEAKER_11]: for all those work in keeping us informed and for seeing this project through from its beginning stages to its end.

761
00:53:54,603 --> 00:54:00,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all too often that we see press releases that say what we're gonna do, but then we never see what we say we're gonna do get done.

762
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:06,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've always known Jeff to be someone that leads by results and not by press releases.

763
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:08,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And this right here is proof of the pudding, Madam President.

764
00:54:08,586 --> 00:54:15,848
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly thank the Community Preservation Committee for their favorable recommendation and I move for approval on the application statement.

765
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

766
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:17,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

767
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:18,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

768
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:23,150
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I want to thank the commission for coming up here.

769
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:29,874
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we've all talked about affordable housing, affordable housing, and this has 94 units.

770
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:31,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I correct?

771
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:34,196
[SPEAKER_21]: 98 units.

772
00:54:34,977 --> 00:54:37,658
[SPEAKER_21]: And these will be mostly family units?

773
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to just come up just so we can hear you on the mic?

774
00:54:42,953 --> 00:54:47,975
[SPEAKER_18]: sorry, Madam President, Jeffrey Driscoll, I'm the executive director of the Medford Housing Authority.

775
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:58,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Presently, there's 144 units on the site that will be increased to 198, and then there will be 40 additional units that will be family units.

776
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, so we'll be adding families into that group.

777
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:01,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, definitely.

778
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,142
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of those 40 units, in particular, 24 of them,

779
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:10,985
[SPEAKER_18]: will be in a building that will be accessible.

780
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:16,446
[SPEAKER_18]: And there will be there will be accessible units available for families handicapped accessible.

781
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:19,206
[SPEAKER_21]: And what about for seniors?

782
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:21,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Would there be sections for seniors only?

783
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:30,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Or will they be mixed in with everybody else that what what we're anticipating doing is on the back end of the site to construct a mid rise building.

784
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:43,300
[SPEAKER_18]: That will house the, the elderly, the seniors, and disabled individuals, and around this, the side and the front of the development will be townhouses.

785
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:50,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the middle of the development will be a 24 unit building with with elevator access.

786
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:53,249
[SPEAKER_21]: So, a couple of concerns that I've heard from neighbors is.

787
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:56,435
[SPEAKER_21]: They're concerned about the train and the pollution from the train.

788
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:58,256
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you address that?

789
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:12,583
[SPEAKER_18]: The way the design is presently structured, we're in schematic design right now, and the way that it's presently structured, we're looking to minimize the impact of the rails and the noise from that on the building.

790
00:56:13,343 --> 00:56:21,127
[SPEAKER_18]: We anticipate with today's construction, we will be able to not necessarily eliminate it entirely, but certainly minimize it.

791
00:56:21,907 --> 00:56:30,093
[SPEAKER_18]: The residents that are at that site right now have a fairly close proximity to the tracks as it is.

792
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,574
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll actually be improving it.

793
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Will there be sound barriers put up there?

794
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:40,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Not necessarily sound barriers, but the construction will take into consideration the noise that's there.

795
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:46,385
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've actually already had a study done dealing with the noise and how to minimize it.

796
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:49,867
[SPEAKER_18]: And the design will take that into consideration.

797
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:50,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

798
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:50,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

799
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, and then we'll go to- Thank you, Madam President.

800
00:56:55,608 --> 00:57:01,891
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, I also have with me my support staff here to be able to provide assistance.

801
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:05,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the chairperson of the Housing Authority, Rosa Chiles.

802
00:57:06,614 --> 00:57:09,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Gabe Ciccarello is the director of modernization and procurement.

803
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:15,379
[SPEAKER_18]: And Margaret Moran is our development consultant, who's been working very closely with us, who's done a fantastic job.

804
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

805
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:17,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for being here.

806
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

807
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:19,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

808
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Driscoll, thank you so much.

809
00:57:21,863 --> 00:57:34,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that this is something that you've been very transparent, and it's always a pleasure when you have the actual commissioner and his team come with concerns or issues.

810
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:35,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that

811
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:50,871
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got, we've had a few emails and concerns about lack of lack of community input which I don't see, I didn't see where that that fell into place I think that you've been so transparent in that format and really involve the community.

812
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I think that any housing right now in this format is so needed.

813
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:06,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And anywhere we can find the space to make sure that we can enhance housing for

814
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:10,043
[SPEAKER_06]: a demographic that has been missed, I think that is a huge win.

815
00:58:11,284 --> 00:58:22,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So we appreciate, I appreciate what you have done as a leader and moving forward to make sure that Medford has options for the people of Medford.

816
00:58:22,768 --> 00:58:26,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank you for your commitment and I applaud

817
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,871
[SPEAKER_06]: your efforts and how you presented this.

818
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:37,453
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something that you hid behind a desk and all of a sudden it came out and you know, the commissioner shows up or send someone there just to approve it.

819
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes takes questions.

820
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:40,114
[SPEAKER_06]: You've always been here.

821
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:41,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's always been.

822
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:47,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you sometimes it's not comfortable, but you've always stood at that podium.

823
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:48,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate that.

824
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:50,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And also bringing your team and

825
00:58:51,957 --> 00:58:56,799
[SPEAKER_06]: them willing to sit there and stand beside you is a huge testament of who you are as a leader.

826
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:06,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, like I said, we've been talking about affordable housing and housing for seniors and like, and I'll repeat it just because I think it's important.

827
00:59:07,102 --> 00:59:07,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not ideal.

828
00:59:08,342 --> 00:59:17,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a penthouse on the water on Mystic Ave on the Mystic River, but it is the step in the right direction and I applaud it.

829
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:18,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you so much.

830
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:19,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for the kind words.

831
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:20,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

832
00:59:20,745 --> 00:59:21,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Councilor Tseng.

833
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:23,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

834
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:27,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as much as I would like to live on that in that house on the mistake.

835
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:33,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I joined my fellow Councilors and saying that I believe that this is a good project.

836
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all.

837
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:45,704
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you go in the city, whoever you talk to, no matter their income background, political background, we're hearing that housing is a problem, that lack of housing is a problem.

838
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:49,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many ways that we can solve it.

839
00:59:49,706 --> 01:00:00,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And given the state of the crisis that we're in, we definitely will need to use more of the tools in the toolbox than just increasing supply.

840
01:00:00,573 --> 01:00:15,491
[SPEAKER_01]: But increasing housing supply is something that I think most of the city can get behind, and economists of all colors, of all stripes, housing activists of all backgrounds too, can get behind this as well.

841
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard about this project for, for a while now I remember sitting, all of us sitting in a meeting, perhaps a year ago, I'm hearing about this project, and I'm very excited to see this come before on the city council.

842
01:00:31,562 --> 01:00:34,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are concerns, but no project is perfect.

843
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:40,569
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do right now is address the real crisis that we have at our hands.

844
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to start to get things done.

845
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:52,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to take those first steps and this is a very impressive step that will move our city in the right direction.

846
01:00:53,479 --> 01:01:00,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank the Commissioner, I thank all of you guys for the hard work that you put into this project and in soliciting feedback from the community.

847
01:01:02,193 --> 01:01:02,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

848
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:04,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

849
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:06,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Brown.

850
01:01:06,457 --> 01:01:08,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much, Director Driscoll for being here.

851
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,224
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad that we get the opportunity to vote in support of this again.

852
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:16,547
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you were here January last year for an earlier step in this process.

853
01:01:16,587 --> 01:01:26,277
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think that this is a really great example of how, you know, public housing and Medford investing in public housing can, you know, be a great example of what affordable housing should be in the community.

854
01:01:27,137 --> 01:01:33,460
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm glad that this CPC recommendation came through so that Medford can invest in its own public housing locally.

855
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:40,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that this really exemplifies that, you know, to build to expand public housing in the community is expensive it takes a long time.

856
01:01:41,124 --> 01:01:47,287
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to be making these investments early and often adding 98 affordable units to our community is.

857
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,107
[SPEAKER_17]: such an important thing.

858
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:53,069
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know it's been a multi step multi year process that you've been shepherding.

859
01:01:53,089 --> 01:02:11,894
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's just really important for people to understand like how much it takes to be adding these permanently affordable units to our community, as well as just exemplifying that affordable housing can look like a lot of things that can be that can look like a lot of different types of households, different types of families, but that it should be rehabilitated, it should be modern, it should be high quality.

860
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:15,336
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that this is just a really a really great example of a project.

861
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:16,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad that we are

862
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:17,836
[SPEAKER_17]: to be able to, you know, chip again.

863
01:02:17,856 --> 01:02:19,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Um you know, part of our fair share of this project.

864
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:20,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

865
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:20,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

866
01:02:21,297 --> 01:02:21,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

867
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice is embarrassed.

868
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:23,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

869
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:24,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Director.

870
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:24,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Just for being here.

871
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,039
[SPEAKER_20]: Three questions.

872
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:27,439
[SPEAKER_20]: One trees.

873
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:31,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any way in the plan to preserve more of the mature trees that are currently on site?

874
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:34,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it's an issue that we've dealt with already.

875
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:38,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, there's been, um, questions raised relative to that.

876
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:42,044
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had an arborist come out and do a study

877
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:45,766
[SPEAKER_18]: of all the trees that are on the site and give us a report on that.

878
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:51,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can tell you that we are going to save as many trees as we possibly can.

879
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,053
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point in time, we're still in the design stage, so I can't tell you what's going to stay and what's going to go.

880
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:01,176
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're not going to knock down any trees unless they absolutely have to be.

881
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:02,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, great.

882
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:10,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Second, just a little bit more on the on the kind of notification and process for existing residents and kind of neighboring of butters.

883
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:16,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you just go into like when residents were first informed, and how many times they've been informed you don't have to be exact on it.

884
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:18,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I don't have a list in front of me.

885
01:03:19,986 --> 01:03:21,546
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can tell you, do you have that list.

886
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:28,190
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually have a have another meeting scheduled for Thursday.

887
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:44,706
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had five resident meetings and four community meetings.

888
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:56,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And we started this in early, we started, we began with a project feasibility in early 2020, but we began in earnest the meetings.

889
01:03:57,271 --> 01:04:01,372
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say, correct me if I'm wrong, a year after that, maybe?

890
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:15,467
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been ongoing with the residents we schedule them at 130 and four o'clock on Thursday afternoon, and then we meet with the neighbors at 630 that evening.

891
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:19,771
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe there's been five or six resident meetings.

892
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,713
[SPEAKER_18]: and four community meetings.

893
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,034
[SPEAKER_18]: This will be the fifth this week.

894
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,215
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been very open.

895
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:32,878
[SPEAKER_18]: The designers have done an excellent job, the architects, in providing the information.

896
01:04:33,058 --> 01:04:39,661
[SPEAKER_18]: I've attended, my staff has attended all of the presentations, and we're trying to be as open as possible.

897
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:46,905
[SPEAKER_18]: We've taken the input from the community and tried to incorporate that into what it is that we're doing.

898
01:04:47,225 --> 01:04:58,554
[SPEAKER_18]: There are certain things, though, that the community has requested that we just can't do because of the zoning changes over the years from when Walkling Court was initially constructed.

899
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:07,181
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the issues was to see if we could not have a thruway through Walkling Court and continue to maintain the circle.

900
01:05:07,962 --> 01:05:13,947
[SPEAKER_18]: We have investigated that fully, and that's not something that would be a recommendation in particular of the fire department to do that.

901
01:05:14,387 --> 01:05:27,058
[SPEAKER_18]: So, therefore, we can't take into consideration that going forward but as with the, my answer as far as the trees are concerned, anything that we can do that's recommended or suggested by the neighbors would certainly consider that and attempt to do it.

902
01:05:27,538 --> 01:05:27,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

903
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:29,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and along those same lines.

904
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,501
[SPEAKER_20]: for the residents during construction?

905
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:36,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they either going to be housed during construction if they can't if their units being demolished or rebuilt?

906
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:38,403
[SPEAKER_20]: And will they have the right to return?

907
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:40,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Another excellent question.

908
01:05:40,224 --> 01:05:42,825
[SPEAKER_18]: First off, I'll answer the second aspect of that first.

909
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:44,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, they will have a right to return.

910
01:05:45,386 --> 01:05:56,010
[SPEAKER_18]: We are in the process and I think the councils are aware we're in the process right now of over $100 million renovation of 121 Riverside Avenue.

911
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:02,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have a relocation project in dealing with that.

912
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:13,760
[SPEAKER_18]: And those residents have either moved within the building, or they've moved from the building to some of our other sites, or that we have given them a Section 8 voucher.

913
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,484
[SPEAKER_18]: And we actually have one individual who received a Section 8 voucher and moved to Florida permanently.

914
01:06:21,505 --> 01:06:22,186
[SPEAKER_18]: and they can do that.

915
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:25,690
[SPEAKER_18]: We would offer the same thing for WalkLink.

916
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:30,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And the way that we're looking to do this is it's a two phase project.

917
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:35,542
[SPEAKER_18]: First phase is for the elderly disabled, the mid rise, the back of the development.

918
01:06:36,043 --> 01:06:38,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And what we will do is take possibly five of the buildings.

919
01:06:39,627 --> 01:06:43,151
[SPEAKER_18]: there and demolish those those individuals would be relocated.

920
01:06:43,992 --> 01:06:49,978
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been in discussions with the state not to fill the vacancies and we'll continue to have those discussions.

921
01:06:50,018 --> 01:07:02,010
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't gotten authorization yet because it is a state development but eventually we will get the authorization not to fill those vacancies and with the vacancies in the front of the development we will relocate people from the back

922
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:07,395
[SPEAKER_18]: and we will also relocate them into our other housing throughout the community.

923
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:14,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Once we have those buildings emptied out, we will then begin the construction.

924
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:22,331
[SPEAKER_18]: And once the construction is over, those folks that live at the front of the development will move immediately into the building.

925
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:28,922
[SPEAKER_18]: folks who were moved to another site will have the opportunity to move back in.

926
01:07:29,162 --> 01:07:31,305
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Housing Authority takes care of all the costs.

927
01:07:31,565 --> 01:07:41,256
[SPEAKER_18]: It takes care of the cost of the initial move, the move back, and also assisting them with any services that they may have had at Walkling Court will continue at the other sites.

928
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:42,918
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, thank you.

929
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:44,160
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really important.

930
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Last question is a little bit bigger picture, and if you don't have the answer in front of you I totally understand it.

931
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:51,849
[SPEAKER_18]: If I don't have the answer I'll make it up to you.

932
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:54,833
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a curveball but it's just kind of in the larger context.

933
01:07:56,132 --> 01:08:04,880
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm no expert on this but my basic understanding is that there's something called Fairchild that's federal law and that is the maximum number of public housing units that we could have in the city.

934
01:08:05,721 --> 01:08:15,330
[SPEAKER_20]: How far below that are we and how much does between this project and 121 how close does that bring us up an excellent, an excellent question again, faircloth faircloth.

935
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:15,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

936
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:16,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

937
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:17,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, we're 83 units below.

938
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:26,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And basically what that is, it's an allocation on paper of the number of public housing units.

939
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:34,319
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of the benefits of the SALT installed development is that there's 200 units there right now.

940
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:42,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Commissioner Scott, Councilor Scarpelli, you indicated about the addition of affordable housing.

941
01:08:43,266 --> 01:08:45,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we have 200 units now.

942
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,871
[SPEAKER_18]: When we're done with the renovation, we'll have 22 additional units.

943
01:08:50,188 --> 01:08:58,632
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a master plan for that site that would afford us the ability to put 88 more units on that site at some future time.

944
01:08:58,672 --> 01:08:59,833
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not looking to do that now.

945
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's at 121 Riverside?

946
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:02,314
[SPEAKER_18]: At 121 Riverside.

947
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:09,518
[SPEAKER_18]: By virtue of what we're doing and the renovation that is undergoing and the authorization we got from the federal government,

948
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:15,180
[SPEAKER_18]: those 200 units that are there now will be added to the Faircloth.

949
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:23,523
[SPEAKER_18]: So that will mean that in the future, there are 200 public housing subsidies available to the city of Medford.

950
01:09:24,443 --> 01:09:26,224
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would make that 283.

951
01:09:26,264 --> 01:09:27,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of those will be utilized

952
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:35,307
[SPEAKER_18]: for the Walking Court project, the construction project and the funding of that.

953
01:09:35,847 --> 01:09:41,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Others will have a project-based Section 8 voucher that will be attached to the unit.

954
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:47,433
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I say attached to the unit, someone can pick up and take that and go someplace else.

955
01:09:48,293 --> 01:09:50,294
[SPEAKER_18]: If they move, they move without the subsidy.

956
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:51,835
[SPEAKER_18]: The subsidy will remain in the unit.

957
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:52,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

958
01:09:52,696 --> 01:09:54,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for answering the question.

959
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:54,517
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

960
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,358
[SPEAKER_20]: And having it, even though you weren't.

961
01:09:56,418 --> 01:09:59,079
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't have to ask my staff on that, but they counseled me well.

962
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

963
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,280
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

964
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:01,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

965
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:04,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions, discussion from the council?

966
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:08,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

967
01:10:10,325 --> 01:10:12,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Matthew Page Lieberman.

968
01:10:17,272 --> 01:10:24,098
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to start with Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street, and that is in a Medford public housing, um, administered building.

969
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:28,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Um I've been extremely excited about this, just like many people here.

970
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:30,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we've been hearing about this for quite a while.

971
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:30,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

972
01:10:30,923 --> 01:10:31,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk to Jeff about it.

973
01:10:31,784 --> 01:10:33,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Just talk to housing Medford about

974
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:41,926
[SPEAKER_13]: being, you know, gratitude for the work that Jeff has done.

975
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:49,650
[SPEAKER_13]: In my experience as a, you know, a tenant of one of these buildings, in general, Jeff's been extremely responsive to me with all the work that he's doing.

976
01:10:49,690 --> 01:11:00,697
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that, you know, I think almost every community, I would hope that every community has, you know, in this country around the world would have an executive director of a housing authority as ambitious as Jeff in getting these projects done.

977
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:08,209
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's also been really wonderful that we've had Roberta Cameron heading up the Community Preservation Committee to kind of shepherd this through.

978
01:11:08,249 --> 01:11:14,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's another name that was mentioned today, which is Losa Janvier, who is the chair of the Board of Commissioners.

979
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:26,818
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm extremely happy that, you know, there's been a lot of progress with the Housing Authority over the past year, especially that Losa, like myself, is an actual resident of these communities.

980
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:29,443
[SPEAKER_13]: these units and is the chair.

981
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:36,579
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Board of Commissioners actually has an actual tenant of these buildings who is heading up the commission, which is extremely exciting for me.

982
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:45,627
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to, yeah, I think that we should all be very grateful to have these three people working for us in this community.

983
01:11:46,028 --> 01:11:59,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Nearly 100 units is incredible, considering all these NIMBY whining with so much development that people try to block to prevent people from being able to be members of our community, actually be able to live here and affordably.

984
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:05,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say, though, that this is a major capital expenditure.

985
01:12:05,436 --> 01:12:06,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is getting new units.

986
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:32,206
[SPEAKER_13]: currently there's a campaign that's going on, mostly, you know, it's directed at the state house to increase the operating budget so we can increase the amount of money that goes to, you know, taking care of these units after they're constructed and taking care of, you know, the state housing, because this is the one state project building of all the housing authority buildings, you know, in the city.

987
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,767
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I've read is that there's

988
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:39,056
[SPEAKER_13]: a lack of parity as far as these federal and state buildings.

989
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:52,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how the budget's administered by the Housing Authority, but what I've read is that the federal government gives us much, much more money for each one of these federal units than the state government gives us for these state buildings, if people understand.

990
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:58,281
[SPEAKER_13]: There are federally-owned buildings administered by the Housing Authority, and then there is one state-owned building.

991
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:14,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, there's a campaign going on, and we're trying to raise money so there'll be more operating money to make sure that those buildings, the rest of the, I mean, that particular, those new units and all the rest of the units in the state building, you know, have all the funding that they need.

992
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,305
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just, you know, really, really appreciative.

993
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:22,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad that there is so much support, and this is really, really exciting for the city.

[SPEAKER_18]: Walkling Court is a voting place.

1010

[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know?

1013
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,201

[SPEAKER_18]: We've committed to a year, correct?

1015
01:14:16,463 --> 01:14:17,604
[SPEAKER_18]: We've committed to a year.

1016
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:24,167
[SPEAKER_18]: We anticipate the closing for this to be in April or May of next year, and then we'll begin the construction.

1017
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:25,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

1018
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:25,548

1049
01:15:54,907 --> 01:16:00,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, going to those to student here vices and bears is withdrawing because

1050
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:22,572
[SPEAKER_04]: here on his mic going to 23-096 offer by vice president parents be it so resolved the Medford City Council that we request an update from the city administration on efforts to assist Medford residents facing the Medicaid cliff due to the end of the pandemic emergency order in reapplying and certifying their eligibility for Medicaid slash mass health insurance coverage.

1051
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:30,517
[SPEAKER_04]: for the resolve of the city administration, engage our community liaison team in providing assistance to eligible residents who speak first languages other than English.

1052
01:16:30,617 --> 01:16:31,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1053
01:16:31,617 --> 01:16:32,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1054
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:42,064
[SPEAKER_20]: As folks know, with the end of the pandemic emergency orders, I think both at the federal and state level, I think they're happening concurrently on the same day, sometime in early to mid-May.

1055
01:16:43,624 --> 01:16:50,609
[SPEAKER_20]: That is changing federal and state rules around MassHealth, which is the Massachusetts Medicaid program for the past

1056
01:16:51,409 --> 01:17:05,796
[SPEAKER_20]: three years people have been able to stay on the program without re enrolling and meeting all those requirements so they may be at risk after this expires of losing their health insurance and not really being aware of it given that there hasn't been the ongoing education and programming needed on that.

1057
01:17:08,746 --> 01:17:23,721
[SPEAKER_20]: and state advocates for health care are asking is that local communities also make this a priority to make sure that when they're communicating with residents that they are including this information and providing access to state and federal resources.

1058
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:28,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, the city can't, you know, do this work for folks, but they can make people aware that this is coming up.

1059
01:17:29,507 --> 01:17:33,332
[SPEAKER_20]: and can share them the resources that already exists from the state and the federal government.

1060
01:17:33,352 --> 01:17:40,560
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just like to request to make sure from the city administration that they are following that best practice as as requested.

1061
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1062
01:17:42,262 --> 01:17:48,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council on the motion of ice and bears seconded by Councilor Knight Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1063
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:57,640

01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:57,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1065
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:57,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1066
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,140

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1071
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:00,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1072
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:04,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1073
01:18:04,021 --> 01:18:04,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1074
01:18:04,121 --> 01:18:04,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1075
01:18:04,661 --> 01:18:04,821
Yes.

1076
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:04,901
Yes.

1082
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1083
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,272
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first of three.

1084
01:20:00,786 --> 01:20:06,250
[SPEAKER_20]: proposals tonight on the council agenda relative to specific charter amendments to the city charter.

1085
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:17,738
[SPEAKER_20]: We first discussed this over a month ago and regular session and we had a committee of the whole meeting this month on the matter, and I really appreciated the thoughtful comments of all my colleagues

1086
01:20:18,518 --> 01:20:19,199
[SPEAKER_20]: on this issue.

1087
01:20:19,699 --> 01:20:39,232
[SPEAKER_20]: I think echoing what that Councilor Caraviello said our committee of the whole is that this really focuses on the city council around a purpose which is making sure that we have the authority that we need to conduct oversight and and also to make sure that we are having real voice and input and bringing the people's voice and input to the city budget.

1088
01:20:40,277 --> 01:20:43,219
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I won't rehash everything that we've discussed in the past two times.

1089
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:58,790
[SPEAKER_20]: We've discussed this, but the city charter of the city of Medford, as acknowledged by many, many elected officials, including the mayor, is one of the strongest planning charters in the Commonwealth, which means that the mayor's office is incredibly strong and the council's powers are not so strong.

1090
01:20:59,351 --> 01:21:06,776
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is one way that we can take action very quickly through some common sense measures to rectify that and make sure that the city council

1091
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:12,313
[SPEAKER_20]: not just should be a partner but must be a partner at the table.

1092
01:21:12,913 --> 01:21:27,279
[SPEAKER_20]: When it comes to things like the city budget and appointments of members of boards and commissions and making sure that we have the legal advice that we need, which kind of came up tonight once again and it comes up pretty much every meeting that we have the legal advice and support that we need to make the best decisions possible.

1093
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:30,740
[SPEAKER_20]: on this and the other two proposals.

1094
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:54,847
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to motion that we schedule a public meeting of the ordinances and rules subcommittee and committee of the whole, um, per discretion of the council president to discuss these matters, and then that we also schedule a public hearing that is required by Chapter 43 B section 10 at our May 23rd regular meeting, and that will give enough time as notice is required for the city clerk to do the required notices for that.

1095
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:55,767
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's my proposal.

1096
01:21:56,627 --> 01:22:01,790
[SPEAKER_20]: two more meetings on this where we can collect more public feedback and then a public hearing on May 23rd.

1097
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:10,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Then pursuant to the discussion, if there are any amendments to these proposed amendments, any changes to these proposed amendments, that can happen in that public hearing.

1098
01:22:11,554 --> 01:22:17,137
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the Council and my fellow Councilors are at the discretion to vote on this, the process after that.

1099
01:22:17,217 --> 01:22:19,278
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll just go over this again, not to belabor the point,

1100
01:22:19,798 --> 01:22:30,102
[SPEAKER_20]: it would require a two thirds vote of the City Council, the assent of the mayor, submission to the state attorney general for review, and then it would be voted on by the voters in our November election.

1101
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:33,824
[SPEAKER_20]: So, again, this is not just something that we can do on our own.

1102
01:22:33,844 --> 01:22:48,250
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of pieces of the process, the ideas, and with my hope to have everybody on board so that we can move forward and make sure that this council and the people that elect these councilors have the powers that we need to do our jobs effectively.

1103
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,990
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

1104
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1105
01:22:51,011 --> 01:22:51,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1106
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:52,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you, Councilors.

1107
01:22:54,093 --> 01:23:10,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a direct correlation of the lack of partnership with the mayor's office and the situation where we are today with really being left in the dark and so many issues, but most important as this speaks to it,

1108
01:23:10,922 --> 01:23:17,328
[SPEAKER_06]: the lack of representation to assist us in making us, giving us the support that we need.

1109
01:23:17,988 --> 01:23:21,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people might say, well, why is this important?

1110
01:23:21,631 --> 01:23:26,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the important this piece is bringing back full circle is the meeting that we had that

1111
01:23:28,677 --> 01:23:55,550
[SPEAKER_06]: that we had no guidance and then were sued by BJ's and then went to court and now here we are now I believe that it's now the residents are coming after this council and that all stems from one simple issue and that's not having legal representation here so again and that that goes back to not having a working relationship with the mayor's office so I think that

1112
01:23:57,251 --> 01:24:25,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said last meeting, we'll belabor the process of the conversation again, but this is something that really, as a unit, I'll support the most part and look forward to putting this back in other elected officials' passwords of true transparency and letting the residents of our community vote to show us that

1113
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:33,104
[SPEAKER_06]: this is the process we need to go in because we really need to move the city in the right direction.

1114
01:24:33,124 --> 01:24:34,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this will help.

1115
01:24:34,564 --> 01:24:36,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President, I would second the motion.

1116
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:37,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1117
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:38,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1118
01:24:40,345 --> 01:24:41,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Morell.

1119
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:47,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we had a really interesting, thoughtful, deliberate conversation about this.

1120
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:51,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Recently, we discussed these proposals in Committee of the Whole.

1121
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,148
[SPEAKER_17]: As Vice President Bears outlined, we're going to have, you know,

1122
01:24:57,028 --> 01:25:02,892
[SPEAKER_17]: continuing opportunity for Councilor input for public input, as we discuss these proposals further.

1123
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:10,516
[SPEAKER_17]: But just to briefly reiterate, you know, some of what I said at our last meeting on this and some of what I heard my fellow Councilors say that really resonated with me.

1124
01:25:10,536 --> 01:25:14,439
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Councilors Scarpelli said this is a way to keep the council relevant.

1125
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,021
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that really sums it up, you know, these three proposals combined.

1126
01:25:19,702 --> 01:25:20,963
[SPEAKER_17]: We talk a lot about

1127
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:28,668
[SPEAKER_17]: our frustrations with not having the tools, the resources, the people that we need to function as a legislative body.

1128
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:36,493
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the politically easier thing to do would be to stay in that state and say, well, you know, we're doing all we can with what we have.

1129
01:25:37,073 --> 01:25:39,215
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a measure to say, actually, that's not good enough.

1130
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:43,778
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to make these specific amendments to the charter so that we actually do have what we need.

1131
01:25:44,258 --> 01:25:49,323
[SPEAKER_17]: so that we can do the work of representing our constituencies that we can do the work of legislating passing policies.

1132
01:25:49,764 --> 01:25:56,991
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that will free up a lot of this council's energy to be a complimentary working partner with the administration across the hall.

1133
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:02,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead of, you know, unfortunately being forced to expend a lot of energy, really trying to

1134
01:26:03,773 --> 01:26:06,536
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to have that co equal relationship.

1135
01:26:07,216 --> 01:26:18,506
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think that we, it's better to enshrine in policy in the charter, a way to have the powers that our constituents need us to have in order to do our work.

1136
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:22,650
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not just like I said last week, that's not just for this term, it's not just for this body.

1137
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:27,595
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a way of saying to the community of Medford, you deserve to have a city council that is functional,

1138
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:34,877
[SPEAKER_17]: No matter the, the climate inside this building no matter the political weather, this council is always going to be empowered to be working for you.

1139
01:26:35,518 --> 01:26:38,199
[SPEAKER_17]: So I look forward to discussing this further and I'll certainly be supporting this tonight.

1140
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1141
01:26:43,268 --> 01:26:43,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1142
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:58,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I again, I had more thorough comments at our committee the whole meeting last week so I don't want to go spend too much time going into detail but I think, regardless of how you view the city council the mayor any of us as individuals on the city council this.

1143
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:03,803
[SPEAKER_01]: These are charter amendments are particularly exciting for all residents of the city.

1144
01:27:06,025 --> 01:27:07,726
[SPEAKER_01]: how we want our city to function.

1145
01:27:08,707 --> 01:27:24,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's top of mind for a lot of people is having a more transparent, more open, more collaborative, more democratic way of governance in the city where we are partners with each other and we work with the folks across the hall from us.

1146
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:31,219
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are times where that relationship is fraught and times where that relationship isn't.

1147
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:44,772
[SPEAKER_01]: But what these, underscoring what Councilor Collins said, what these charter amendments help us do is it sets that foundation and puts it into place that we will be partners and that we will work with each other.

1148
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:49,016
[SPEAKER_01]: It empowers us as a council to do the job that voters expect us to do.

1149
01:27:50,457 --> 01:28:08,244
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I think there's always a shock when you talk to voters, their residents, and, you know, we describe what we have to do research-wise, what the lack of support and staff that we have as a city council, the lack of ability that we have to hold everyone accountable as well.

1150
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:13,165
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all basic functions of government that residents expect of all of us.

1151
01:28:14,406 --> 01:28:19,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And these charter amendments empower us to serve the people the way that they expect

1152
01:28:20,308 --> 01:28:21,069
[SPEAKER_01]: us to serve them.

1153
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:23,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just add on to that.

1154
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:28,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited to solicit more public feedback on it.

1155
01:28:28,974 --> 01:28:34,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank Councilor Bears for building that into this plan for the charter amendments as well.

1156
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:36,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1157
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1158
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:40,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

1159
01:28:40,262 --> 01:28:44,685
[SPEAKER_21]: So these are tools that other city councils in the past have had.

1160
01:28:45,306 --> 01:28:49,589
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a shame that we have to actually make an ordinance to get

1161
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:55,361
[SPEAKER_21]: these things in place, especially with the legal counsel.

1162
01:28:55,621 --> 01:29:00,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions came up tonight and said that we didn't have counsel, but I plan to support this wholeheartedly.

1163
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:08,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Part of this is, as Councilor Collins said, people hold us to a standard.

1164
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:22,218
[SPEAKER_21]: And right now, the standard that people hold us to, we're not able to obtain right now under this administration that just has made this council irrelevant over the last three years.

1165
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:24,580
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will be supporting this 100% this evening.

1166
01:29:25,521 --> 01:29:25,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1167
01:29:27,183 --> 01:29:28,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

1168
01:29:30,146 --> 01:29:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Any members of the public who wish to speak?

1169
01:29:33,642 --> 01:29:56,550
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have a motion from vice president bears to send this to the ordinance and rule subcommittee second by it's a it's sorry to be more detailed about the motion that maybe is necessary, but it would be to schedule public meetings of the ordinances and rule subcommittee and the committee of the whole on this topic and to hold a public hearing on at our May 23rd regular meeting as required by Chapter 43 B section 10.

1170
01:29:58,115 --> 01:30:01,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, voted out of your subcommittee to get it.

1171
01:30:01,999 --> 01:30:07,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the way this is going, it's technically that there will be, it's not going to ordinances and rules subcommittee per se.

1172
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:12,308
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that the ordinances rules subcommittee could have a public meeting to request public feedback on it.

1173
01:30:12,688 --> 01:30:15,731
[SPEAKER_20]: The amendments would actually by law have to happen at that public hearing.

1174
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:24,059
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess in some sense, the papers never chapter 43 B section 10 authorizes the city council to authorize a committee to hold meeting on the matter.

1175
01:30:25,065 --> 01:30:33,734
[SPEAKER_20]: But the decisions have to happen at the public hearing so it's just different than anything we normally do because it's a specific process outlined by constitutional amendment and then it's enabling legislation.

1176
01:30:34,234 --> 01:30:36,236
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why I'm proposing the amendment the way I'm proposing it.

1177
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:36,937
Okay.

1178
01:30:37,657 --> 01:30:43,823
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to vote it out that'd be great though, just okay yeah we'll definitely vote to at the subcommittee to make sure it goes back to the council.

1179
01:30:43,843 --> 01:30:43,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1180
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:45,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, thank you.

1181
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:48,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for our processes I understand processes which is for our processes.

1182
01:30:49,610 --> 01:31:02,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have that language Mr. Clerk, I just want to clarify, so you want to, you want to hold public meetings of the ordinances rules subcommittee and public meeting of the committee the whole and then a public hearing on May 23, at the council meeting, as a council's regular meeting.

1183
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:02,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1184
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:03,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1185
01:31:05,184 --> 01:31:08,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of ice is a bear second by Councilor probably Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1186
01:31:14,348 --> 01:31:14,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Bears.

1187
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:15,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1188
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:15,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1189
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:15,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1190
01:31:27,902 --> 01:31:30,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

1191
01:31:31,724 --> 01:31:52,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Q3-098 offered by Vice President Bears, be it ordered that under the provisions of Chapter 43B of the Massachusetts General Laws, including Sections 10 and 19 of said chapter, Article 89 of the Massachusetts Constitution and any other applicable provisions of law, Councilor Isaac V. Zach Bears proposes by written request to the City Clerk of the City of Medford the following amendments to the Charter of the City of Medford outlined in the Acts of 1986, Chapter 605,

1192
01:31:54,735 --> 01:32:14,438
[SPEAKER_04]: and submit such amendment for approval by the voters of the city of Medford section 59 creation and approval of the municipal budget, generally the mayor and city council of the city of Medford shall hold budgetary powers together with the power to modify in a whole or in part an appropriation order or an item with an appropriation order clarify budgetary procedure and procedures

1193
01:32:15,019 --> 01:32:24,603
[SPEAKER_04]: and take such other actions as are necessary to amend, approve or disapprove the annual budget for the city, accepting the powers to originate and appropriate appropriation order which shall be reserved for the mayor.

1194
01:32:25,564 --> 01:32:36,589
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor not later than the second Wednesday in May of each year shall submit to the city council the annual budget of the current expenses of the city for the forthcoming fiscal year and the mayor may submit therein after such

1195
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:51,908
[SPEAKER_04]: supplementary appropriation orders as they may be necessary, not later than the second Wednesday in June because the council shall take definite action on the annual budget by adopting amending or rejecting it, provided that the amended version shall not be for a higher total budget than originally proposed.

1196
01:32:52,466 --> 01:33:03,072
[SPEAKER_04]: In the event of their failure to act on a budget submitted by the mayor, the items and the appropriation orders in the budget as recommended by the mayor shall be in effect as if formally adopted by the city council and approved by the mayor.

1197
01:33:03,653 --> 01:33:11,357
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor shall have seven days from the time of a budgetary vote of the council to approve or return said budget to the council.

1198
01:33:11,898 --> 01:33:17,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the event of the failure of the mayor to act on the budget approved by the council, the budget shall be in effect as approved by the council.

1199
01:33:19,422 --> 01:33:32,410
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor may modify a budget approved by the council by returning it to said council with amendments to any line item provided that a two thirds vote of the council shall be sufficient to override any budgetary amendments in whole or in part or an overall budgetary veto by the mayor.

1200
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:46,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It shall be the duty of the city officials when requested by the mayor to submit to the mayor forthwith in such detail as the mayor may require estimates for the next fiscal year of the expenditures of the department or office under their charge which estimates shall be transmitted to the city council provided however

1201
01:33:47,178 --> 01:34:02,084
[SPEAKER_04]: that the mayor shall neither submit nor thereafter reduce the appropriations for the city council at or to a level below that which existed for the previous fiscal year, nor shall the city council reduce the appropriations for the mayor's office below that which existed for the previous fiscal year, Vice President Bears.

1202
01:34:03,546 --> 01:34:04,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1203
01:34:04,547 --> 01:34:15,195
[SPEAKER_20]: If it wasn't an amendment to the City Charter, I would have motioned to not read it, but I think as it's a proposed amendment to the City Charter, it needs to be read at least once in full.

1204
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:16,376
[SPEAKER_20]: All in one breath.

1205
01:34:16,396 --> 01:34:20,039
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, you know, amazing, amazing present.

1206
01:34:20,059 --> 01:34:20,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's funny.

1207
01:34:24,843 --> 01:34:32,169
[SPEAKER_20]: I would move the same motion that I made on the previous paper to schedule the public meetings and then hold a public hearing on May 23rd at our regular meeting.

1208
01:34:32,478 --> 01:34:32,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1209
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a second motion for Vice Mayor second from Councilor Scarpelli.

1210
01:34:36,542 --> 01:34:40,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion from the council on this specific amendment?

1211
01:34:41,641 --> 01:34:41,701
[SPEAKER_11]: you.

1212
01:34:41,721 --> 01:34:42,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1213
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:42,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1214
01:34:42,402 --> 01:34:43,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1215
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:45,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Council night as the dissenting vote.

1216
01:34:45,544 --> 01:34:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel so.

1217
01:34:46,064 --> 01:34:49,007
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my obligation to explain where I come from.

1218
01:34:49,087 --> 01:34:53,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Why when voting against these amendments to, uh, these.

1219
01:34:54,751 --> 01:34:57,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Resolutions to move to amend that city job.

1220
01:34:58,394 --> 01:35:01,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Um from day one in my election to the City Council.

1221
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:05,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always felt that the best path to try to change was through the time tested

1222
01:35:10,976 --> 01:35:12,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't support an abbreviated review.

1223
01:35:13,297 --> 01:35:18,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And I truly questioned whether or not people in power trying to expand their own power was the best course.

1224
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:30,623
[SPEAKER_11]: And looking at the papers before us this evening, or the series of papers that are before us this evening, we still have the elephant in the room to deal with the fact that we have zero legal counsel at all to provide us with any support.

1225
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:34,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The constitution of this community is the charter.

1226
01:35:34,905 --> 01:35:37,386
[SPEAKER_11]: And for us to move forward in haste without legal counsel

1227
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:46,359
[SPEAKER_11]: providing advice, consent and direction, I think is something that we need to review with great caution and handle with kids gloves.

1228
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So for those reasons and those reasons alone, I will be voting against this paper this evening.

1229
01:35:51,945 --> 01:35:56,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Since my election to the city council, there's always been some small

1230
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:01,391
[SPEAKER_11]: movement in this community to review or amend the charter.

1231
01:36:02,092 --> 01:36:16,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's been small minority groups that have moved to try to collect the signatures to do such, and they have been able to do so, which tells me that there is a lack of interest in addressing the charter in this community by the general populace.

1232
01:36:17,697 --> 01:36:21,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that reason as well, I will be voting against this paper soon.

1233
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:23,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank the Councilor for the work that he's done.

1234
01:36:23,299 --> 01:36:24,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate his initiative.

1235
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,980
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you got to start somewhere.

1236
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:33,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you know, it's almost what came first, the chicken or the egg.

1237
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:34,042
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?

1238
01:36:34,062 --> 01:36:35,343
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the tools to address this.

1239
01:36:36,143 --> 01:36:46,267
[SPEAKER_11]: and he's put in the paper for this, trying to give us the tools, but it's really a philosophical and theoretical discussion as to how it feels the government should work and what's best practice for good government.

1240
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:49,169
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's for that reason that I'll be voting against it this evening.

1241
01:36:50,189 --> 01:36:50,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1242
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the Council?

1243
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:55,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

1244
01:36:55,211 --> 01:36:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Sharon D'Eso.

1245
01:36:58,933 --> 01:37:03,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1246
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1247
01:37:09,854 --> 01:37:15,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm supporting Councilor Knight and any people in the public who are listening to this.

1248
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:22,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Several years ago, maybe even shorter, there was a group of us who were very concerned about the charter.

1249
01:37:22,743 --> 01:37:33,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that we sought any direct criticism, not that we were after any individuals, but because I think our charter had not been reviewed for about 36 or 37 years.

1250
01:37:34,351 --> 01:37:36,112
[SPEAKER_15]: We're really faltering behind.

1251
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:43,727
[SPEAKER_15]: progress in review in comparison to other surrounding towns.

1252
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:54,390
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of councilmen now who are still present, like Mr. Schiappelli, Adam Knight, and Councilor Caraviello, who can attest to a lot of public participation.

1253
01:37:54,930 --> 01:38:02,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have in my home hundreds and hundreds of signatures because it still got stalemated at the State House.

1254
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:08,625
[SPEAKER_15]: I firmly believe that this should go even beyond a public hearing.

1255
01:38:09,526 --> 01:38:13,928
[SPEAKER_15]: That still leaves it in the hands of and direction of the city council.

1256
01:38:14,428 --> 01:38:23,792
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be seeking ways that the public will definitely be participating in this, in revitalizing these issues.

1257
01:38:24,092 --> 01:38:25,253
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank you all.

1258
01:38:25,693 --> 01:38:46,426
[SPEAKER_15]: for going in the favor of charter review anyway, but to leave it in the hands of different groups, et cetera, where you can just override us and make your own amendments to the charter, I don't know quite if that is even legal, but I do really appreciate, along with others, any attention that's given to these movements.

1259
01:38:47,267 --> 01:38:50,689
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope to get back on with a couple of pieces of information later tonight.

1260
01:38:51,089 --> 01:38:52,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you and a happy spring to all.

1261
01:38:53,191 --> 01:38:54,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

1262
01:38:56,018 --> 01:38:58,279
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, and then we'll go to Vice President Bears.

1263
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:02,982
[SPEAKER_17]: I was probably going to reiterate the point that Vice President Bears made.

1264
01:39:03,223 --> 01:39:04,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, and feel free, Councilor Collins.

1265
01:39:04,964 --> 01:39:15,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just going to say that, yes, there'd be a public hearing, but then it would need to be approved by the mayor, reviewed by the state attorney general, and then voted on by the voters on the ballot as a ballot question.

1266
01:39:16,051 --> 01:39:20,854
[SPEAKER_20]: So it wouldn't just be the city council saying, this is what it is.

1267
01:39:20,874 --> 01:39:22,535
[SPEAKER_20]: That certainly is not how the law works.

1268
01:39:22,575 --> 01:39:24,596
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be the voters of the city approving a change.

1269
01:39:25,277 --> 01:39:30,640
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to also add that this is not charter review.

1270
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,962
[SPEAKER_20]: These are specific amendments to address specific problems that we've seen.

1271
01:39:34,602 --> 01:39:37,844
[SPEAKER_20]: There are portions of charters that exist in many other communities.

1272
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:42,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Charter review, which would look at everything, would look at ward representation, would look at

1273
01:39:43,307 --> 01:39:48,690
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, a bunch of other things that would potentially write a completely new charter compared to the charter that we have now.

1274
01:39:49,131 --> 01:39:50,351
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a separate process.

1275
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:53,253
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the thing you can get signatures to collect for.

1276
01:39:54,554 --> 01:39:58,756
[SPEAKER_20]: That's where you can have a home rule petition at the State House to do a comprehensive review.

1277
01:39:59,396 --> 01:40:06,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the things that people talk about when they talk about charter review, you can't even do through this amendment process, which is very specific to the balance of powers.

1278
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:09,742
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't change mode of election, terms of election,

1279
01:40:11,523 --> 01:40:14,405
[SPEAKER_20]: or the districts that people are elected from.

1280
01:40:14,505 --> 01:40:17,928
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is much more targeted than a comprehensive charter review.

1281
01:40:17,988 --> 01:40:30,277
[SPEAKER_20]: This is saying very specifically, we have seen what a disempowered council looks like, and that the council by charter does not have the powers that it needs to assert its authority as an independent branch of

1282
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:35,781
[SPEAKER_20]: the city government as to address the separation of powers, and this is specifically targeted at that.

1283
01:40:36,621 --> 01:40:41,284
[SPEAKER_20]: These amendments wouldn't even give the city council unilateral discretion on any of this anyway.

1284
01:40:41,304 --> 01:40:44,287
[SPEAKER_20]: It would just give us an equal share of voice in these questions.

1285
01:40:44,407 --> 01:40:47,589
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for the comments, and I appreciate it.

1286
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:57,936
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope folks will come to public meetings and voice that, and we can do the education work, and we can also consider what voters are saying and residents are saying about these amendments over the next few weeks.

1287
01:40:58,937 --> 01:40:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1288
01:41:00,707 --> 01:41:01,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1289
01:41:02,068 --> 01:41:02,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1290
01:41:02,668 --> 01:41:13,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Though I agree with Councilor Lateef, what he says, I agree that is the road to go, but this council has been forced into a corner now, and this is the reason for this.

1291
01:41:14,036 --> 01:41:15,096
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to make that clear.

1292
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:17,358
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not something that we just come up with out of the sky.

1293
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:22,601
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been back, we've been forced into this situation that we're in now.

1294
01:41:23,842 --> 01:41:24,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1295
01:41:25,523 --> 01:41:26,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

1296
01:41:28,135 --> 01:41:30,618
[SPEAKER_04]: me for their comments from members of the public.

1297
01:41:31,659 --> 01:41:35,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion from President Bears sector by Councilor Scarpelli.

1298
01:41:36,184 --> 01:41:37,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1299
01:41:38,346 --> 01:41:38,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1300
01:41:38,527 --> 01:41:38,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1301
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

1302
01:41:55,929 --> 01:42:12,538
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-099, offered by Vice President Bears, be it ordered that under the provisions of Chapter 43B of the Medford, I'm sorry, Medford, Massachusetts General Laws, including Sections 10 and 19 of said chapter, Article 89 of the Massachusetts Constitution and any other applicable provision of law, Councilor Isaac B. Zach Bears,

1303
01:42:13,538 --> 01:42:26,855
[SPEAKER_04]: proposes by written request the city council of the city of Medford the following amendments to the charter of the city of Medford outlined in the acts of 1986 chapter 605, which would have been the existing title and existing text of the first paragraph of the acts of 1986 chapter 605 section one, three,

1304
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: and submit such amendment for approval by the voters of the city of Medford section 52 appointments by the mayor.

1305
01:42:35,745 --> 01:42:52,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally the mayor shall appoint subject to confirmation by the city council by majority vote all members of municipal boards committees and commissions except the school committee officials appointed by the governor and assessors if elected by vote of the people for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the city ordinance or general laws.

1306
01:42:54,009 --> 01:42:59,279
[SPEAKER_04]: All members of municipal boards, committees, and commissions shall serve terms as defined by city ordinance or general laws.

1307
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,367
[SPEAKER_04]: All heads of the department shall be appointed by the mayor without confirmation by the city council.

1308
01:43:03,827 --> 01:43:11,292
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor shall refer to the city council and simultaneously file with the city clerk the name of each person the mayor desires to appoint as a member of the board committee or commission.

1309
01:43:11,772 --> 01:43:19,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council shall have 45 days after the date on which notice of the proposed appointment was filed with the city clerk to vote to approve or reject the appointment.

1310
01:43:19,797 --> 01:43:25,741
[SPEAKER_04]: If the city council does not approve or reject the appointment within 45 days, it may file a 15 day extension with the city clerk.

1311
01:43:27,158 --> 01:43:31,301
[SPEAKER_04]: If the time period elapses and no extension has been filed, the appointment shall be deemed approved.

1312
01:43:31,682 --> 01:43:40,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of the boards, committees, and commissions may be removed at the discretion of the appointing authority subject to limitations and requirements imposed by federal and state laws, rules, and or regulations.

1313
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:42,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1314
01:43:43,512 --> 01:43:45,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President, for reading that out loud.

1315
01:43:46,134 --> 01:43:47,655
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate your deference on these.

1316
01:43:47,715 --> 01:43:51,218
[SPEAKER_20]: This one is the final of the three amendments that would actually amend

1317
01:43:51,755 --> 01:43:59,219
[SPEAKER_20]: our existing charter regarding appointments by the mayor to require city council approval of municipal boards, committees, and commissions.

1318
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:05,481
[SPEAKER_20]: The rest of the language, there's some language in here that remains from the existing charter.

1319
01:44:05,742 --> 01:44:21,189
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, obviously this would not apply to the school committee or officials appointed by the governor or assessors if elected by the vote of the people, as well as it would not apply to heads of departments, which is what our current charter says, but it would apply to members of boards, committees, and commissions created by ordinance of the city of Medford.

1320
01:44:22,181 --> 01:44:27,804
[SPEAKER_20]: and I would follow the same motion to hold these public meetings and hold a public hearing at our May 23rd regular meeting.

1321
01:44:28,265 --> 01:44:30,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1322
01:44:30,406 --> 01:44:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council on this paper?

1323
01:44:35,589 --> 01:44:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

1324
01:44:40,252 --> 01:44:44,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1325
01:44:44,394 --> 01:44:45,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1326
01:44:47,296 --> 01:44:48,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Bears.

1327
01:44:48,817 --> 01:44:48,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1328
01:44:51,078 --> 01:44:51,839
Yes.

1329
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:52,279
Yes.

1330
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:57,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven, sorry six in the affirmative one in the negative.

1331
01:44:57,326 --> 01:44:59,909
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

1332
01:45:06,477 --> 01:45:08,598
[SPEAKER_04]: T3-100 offered by Councilor Tseng.

1333
01:45:09,018 --> 01:45:18,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas students at Tufts University have noted that the sidewalk on the school side at the College Ave and Boston Ave intersection is experiencing overcrowding at class change times as students are walking in the street itself.

1334
01:45:18,603 --> 01:45:24,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Being resolved, the City Council asked the Department of Public Works to explore solutions to this problem and collaborate with Tufts University where needed.

1335
01:45:25,127 --> 01:45:25,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

1336
01:45:26,539 --> 01:45:27,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Morell.

1337
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:50,517
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of students wrote to me and I also had a chance to talk to a bunch of students at a town hall type meeting at Tufts a few weeks ago where they brought to my attention that during the class change periods, between periods of different classes, a bunch of students are walking on the road because the sidewalk is too crowded.

1338
01:45:50,857 --> 01:45:54,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And they asked me if we could explore any solutions such as holding

1339
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,363
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a red light just a little, just a little bit longer.

1340
01:45:57,383 --> 01:46:10,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I mean, I'm not a traffic genius, I don't know the solutions to this problem but I thought it would be good for them for me to flag it for us as a council to flag it for the DPW.

1341
01:46:10,615 --> 01:46:12,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Todd Lake

1342
01:46:13,778 --> 01:46:23,466
[SPEAKER_01]: did write to me and we've been communicating about this recently, and he let me know that there's still some work to be done at that intersection that's been scheduled.

1343
01:46:24,406 --> 01:46:30,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially what we're waiting for right now is for the MBTA, the Green Line Extension,

1344
01:46:32,292 --> 01:46:35,196
[SPEAKER_01]: to finish up some repairs improvements that they owe us as a city.

1345
01:46:35,897 --> 01:46:43,105
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an approved pavement marking plan that has yet to be implemented that repaints and realign some things.

1346
01:46:43,386 --> 01:46:49,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So, essentially, what might be best is for us to see how that plan works, but he did.

1347
01:46:50,514 --> 01:47:07,367
[SPEAKER_01]: He did let me know that the DPW will keep an eye on that intersection, and that there are a lot of competing interests for road space there, and the job, which makes things even more difficult, but that he in the department would explore different solutions.

1348
01:47:10,169 --> 01:47:10,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1349
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:13,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1350
01:47:13,841 --> 01:47:21,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just thinking for, you know, this is a great school right I mean it's one of the most prestigious universities around you think these kids might not had across the street.

1351
01:47:21,666 --> 01:47:28,230
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but with that being said, maybe we can we can ask our friends up at Tufts University to.

1352
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:31,612
[SPEAKER_11]: have a class called look both ways before crossing the street.

1353
01:47:32,073 --> 01:47:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do commend the gentleman for putting the paper forward.

1354
01:47:35,595 --> 01:47:39,559
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, there has to also be some personal responsibility, I think, when it comes to pedestrian safety.

1355
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I think this is one of the perfect examples thereof.

1356
01:47:43,942 --> 01:47:45,843
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I'll support the paper this evening.

1357
01:47:45,863 --> 01:47:49,306
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think this is certainly a priority of the Council.

1358
01:47:50,747 --> 01:47:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1359
01:47:51,388 --> 01:47:52,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the Council?

1360
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by

1361
01:47:59,528 --> 01:48:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1362
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:04,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1363
01:48:05,031 --> 01:48:05,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1364
01:48:05,191 --> 01:48:05,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1365
01:48:20,237 --> 01:48:33,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in front of zero that I get the motion passes to three dash to a one offered by cancer saying, be it so resolved that the city council asked the city administration for prioritization and updates on the resurfacing of slash fixing of potholes on Riverside have comes are saying.

1366
01:48:34,888 --> 01:48:35,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you President Morell.

1367
01:48:35,769 --> 01:48:46,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had written this resolution up a while ago before Commissioner McGivern posted on Facebook a response to a similar question.

1368
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Riverside Avenue is a very heavily trafficked street in our city and I think we all know how awful the state of that road is.

1369
01:48:56,985 --> 01:49:03,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time in Wellington visiting my parents, and every time I have to get over there, it's like you're riding a roller coaster.

1370
01:49:03,509 --> 01:49:05,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not good for anyone.

1371
01:49:06,011 --> 01:49:11,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of residents in that neighborhood think it's a sign of being overlooked.

1372
01:49:11,855 --> 01:49:23,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important for us as a city council and as a local government to say, no, every single street is important, every neighborhood is important, and we have a plan for that street.

1373
01:49:23,842 --> 01:49:34,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Tim McGivern did get back to me on this, and he told me that there are plans to resurface that road this season.

1374
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:42,917
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a pavement valuation a couple of years ago, and they've been hard at work prioritizing and coordinating work there.

1375
01:49:43,397 --> 01:49:48,561
[SPEAKER_01]: They've started a crack sealing program, a box out patching program, and more programs.

1376
01:49:50,613 --> 01:50:07,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, they're going to plan to resurface as much as the budget allows, but part of the problem that we're facing here is that the evaluation that our city received was that we should be spending at least $3.5 million in resurfacing roads every year.

1377
01:50:08,707 --> 01:50:15,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for the past in for, um, for many decades, we've only been spending, uh, less than $1 million.

1378
01:50:15,974 --> 01:50:22,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of, um, a lot of work that we'll have to do to catch up in terms of our repairs.

1379
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:33,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he did ask me to convey to people watching this meeting, um, to ask our state reps to advocate for more chapter 90 funding, which is the primary source

1380
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:39,233
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use as municipalities to maintain our roadways and improve our roadways.

1381
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:49,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did ask that if anyone did have any more specific questions about Riverside Ave to contact him, to email him or to call him.

1382
01:50:50,778 --> 01:50:55,201
[SPEAKER_01]: He did tell me also that they have put this out to bid.

1383
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:59,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's hopeful that this can get done this year.

1384
01:51:01,464 --> 01:51:02,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Councilor Tseng.

1385
01:51:02,723 --> 01:51:09,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, on that, I just ask that any work that we do related to Riverside Avenue be coordinated with the MWRA and National Grid.

1386
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:19,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If we think back, we had an opportunity to resurface Riverside Avenue for a significant stretch, I believe, from Freedom Way going up towards

1387
01:51:20,954 --> 01:51:22,936
[SPEAKER_11]: a narrow bread for lack of a better explanation.

1388
01:51:23,517 --> 01:51:28,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And the council was looking for some additional concessions curb stones and stuff like that.

1389
01:51:29,643 --> 01:51:40,595
[SPEAKER_11]: But ultimately, the MWRA and National Grid had a project that would have provided curb to curb resurfacing to that stretch of certain stretch of Riverside Avenue that was in significant need of disrepair for payout.

1390
01:51:41,392 --> 01:51:45,595
[SPEAKER_11]: the city council request that the administration move forward and resurface that roadway.

1391
01:51:46,195 --> 01:51:51,058
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll put us in a position where we'd have the five year moratorium placed on the road, and it wouldn't be able to be open.

1392
01:51:51,138 --> 01:51:57,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So we put ourselves in a situation where we had public utilities that were willing to resurface the roadway for free.

1393
01:51:57,562 --> 01:52:03,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're doing it, we're paying for it, and we're locking it up for five years and preventing them from doing their underground infrastructure improvements.

1394
01:52:03,806 --> 01:52:09,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I just ask that the city engineer be provided with this information as well as Mr. Lasky over at the MWRA.

1395
01:52:10,372 --> 01:52:11,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to make that as an amendment?

1396
01:52:12,033 --> 01:52:12,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

1397
01:52:12,933 --> 01:52:13,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1398
01:52:13,453 --> 01:52:14,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1399
01:52:15,334 --> 01:52:16,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Morell.

1400
01:52:16,214 --> 01:52:18,395
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate Councilor Tseng putting this forward.

1401
01:52:18,996 --> 01:52:38,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that this is, you know, for the community, probably one of the better examples, you know, simplest examples that we have about our backlog of capital needs in the community, you know, just demonstrating when we defer maintenance over the cost of, over the length of, in this case, you know, 30 to 40 years, that maintenance over time gets more expensive because we can't

1402
01:52:39,924 --> 01:52:50,568
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not paying to prevent or stop the damages that are currently occurring, let alone the ones that we can already, you know, see and observe and that people are reporting on see click fix all the time.

1403
01:52:51,048 --> 01:52:56,930
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that our engineering department is well aware of the scope of the problem they're doing all that we can I think that it, you know, demonstrates

1404
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:10,153
[SPEAKER_17]: the need to be finding cheaper ways to resurface these roads where we can like Councilor Knight said, and it also demonstrates the strong need to figure out how can we start paying for this more quickly so that these needs for repairs are not mounting.

1405
01:53:10,973 --> 01:53:13,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're just continually continually playing catch up.

1406
01:53:13,634 --> 01:53:19,215
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also want to note I've had a lot of friends of mine who are also cyclists specifically complain about Riverside, which is

1407
01:53:19,835 --> 01:53:26,298
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, because the pothole situation, basically unbreakable so I just want to throw that in there to let cyclists know everybody is going.

1408
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:31,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody is walking around frustrated because of the road situation in Medford, and you know, cyclists are as well.

1409
01:53:32,141 --> 01:53:32,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1410
01:53:32,902 --> 01:53:33,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1411
01:53:33,462 --> 01:53:40,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President, probably the number one concern that I have and everybody streets streets streets is out the poor condition.

1412
01:53:41,601 --> 01:53:45,942
[SPEAKER_21]: You're afraid to drive your bicycle down the streets, try driving your car down the street.

1413
01:53:45,962 --> 01:53:49,483
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Councilor Lighthouse, he's blown on in his car.

1414
01:53:50,083 --> 01:53:51,383
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah.

1415
01:53:52,324 --> 01:53:58,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so like I say, forget about the bikes, you drive your car down the street, you take your life in your hands.

1416
01:53:58,845 --> 01:54:03,706
[SPEAKER_21]: That seems to be the biggest concern everybody, is the lack of paving on the streets.

1417
01:54:04,346 --> 01:54:08,927
[SPEAKER_21]: We're probably spending millions of dollars a year just patching our streets, never mind fixing them.

1418
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:11,088
[SPEAKER_21]: We're still waiting on a plan

1419
01:54:12,349 --> 01:54:16,732
[SPEAKER_21]: for the streets that are supposedly going to be paved somewhere in the near future.

1420
01:54:17,452 --> 01:54:26,339
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would like the mayor to probably within the next couple of meetings to submit the plan on what streets are going to be paved and where is the paving program.

1421
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:28,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1422
01:54:30,201 --> 01:54:36,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1423
01:54:36,946 --> 01:54:37,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1424
01:54:43,417 --> 01:54:43,577

Yes.

1428
01:54:47,379 --> 01:54:47,580
Yes.

1429
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:47,760
Yes.

1430
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,000
Yes.

1431
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:48,360
Yes.

1432
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:49,140
Yes.

1433
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:49,521
Yes.

1434
01:54:49,601 --> 01:54:49,821
Yes.

1435
01:54:50,581 --> 01:54:50,721
Yes.

1436
01:54:50,741 --> 01:54:50,821
Yes.

1437
01:54:50,901 --> 01:54:51,041
Yes.

1438
01:54:51,242 --> 01:54:51,502
Yes.

1439
01:54:51,902 --> 01:54:52,122
Yes.

1440
01:54:52,182 --> 01:54:52,342
Yes.

1441
01:54:52,402 --> 01:54:52,602
Yes.

1442
01:54:52,782 --> 01:54:53,023
Yes.

1443
01:55:10,715 --> 01:55:11,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1444
01:55:11,135 --> 01:55:28,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so this this resolution comes from talking to a lot of, particularly on Spanish and Creole speaking, I'm residents who find it particularly intimidating to go to City Hall because they find it a little confusing to find which office to go to where to navigate.

1445
01:55:29,384 --> 01:55:34,767
[SPEAKER_01]: As we keep talking about the beautification of City Hall I think this is something to keep in mind, obviously we can't

1446
01:55:35,287 --> 01:55:38,189
[SPEAKER_01]: translate into every single language spoken in our community.

1447
01:55:38,709 --> 01:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we can make more of an effort as a city to translate to the most commonly spoken languages.

1448
01:55:45,514 --> 01:55:55,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to have the basic, even a basic guide at the door or a small sign to translate the word, which number of room numbers offices are in that would be helpful.

1449
01:55:57,122 --> 01:55:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1450
01:55:59,063 --> 01:56:00,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other members of the council wish to speak?

1451
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1452
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:08,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1453
01:56:11,282 --> 01:56:17,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes.

1454
01:56:17,827 --> 01:56:19,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications from the mayor 23-283.

1455
01:56:29,776 --> 01:56:35,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendment to the revised ordinances entitled personnel article two.

1456
01:56:42,248 --> 01:57:09,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Classification and compensation plan section 66 dash 33 entitled officers and employees, non union by adopting the following change amendment a, the language of calf 19 shall be amended to include the following position human resources director, respectfully committed, submitted analog current motion of the paper ruled out of order Madam President on 321 23 this council disposed of a very similar paper the city council rules clearly indicated the council disposes of a paper a paper of similar matter cannot be reintroduced for 90 days.

1457
01:57:12,255 --> 01:57:17,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion rule I have to look at the past paper.

1458
01:57:26,268 --> 01:57:30,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I do know that I was trying to look at the past paper you're actually right that rule does exist.

1459
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:57,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is this is what the rule states.

1460
01:57:57,993 --> 01:58:00,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that would be so 90 days.

1461
01:58:00,454 --> 01:58:03,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So 90 days since it was disposed of.

1462
01:58:09,421 --> 01:58:10,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1463
01:58:11,002 --> 01:58:13,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be possible for the city council to take the rules out of order?

1464
01:58:16,406 --> 01:58:17,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone would have to make that motion.

1465
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:24,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I rule that the paper, yes, I would rule that the paper is out of order based on the city council rules.

1466
01:58:30,115 --> 01:58:33,677
[SPEAKER_04]: The language of the past paper, it was, I mean, it was introduced so long ago.

1467
01:58:41,862 --> 01:58:42,482
[SPEAKER_08]: One moment.

1468
01:59:02,205 --> 01:59:03,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it gets me to it.

1469
01:59:04,507 --> 01:59:12,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, Madam President, what it was, was a paper that was going to create a CAF 19 for the human resource directors position as well as other positions.

1470
01:59:12,173 --> 01:59:21,300
[SPEAKER_11]: But that position was included in the paper and that is a same or similar paper that has been rejected by this body and therefore is barred from introduction.

1471
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:30,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was, it was taken off the table though to, I need to, I don't have the minutes in front of me to receive them.

1472
01:59:31,945 --> 01:59:37,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It was taken off the table to be disposed of that it was disposed of and then it was reintroduced less than 90 days.

1473
01:59:39,351 --> 01:59:41,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So the council voted on it saying goodbye.

1474
01:59:42,053 --> 01:59:45,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the mayor brought it back, but the mayor brought it back before the cooling off period.

1475
01:59:57,467 --> 01:59:59,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have rules, but we don't need them, right?

1476
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:01,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could just throw them out.

1477
02:00:01,989 --> 02:00:10,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, the rules are put in place is check and balance, you know, be sure that we stay honest and transparent.

1478
02:00:12,815 --> 02:00:13,255
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're right.

1479
02:00:13,275 --> 02:00:14,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to real time.

1480
02:00:26,675 --> 02:00:30,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to motion for a brief recess, but I'm also fine.

1481
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion for a five minute recess.

1482
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:38,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1483
02:00:41,222 --> 02:00:47,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, I'm happy to make a couple of comments that may be helpful to the council in considering whether they wish to take this out of order or not.

1484
02:00:49,346 --> 02:00:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the ruling that has been disposed of in the paper would be

1485
02:00:57,248 --> 02:00:59,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Not able to speak on.

1486
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:02,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Clarification Madam President, so ultimately the paper was introduced this evening.

1487
02:01:03,333 --> 02:01:05,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I made a motion to have the paper ruled out of order.

1488
02:01:05,094 --> 02:01:07,456
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper was ruled out of order and now we're still talking about it.

1489
02:01:07,476 --> 02:01:08,697
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper's been ruled out of order.

1490
02:01:08,737 --> 02:01:10,499
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time to move on.

1491
02:01:11,299 --> 02:01:14,081
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct and I just want to look.

1492
02:01:14,702 --> 02:01:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to affirm with our rules.

1493
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:24,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just.

1494
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:40,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to look at the rules just, I want to make sure that this is disposed of and not, we asked you to come up with this before, things that failed as opposed to being received in place on file.

1495
02:01:44,069 --> 02:01:46,209
[SPEAKER_20]: What was the initial paper number?

1496
02:01:46,729 --> 02:01:49,710
[SPEAKER_04]: The initial paper was introduced like a very long time ago.

1497
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:53,051
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was, was it 21631?

1498
02:01:53,131 --> 02:01:54,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to figure that out.

1499
02:01:54,675 --> 02:01:55,836
[SPEAKER_17]: just so we can compare.

1500
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd move the five-minute recess.

1501
02:02:02,202 --> 02:02:05,945
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, President Bears for a five-minute recess, seconded by... Second.

1502
02:02:06,325 --> 02:02:07,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my question is this.

1503
02:02:07,867 --> 02:02:11,390
[SPEAKER_11]: If the paper's already been ruled on and it's been ruled out of order, what are we recessing on?

1504
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:12,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you made a ruling?

1505
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:13,772
[SPEAKER_11]: She did.

1506
02:02:13,792 --> 02:02:14,253
[SPEAKER_08]: She made a ruling.

1507
02:02:14,273 --> 02:02:15,213
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper was out of order.

1508
02:02:15,253 --> 02:02:15,574
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1509
02:02:15,594 --> 02:02:16,394
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1510
02:02:16,695 --> 02:02:17,095
[SPEAKER_11]: That is all.

1511
02:02:21,871 --> 02:02:23,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1512
02:02:23,912 --> 02:02:26,953
[SPEAKER_17]: If I may, I just want to state for the record, I'm not opposed to this paper.

1513
02:02:26,993 --> 02:02:28,274
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is something we should discuss.

1514
02:02:28,314 --> 02:02:37,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that it, you know, I certainly understand the argument for not spot changing our rules, but I just, you know, I hope that this is something that we can discuss, you know, after the cooling off period.

1515
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:41,519
[SPEAKER_17]: If we've confirmed that, that's, you know, procedurally the action we have to take.

1516
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:41,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1517
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:43,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President.

1518
02:02:44,341 --> 02:02:45,021
[SPEAKER_20]: President Bears.

1519
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:49,403
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may, as the person who filed the, or who moved to

1520
02:02:51,192 --> 02:02:52,672
[SPEAKER_20]: receive and place this on file.

1521
02:02:53,352 --> 02:03:01,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I did that at, you know, 14, 15 months after the paper had been filed, not with the intention of starting a cooling off period the day that I moved to receive it and place it on file.

1522
02:03:02,314 --> 02:03:08,856
[SPEAKER_20]: As I read the rules, obviously, regardless of my intention, that was its effect.

1523
02:03:10,356 --> 02:03:13,457
[SPEAKER_20]: I would move to suspend the rules to take the paper under consideration.

1524
02:03:13,477 --> 02:03:15,997
[SPEAKER_20]: It's up to the council to vote on that if they want to or not.

1525
02:03:16,037 --> 02:03:17,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of Parliament, we agree.

1526
02:03:17,337 --> 02:03:19,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, the paper has already been addressed.

1527
02:03:19,418 --> 02:03:20,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna dispose of the paper.

1528
02:03:21,707 --> 02:03:22,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I already motioned.

1529
02:03:22,427 --> 02:03:23,948
[SPEAKER_20]: A motion to overrule is the chair.

1530
02:03:25,549 --> 02:03:31,792
[SPEAKER_11]: So the motion is... My motion is to... The question of the chair is whether or not the paper's out of order.

1531
02:03:31,953 --> 02:03:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the motion is to question whether or not the paper's out of order.

1532
02:03:34,414 --> 02:03:36,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So the paper will need a supermajority in order to move forward.

1533
02:03:38,054 --> 02:03:44,415
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I not also move to suspend the rules to take the paper to suspend rule 25 or whatever it is to take the paper.

1534
02:03:44,775 --> 02:03:45,935
[SPEAKER_20]: We have the authority to do that.

1535
02:03:45,955 --> 02:03:48,456
[SPEAKER_20]: Paper was just disposed of.

1536
02:03:48,816 --> 02:03:50,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just put it down a month ago.

1537
02:03:50,636 --> 02:03:51,697
[SPEAKER_11]: She just ruled it out of order.

1538
02:03:54,577 --> 02:04:00,818
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the rules are set by a majority of the council, which can suspend the rules at any time, which we do often.

1539
02:04:01,378 --> 02:04:05,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I suppose a bit.

1540
02:04:07,171 --> 02:04:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the ruling is down.

1541
02:04:08,752 --> 02:04:11,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1542
02:04:11,594 --> 02:04:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So 90 days from the 321, it could be introduced.

1543
02:04:14,937 --> 02:04:20,201
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it the clerk puts out a report to do?

1544
02:04:22,403 --> 02:04:27,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It was from Councilor Knight to add that to reports due.

1545
02:04:29,448 --> 02:04:31,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So it reports due being that paper be back on.

1546
02:04:35,656 --> 02:04:37,837
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want them to forget Madam President.

1547
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:43,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Call the roll.

1548
02:04:43,701 --> 02:04:44,002

[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind.

02:04:46,523 --> 02:04:46,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Withdrawn.

1553
02:04:47,004 --> 02:04:47,024
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-284.

1554
02:04:59,262 --> 02:05:10,365
[SPEAKER_04]: To our President and members of the Medford City Council regarding food truck permitting, dear President Morell and members of the Medford City Council, on behalf of the below entities, I respectfully submit to the Medford City Council the following request for a food truck permit in the city of Medford.

1555
02:05:10,425 --> 02:05:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to city council approval, vendors are required to adhere to the health department food safety requirements.

1556
02:05:15,986 --> 02:05:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: One, Boston Glory Games, May 6th, four to eight, work hard, eat good.

1558
02:05:24,628 --> 02:05:26,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to waive the remainder of the reading and move approval.

1559
02:05:27,272 --> 02:05:29,974
[SPEAKER_04]: for the first roll request, okay.

1560
02:05:30,454 --> 02:05:37,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the remainder of the reading and remove approval for SOFR, there's two different food truck requests.

1561
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: For both food truck requests, both separate requests, knowing there's multiple dates for one of them.

1562
02:05:42,483 --> 02:05:43,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1563
02:05:44,304 --> 02:05:45,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1564
02:06:05,262 --> 02:06:05,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:06:05,562 --> 02:06:05,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:05,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1571
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:35,123
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the first number, 044?

1572
02:06:35,303 --> 02:06:35,843
[SPEAKER_04]: 044 and 059.

1573
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:37,224
[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion.

1574
02:06:37,904 --> 02:06:39,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Description of what they are.

1575
02:06:39,505 --> 02:06:45,387
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the loan order for sidewalk construction and equipment bonds of the non-union COLA.

1576
02:06:48,248 --> 02:06:48,928
[SPEAKER_06]: No one know for me.

1577
02:06:49,632 --> 02:06:54,638
[SPEAKER_04]: on the motion of ice and bears to take papers to do that here for four and two three dash zero.

1578
02:06:54,698 --> 02:06:57,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I can Madam President, we just have to go to the table first.

1579

[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so to take them off the table for their to then go on third reading, seconded by Mr. Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1580
02:07:22,907 --> 02:07:23,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1581
02:07:23,087 --> 02:07:23,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1582
02:07:23,247 --> 02:07:23,327
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1583
02:07:23,347 --> 02:07:23,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1584
02:07:38,216 --> 02:07:42,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

1585
02:07:42,798 --> 02:07:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-3-0-044, the loan order for sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1586
02:07:47,139 --> 02:07:48,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1587
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:54,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, and on both of these orders, I think that I implore, and

1588
02:07:56,593 --> 02:08:01,217
[SPEAKER_06]: have my fellow Councilors understand the temperament that we're in right now the climate we're in.

1589
02:08:01,237 --> 02:08:21,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I received phone calls today I don't know if any of you have also from the school department that the mayor has already shared a very dire situation on the school side, that there will be cuts and layoffs on the school department, and believing that the administration's have a meeting here tomorrow.

1590
02:08:22,197 --> 02:08:28,822
[SPEAKER_06]: to rethink that and try to focus on how we're going to stop such a drastic move.

1591
02:08:28,882 --> 02:08:44,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, to my fellow Councilors and to the public, I've been imploring all of you, without understanding the budget and without understanding what we're doing with the money in our community, please don't vote anymore.

1592
02:08:47,017 --> 02:08:53,847
[SPEAKER_06]: money papers because we don't know where this is going to go when it comes to the presentation of the budget.

1593
02:08:54,548 --> 02:09:00,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I beg of you to please consider that I've been saying this and it's coming through fruition.

1594
02:09:01,471 --> 02:09:23,350
[SPEAKER_06]: from what teachers have called me, and they're appalled, and they don't know where they're going after what was supposed to be good faith negotiations and understanding the climate financially this community, and what is being told to me by the school department of teachers in the school department that they've been told that there will be cuts and layoffs.

1595
02:09:24,335 --> 02:09:42,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So every dollar right now we should really consider whether we're approving anything, dealing with money anything right now, until we have further understanding of what is going to happen in our community, when it comes to budget time because of the lack of information that have been shared to this council.

1596
02:09:44,114 --> 02:09:50,182
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been pushing money papers through because quote unquote what you said was, we still need to do the business of the city.

1597
02:09:50,803 --> 02:10:01,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we're doing is something unknown and what might happen is whatever we voted for is going to cause drastic trickle down effect in other areas in our community.

1598
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:16,111
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is why I've said it, and believe me, I hate the fact that this looks like it's going to happen, that the budget is dire, that there are severe consequences that are happening.

1599
02:10:17,465 --> 02:10:20,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, you know, I can only hope it's not true.

1600
02:10:20,908 --> 02:10:24,350
[SPEAKER_06]: But since we haven't had any information from anybody administration.

1601
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:32,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only go with the people that reach out to me and share information, and that came directly from the school committee.

1602
02:10:33,657 --> 02:10:35,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is where we stand.

1603
02:10:35,918 --> 02:10:59,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your own conscious to vote on this, but understand, whatever you vote for, for one more dollar, whatever you vote on, when it comes to the budget season, and when it comes to the mayor looking at us and saying, we can't do what you want, and we're going to have to look at other positions, and then cut the assistant in the engineering department, or cut this program at the library, or cut this on our side, it falls on us.

1604
02:11:00,745 --> 02:11:02,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I know it's a drastic conversation.

1605
02:11:03,346 --> 02:11:06,206
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, believe me, I wish I was wrong.

1606
02:11:07,567 --> 02:11:08,687
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is what's happening.

1607
02:11:09,267 --> 02:11:10,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1608
02:11:11,388 --> 02:11:12,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1609
02:11:14,128 --> 02:11:19,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I completely agree with Councilor Scarpelli that we should not be in the position of cutting any positions.

1610
02:11:20,070 --> 02:11:29,152
[SPEAKER_20]: And quite frankly, my understanding of the city budget is that it's and the state funding that's coming in, etc, is not that

1611
02:11:30,872 --> 02:11:37,996
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have the money to fund things, it's that the money will not be allocated by the single authority who can allocate said monies to fund things.

1612
02:11:38,536 --> 02:11:42,038
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just don't want us and again I understand exactly where you're coming from.

1613
02:11:42,058 --> 02:11:49,582
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want again this council will be put in the position of falling into the trap of the false narrative setup that says we don't have the money because that's just not true.

1614
02:11:50,463 --> 02:11:58,167
[SPEAKER_20]: It's how much are we willing to allocate is the mayor willing to allocate for the city budget for the public school system and for the city departments.

1615
02:12:00,207 --> 02:12:17,999
[SPEAKER_20]: my understanding of the information that we have received which I agree with you is not as complete as we want it to be for sure, is not that the money is not there, it's that we're being quote unquote prudent, and we're being quote unquote fiscally conservative, and I don't believe that we should be doing that at the expense of firing city employees are laying off city employees.

1616
02:12:18,439 --> 02:12:23,543
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think if we accept that the dollar amount is the dollar amount that the whatever the mayor says goes.

1617
02:12:24,303 --> 02:12:28,206
[SPEAKER_20]: then that's coming to us and putting a scarcity mindset on us that actually doesn't exist.

1618
02:12:28,266 --> 02:12:30,988
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that we don't have the authority to countervail it, right?

1619
02:12:31,108 --> 02:12:33,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And that there's only one political actor in the city that does.

1620
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:41,376
[SPEAKER_20]: On these specific items, we're talking about a bond issue that we do regularly for sidewalk construction and equipment.

1621
02:12:42,216 --> 02:12:46,560
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a bond issue, so the costs are going to be over a long period of the bond.

1622
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:52,024
[SPEAKER_20]: So the actual costs of the city are significantly smaller on an annual basis compared to the amount of the bond.

1623
02:12:52,544 --> 02:12:53,485
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the second piece

1624
02:12:54,205 --> 02:12:56,746
[SPEAKER_20]: is is cola money that's under $100,000.

1625
02:12:57,106 --> 02:13:02,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Four weeks ago, I think this council unanimously voted to approve $2 million in free cash to go to new fire trucks.

1626
02:13:02,428 --> 02:13:04,208
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not saying that was a good thing or a bad thing.

1627
02:13:04,588 --> 02:13:10,690
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're talking about an order of magnitude less than that we're talking about 100,000 to 200,000 not $2 million.

1628
02:13:10,951 --> 02:13:14,932
[SPEAKER_20]: And finally, again, like the second piece of it, the cola piece of it.

1629
02:13:15,532 --> 02:13:23,922
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I don't think teachers should be there should not even be a threat or consideration of any staff at our city at our school system at all being threatened at all in this budget.

1630
02:13:24,723 --> 02:13:32,652
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact that that's a discussion we're having is a choice by the person who says this is how much money you're going to get in the school system which is none of us and quite frankly none of the school committee except for the chair of the school committee.

1631
02:13:35,155 --> 02:13:41,237
[SPEAKER_20]: There's cola adjustments for people who work in this community who work in City Hall who haven't gotten raises for four years.

1632
02:13:41,877 --> 02:13:46,379
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I, when I should that be allowed to happen either absolutely not.

1633
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:54,782
[SPEAKER_20]: These are people who work for the city who deserve fair compensation just like every single worker in the city, and our public school system deserves it.

1634
02:13:56,145 --> 02:14:00,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have the choice today to approve a fair union contract for certain workers?

1635
02:14:00,688 --> 02:14:00,888
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1636
02:14:01,028 --> 02:14:06,711
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have an authority to say to the school department, to the mayor, the school department shall have this and there shall be no layoffs?

1637
02:14:06,771 --> 02:14:06,971
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1638
02:14:07,012 --> 02:14:13,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have the authority technically before me as one seventh the authority at the very least to say that people haven't gotten raises for four years should get raises?

1639
02:14:15,386 --> 02:14:18,710
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to say yes to that, because that's a good thing.

1640
02:14:19,070 --> 02:14:23,255
[SPEAKER_20]: I said this before when we discussed this at its first reading, I don't think the mayor cares.

1641
02:14:23,816 --> 02:14:27,580
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think us voting no is going to change position on union negotiations at all.

1642
02:14:29,182 --> 02:14:29,683
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't.

1643
02:14:30,515 --> 02:14:33,878
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's no gain to leave it on the table.

1644
02:14:33,918 --> 02:14:36,120
[SPEAKER_20]: In my perspective, I respect other opinions on that.

1645
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:37,842
[SPEAKER_20]: I respect other positions on that.

1646
02:14:39,183 --> 02:14:53,035
[SPEAKER_20]: But there is loss, and I'm not willing to take loss for no reason at all, when that loss could mean city employees no longer working here because they haven't gotten raised in multiple years and want to move to another community or agency.

1647
02:14:53,495 --> 02:14:56,178
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I respect the principle of where everyone's coming from.

1648
02:14:56,678 --> 02:15:07,506
[SPEAKER_20]: and the fact that we need more information, but I don't think that we should allow the scarcity mindset of one elected official in the community to determine how all of us act.

1649
02:15:09,428 --> 02:15:10,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1650
02:15:11,411 --> 02:15:12,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Morell.

1651
02:15:12,292 --> 02:15:23,406
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate hearing my other colleagues perspectives on this and I, you know, we've we've talked about this issue before we talked about this, we voted on this for first reading, I know that there's a variety of opinion on this.

1652
02:15:23,446 --> 02:15:26,290
[SPEAKER_17]: I think people know where I stand my, you know,

1653
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:31,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Similarly, we can only vote on what we have the power to vote on.

1654
02:15:31,792 --> 02:15:38,095
[SPEAKER_17]: We cannot affect direct change of the things that we do not have the jurisdiction to affect direct change over.

1655
02:15:38,816 --> 02:15:39,996
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something that we get to vote on.

1656
02:15:40,416 --> 02:15:42,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that these people deserve raises.

1657
02:15:42,357 --> 02:15:43,758
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that everybody deserves a raise.

1658
02:15:43,998 --> 02:15:47,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wish that we had the opportunity to affect that, but we don't.

1659
02:15:47,179 --> 02:15:47,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also, I think

1660
02:15:48,680 --> 02:16:07,052
[SPEAKER_17]: The more important point here I think the it's not really an elephant in the room it's just what's on everybody's mind because I think everybody's really worried about the only piece of the budget that we have had an indication about so far, which is the proposal given to the schools, and it is I think impossible not to consider.

1661
02:16:08,036 --> 02:16:13,881
[SPEAKER_17]: these expenditures in the context of the really worrying number that was given to the schools over the past couple weeks.

1662
02:16:13,941 --> 02:16:15,803
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that that's something that we all care a lot about.

1663
02:16:17,184 --> 02:16:28,253
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think I want to, you know, kind of underline something that Vice President Bair said, which is that we get to choose, you know, whether this conversation is about

1664
02:16:29,357 --> 02:16:36,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I guess we're in the position of having to choose between this loan order or the schools or this proposed wage adjustment or the schools.

1665
02:16:37,101 --> 02:16:38,342
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not the case.

1666
02:16:38,482 --> 02:16:39,763
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a binary.

1667
02:16:40,203 --> 02:16:41,724
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not the choice that we're being presented.

1668
02:16:43,165 --> 02:16:47,928
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a version of that narrative where that is what's happening, but that's not factual.

1669
02:16:48,708 --> 02:16:56,032
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we all wish that we had been in meaningful, deliberate conversations about crafting this budget for a long time now, and that hasn't been the case.

1670
02:16:58,412 --> 02:17:07,036
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have meetings and meetings ahead of us where we can be saying what I think is already known about our shared council priorities for this budget.

1671
02:17:07,596 --> 02:17:16,740
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's no secret that, you know, in June of last year all of us were very willing to disapprove the budget that didn't meet a single one of our council priorities.

1672
02:17:17,521 --> 02:17:20,002
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I go into this budget season really willing to

1673
02:17:20,862 --> 02:17:27,589
[SPEAKER_17]: communicate and collaborate and, you know, be in dialogue with the administration about the things that I need to see in the budget in order to be a yes vote on it.

1674
02:17:29,131 --> 02:17:29,872
[SPEAKER_17]: That's no secret.

1675
02:17:29,952 --> 02:17:30,453
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that

1676
02:17:32,198 --> 02:17:36,940
[SPEAKER_17]: know, obviously, proper funding for the schools where layoffs are not an issue is a huge part of that.

1677
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:45,043
[SPEAKER_17]: We go into this with the information that we have, including, you know, a pretty sizable free cash number that we learned about just a couple months ago.

1678
02:17:45,223 --> 02:17:46,743
[SPEAKER_17]: All of that is context that we can use.

1679
02:17:46,783 --> 02:17:47,784
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that the money is there.

1680
02:17:47,924 --> 02:17:49,064
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a matter of appropriation.

1681
02:17:49,124 --> 02:17:50,145
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a matter of allocation.

1682
02:17:50,165 --> 02:17:53,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't buy the narrative that it's sidewalks or schools.

1683
02:17:53,266 --> 02:17:56,027
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't buy the narrative that it's non-union personnel or schools.

1684
02:17:56,467 --> 02:17:58,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it can be both, and I'm willing to have the conversation to get there.

1685
02:17:59,288 --> 02:18:00,169
[SPEAKER_17]: for tonight.

1686
02:18:00,749 --> 02:18:10,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that these are things that we should approve, and I just wanted to explain my reasoning on that, and I hope that over the next couple months, we can be unified as a council on lobbying for a budget that our community deserves.

1687
02:18:10,656 --> 02:18:10,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1688
02:18:11,597 --> 02:18:11,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1689
02:18:13,792 --> 02:18:25,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate my colleagues words, but again I'm going to, I'll say, if there's a reason why the male mayor only allocated a certain amount of money to the school side.

1690
02:18:26,502 --> 02:18:30,445
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only equate that there is some shortfalls on the city side.

1691
02:18:31,246 --> 02:18:35,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is what we're saying, again, we don't have the information in front of us.

1692
02:18:36,777 --> 02:18:41,181
[SPEAKER_06]: The question about a $2 million, a $200 million fire truck order.

1693
02:18:41,201 --> 02:18:44,264
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why we, I've always supported that is simple.

1694
02:18:45,065 --> 02:18:48,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a process that had time table on it.

1695
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:52,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to take years before we address that financially, but the vote needed to be taken.

1696
02:18:53,073 --> 02:18:54,013
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we supported it.

1697
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:58,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, again,

1698
02:19:00,592 --> 02:19:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: it's being a little disingenuine when we have the union heads in front of us, and we tell them that we're supporting them.

1699
02:19:07,518 --> 02:19:21,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And their, their, their response to us was, I hope you would not support a non union positions raise when we haven't had people in this building that haven't gotten a raise in four or five years.

1700
02:19:22,811 --> 02:19:23,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Those exact words.

1701
02:19:24,975 --> 02:19:48,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the three points that were raised in my eyes, but I think three points that it's very, very effective to understand when we keep voting, even for another dollar right now, for what I've heard from the school department is really a glimmer of fear that I'm seeing that's going to come in front of us, hopefully by July 1.

1702
02:19:48,896 --> 02:19:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So again,

1703
02:19:52,865 --> 02:19:58,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, and here's, we supported the charter changes that Council B has brought forward for this purpose.

1704
02:20:00,371 --> 02:20:02,512
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we all mostly stood together with this.

1705
02:20:03,153 --> 02:20:14,421
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that we haven't been part of the discussion, the fact that we have been disrespected and treated like our opinions don't count, and the ordinances that we put in place don't count.

1706
02:20:15,627 --> 02:20:20,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's many different layers to this, but I'll be honest with you, I've been saying this for a long time now.

1707
02:20:20,948 --> 02:20:42,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, I respect everybody behind this reel, and I respect your opinions, but all I'm saying is, and I hope I'm wrong, when it comes to July 1, and we're looking at different drastic cuts, because even a bond, there's trickle down effect on how that money's being dispersed.

1708
02:20:45,178 --> 02:20:46,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

1709
02:20:46,359 --> 02:21:10,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a bond, but if we're using money from one area to take away from another area to pay for a bond because it's spread over many years, until we know that climate or that's explained to us in a thoughtful, reasonable, responsible way that I can go back to the constituents that voted me in, that I could look at them and say, this is why I support it, I can't do it.

1710
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:12,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this isn't,

1711
02:21:14,142 --> 02:21:17,670
[SPEAKER_06]: anything to banter back and forth and say that I don't respect what you're saying.

1712
02:21:18,071 --> 02:21:19,834
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm saying is that's the view that I feel.

1713
02:21:20,516 --> 02:21:21,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I appreciate it.

1714
02:21:21,498 --> 02:21:22,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1715
02:21:24,595 --> 02:21:25,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1716
02:21:25,335 --> 02:21:29,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be extremely brief because I think we've talked about these two items for months now.

1717
02:21:31,016 --> 02:21:41,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I very much respect my colleagues' ways of seeing this, and I think it's not unreasonable to see it that way.

1718
02:21:41,499 --> 02:21:47,840
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think it is a false choice, especially when the mayor's announced that we have $25 million in free cash.

1719
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:53,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, that's not going to fix all of our problems, but it's a starting point for a conversation.

1720
02:21:54,662 --> 02:22:13,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we also have to look at the size of the decisions that we're making and as Councilor bears has referred has has talked about, um, it's voting no on these items won't save any particular program voting yes on these items won't kill any particular program.

1721
02:22:13,801 --> 02:22:16,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a false way of, I think,

1722
02:22:16,684 --> 02:22:22,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe false is a strong way of putting it, but it's not the way I believe that we should look at this problem.

1723
02:22:23,691 --> 02:22:27,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, I think we need also a bigger picture lens as well.

1724
02:22:28,756 --> 02:22:31,639
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pay attention to employee retention.

1725
02:22:31,679 --> 02:22:33,881
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pay attention to

1726
02:22:34,882 --> 02:22:36,383
[SPEAKER_01]: how much things cost in the long run.

1727
02:22:36,883 --> 02:22:43,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at these items, these items speak to those worries and those goals that we have as a city.

1728
02:22:43,607 --> 02:22:55,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that all of us do share the sidewalk bond, you know, part of that is for bringing machinery to the city for us to bring projects in-house.

1729
02:22:56,134 --> 02:23:06,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And that requires investment, but that investment is going to pay off in the long run with better roads and with cheaper solutions to our infrastructure problems.

1730
02:23:06,739 --> 02:23:09,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it's about making an investment in the city.

1731
02:23:10,961 --> 02:23:20,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I do respect my colleagues' ways of seeing this, and I think we've hashed it out and we've talked about it for weeks now.

1732
02:23:20,866 --> 02:23:22,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think I'm ready to vote on it.

1733
02:23:26,425 --> 02:23:33,334
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the Council needs to have an explanation of where the $25 million of free cash came from.

1734
02:23:33,354 --> 02:23:39,061
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the people deserve an explanation on what

1735
02:23:40,345 --> 02:23:42,126
[SPEAKER_21]: the $25 million can be spent on.

1736
02:23:42,146 --> 02:23:47,209
[SPEAKER_21]: I think people are hearing the $25 million, they think it's gonna be the savior.

1737
02:23:47,809 --> 02:23:51,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And that money is not just meant to be pushed around.

1738
02:23:52,091 --> 02:24:08,020
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would hope that the administration comes back to explain to us how we arrived at that $25 million number and let the people know what the 25 million can be spent on and can't be spent on.

1739
02:24:09,289 --> 02:24:12,732
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't want people to have any false sense of security here.

1740
02:24:16,734 --> 02:24:31,124
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll make that into a motion that the administration provide an explanation of where the $25 million of free cash came from and also provide us with a definition of what the $25 million can be spent and can't be spent on.

1741
02:24:31,785 --> 02:24:36,148
[SPEAKER_21]: So like I said, so the taxpayer understands

1742
02:24:37,604 --> 02:24:39,666
[SPEAKER_21]: where that money is arriving from.

1743
02:24:40,847 --> 02:24:45,112
[SPEAKER_21]: And the word free, it's not free, money belongs to the taxpayers, it's not, nothing is free.

1744
02:24:46,112 --> 02:24:47,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like it to be a B paper?

1745
02:24:47,654 --> 02:24:47,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1746
02:24:48,094 --> 02:24:48,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1747
02:24:49,896 --> 02:24:50,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1748
02:24:50,777 --> 02:24:52,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1749
02:24:52,759 --> 02:25:00,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, you know, we have two papers that are before us this evening, one paper for a loan of a sidewalks, and another paper for

1750
02:25:01,597 --> 02:25:02,958
[SPEAKER_11]: raises for non-union employees.

1751
02:25:03,658 --> 02:25:07,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I look at these papers, I say to myself, does our city need sidewalks?

1752
02:25:07,239 --> 02:25:08,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, that's the first question.

1753
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:09,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Does our city need sidewalks?

1754
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:13,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, our city needs sidewalks.

1755
02:25:14,563 --> 02:25:22,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, this paper that's before us, I think, asks us to borrow more money than the city's been appropriating to repair streets in the community.

1756
02:25:25,227 --> 02:25:26,728
[SPEAKER_11]: They're asking us to borrow money.

1757
02:25:28,829 --> 02:25:32,551
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I'm sitting there and I'm just thinking back months, Madam President.

1758
02:25:33,291 --> 02:25:36,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Months, we've been asking them where they're spending it.

1759
02:25:37,994 --> 02:25:41,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't we be provided with the Warren articles?

1760
02:25:41,716 --> 02:25:46,559
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been asking for it since our prior finance director was run out of town under discrimination suits.

1761
02:25:47,819 --> 02:25:51,441
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, she was able to give it to us, no problem, with a push of a button.

1762
02:25:51,581 --> 02:25:52,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really don't understand this.

1763
02:25:54,243 --> 02:25:57,885
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so when we talk about borrowing money,

1764
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:17,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talk about an administration that prides itself on transparency, but this is the same administration that refuses to provide us with the documentation that shows where they're spending their money, as requested by the council on a number of occasions now, probably totaling in the double digits.

1765
02:26:18,925 --> 02:26:20,626
[SPEAKER_11]: It raises a red flag, Madam President.

1766
02:26:20,966 --> 02:26:22,006
[SPEAKER_11]: It raises a red flag.

1767
02:26:22,626 --> 02:26:24,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we talk about the loan,

1768
02:26:25,922 --> 02:26:30,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I talk about financial transparency and I talk about the request that this council has made.

1769
02:26:31,887 --> 02:26:35,550
[SPEAKER_11]: The request that this council has made for months and months and months upon end.

1770
02:26:36,711 --> 02:26:38,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer that I get when I say, where is it?

1771
02:26:39,133 --> 02:26:40,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are the Warren articles?

1772
02:26:40,954 --> 02:26:41,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we don't have the time.

1773
02:26:42,596 --> 02:26:43,236
[SPEAKER_11]: We're too busy.

1774
02:26:44,798 --> 02:26:53,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there are two non-union personnel in this room whose salary total about a quarter of a million bucks that are here before us for a raise, but they're too busy.

1775
02:26:54,328 --> 02:26:56,089
[SPEAKER_11]: to provide us with the documentation that we need.

1776
02:26:56,930 --> 02:26:59,171
[SPEAKER_11]: They're too busy to give us the papers that we've asked for.

1777
02:27:01,273 --> 02:27:04,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's the excuse that we've been given, time in and time out.

1778
02:27:06,316 --> 02:27:17,203
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're not able to provide us with the simple financial data that their predecessors were able to provide us with, or willing to provide us with, maybe is more accurate of a statement.

1779
02:27:18,464 --> 02:27:21,206
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet, they're here asking for a race.

1780
02:27:24,636 --> 02:27:29,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I hear the term non-union, I think depominate.

1781
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:33,643
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I think when I hear the term non-union, depominate, because that's really what this is.

1782
02:27:33,683 --> 02:27:34,863
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a race for depominates.

1783
02:27:35,804 --> 02:27:53,017
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we look at this paper, and we examine this paper in its initial state, when it came before us, when the mayor tried to give herself a raise in this paper retroactively, without disclosure to the council, without a list of titles to the council,

1784
02:27:54,775 --> 02:27:57,596
[SPEAKER_11]: explaining what titles were going to be elevated.

1785
02:27:59,016 --> 02:28:02,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the cost of living adjustment for non-union personnel, Madam President.

1786
02:28:02,077 --> 02:28:07,419
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with the number of CAFRI classifications that the administration's put forward.

1787
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:10,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, the administration's talked

1788
02:28:11,258 --> 02:28:20,366
[SPEAKER_11]: so braggadociosly about the opportunity to have a compensation study that's been forecasted from some grant that we were awarded.

1789
02:28:20,386 --> 02:28:26,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see the compensation study, but week in and week out, I see titles that are coming before us for increases.

1790
02:28:27,832 --> 02:28:38,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, the rank and file workers, DPW, our police, our fire, our clerical workers, the people that we pick up the phone every day and call and say, can you fix this pothole farming?

1791
02:28:40,713 --> 02:28:42,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you do a wellness check on this family?

1792
02:28:42,454 --> 02:28:43,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen my neighbor in a while.

1793
02:28:44,956 --> 02:28:47,378
[SPEAKER_11]: My father fell down, can you come help me pick him up?

1794
02:28:48,019 --> 02:28:50,841
[SPEAKER_11]: My basement's flooded, can you come over and help pump me out?

1795
02:28:51,502 --> 02:28:53,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the people that aren't getting the raise.

1796
02:28:54,904 --> 02:28:58,487
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people that are getting the raise are the ones that aren't gonna provide us with the information that we need.

1797
02:29:01,469 --> 02:29:02,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is backwards.

1798
02:29:03,251 --> 02:29:05,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a rising tide floats all boats, Madam President.

1799
02:29:06,453 --> 02:29:11,756
[SPEAKER_11]: But never ever will I put the management before the working people ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

1800
02:29:12,456 --> 02:29:14,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what the administration is asking us what to do.

1801
02:29:15,758 --> 02:29:21,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I certainly believe that non-union personnel in this community deserve a raise.

1802
02:29:22,441 --> 02:29:28,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at my track record, and you go back to previous administrations, you'll see who held up.

1803
02:29:30,467 --> 02:29:36,049
[SPEAKER_11]: a raise for non-union personnel when it wasn't equal to what union personnel were getting.

1804
02:29:36,769 --> 02:29:41,731
[SPEAKER_11]: When the prior administration asked non-union personnel to take a zero, I held it up.

1805
02:29:42,151 --> 02:29:42,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't approve it.

1806
02:29:43,272 --> 02:29:45,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And I negotiated with the administration to defer that zero.

1807
02:29:46,673 --> 02:29:50,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So they took a zero one year and they deferred it and got a raise in the end that made up for it, Madam President.

1808
02:29:50,894 --> 02:29:52,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody was whole and everybody was happy.

1809
02:29:53,107 --> 02:29:54,548
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to do this, Madam President.

1810
02:29:54,949 --> 02:29:56,150
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to work with labor.

1811
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:59,873
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to work with the personnel in this building to make them happy, all right?

1812
02:30:00,173 --> 02:30:06,538
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to work in partnership and in concert with this council and with the people that are in this building, all right?

1813
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:11,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to have a hands-on mayor versus a social media influencer.

1814
02:30:11,883 --> 02:30:12,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I really would.

1815
02:30:13,124 --> 02:30:16,327
[SPEAKER_11]: But at this point in this game, Madam President, where are we?

1816
02:30:16,787 --> 02:30:21,071
[SPEAKER_11]: We're no further ahead today than we were in January or the January before that.

1817
02:30:22,268 --> 02:30:33,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And for us to take these votes right now is going to send a message to those rank and file workers that have been fighting and struggling every day with the administration whose rights have been trampled to say, yeah, yeah, we hear you, but we really don't care.

1818
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:34,701
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still going to reward them.

1819
02:30:35,082 --> 02:30:36,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're still going to give them their raises.

1820
02:30:36,383 --> 02:30:37,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll get yours too, don't worry about it.

1821
02:30:37,725 --> 02:30:39,687
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's money left and she decides to appropriate it.

1822
02:30:43,238 --> 02:30:48,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't, in good faith, Madam President, take these votes this evening.

1823
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:51,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to support this paper to give the non-union personnel a raise.

1824
02:30:51,641 --> 02:30:53,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to support it when the time is right.

1825
02:30:53,262 --> 02:30:54,762
[SPEAKER_11]: The time right now is not right.

1826
02:30:55,363 --> 02:30:56,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to support.

1827
02:30:56,743 --> 02:30:59,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to support these sidewalks, because these are needs that our community have.

1828
02:31:00,345 --> 02:31:01,725
[SPEAKER_11]: These are needs that our community has.

1829
02:31:02,585 --> 02:31:04,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to support these papers, but I can't.

1830
02:31:05,086 --> 02:31:11,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't, in good faith, look at myself in the mirror tomorrow if I take these votes and vote yes, because I'd find it to be fiscally irresponsible.

1831
02:31:13,249 --> 02:31:21,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Fiscally irresponsible, because I've given this same goddamn speech week in and week out, asking about fiscal transparency, asking about where the money's being spent.

1832
02:31:21,635 --> 02:31:23,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And I get this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1833
02:31:23,876 --> 02:31:24,436
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I get.

1834
02:31:24,576 --> 02:31:27,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I get nothing but lip service and mumbo jumbo, Madam President.

1835
02:31:28,339 --> 02:31:28,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

1836
02:31:33,262 --> 02:31:38,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm comfortable waking up in the morning, knowing that I took the good vote, knowing that I stood by my principles.

1837
02:31:41,214 --> 02:31:43,395
[SPEAKER_11]: No one that I'm not going to be walked over and pushed around.

1838
02:31:45,536 --> 02:31:48,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Not taken advantage of, taken for granted, and not being respected.

1839
02:31:49,018 --> 02:31:51,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what this is about at this point, Madam President.

1840
02:31:52,059 --> 02:31:53,900
[SPEAKER_11]: The rank and file workers not being respected.

1841
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:55,701
[SPEAKER_11]: The council's not being respected.

1842
02:31:57,521 --> 02:31:59,762
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're being asked to do an awful lot.

1843
02:32:01,983 --> 02:32:03,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's fair.

1844
02:32:04,845 --> 02:32:05,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

1845
02:32:06,586 --> 02:32:07,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Bears.

1846
02:32:07,786 --> 02:32:08,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1847
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:13,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Two things I'll get out of the way before I get to what I was actually going to say.

1848
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:28,545
[SPEAKER_20]: there has been a lot of work by council leadership to get information that shouldn't have taken a lot of work to get, but some of that information is coming through and hasn't come through before.

1849
02:32:28,605 --> 02:32:30,326
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a quarter three budget to actuals.

1850
02:32:30,366 --> 02:32:33,808
[SPEAKER_20]: We have warrant articles for March, 2023 and some prior months.

1851
02:32:33,828 --> 02:32:35,509
[SPEAKER_20]: We have warrant articles for legal expenses.

1852
02:32:35,889 --> 02:32:36,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it everything we've asked for?

1853
02:32:37,069 --> 02:32:37,229
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1854
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:39,651
[SPEAKER_20]: Should have taken as long as it needed to, to get to us.

1855
02:32:39,811 --> 02:32:40,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely not.

1856
02:32:40,651 --> 02:32:42,632
[SPEAKER_20]: And in that, I completely agree with my colleagues.

1857
02:32:44,053 --> 02:32:47,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Second piece of this, again, like this is difficult.

1858
02:32:48,524 --> 02:32:53,050
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not that I don't want to stand by my principles, it's that multiple principles are in conflict.

1859
02:32:54,452 --> 02:32:54,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?

1860
02:32:57,256 --> 02:32:59,539
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not just department heads who are going to get a coal erase.

1861
02:33:00,617 --> 02:33:09,047
[SPEAKER_20]: And this, this equipment thing that we're talking about we're talking about Mike Wentzel said the same thing that about chief Friedman's order for the fire trucks that he said about this equipment.

1862
02:33:09,548 --> 02:33:11,149
[SPEAKER_20]: If we put in the order now it'll take a year.

1863
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:12,992
[SPEAKER_20]: If we don't it could take a year and a half.

1864
02:33:13,592 --> 02:33:16,095
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now the chief said two years three years that's fine.

1865
02:33:16,215 --> 02:33:19,079
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to debate the specifics because principles are in conflict.

1866
02:33:21,972 --> 02:33:38,085
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason principals are in conflict are the reasons that everyone has said and everyone has shared, which is that the process is not what it should be and we are not included in the people who need to be included in a process to build trust and engender a trust and build a good relationship and get a good work product is not happening and needs to happen.

1867
02:33:38,546 --> 02:33:50,396
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we just earlier tonight voted on specific tools and amendments to give us more leverage and authority that quite frankly, again, I think even the mayor when she was a Councilor said that the council should have to make sure that there's a fair and balanced process.

1868
02:33:52,175 --> 02:33:59,496
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, my principles are in conflict here because there are people who are not department heads who fall in the non-union category more than you would think.

1869
02:33:59,516 --> 02:34:00,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, department heads fall into it too.

1870
02:34:01,417 --> 02:34:02,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, department heads fall into it.

1871
02:34:02,797 --> 02:34:06,178
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could just, I didn't interrupt you and I'd be happy to hear your response.

1872
02:34:07,538 --> 02:34:17,720
[SPEAKER_20]: The people who fall into it who say the same thing that I'm hearing from union workers who say they shouldn't have gotten a raise, that they need a raise and they haven't gotten it and there's a reason that they need it because they need to support themselves and their families.

1873
02:34:18,624 --> 02:34:21,145
[SPEAKER_20]: Are those people gonna leave the city too for the exact same reason?

1874
02:34:21,185 --> 02:34:23,807
[SPEAKER_20]: And should I be forced to pit those two groups against each other?

1875
02:34:23,907 --> 02:34:24,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely not.

1876
02:34:24,867 --> 02:34:27,389
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's not the authority that is given to me.

1877
02:34:27,669 --> 02:34:30,870
[SPEAKER_20]: That choice has been made for me by the person who has that authority.

1878
02:34:31,231 --> 02:34:36,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So now I have the choice of disappointing one group or another group and one group not getting what they want.

1879
02:34:36,293 --> 02:34:46,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't even have a choice to give them what they want or another group not getting what they want because, and what they deserve, because we're holding up something that they deserve and they have a right to

1880
02:34:47,852 --> 02:34:50,433
[SPEAKER_20]: because we're being forced to pit people against each other in this room.

1881
02:34:51,534 --> 02:35:01,118
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, when I was talking earlier about the scarcity mindset, that's the trap that we're all being boxed into.

1882
02:35:02,038 --> 02:35:08,561
[SPEAKER_20]: One, because quite frankly, we don't even have the authority that we should have to have an equal voice in the conversation, which is something we're working on.

1883
02:35:09,582 --> 02:35:12,103
[SPEAKER_20]: And two, yes, there is a dearth of information.

1884
02:35:12,163 --> 02:35:15,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do agree that we should have more information.

1885
02:35:15,204 --> 02:35:16,605
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, when we're talking about here,

1886
02:35:17,889 --> 02:35:21,112
[SPEAKER_20]: the bond order or a less than $100,000 wage adjustment.

1887
02:35:21,172 --> 02:35:33,482
[SPEAKER_20]: And the choice is that we could reject those and probably do nothing because the people listening don't care if we reject it generally, or we could actually make some positive progress.

1888
02:35:34,603 --> 02:35:36,645
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to pick the positive progress side.

1889
02:35:36,705 --> 02:35:44,792
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not that I'm going to feel good in the morning about it or bad in the morning about it, because I'm going to feel both in the morning about it because my principles are in conflict.

1890
02:35:47,959 --> 02:35:56,205
[SPEAKER_20]: And the principle that I want to put forward to support working people by voting against this, I gain nothing on that.

1891
02:35:56,826 --> 02:36:02,290
[SPEAKER_20]: The principle to support working people who aren't in the union, I actually harm if I vote against it.

1892
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:07,414
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to belabor this anymore, but I also don't want to cut off further discussion.

1893
02:36:07,534 --> 02:36:12,438
[SPEAKER_20]: I respect my colleagues who don't vote for it, but it's really just a question of,

1894
02:36:14,515 --> 02:36:24,342
[SPEAKER_20]: punishing people who have no role and voice in this, because the people that should have their backs don't have their backs in the way that they should.

1895
02:36:24,462 --> 02:36:34,048
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm not going to be the person at the end of the day who punishes someone and makes them suffer for something they had no role in creating, because I just don't fundamentally think that's fair.

1896
02:36:34,548 --> 02:36:38,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And I respect the people who think that that's not holding the line because I want to hold the line too.

1897
02:36:39,091 --> 02:36:40,012
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm, I'm

1898
02:36:40,372 --> 02:36:42,875
[SPEAKER_20]: I've said it every time we've talked about this, I'm deeply conflicted on it.

1899
02:36:43,255 --> 02:36:46,899
[SPEAKER_20]: But that principle is what I draw on when I make my final call here.

1900
02:36:46,919 --> 02:36:49,181
[SPEAKER_20]: I could see it the other way.

1901
02:36:50,182 --> 02:36:51,824
[SPEAKER_20]: On a different day, I could see it the other way.

1902
02:36:52,725 --> 02:36:53,165
[SPEAKER_20]: It sucks.

1903
02:36:53,606 --> 02:36:55,267
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not the position we should be put in.

1904
02:36:55,287 --> 02:36:59,572
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's where I think on this larger concept and the larger issue at hand, we do all agree.

1905
02:37:01,350 --> 02:37:16,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So I hope that we can, in good faith, work to create solutions that create a better process for everyone so that we're not put in a position of pitting people against each other or punishing or causing harm to people for no reason that they created.

1906
02:37:16,737 --> 02:37:17,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1907
02:37:17,677 --> 02:37:18,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1908
02:37:19,098 --> 02:37:19,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bernal.

1909
02:37:19,918 --> 02:37:20,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate it.

1910
02:37:21,199 --> 02:37:28,862
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the frustration that we felt around some of the

1911
02:37:30,277 --> 02:37:33,118
[SPEAKER_17]: information or lack thereof that we've gotten in the city's financial health.

1912
02:37:33,599 --> 02:37:49,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that that anger and frustration is fairly directed at the department head so we might be receiving it from I think that it's all a symptom of the same problem, which is that this city does not have the resources and the tools that it needs to be thriving and fully functional and reasonably staffed and have all staff be reasonably compensated.

1913
02:37:49,946 --> 02:37:51,767
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that

1914
02:37:54,418 --> 02:38:02,359
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think that we all share the same values here and I really want for us to be able to continue this conversation over the next couple months with our

1915
02:38:03,786 --> 02:38:08,570
[SPEAKER_17]: knowing that we share the same values around this and knowing our real roadblock and adversary here.

1916
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:13,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not think that this is unionized personnel against department heads.

1917
02:38:13,775 --> 02:38:16,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think this is unionized personnel against non-unionized department heads.

1918
02:38:17,218 --> 02:38:25,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think that any of my fellow Councilors are saying that for the most part, but I think that we're in the danger of rhetorically falling into that trap.

1919
02:38:25,244 --> 02:38:31,570
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't wanna leave the community with that impression because the non-unionized personnel are not the problem here.

1920
02:38:33,045 --> 02:38:36,007
[SPEAKER_17]: the folks, you know, everybody deserves that Cola increase.

1921
02:38:37,367 --> 02:38:42,630
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't fix the situation of union bargaining in the city by withholding this vote.

1922
02:38:42,670 --> 02:38:44,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I'm not going to withhold my vote of support on it.

1923
02:38:46,050 --> 02:38:51,192
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I've said all this before, but it's just, it's so important to me that I want to say it again.

1924
02:38:51,212 --> 02:38:54,854
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we can't fall prey to this misdirection.

1925
02:38:55,014 --> 02:38:59,116
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to know our real roadblock here because our real roadblock is the one that we all agree on.

1926
02:38:59,796 --> 02:39:10,661
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's the fact that we don't have the political will to allocate the money that we do have to pay everybody and bargain with everybody the way that they to be bargained with.

1927
02:39:11,658 --> 02:39:16,362
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I won't be withholding my vote on this tonight because I don't think that this is the problem.

1928
02:39:17,023 --> 02:39:26,410
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've been talking a lot specifically this evening and also in general about the tools that would empower us to deal with the actual roadblock here, but this isn't it.

1929
02:39:26,791 --> 02:39:27,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1930
02:39:30,772 --> 02:39:31,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1931
02:39:31,332 --> 02:39:34,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's fairly clear where we all stand on it.

1932
02:39:34,255 --> 02:39:40,199
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this for probably more meetings than I can count on my hand.

1933
02:39:40,439 --> 02:39:42,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, um, I think we should move the question.

1934
02:39:44,882 --> 02:39:46,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor has requested to move the question.

1935
02:39:46,604 --> 02:39:48,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, I'm sorry, Councilor Tseng has requested to move the question.

1936
02:39:48,665 --> 02:39:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight already did have his hand up, so we'll go to him and take this question.

1937
02:39:52,468 --> 02:39:53,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1938
02:39:53,689 --> 02:39:54,309
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of things.

1939
02:39:54,349 --> 02:39:55,931
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, the rank and file need it more.

1940
02:39:57,031 --> 02:39:59,033
[SPEAKER_11]: The rank and file workers need it more because they make less money.

1941
02:40:01,949 --> 02:40:04,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, the rank and file make less more.

1942
02:40:04,512 --> 02:40:07,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So, these races have a bigger impact on their life than they were in the department.

1943
02:40:09,197 --> 02:40:17,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, we don't see our rank and file union workers getting reclassification requests presented to the city council.

1944
02:40:20,890 --> 02:40:23,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the FOB reclassification plan.

1945
02:40:23,773 --> 02:40:32,584
[SPEAKER_11]: The Friends of Brianna reclassification plan, depending on who you are and what role you're in, you might get a raise, you might not, you might get a reclassification, you might reclassify your title.

1946
02:40:33,545 --> 02:40:40,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, Madam President, these non-union personnel do have a role in the breakdown

1947
02:40:41,771 --> 02:40:45,095
[SPEAKER_11]: in labor relations between the rank-and-file workers and the administration.

1948
02:40:45,435 --> 02:40:57,789
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't say that the chief of staff, that the city attorney, that the HR director haven't had a direct impact on the breakdown in the relationship and the morale with our rank-and-file workers in the fire department, in the DPW, in the clerical union.

1949
02:40:57,870 --> 02:41:00,593
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't say it, because we've seen them here expressing that.

1950
02:41:04,603 --> 02:41:11,847
[SPEAKER_11]: What was requested from the administration some 30 plus months ago was not a dearth of information.

1951
02:41:11,867 --> 02:41:13,368
[SPEAKER_11]: It was rather concise.

1952
02:41:14,409 --> 02:41:17,430
[SPEAKER_11]: A copy of the Warren articles once a month that shows us where you're spending the money.

1953
02:41:18,211 --> 02:41:19,011
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we asked for.

1954
02:41:21,212 --> 02:41:25,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, usually when there's conflict,

1955
02:41:28,663 --> 02:41:30,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to act when there's conflict.

1956
02:41:30,904 --> 02:41:32,084
[SPEAKER_11]: You can take a step back and wait.

1957
02:41:32,705 --> 02:41:38,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So if your values are being conflicted, wouldn't now be the time to take a step back and not hurt anybody?

1958
02:41:39,267 --> 02:41:39,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Sit back and wait?

1959
02:41:39,987 --> 02:41:45,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what I'm comfortable doing this evening, Madam President.

1960
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to vote him down.

1961
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:48,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want him to sit right where they are.

1962
02:41:48,991 --> 02:41:51,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see if some of these issues that we're talking about work themselves out.

1963
02:41:52,592 --> 02:41:54,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm not comfortable supporting these

1964
02:41:57,290 --> 02:42:13,625
[SPEAKER_11]: requests that are before us this evening, based upon the current events that are going on in this community, the circumstances that arise every time we request financial transparency, the circumstances that arise every time we request basic information.

1965
02:42:17,709 --> 02:42:20,772
[SPEAKER_11]: If we keep being the rubber stamp, we're going to get treated

1966
02:42:21,873 --> 02:42:23,894
[SPEAKER_11]: just like that, a rubber stamp, Madam President.

1967
02:42:24,374 --> 02:42:25,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I rest my case.

1968
02:42:25,054 --> 02:42:27,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We've debated this thing till we're all blue in the face.

1969
02:42:28,036 --> 02:42:28,956
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it is what it is.

1970
02:42:29,016 --> 02:42:30,917
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a dead horse at this point in time, Madam President.

1971
02:42:31,317 --> 02:42:38,040
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, when I sat there and I looked at those workers that were standing here, the 200 workers that were standing here, and I told them I stood with them, I meant it.

1972
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:39,340
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna stand with them.

1973
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:40,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I'll stand.

1974
02:42:40,361 --> 02:42:42,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

1975
02:42:42,681 --> 02:42:45,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, President Barras.

1976
02:42:45,343 --> 02:42:47,363
[SPEAKER_20]: We've rejected 16 of the 18 CAFs.

1977
02:42:47,463 --> 02:42:51,285
[SPEAKER_20]: So by any respect, we are basically the opposite of a rubber stamp.

1978
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:58,009
[SPEAKER_20]: they're two for 18, wouldn't even be a good record and for a bait, you know, wouldn't even be a good average for a hitter in baseball.

1979
02:43:00,712 --> 02:43:07,442
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, in my opinion here, the inaction is what is what's going to cause the harm and the actions not going to I respect the other opinion, but I just don't

1980
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:16,785
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like the idea of it being framed that by doing this, we're not supporting the workers or a rubber stamp because 90% of the time we're doing what they ask.

1981
02:43:16,845 --> 02:43:21,568
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are specific cases that come up and we hear about specific harms that may be caused by inaction.

1982
02:43:22,049 --> 02:43:26,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't wanna be in that position, but I'm also not gonna actively harm people.

1983
02:43:26,732 --> 02:43:28,793
[SPEAKER_20]: In my opinion, what I feel is active harm.

1984
02:43:29,113 --> 02:43:29,894
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's it.

1985
02:43:30,274 --> 02:43:34,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't wanna be pigeonholed, which I felt like that was happening a little bit.

1986
02:43:34,317 --> 02:43:36,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I'm not saying,

1987
02:43:37,730 --> 02:43:43,493
[SPEAKER_20]: that you're not supporting people by not voting for it, but you're saying by voting for it, that I'm not supporting people.

1988
02:43:43,533 --> 02:43:50,317
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's just, it's a little farther than I'd like this to go, but I respect where you're coming from on this.

1989
02:43:50,357 --> 02:43:54,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of personal privilege on that, Madam President.

1990
02:43:54,779 --> 02:44:01,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, the people that I'm trying to support in this community are the taxpayers, the people that put us here.

1991
02:44:02,784 --> 02:44:06,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who I'm trying to support because I see this lack of fiscal transparency as a problem.

1992
02:44:07,555 --> 02:44:09,337
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't had this with any other administration.

1993
02:44:10,298 --> 02:44:16,644
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never had an administration run on a platform of transparency, and then shut all the lights off in City Hall.

1994
02:44:20,388 --> 02:44:25,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have we've been debating both papers it seems we have two separate papers and we have a B paper.

1995
02:44:25,372 --> 02:44:31,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to take them in order we have the loan order for cyber construction equipment bonds eligible for third reading tonight.

1996
02:44:32,632 --> 02:44:40,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a B paper from Councilor Caraviello to get a report on free cash, how we ended up with the amount of free cash we have and what is eligible for use of, and anything I'm missing?

1997
02:44:42,018 --> 02:44:43,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's why I said it.

1998
02:44:44,600 --> 02:44:45,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll take the B paper first.

1999
02:44:45,701 --> 02:44:51,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion from Councilor Caraviello on the B paper, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to take paper 23-060 off the table.

2039
02:46:46,662 --> 02:46:50,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion from Vice President Paris to take 23-060 off the table.

2040
02:46:52,371 --> 02:46:59,699
[SPEAKER_04]: seconded by seconded by Councilor Collins.

2041
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:01,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2042
02:47:04,264 --> 02:47:13,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is for free cash item two of the paper we previously passed for $80,000 the appropriation for the COLA adjustment for non-union personnel.

2043
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:21,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2044
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:21,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2045
02:47:21,570 --> 02:47:21,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2046
02:47:37,131 --> 02:47:39,753
[SPEAKER_04]: and the affirmative through the negative motion passes to take it off the table.

2047
02:47:40,033 --> 02:47:41,334
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

2048
02:47:42,035 --> 02:47:42,816
[SPEAKER_20]: I just had a question.

2049
02:47:42,936 --> 02:47:46,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, first, I just wanted to say to what Councilor Caraviellol was speaking earlier about free cash.

2050
02:47:47,239 --> 02:47:57,627
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding, at least from the revenue discussion that we had in the committee of the whole recently, is that the administration has been underestimating local receipts portion of revenue and over and

2051
02:47:59,636 --> 02:48:12,546
[SPEAKER_20]: estimating at least highly the amount of expenses such that having done that there is now a significant surplus free cash, of course, is a horrible term for what it actually is, which is the reserves of the city is built up by surplus collection of tax revenue.

2052
02:48:13,027 --> 02:48:19,532
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe Councilor Collins made an incredible point recently about a month ago talking about how.

2053
02:48:21,432 --> 02:48:39,728
[SPEAKER_20]: that surplus and that balance of that surplus means that there are things whether that be collective bargaining agreements, or sidewalk repairs or the school funding or any of the many other things that we think need to be happening and should be happening urgently, that were not funded instead for that money to sit in the non interest bearing reserve account.

2054
02:48:40,849 --> 02:48:41,850
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have that money.

2055
02:48:43,268 --> 02:48:46,189
[SPEAKER_20]: It's more than any bond agency says we need to have in reserves.

2056
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:57,494
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I talk about a scarcity mindset, and what we're talking about with the schools, right, they were talking about needing about 74 million and they suggested appropriations gonna come as about 71.8 million, so that's $2.2 million.

2057
02:48:58,535 --> 02:49:06,758
[SPEAKER_20]: That could come from this pool of money, which is essentially money that could have been in the budget, instead was not in the budget, went to a surplus fund.

2058
02:49:08,457 --> 02:49:16,880
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, and may have also played into last year's discussions around structural deficits as well that maybe we're actually smaller than we thought because there's this surplus tax revenue.

2059
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:20,461
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to ask Director Dickinson, if I could.

2060
02:49:21,301 --> 02:49:27,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Has there been any adjustment to the cost of this paper after the city council voted to remove any elected officials from the cola.

2061
02:49:30,947 --> 02:49:31,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Dickinson.

2062
02:49:32,707 --> 02:49:36,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice Mayor, is that a question I think you may have missed?

2063
02:49:36,368 --> 02:49:41,729
[SPEAKER_20]: We removed at our last meeting, the mayor and the city council were included in the COLA.

2064
02:49:41,869 --> 02:49:50,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just wondering if the removal of those positions that we all unanimously voted for has changed the amount of the appropriation for free cash for the COLA.

2065
02:50:02,294 --> 02:50:03,435
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, your microphone's not on.

2066
02:50:03,475 --> 02:50:05,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Shane, can you turn on the microphone at the podium?

2067
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:13,063
[SPEAKER_08]: The calculations are the same.

2068
02:50:13,083 --> 02:50:14,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still finalizing it.

2069
02:50:14,624 --> 02:50:17,287
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing these things where you're doing

2070
02:50:26,594 --> 02:50:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Combining step increases with cost of living increases every year, everything has to be calculated separately.

2071
02:50:37,028 --> 02:50:41,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good number about, I would say, $15,000 to $20,000 worth of that $80,000.

2072
02:50:44,838 --> 02:50:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: is retro pay for people from fiscal 2021.

2073
02:50:49,423 --> 02:51:03,377
[SPEAKER_05]: The fiscal 2022 amounts have been accrued on fiscal 2022 because they are fiscal 22 expenses, so we actually reserve that money in fiscal 2022 to pay those COLAs.

2074
02:51:04,258 --> 02:51:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And then

2075
02:51:05,893 --> 02:51:21,277
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of it, it's probably a little bit more than we need, but we can do budget with just, there should be room in the budgets because the non-COLA, I mean the non-union positions are spread about the city.

2076
02:51:22,138 --> 02:51:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So there should be enough room in the budgets to cover that if we have some,

2077
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:32,663
[SPEAKER_05]: probably about $60,000 worth of free cash to cover that.

2078
02:51:32,803 --> 02:51:39,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't expect there won't be any change in that.

2079
02:51:39,788 --> 02:51:47,654
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be able to find the money to do all this, to do the retro pay and finish out the fiscal year.

2080
02:51:52,339 --> 02:51:56,561
[SPEAKER_05]: cover the salary increases that we will need going forward.

2081
02:51:57,321 --> 02:52:00,422
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to confirm it that the mayor and the city council are not included in this.

2082
02:52:01,703 --> 02:52:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no.

2083
02:52:02,483 --> 02:52:03,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, great.

2084
02:52:03,443 --> 02:52:07,165
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make sure because that's they were when we first looked at it and then we voted to exclude.

2085
02:52:07,265 --> 02:52:09,306
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, Director Dickinson.

2086
02:52:09,326 --> 02:52:11,326
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the detailed response.

2087
02:52:14,248 --> 02:52:15,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Or the response.

2088
02:52:16,088 --> 02:52:17,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion from the council?

2089
02:52:19,647 --> 02:52:21,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a motion?

2090
02:52:24,551 --> 02:52:28,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to approve for third reading or just motion to approve.

2091
02:52:28,254 --> 02:52:37,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion of Vice-President Bears to approve the free crash appropriation of $8,000 for the non-unit COLA adjustment seconded by Councilor Collins.

2092
02:52:37,042 --> 02:52:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2093
02:52:38,923 --> 02:52:39,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice-President Bears.

2094
02:52:39,764 --> 02:52:40,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2095
02:52:41,766 --> 02:52:42,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

2096
02:52:42,526 --> 02:52:42,606
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2097
02:52:50,933 --> 02:52:54,416
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2098
02:52:55,116 --> 02:52:57,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2099
02:52:57,758 --> 02:52:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2100
02:52:58,179 --> 02:52:59,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2101
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

2102
02:53:02,062 --> 02:53:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Public participation.

2103
02:53:02,942 --> 02:53:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any members on Zoom or in person who would like to participate in public participation?

2104
02:53:08,847 --> 02:53:09,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who would like to speak?

2105
02:53:12,510 --> 02:53:13,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none.

2106
02:53:13,611 --> 02:53:15,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Matthew Page Lieberman.

2107
02:53:15,592 --> 02:53:18,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

2108
02:53:19,715 --> 02:53:22,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

2109
02:53:22,978 --> 02:53:40,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was some conversation earlier, extremely appreciative of Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins talking about pedestrian and bicyclist safety on these roads, especially about potholes, having to navigate when there's a lot of, there are a lot of these works going on now.

2110
02:53:41,175 --> 02:53:44,238
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about these really, really ongoing projects.

2111
02:53:44,805 --> 02:53:45,686
[SPEAKER_13]: to repair whatever.

2112
02:53:45,706 --> 02:53:57,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, as far as the city, or, you know, I subscribe to the city website, you know, so I get all the notices, I'm sure that I'm like less than 1% of the population that actually has it configured.

2113
02:53:57,934 --> 02:54:01,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever city has a new blog post, I get an email about it.

2114
02:54:02,357 --> 02:54:05,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, you know, I think there's some of this argument that the city isn't doing

2115
02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:12,784
[SPEAKER_13]: a great job as far as people always say that the city is not doing a really good job of outreach and informing the public.

2116
02:54:13,644 --> 02:54:15,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it could always be improved upon.

2117
02:54:15,965 --> 02:54:23,550
[SPEAKER_13]: However, as a cyclist, as a pedestrian, I know that a lot of times when I'm trying to, I do have to cross the street.

2118
02:54:24,210 --> 02:54:33,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe some Councilors believe that there has to be a course at Tufts so that people have to have personal responsibility when they cross the street.

2119
02:54:33,435 --> 02:54:36,017
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really kind of missing the larger point.

2120
02:54:36,918 --> 02:54:38,743
[SPEAKER_13]: when we make these kinds of arguments.

2121
02:54:39,285 --> 02:54:44,278
[SPEAKER_13]: But now, you know, trying to navigate this stuff and knowing that there are these, you know, trucks

2122
02:54:45,105 --> 02:54:47,666
[SPEAKER_13]: busses, angry motorists and stuff like this.

2123
02:54:48,026 --> 02:54:54,729
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of times when I'm walking by, I try to ask like, you know, just looking at a project, how long is this supposed to be going on for?

2124
02:54:55,109 --> 02:54:56,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And why is that project here?

2125
02:54:57,110 --> 02:55:07,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And so sometimes I have like this kind of question of, does the city council have the ability to kind of set any ordinance that signs will be posted about all these projects?

2126
02:55:07,495 --> 02:55:10,136
[SPEAKER_13]: This is our expected, you know, termination date.

2127
02:55:10,436 --> 02:55:12,077
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is why we're doing this work.

2128
02:55:13,197 --> 02:55:15,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that this is the end of the night, but it is something I would like to know.

2129
02:55:15,599 --> 02:55:18,140
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you follow up and kind of get an answer to this?

2130
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:28,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I assume that there's some kind of basic, a very simple answer about, you know, if it's a state project or whatever, but that would be something that I think the city would really benefit from this kind of notices right at the project.

2131
02:55:28,887 --> 02:55:31,849
[SPEAKER_13]: This is why we're doing this, and this is when we plan to end the work.

2132
02:55:31,869 --> 02:55:32,809
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be very helpful.

2133
02:55:34,811 --> 02:55:35,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2134
02:55:38,333 --> 02:55:40,854
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Vice Chair Bears.

2135
02:55:40,874 --> 02:55:41,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2136
02:55:53,986 --> 02:55:54,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2137
02:55:54,907 --> 02:56:00,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm the first thing that I gave motion passes me in the future.
