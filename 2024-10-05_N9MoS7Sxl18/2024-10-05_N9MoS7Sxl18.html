    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=613.619s">If</a>  I'm hearing this correctly, I believe the gentleman just said that I'm sorry, I believe the gentleman just said this was, you know, look like it was going to be a purely residential project and then the reason they. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=625.509s">developed</a>  with some sort of commercial component was based upon the wishes of the community of the city of Medford during the planning and development process. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=632.571s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=636.151s">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=637.472s">I</a>  wasn't there in 2015 when it was permitted, but the permits included retail space. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=643.333s">It</a>  just wasn't described adequately to allow for a cafe now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=651.478s">that</a>  to, you know, to make clear what type of use we would like to see in this space.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=658.223s">Yeah,</a>  because I remember when when this went through, and I think that that was part of the deal was that the city was trying to promote this mixed use development and adding commercial components to residential structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=668.491s">So</a>  ultimately, this vacant retail space is actually a creation of our own public policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=673.254s">I</a>  see no reason why we should stand in the way and I'd move for approval on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=676.396s">I</a>  don't think this is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=677.838s">I</a>  know this is a public hearing, but this is something I certainly don't have any problem</p>

about now the Uber Eats and all these delivery services, the park on front and run in, and what it would cause for that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=722.144s">So</a>  is there parking there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=725.347s">Understood,</a>  Councilor, and that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=728.049s">There</a>  is now visitor parking along the street here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=732.533s">I</a>  can't recall how many spaces off the top of my head, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=739.102s">We</a>  envision this as the transit-oriented development. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=742.884s">We're</a>  right across the street from a tea station. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=745.326s">We're</a>  thinking residents of the building and of the neighborhood stopping here for coffee on their way to work, or on their way to the tea, or back, or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=757.513s">So</a>  that's kind of how we see it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=760.458s">No,</a>  that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=761.598s">And</a>  I understand that if that was 10 years ago, but now with all these delivery services, that's something that when we look for these types of permits, it's something that I have to wait for the fact that they're not gonna park and then walk over. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=778.024s">They're</a>  gonna put three or four deep and run in. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=782.665s">And</a>  I would hate to put any limits on anybody in their business, but that's my concern right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=788.908s">But</a>  thank you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=794.189s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=796.132s">I</a>  think that was, I think when the first opened up, that was a grocery store, if I'm correct.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=802.001s">Yeah,</a>  or a convenience store.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=804.288s">I</a>  think if the attorney can verify that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=806.729s">Do</a>  you know what was in that space prior?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=808.89s">Was</a>  that a grocery store? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=810.551s">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=811.472s">You</a>  know, I've got Paul Spivak, he's the property manager on the line there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=816.454s">Maybe</a>  Paul can give us some info.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=818.035s">I</a>  do recall that that's what was in there for a while there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=820.376s">And</a>  he did serve coffee and stuff, but it was more of a convenience store than an actual cafe originally.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=826.099s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=828.381s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=830.284s">Thank</a>  you, President really I also just wanted to know this is I walked on this part of Boston have very frequently so I've seen what's you know was currently or was formerly in the space when it was a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=844.82s">This</a>  strikes me as if the narrative here is you know we're trying to figure out what to do with this ground floor level that has to be commercial we're trying to figure out how to make better use of the space you know I'm certainly willing to go ahead and approve this if you know the owner wants to try it as a cafe instead of a convenience store it is true I almost never saw anybody going into that convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=863.711s">I</a>  definitely hear Councilors Garpelli's concerns about parking I think that making sure that we're not obstructing the roadway to ensure the safety of the roadway is really really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=871.995s">On</a>  the other hand, it's kind of hard for me to look at a potential commercial space and have it go underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=876.379s">You</a>  know, I think that we see the issue of cars parked where they shouldn't be all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=881.483s">To</a>  me, that's an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=882.844s">You</a>  know, I don't want us to be tampering down on commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=884.986s">I'd</a>  rather see rather CSB doing proper enforcement of where people shouldn't shouldn't be parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=890.07s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=891.131s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=893.233s">Mr.</a>  Is there anything else that you want to share for your presentation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=898.333s">No,</a>  that pretty much does it in case anyone has any questions, but that's pretty much the overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=902.515s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=904.036s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=906.417s">Whereas</a>  this is a public hearing, I need to open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=909.078s">So</a>  we're going to open up this public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=911.28s">If</a>  there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper, please either come up to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=918.343s">And</a>  that would be you as well, Mr. Hurtubise, saying you're in favor of this paper, I assume.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=927.882s">Yes,</a>  to go on the record, I'm in favor of this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=930.883s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=932.443s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak in favor of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=935.384s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=939.085s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak against this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=942.826s">Please</a>  come up to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=949.39s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=953.112s">So</a>  we do have a motion to approve from Councilor Knights second. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=956.874s">I</a>  had a second but sounds like my Councilor Carmel, but we did have something raised brought to our attention by director of planning development sustainability hunt today, and that our recent update to the zoning <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=968.952s">We</a>  had the process was changed to send special permit to this, the Community Development Board for opinion before voting on it by bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=977.624s">In</a>  further review, we actually found that there was some conditions on that even prior to the reconfiguration so it's not just a reconfiguration thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=986.69s">My</a>  recommendation would be twofold, would be to approve pending any comment or feedback from the Community Development Board, as well as the six day public comment period, if we can amend to that.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1013.88s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1014.161s">All</a>  right, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1016.303s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1019.706s">I</a>  was reviewing this and there are some criteria that's supposed to be reviewed about the social and economic community needs, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities and other public services, compatibility with the other structures in the neighborhood, impacts on the natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1041.11s">and</a>  the proposals compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1044.931s">Um,</a>  and so when this is referred to the development board we're happy to just reply back with that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1054.295s">Um,</a>  there is the ability to put conditions on this but as this is already a completely built out location. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1061.897s">I'm</a>  not clear that any of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1064.023s">conditions</a>  that are allowed under our zoning ordinances would be relevant for this, but the city council would be, or the, sorry, the city board would be happy to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1074.432s">Just</a>  to be clear, it doesn't require a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1077.875s">So</a>  we would just put it on the next available city board meeting, which I don't have that date in front of me, but it is not tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1086.322s">Tomorrow</a>  night, there is a city board hearing, but we need to put it, we need 48 hours notice to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1093.458s">And</a>  then we would get back to the city council with the letter with our recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1100.503s">On</a>  first glance, it seems like it would be a lovely addition to the neighborhood and the benefit to the residents, but that's the city board will weigh in on that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1110.305s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1111.426s">So</a>  Councilor Knight, you had a motion and would you like to amend it? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1114.408s">We'll</a>  take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1115.328s">So</a>  we have the motion from Vice President Bears to approve pending comments from the Community Development Board and the six day public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1124.314s">I</a>  think we have a second from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1126.575s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, do you have that language? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1129.117s">Okay,</a>  please call the roll when you are ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1133.099s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1135.04s">He</a>  got it first. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1149.024s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative zero negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1151.546s">The</a>  motion passes 23-084 legal notice of a public hearing the Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in the Howard F Alden chambers at Medford City Hall 85 George P has to drive Medford and via zoom on Tuesday, April 25 2023 at 7pm, a link to be posted no later than Friday, April 21 2023 on a petition from a lean teen doing business as mainly in spiritual shop 16 Main Street <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1175.486s">Medford</a>  Mass for a paranormal license and for a special permit for use for retail and services, paranormal services and sales in accordance with Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, to operate a retail and service establishment at 16 Main Street, Medford Mass, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1190.834s">Said</a>  site being located in a commercial 1C1 zoning district as follows, use for retail and services, paranormal service and sales under Section 5.F of Medford Zoning Ordinances, Chapter 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1203.373s">petition</a>  and plans may be seen the office of the city clerk room 103 Medford City Hall Medford mass call 781-393-2425 for accommodations aids the city of Medford is an EEO a 504 employee by order of the city council sign Adam L her to be city clerk advertised in the Medford transcript and some rural journal, April 6, and April <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1224.214s">Do</a>  we have a representative? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1229.277s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1229.937s">If</a>  the petitioner wants to come up, just give us a brief overview of the permit, the special permit you're seeking. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1237.381s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1326.815s">How</a>  many employees are employed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1328.396s">It's</a>  just myself.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1329.496s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1329.996s">And</a>  this is a business that runs successfully in neighboring communities, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1334.959s">Say</a>  that again?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1335.499s">This</a>  is a business that also runs in a neighboring community?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1337.7s">It</a>  can, yes.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1342.649s">No,</a>  I think this is something different and if it brings more people to the square, I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1351.313s">And</a>  I might find myself there one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1358.496s">Everybody</a>  can use some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1359.556s">So</a>  anyway, so I wouldn't seek to move approval, but I know it's public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1365.698s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1367.559s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1369.56s">So</a>  in reviewing this, we were looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1372.558s">the</a>  definition of paranormal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1375.08s">And</a>  see, this is where we needed an attorney to give us a little guidance on exactly the meaning of what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1384.667s">And,</a>  you know, there's some language here that I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm a little confused with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1388.91s">So</a>  when I heard the paranormal licensing itself, I was a little bit confused because immediately my mind went to, you know, ghosts and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1396.996s">So</a>  I was like, wait a minute, but I guess <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1401.081s">from</a>  the works that I would do or provide as services, it falls under that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1405.945s">So</a>  there's a variety of what is paranormal in that sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1409.848s">I'm</a>  still trying to understand it myself.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1411.67s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1412.411s">See,</a>  if we had an attorney to give us a little, so I guess a little bit more clarity on what the definition is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1420.117s">I</a>  mean, if you like my opinion, I believe it falls under like the act of arts in a sense, um, spiritually speaking, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1427.625s">For</a>  me to be working with stones and energy, it's a spiritual realm, so most people wouldn't know exactly how to, I guess, I don't label it, so it's under that, I mean, it's under the act of paranormal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1440.75s">I</a>  don't understand it 100% either, but it was interesting to me as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1448.209s">I'm</a>  just a little hesitant voting on something that I really have no knowledge of and no clarity on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1454.974s">Is</a>  there anything I can do to help?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1456.515s">No,</a>  I'm just saying, before you came in, myself and the other council, we were looking at the definition of paranormal, and I was just a little confused on some of the definitions on what the meanings of the services that are provided under a definition of paranormal.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1475.263s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1476.805s">Thank</a>  you, President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1477.946s">Thank</a>  you for being here to share more about your, your business and I was looking also at the definition of this type of retail establishment in our current setting code and I have to agree with my fellow Councilor or the definition that exists in our muni code is certainly outdated included some. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1495.188s">interesting</a>  references from whenever it was written, but in this case, you know, clearly from your description, it's a store that's providing services and retail of a spiritual inclination. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1506.273s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli, I think this is going to bring an interesting flavor to Medford Square that doesn't currently exist there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1513.116s">And</a>  you know, towards the goal of bringing more people of all different inclinations to our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1519.439s">I</a>  think this could be a great thing for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1520.86s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1522.267s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1524.809s">Yes,</a>  I think it is important to point out you know the term paranormal is a dated term that's included in a zoning act and the question isn't whether or not they're performing functions that are paranormal in nature it's, you know, whether or not this <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1538.97s">function</a>  that they're performing where when it's best fit is underneath the zoning act right now that's what it falls under based upon the definitions that have been provided to us beforehand I certainly have no problem with the entrepreneur pursuing an opportunity to create a very successful business here in the city of Medford especially in a downtown district and that there is a market for this type of business I mean we see <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1563.498s">Salem</a>  Massachusetts for example with thrives on this type of business so I mean I wish you the best of luck and you certainly have my support.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1571.019s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1571.799s">I</a>  was gonna say at least it's another bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1575.34s">So,</a>  but on this specific motion after we open the public hearing I just, I would, I would like to make the same motion that we made on the prior special permit, but I'll wait for the public here to be open for the discussion accounts at this time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1590.022s">Seeing</a>  none, as this is a public hearing we need to open up the public hearing so <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1593.648s">anyone</a>  who would like to speak in favor of this petition, please raise your hand on zoom or come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1599.433s">Assuming</a>  you are in favor of this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1601.514s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1601.915s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1602.875s">Do</a>  you want to, you can come up and give your name just so we can just for the record, just officially.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1899.055s">Okay,</a>  so we did, we submitted the report, but you know how it is, there's heavy traffic in city hall, it took longer than expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1908.145s">But</a>  finally, we synchronized our time today, so we're gonna do the presentation and make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1914.691s">I</a>  believe almost everything in here, you have seen it, you heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1919.012s">But</a>  the thing is, we're trying to get the community on board to understand what we're trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1924.496s">Because</a>  you have to remember, we are still in a transition mode, from one form of election office to another form of election office. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1934.422s">I</a>  think you guys created that office anyway, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1937.715s">So</a>  we're talking about complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1940.316s">Were</a>  there any complaint? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1941.756s">Okay,</a>  if you show me a good election, any election without a complaint, it won't be an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1948.438s">It'll</a>  be a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1951.018s">There's</a>  always issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1952.879s">It's</a>  what you do with the issues that's more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1957.76s">So</a>  for instance, one of the first thing, we had an issue with pole pads. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1962.481s">We</a>  know what took place with the pole pads. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1965.958s">that</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1978.165s">Our</a>  spare, we had our spare, just in case. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1981.007s">Because</a>  anything computerized, you can go, they take the electricity, you need to find your voters list. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1988.751s">But</a>  one of the thing that I personally, on November election, I stopped to 16%. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1996.956s">The</a>  reason I didn't say 18, because two of them <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2001.646s">the</a>  same <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2012.694s">up</a>  and running, except for one, because we run into an issue at the former Columbus School because it was open lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2020.256s">I'm</a>  sure some of you I spoke with on that day that we had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2024.998s">We</a>  had to go through the firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2028.019s">But</a>  we know how to deal with that the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2030.219s">It's</a>  not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2031.36s">As</a>  we speak right now, we have election coming up in September and November. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2039.162s">I</a>  didn't skip the early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2040.963s">This</a>  is a total <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2042.503s">different</a>  game, because it's going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2046.287s">We</a>  already made contact with every location that we're going to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2054.536s">We</a>  confirmed everybody's going to be on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2058.0s">Now,</a>  we went a little bit further than that, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2061.423s">Hey,</a>  if I go there, you're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2063.726s">Who</a>  do I call? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2066.175s">Backup</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2067.776s">Well,</a>  suppose backup number one get into an accident coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2071.699s">Who</a>  do I call? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2072.559s">Backup</a>  number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2073.94s">So,</a>  we went from one tier to three level to get that in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2078.703s">So,</a>  that's one of the thing I think you guys should give us a medal for doing that because it makes things work faster, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2089.65s">There</a>  will, we had another issue that was the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2097.175s">That</a>  was a terrible night. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2100.477s">We</a>  run longer than expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2102.459s">We</a>  have API sitting right here, okay, waiting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2108.183s">Unofficial</a>  is unofficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2111.005s">That</a>  night, we tried to contact backup to guide us to what we were gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2119.312s">We're</a>  realizing the time, it was gonna be the day after the election, we made a commission <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2127.07s">We</a>  said, we don't give them the commission, the numbers for today, the one that went to the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2134.172s">By</a>  tomorrow, we'll put everything together and give them still unofficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2139.094s">Within</a>  two days, called by the Massachusetts General Law, we give you the official count. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2145.756s">So</a>  we've done well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2147.116s">Will</a>  that ever happen again? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2149.682s">I</a>  doubt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2150.602s">I</a>  don't think so because now we already contracted with LHS to be here on site with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2159.306s">Because</a>  we were trying to save money, but I said, LHS, ah, you don't have to show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2163.427s">We</a>  can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2164.648s">But</a>  things happen, you want them to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2167.229s">So</a>  the contract is there, signed, they will be with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2170.47s">So</a>  whatever happen, we'll take action towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2173.311s">So</a>  that was the problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2175.672s">Signage.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2177.272s">A</a>  lot of people talk about signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2180.942s">I</a>  don't know if any one of you remember, because I'm the oldest guy in the room right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2184.843s">You</a>  can say not, because I'm older than you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2188.124s">That</a>  day was really windy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2190.584s">It</a>  was windy like crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2193.225s">The</a>  signage we brought, we brought a bunch of new ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2197.766s">You</a>  couldn't put them outside, because there's no place to anchor them on the concrete in front of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2205.228s">Even</a>  if you put them, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2208.545s">Anywhere,</a>  you will have to tie them, and people won't see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2213.391s">Signage</a>  was complete, it was okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2217.276s">I</a>  was dispatched by the election manager, if I do recall, to a specific place for signage, and I went there, we had it in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2229.719s">that</a>  was something that came up because even I personally receive a lot of phone calls about payroll to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2235.743s">This</a>  is something is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2237.304s">People</a>  don't see money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2238.145s">They</a>  go, they panic. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2239.166s">They</a>  go crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2240.106s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2240.807s">Me,</a>  I don't see money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2242.128s">I</a>  relax. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2242.748s">I</a>  have done this work here as a volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2247.167s">It</a>  took them longer to pay me, but I know it's money now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2250.39s">The</a>  money is there, so I'll wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2252.372s">But</a>  we work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2254.533s">I</a>  even spoke with some of the councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2257.136s">I</a>  spoke with the branch of government here responsible to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2261.98s">Eventually,</a>  everybody got paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2264.041s">OK,</a>  that was a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2266.804s">Almost</a>  to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2268.864s">And</a>  this is the one that hurt me the most, because that transition was done, and I have no idea at the time I was in charge of a political organization, didn't know when that word was created. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2280.487s">I</a>  found out the hard way. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2281.607s">I'm</a>  still trying to understand the logic behind it, the concept behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2287.408s">We</a>  have seven to A, we have six to A. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2291.549s">There's</a>  a lack of voter education. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2293.951s">If</a>  most of you recall, in 2022, we took the entire month of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2300.116s">We</a>  conducted voter education here with the high school, with the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2305.901s">We</a>  did it at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2309.864s">Should</a>  we hold ourselves responsible because our citizens are not fully educated on voters? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2316.329s">I</a>  would say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2318.136s">But</a>  you can always say no, because me, as an intelligent voter, if I go to a polling station to vote for someone, I'm gonna find out everyone who walks to a polling station knows them well who they're gonna vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2334.786s">So</a>  if you look on that, their name is not there, you can always go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2339.782s">and</a>  tell them, I think we worked this one out, we informed you, and you were happy, you sent us some good information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2347.49s">So</a>  the thing we're trying to do, we say, you know, how do we gonna stop that from ever happening again? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2352.715s">Well,</a>  you know how it's gonna, when you walk, you're gonna know exactly where to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2357.139s">If</a>  you're 62A, you're gonna go to 62A. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2361.003s">That</a>  way you don't have to get any ballot from, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2364.386s">you</a>  know, the guy from six to just if I could, Madam President, really quickly.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2369.913s">And</a>  just to clarify, this is because we created our priest, the state made it there, they did their redistricting after we did our reprieving thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2376.441s">So</a>  there's some people who are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2379.024s">Basically,</a>  there's two legislative districts that overlap precinct boundaries inaccurately. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2382.908s">So</a>  there's a piece of a precinct <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2384.61s">in</a>  one state rep district and a piece of a precinct in another state rep district. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2388.473s">And</a>  that's because they, I just wanted to clarify how we got here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2393.096s">We</a>  could have done better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2394.397s">We</a>  could have make it in a way where you isolate each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2398.019s">No,</a>  I completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2399.74s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2401.622s">And</a>  we're working on that, but in the near future, on the next election, you know exactly where you're going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2407.265s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2407.725s">You</a>  628, this is where you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2409.106s">We</a>  are in the process of looking for other avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2412.006s">We'll</a>  be circling back to you guys to help us get site in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2416.867s">You</a>  know, one of our biggest challenge is ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2420.268s">Not</a>  too many buildings that we can use have access to my friends, the elders, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2427.79s">So</a>  that was the issue.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2430.811s">I</a>  appreciate the solutions focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2431.971s">I</a>  just wanted people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2433.612s">It</a>  was the pandemic delay in the census that then the state house decided to force us to re-precinct before they redistricted. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2439.554s">So</a>  for the first time in probably 200 years, we had legislative districts that didn't line up with precinct boundaries.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2445.315s">I'm</a>  not that old.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2448.196s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2448.696s">I</a>  think you're right, vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2451.177s">So</a>  what we're going to do from there on, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2455.815s">Already</a>  we're talking in the election office about voter education, which is mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2461.165s">We</a>  have to keep on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2462.968s">We</a>  gotta do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2464.211s">We're</a>  working with... <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2467.345s">the</a>  school to see how we get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2470.127s">We're</a>  working with the elders to see how we get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2473.869s">But</a>  we're working about new ideas, how to put it in our website, how to get involved with reverse 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2482.294s">We</a>  had never used that in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2484.916s">Okay,</a>  we gotta do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2489.905s">something</a>  when you go, a flash information on your website when you go there so you know exactly when and where we have elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2499.59s">So</a>  all these little things are in the process of happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2503.912s">Challenge</a>  and issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2506.94s">election</a>  workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2508.06s">That's</a>  one of the biggest issues we face in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2510.741s">Okay,</a>  why? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2511.541s">Sometimes</a>  we don't have enough people to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2513.642s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2514.362s">You</a>  confirm with a guy or a lady who's gonna be here working with you tomorrow, and they don't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2521.784s">They</a>  don't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2522.424s">When</a>  they don't show up, you have to drag the next person in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2527.025s">But</a>  that next person in line had something else going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2529.986s">So</a>  it makes it a little challenging to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2532.327s">But</a>  right now, we did an audit of the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2536.96s">Workers,</a>  and we're trying to change their status to see if they can get them interested in what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2543.802s">And</a>  so far, it went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2545.182s">It's</a>  working. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2547.803s">New</a>  leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2549.724s">You</a>  know, anytime you change leadership, you have challenges, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2555.405s">I've</a>  been so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2557.026s">I</a>  didn't know the election manager until we start working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2561.327s">I</a>  think the team works well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2563.848s">You</a>  can sit down, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2565.568s">iron</a>  what's not working, what is working, and make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2570.616s">Because</a>  we all have the same objective, make the election of Medford-Rothschild square and fair, and smooth too. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2581.244s">You</a>  guys gonna be up this year, you probably see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2584.565s">I</a>  had conversation with some of you about things that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2587.627s">You're</a>  aware of what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2589.887s">But</a>  one thing I will recommend as I'm speaking, maybe my last chance, who knows, I'm an old guy, I may not see tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2597.21s">Don't</a>  be afraid to make a phone call to find out what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2600.451s">Because</a>  people call me anytime they wanna call me, they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2603.513s">And</a>  anytime I wanna call you guys, I do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2605.873s">So</a>  let's have a conversation because we all want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2609.995s">for</a>  the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2618.403s">Right</a>  now, there's something we haven't seen in the city, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2623.548s">We're</a>  in the process of seeing how to utilize that pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2628.498s">pole</a>  pads where the workers can remotely access them should there is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2635.959s">Because</a>  when you say computers, everybody shake in the city of Medford, even my wife, who is smarter than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2643.561s">I</a>  mean, most of you knows my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2645.681s">When</a>  you say computers, she shake. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2647.962s">And</a>  that goes for all our workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2651.903s">So</a>  we're working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2654.984s">We</a>  talk about census. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2657.547s">One</a>  of the key recommendation, there was a lot of question asked, are we going to do the following? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2662.232s">Most</a>  of you receive your census the same way as everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2666.097s">No</a>  one told us how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2668.019s">It</a>  was up, the city, the election manager said, that's how we got to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2673.785s">So</a>  right now we on, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2676.061s">Right</a>  on top of our game with the census, we're working with the second wave of people who fail to send their confirmation back. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2685.345s">But</a>  one of the key thing you got to remember, we have no control over the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2689.888s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2691.323s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2692.304s">We</a>  made arrangements a few years back to make it smooth, because when you send a letter from Medford to Medford, from City Hall to Medford, it used to go from City Hall to Medford to Boston, then back to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2707.128s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2707.929s">So</a>  we had to work that out with the, uh, Paul, uh, Paul master. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2713.692s">And</a>  he says, okay, this is what we're going to do anything to do with election. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2717.815s">It</a>  will go Medford to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2720.636s">So</a>  we broke that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2721.977s">So</a>  it's not our control. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2723.478s">That's</a>  federal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2724.759s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2725.499s">So</a>  this is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2729.422s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2730.25s">Moving</a>  forward, we're already moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2732.471s">For</a>  those who doesn't know, because I spoke with one of you who didn't know, we had our election calendar already posted, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2739.434s">Because</a>  right now we're in a cycle of town election. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2743.635s">And</a>  following town election, there'll be city election. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2748.357s">That's</a>  when informations are there for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2753.379s">You</a>  will be happy after looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2755.22s">Don't</a>  forget to send the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2759.528s">notes,</a>  because a lot of you will be happy what's been what took place and makes it easy to go through and avoid any error. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2768.632s">I</a>  will rest my case unless you have any questions for any one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2772.814s">But</a>  I know I know he was gonna ask questions.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3163.788s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3165.009s">This</a>  is a project I'm very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3166.73s">This</a>  is something that I think dates back to the Burke administration, and it's something that the director, the executive director, Director Driscoll has been keeping us very well apprised of over the years in terms of the progress that's being made in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3181.08s">I</a>  just want to commend him for the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3183.622s">This</a>  is one of many funding sources that the Housing Authority has been able to utilize to renovate and revitalize the passes over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3190.468s">And</a>  this project is going to be good for our community, good for our seniors, and it's going to be good in addressing some of the affordable housing shortages that we have here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3198.315s">And</a>  for those reasons, I'll be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3201.317s">When</a>  we look back at the application that's before us, what comes to mind for me is the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3211.063s">multiple,</a>  five, six public meetings that we've had on this previously already to discuss what's going on, prepare us for what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3219.653s">That's</a>  the way that financial management should take place in a municipality, especially one of this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3224.959s">So,</a>  again, I commend Executive Director Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3227.882s">for</a>  all those work in keeping us informed and for seeing this project through from its beginning stages to its end. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3234.603s">It's</a>  all too often that we see press releases that say what we're gonna do, but then we never see what we say we're gonna do get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3241.505s">And</a>  I've always known Jeff to be someone that leads by results and not by press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3246.666s">And</a>  this right here is proof of the pudding, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3248.586s">So</a>  I certainly thank the Community Preservation Committee for their favorable recommendation and I move for approval on the application statement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3278.239s">Do</a>  you want to just come up just so we can hear you on the mic?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3282.953s">sorry,</a>  Madam President, Jeffrey Driscoll, I'm the executive director of the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3288.455s">Presently,</a>  there's 144 units on the site that will be increased to 198, and then there will be 40 additional units that will be family units.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3298.46s">Right,</a>  so we'll be adding families into that group.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3300.901s">Yes,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3301.681s">And</a>  some of those 40 units, in particular, 24 of them, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3307.964s">will</a>  be in a building that will be accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3311.525s">And</a>  there will be there will be accessible units available for families handicapped accessible.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3316.986s">And</a>  what about for seniors? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3319.246s">Would</a>  there be sections for seniors only?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3321.067s">Or</a>  will they be mixed in with everybody else that what what we're anticipating doing is on the back end of the site to construct a mid rise building. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3331.729s">That</a>  will house the, the elderly, the seniors, and disabled individuals, and around this, the side and the front of the development will be townhouses. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3344.381s">And</a>  in the middle of the development will be a 24 unit building with with elevator access.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3350.987s">So,</a>  a couple of concerns that I've heard from neighbors is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3354.134s">They're</a>  concerned about the train and the pollution from the train.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3356.555s">How</a>  do you address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3359.136s">The</a>  way the design is presently structured, we're in schematic design right now, and the way that it's presently structured, we're looking to minimize the impact of the rails and the noise from that on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3373.343s">We</a>  anticipate with today's construction, we will be able to not necessarily eliminate it entirely, but certainly minimize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3381.907s">The</a>  residents that are at that site right now have a fairly close proximity to the tracks as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3390.333s">We'll</a>  actually be improving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3392.255s">Will</a>  there be sound barriers put up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3394.096s">Not</a>  necessarily sound barriers, but the construction will take into consideration the noise that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3400.3s">And</a>  we've actually already had a study done dealing with the noise and how to minimize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3407.826s">And</a>  the design will take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3409.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3410.708s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3415.608s">If</a>  I may, I also have with me my support staff here to be able to provide assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3421.971s">I</a>  have the chairperson of the Housing Authority, Rosa Chiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3426.614s">Gabe</a>  Ciccarello is the director of modernization and procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3429.976s">And</a>  Margaret Moran is our development consultant, who's been working very closely with us, who's done a fantastic job.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3439.161s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3440.422s">Commissioner</a>  Driscoll, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3441.863s">I</a>  know that this is something that you've been very transparent, and it's always a pleasure when you have the actual commissioner and his team come with concerns or issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3454.811s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3455.711s">We've</a>  got, we've had a few emails and concerns about lack of lack of community input which I don't see, I didn't see where that that fell into place I think that you've been so transparent in that format and really involve the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3471.852s">And</a>  again, I think that any housing right now in this format is so needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3479.257s">And</a>  anywhere we can find the space to make sure that we can enhance housing for <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3486.862s">a</a>  demographic that has been missed, I think that is a huge win. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3491.284s">So</a>  we appreciate, I appreciate what you have done as a leader and moving forward to make sure that Medford has options for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3502.768s">So</a>  I thank you for your commitment and I applaud <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3506.81s">your</a>  efforts and how you presented this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3508.911s">This</a>  isn't something that you hid behind a desk and all of a sudden it came out and you know, the commissioner shows up or send someone there just to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3517.473s">It</a>  takes takes questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3519.013s">You've</a>  always been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3520.514s">And</a>  that's what's always been. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3521.694s">I</a>  tell you sometimes it's not comfortable, but you've always stood at that podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3527.276s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3529.156s">And</a>  also bringing your team and <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3531.957s">them</a>  willing to sit there and stand beside you is a huge testament of who you are as a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3536.839s">So,</a>  um, like I said, we've been talking about affordable housing and housing for seniors and like, and I'll repeat it just because I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3547.102s">It's</a>  not ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3548.342s">It's</a>  not a penthouse on the water on Mystic Ave on the Mystic River, but it is the step in the right direction and I applaud it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3557.205s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3558.205s">Thank</a>  you very much for the kind words.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3560.285s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3560.745s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3562.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3563.267s">Um,</a>  as much as I would like to live on that in that house on the mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3567.849s">Um,</a>  I think I joined my fellow Councilors and saying that I believe that this is a good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3574.333s">Um,</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3576.238s">wherever</a>  you go in the city, whoever you talk to, no matter their income background, political background, we're hearing that housing is a problem, that lack of housing is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3586.044s">And</a>  there are many ways that we can solve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3589.706s">And</a>  given the state of the crisis that we're in, we definitely will need to use more of the tools in the toolbox than just increasing supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3600.573s">But</a>  increasing housing supply is something that I think most of the city can get behind, and economists of all colors, of all stripes, housing activists of all backgrounds too, can get behind this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3616.371s">We've</a>  heard about this project for, for a while now I remember sitting, all of us sitting in a meeting, perhaps a year ago, I'm hearing about this project, and I'm very excited to see this come before on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3631.562s">I</a>  know that there are concerns, but no project is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3635.145s">What</a>  we need to do right now is address the real crisis that we have at our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3641.91s">And</a>  we need to start to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3645.393s">And</a>  we need to take those first steps and this is a very impressive step that will move our city in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3653.479s">So</a>  I thank the Commissioner, I thank all of you guys for the hard work that you put into this project and in soliciting feedback from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3662.193s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3663.414s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3665.616s">Thank</a>  you, President Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3666.457s">Thank</a>  you so much, Director Driscoll for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3668.559s">I'm</a>  glad that we get the opportunity to vote in support of this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3673.244s">I</a>  know you were here January last year for an earlier step in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3676.587s">I</a>  just think that this is a really great example of how, you know, public housing and Medford investing in public housing can, you know, be a great example of what affordable housing should be in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3687.137s">So</a>  I'm glad that this CPC recommendation came through so that Medford can invest in its own public housing locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3693.48s">I</a>  think that this really exemplifies that, you know, to build to expand public housing in the community is expensive it takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3701.124s">We</a>  need to be making these investments early and often adding 98 affordable units to our community is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3708.247s">such</a>  an important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3709.527s">And</a>  I know it's been a multi step multi year process that you've been shepherding. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3713.089s">And</a>  I think that's just really important for people to understand like how much it takes to be adding these permanently affordable units to our community, as well as just exemplifying that affordable housing can look like a lot of things that can be that can look like a lot of different types of households, different types of families, but that it should be rehabilitated, it should be modern, it should be high quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3732.635s">I</a>  think that this is just a really a really great example of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3735.416s">I'm</a>  glad that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3736.876s">to</a>  be able to, you know, chip again. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3737.856s">Um</a>  you know, part of our fair share of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3739.817s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3740.357s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3741.297s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3741.798s">Vice</a>  is embarrassed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3742.798s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3743.738s">Thank</a>  you, Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3744.278s">Just</a>  for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3745.159s">Three</a>  questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3746.279s">One</a>  trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3747.759s">Is</a>  there any way in the plan to preserve more of the mature trees that are currently on site?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3752.061s">Yes,</a>  it's an issue that we've dealt with already. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3754.762s">Um,</a>  there's been, um, questions raised relative to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3759.383s">We've</a>  had an arborist come out and do a study <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3762.744s">of</a>  all the trees that are on the site and give us a report on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3766.306s">And</a>  I can tell you that we are going to save as many trees as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3771.65s">At</a>  this point in time, we're still in the design stage, so I can't tell you what's going to stay and what's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3777.654s">But</a>  we're not going to knock down any trees unless they absolutely have to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3781.576s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3783.317s">Second,</a>  just a little bit more on the on the kind of notification and process for existing residents and kind of neighboring of butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3790.081s">Can</a>  you just go into like when residents were first informed, and how many times they've been informed you don't have to be exact on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3797.164s">Oh,</a>  I don't have a list in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3799.986s">But</a>  I can tell you, do you have that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3805.288s">We</a>  actually have a have another meeting scheduled for Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3820.585s">We've</a>  had five resident meetings and four community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3824.866s">And</a>  we started this in early, we started, we began with a project feasibility in early 2020, but we began in earnest the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3837.271s">I</a>  would say, correct me if I'm wrong, a year after that, maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3842.433s">We've</a>  been ongoing with the residents we schedule them at 130 and four o'clock on Thursday afternoon, and then we meet with the neighbors at 630 that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3856.428s">I</a>  believe there's been five or six resident meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3860.652s">and</a>  four community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3862.753s">This</a>  will be the fifth this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3865.074s">We've</a>  been very open. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3866.695s">The</a>  designers have done an excellent job, the architects, in providing the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3873.058s">I've</a>  attended, my staff has attended all of the presentations, and we're trying to be as open as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3880.342s">We've</a>  taken the input from the community and tried to incorporate that into what it is that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3887.225s">There</a>  are certain things, though, that the community has requested that we just can't do because of the zoning changes over the years from when Walkling Court was initially constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3898.995s">One</a>  of the issues was to see if we could not have a thruway through Walkling Court and continue to maintain the circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3907.962s">We</a>  have investigated that fully, and that's not something that would be a recommendation in particular of the fire department to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3914.387s">So,</a>  therefore, we can't take into consideration that going forward but as with the, my answer as far as the trees are concerned, anything that we can do that's recommended or suggested by the neighbors would certainly consider that and attempt to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3927.538s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3927.838s">Yeah,</a>  and along those same lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3929.94s">for</a>  the residents during construction? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3931.521s">Are</a>  they either going to be housed during construction if they can't if their units being demolished or rebuilt? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3937.123s">And</a>  will they have the right to return?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3938.423s">Another</a>  excellent question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3940.224s">First</a>  off, I'll answer the second aspect of that first. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3942.885s">Yes,</a>  they will have a right to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3945.386s">We</a>  are in the process and I think the councils are aware we're in the process right now of over $100 million renovation of 121 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3956.75s">And</a>  we have a relocation project in dealing with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3962.854s">And</a>  those residents have either moved within the building, or they've moved from the building to some of our other sites, or that we have given them a Section 8 voucher. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3974.88s">And</a>  we actually have one individual who received a Section 8 voucher and moved to Florida permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3981.505s">and</a>  they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3983.628s">We</a>  would offer the same thing for WalkLink. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3986.571s">And</a>  the way that we're looking to do this is it's a two phase project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3990.856s">First</a>  phase is for the elderly disabled, the mid rise, the back of the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3996.043s">And</a>  what we will do is take possibly five of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3999.627s">there</a>  and demolish those those individuals would be relocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4003.992s">We</a>  have been in discussions with the state not to fill the vacancies and we'll continue to have those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4010.018s">We</a>  haven't gotten authorization yet because it is a state development but eventually we will get the authorization not to fill those vacancies and with the vacancies in the front of the development we will relocate people from the back <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4022.75s">and</a>  we will also relocate them into our other housing throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4028.016s">Once</a>  we have those buildings emptied out, we will then begin the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4035.884s">And</a>  once the construction is over, those folks that live at the front of the development will move immediately into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4043.335s">folks</a>  who were moved to another site will have the opportunity to move back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4049.162s">And</a>  the Housing Authority takes care of all the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4051.565s">It</a>  takes care of the cost of the initial move, the move back, and also assisting them with any services that they may have had at Walkling Court will continue at the other sites.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4062.197s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4063.439s">That's</a>  really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4064.66s">Last</a>  question is a little bit bigger picture, and if you don't have the answer in front of you I totally understand it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4069.947s">If</a>  I don't have the answer I'll make it up to you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4072.029s">It's</a>  not a curveball but it's just kind of in the larger context. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4076.132s">I'm</a>  no expert on this but my basic understanding is that there's something called Fairchild that's federal law and that is the maximum number of public housing units that we could have in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4085.721s">How</a>  far below that are we and how much does between this project and 121 how close does that bring us up an excellent, an excellent question again, faircloth faircloth.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4095.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4096.071s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4096.731s">Right</a>  now, we're 83 units below. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4101.548s">And</a>  basically what that is, it's an allocation on paper of the number of public housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4107.493s">So</a>  one of the benefits of the SALT installed development is that there's 200 units there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4116.901s">Commissioner</a>  Scott, Councilor Scarpelli, you indicated about the addition of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4123.266s">Well,</a>  we have 200 units now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4125.888s">When</a>  we're done with the renovation, we'll have 22 additional units. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4130.188s">There's</a>  a master plan for that site that would afford us the ability to put 88 more units on that site at some future time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4138.672s">We're</a>  not looking to do that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4139.973s">That's</a>  at 121 Riverside? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4141.534s">At</a>  121 Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4143.035s">By</a>  virtue of what we're doing and the renovation that is undergoing and the authorization we got from the federal government, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4150.278s">those</a>  200 units that are there now will be added to the Faircloth. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4155.56s">So</a>  that will mean that in the future, there are 200 public housing subsidies available to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4164.443s">And</a>  that would make that 283. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4166.264s">Some</a>  of those will be utilized <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4170.565s">for</a>  the Walking Court project, the construction project and the funding of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4175.847s">Others</a>  will have a project-based Section 8 voucher that will be attached to the unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4182.13s">And</a>  when I say attached to the unit, someone can pick up and take that and go someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4188.293s">If</a>  they move, they move without the subsidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4190.334s">The</a>  subsidy will remain in the unit.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4192.355s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4192.696s">Thank</a>  you so much for answering the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4194.116s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4194.597s">And</a>  having it, even though you weren't.</p>

    <p>[b-MzuLbfz14_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4217.272s">I'm</a>  going to start with Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street, and that is in a Medford public housing, um, administered building. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4224.118s">Um</a>  I've been extremely excited about this, just like many people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4228.121s">I</a>  mean, we've been hearing about this for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4230.363s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4230.923s">Talk</a>  to Jeff about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4231.784s">Just</a>  talk to housing Medford about <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4239.364s">being,</a>  you know, gratitude for the work that Jeff has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4242.446s">In</a>  my experience as a, you know, a tenant of one of these buildings, in general, Jeff's been extremely responsive to me with all the work that he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4249.69s">And</a>  I think that, you know, I think almost every community, I would hope that every community has, you know, in this country around the world would have an executive director of a housing authority as ambitious as Jeff in getting these projects done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4261.605s">and</a>  it's also been really wonderful that we've had Roberta Cameron heading up the Community Preservation Committee to kind of shepherd this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4268.249s">And</a>  there's another name that was mentioned today, which is Losa Janvier, who is the chair of the Board of Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4275.352s">And</a>  I'm extremely happy that, you know, there's been a lot of progress with the Housing Authority over the past year, especially that Losa, like myself, is an actual resident of these communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4287.298s">these</a>  units and is the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4289.503s">So</a>  the Board of Commissioners actually has an actual tenant of these buildings who is heading up the commission, which is extremely exciting for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4298.344s">But</a>  I just wanted to, yeah, I think that we should all be very grateful to have these three people working for us in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4306.028s">Nearly</a>  100 units is incredible, considering all these NIMBY whining with so much development that people try to block to prevent people from being able to be members of our community, actually be able to live here and affordably. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4320.014s">I</a>  just want to say, though, that this is a major capital expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4325.436s">So</a>  this is getting new units. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4327.137s">currently</a>  there's a campaign that's going on, mostly, you know, it's directed at the state house to increase the operating budget so we can increase the amount of money that goes to, you know, taking care of these units after they're constructed and taking care of, you know, the state housing, because this is the one state project building of all the housing authority buildings, you know, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4353.266s">And</a>  what I've read is that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4355.515s">a</a>  lack of parity as far as these federal and state buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4359.536s">I</a>  don't know how the budget's administered by the Housing Authority, but what I've read is that the federal government gives us much, much more money for each one of these federal units than the state government gives us for these state buildings, if people understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4372.9s">There</a>  are federally-owned buildings administered by the Housing Authority, and then there is one state-owned building. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4379.241s">And</a>  so, you know, there's a campaign going on, and we're trying to raise money so there'll be more operating money to make sure that those buildings, the rest of the, I mean, that particular, those new units and all the rest of the units in the state building, you know, have all the funding that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4395.224s">So</a>  I'm just, you know, really, really appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4398.405s">I'm</a>  glad that there is so much support, and this is really, really exciting for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4402.286s">Thank</a>  you so much, Jeff, Verda, and Losa.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4794.67s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4796.792s">This</a>  is the first of three. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4800.786s">proposals</a>  tonight on the council agenda relative to specific charter amendments to the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4807.01s">We</a>  first discussed this over a month ago and regular session and we had a committee of the whole meeting this month on the matter, and I really appreciated the thoughtful comments of all my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4818.518s">on</a>  this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4819.699s">I</a>  think echoing what that Councilor Caraviello said our committee of the whole is that this really focuses on the city council around a purpose which is making sure that we have the authority that we need to conduct oversight and and also to make sure that we are having real voice and input and bringing the people's voice and input to the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4840.277s">I</a>  think I won't rehash everything that we've discussed in the past two times. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4843.239s">We've</a>  discussed this, but the city charter of the city of Medford, as acknowledged by many, many elected officials, including the mayor, is one of the strongest planning charters in the Commonwealth, which means that the mayor's office is incredibly strong and the council's powers are not so strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4859.351s">And</a>  this is one way that we can take action very quickly through some common sense measures to rectify that and make sure that the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4868.791s">not</a>  just should be a partner but must be a partner at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4872.913s">When</a>  it comes to things like the city budget and appointments of members of boards and commissions and making sure that we have the legal advice that we need, which kind of came up tonight once again and it comes up pretty much every meeting that we have the legal advice and support that we need to make the best decisions possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4888.439s">on</a>  this and the other two proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4890.78s">I'm</a>  going to motion that we schedule a public meeting of the ordinances and rules subcommittee and committee of the whole, um, per discretion of the council president to discuss these matters, and then that we also schedule a public hearing that is required by Chapter 43 B section 10 at our May 23rd regular meeting, and that will give enough time as notice is required for the city clerk to do the required notices for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4914.907s">So</a>  that's my proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4916.627s">two</a>  more meetings on this where we can collect more public feedback and then a public hearing on May 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4923.811s">Then</a>  pursuant to the discussion, if there are any amendments to these proposed amendments, any changes to these proposed amendments, that can happen in that public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4931.554s">And</a>  then the Council and my fellow Councilors are at the discretion to vote on this, the process after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4937.217s">And</a>  I'll just go over this again, not to belabor the point, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4939.798s">it</a>  would require a two thirds vote of the City Council, the assent of the mayor, submission to the state attorney general for review, and then it would be voted on by the voters in our November election. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4950.242s">So,</a>  again, this is not just something that we can do on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4953.844s">There's</a>  a lot of pieces of the process, the ideas, and with my hope to have everybody on board so that we can move forward and make sure that this council and the people that elect these councilors have the powers that we need to do our jobs effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4968.39s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4971.011s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4971.811s">Again,</a>  thank you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4974.093s">I</a>  think this is a direct correlation of the lack of partnership with the mayor's office and the situation where we are today with really being left in the dark and so many issues, but most important as this speaks to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4990.922s">the</a>  lack of representation to assist us in making us, giving us the support that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4997.988s">And</a>  some people might say, well, why is this important? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5001.631s">I</a>  think the important this piece is bringing back full circle is the meeting that we had that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5008.677s">that</a>  we had no guidance and then were sued by BJ's and then went to court and now here we are now I believe that it's now the residents are coming after this council and that all stems from one simple issue and that's not having legal representation here so again and that that goes back to not having a working relationship with the mayor's office so I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5037.251s">Like</a>  I said last meeting, we'll belabor the process of the conversation again, but this is something that really, as a unit, I'll support the most part and look forward to putting this back in other elected officials' passwords of true transparency and letting the residents of our community vote to show us that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5067.563s">this</a>  is the process we need to go in because we really need to move the city in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5073.124s">And</a>  I think this will help. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5074.564s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President, I would second the motion.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5076.905s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5077.985s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5080.345s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5082.386s">I</a>  think that we had a really interesting, thoughtful, deliberate conversation about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5088.066s">Recently,</a>  we discussed these proposals in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5092.087s">As</a>  Vice President Bears outlined, we're going to have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5097.028s">continuing</a>  opportunity for Councilor input for public input, as we discuss these proposals further. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5103.712s">But</a>  just to briefly reiterate, you know, some of what I said at our last meeting on this and some of what I heard my fellow Councilors say that really resonated with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5110.536s">I</a>  think Councilors Scarpelli said this is a way to keep the council relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5115.199s">I</a>  think that really sums it up, you know, these three proposals combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5119.702s">We</a>  talk a lot about <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5121.683s">our</a>  frustrations with not having the tools, the resources, the people that we need to function as a legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5128.688s">And</a>  I think the politically easier thing to do would be to stay in that state and say, well, you know, we're doing all we can with what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5137.073s">This</a>  is a measure to say, actually, that's not good enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5139.255s">We're</a>  going to make these specific amendments to the charter so that we actually do have what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5144.258s">so</a>  that we can do the work of representing our constituencies that we can do the work of legislating passing policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5149.764s">I</a>  think that will free up a lot of this council's energy to be a complimentary working partner with the administration across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5157.852s">Instead</a>  of, you know, unfortunately being forced to expend a lot of energy, really trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5163.773s">trying</a>  to have that co equal relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5167.216s">You</a>  know, I think that we, it's better to enshrine in policy in the charter, a way to have the powers that our constituents need us to have in order to do our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5178.787s">And</a>  that's not just like I said last week, that's not just for this term, it's not just for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5182.991s">I</a>  think it's a way of saying to the community of Medford, you deserve to have a city council that is functional, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5188.095s">No</a>  matter the, the climate inside this building no matter the political weather, this council is always going to be empowered to be working for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5195.518s">So</a>  I look forward to discussing this further and I'll certainly be supporting this tonight.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5199.619s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5203.268s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5203.668s">Um,</a>  I again, I had more thorough comments at our committee the whole meeting last week so I don't want to go spend too much time going into detail but I think, regardless of how you view the city council the mayor any of us as individuals on the city council this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5219.38s">These</a>  are charter amendments are particularly exciting for all residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5226.025s">how</a>  we want our city to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5228.707s">I</a>  think what's top of mind for a lot of people is having a more transparent, more open, more collaborative, more democratic way of governance in the city where we are partners with each other and we work with the folks across the hall from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5246.475s">you</a>  know, there are times where that relationship is fraught and times where that relationship isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5252.0s">But</a>  what these, underscoring what Councilor Collins said, what these charter amendments help us do is it sets that foundation and puts it into place that we will be partners and that we will work with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5264.792s">It</a>  empowers us as a council to do the job that voters expect us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5270.457s">There's,</a>  I think there's always a shock when you talk to voters, their residents, and, you know, we describe what we have to do research-wise, what the lack of support and staff that we have as a city council, the lack of ability that we have to hold everyone accountable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5288.544s">These</a>  are all basic functions of government that residents expect of all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5294.406s">And</a>  these charter amendments empower us to serve the people the way that they expect <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5300.308s">us</a>  to serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5301.989s">And</a>  I'm just add on to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5304.211s">I'm</a>  very excited to solicit more public feedback on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5308.974s">I</a>  thank Councilor Bears for building that into this plan for the charter amendments as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5316.58s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5317.72s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5319.281s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5320.262s">So</a>  these are tools that other city councils in the past have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5325.306s">And</a>  it's a shame that we have to actually make an ordinance to get <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5330.695s">these</a>  things in place, especially with the legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5335.621s">Questions</a>  came up tonight and said that we didn't have counsel, but I plan to support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5342.711s">Part</a>  of this is, as Councilor Collins said, people hold us to a standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5349.945s">And</a>  right now, the standard that people hold us to, we're not able to obtain right now under this administration that just has made this council irrelevant over the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5362.258s">So</a>  I will be supporting this 100% this evening.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5365.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5367.183s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5370.146s">Any</a>  members of the public who wish to speak?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5373.642s">So</a>  we have a motion from vice president bears to send this to the ordinance and rule subcommittee second by it's a it's sorry to be more detailed about the motion that maybe is necessary, but it would be to schedule public meetings of the ordinances and rule subcommittee and the committee of the whole on this topic and to hold a public hearing on at our May 23rd regular meeting as required by Chapter 43 B section 10.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5398.115s">Okay,</a>  voted out of your subcommittee to get it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5401.999s">I</a>  think the way this is going, it's technically that there will be, it's not going to ordinances and rules subcommittee per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5407.804s">It's</a>  just that the ordinances rules subcommittee could have a public meeting to request public feedback on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5412.688s">The</a>  amendments would actually by law have to happen at that public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5415.931s">So</a>  I guess in some sense, the papers never chapter 43 B section 10 authorizes the city council to authorize a committee to hold meeting on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5425.065s">But</a>  the decisions have to happen at the public hearing so it's just different than anything we normally do because it's a specific process outlined by constitutional amendment and then it's enabling legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5434.234s">So</a>  that's why I'm proposing the amendment the way I'm proposing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5437.657s">You</a>  want to vote it out that'd be great though, just okay yeah we'll definitely vote to at the subcommittee to make sure it goes back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5443.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5444.604s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5445.445s">Just</a>  for our processes I understand processes which is for our processes.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5449.61s">Do</a>  you have that language Mr. Clerk, I just want to clarify, so you want to, you want to hold public meetings of the ordinances rules subcommittee and public meeting of the committee the whole and then a public hearing on May 23, at the council meeting, as a council's regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5462.541s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5462.922s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5465.184s">So</a>  on the motion of ice is a bear second by Councilor probably Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5474.348s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5474.949s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5475.029s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5475.249s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5683.342s">Council</a>  night as the dissenting vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5685.544s">I</a>  feel so. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5686.064s">It's</a>  my obligation to explain where I come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5689.087s">Why</a>  when voting against these amendments to, uh, these. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5694.751s">Resolutions</a>  to move to amend that city job. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5698.394s">Um</a>  from day one in my election to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5701.236s">I've</a>  always felt that the best path to try to change was through the time tested <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5710.976s">I</a>  don't support an abbreviated review. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5713.297s">And</a>  I truly questioned whether or not people in power trying to expand their own power was the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5720.199s">And</a>  looking at the papers before us this evening, or the series of papers that are before us this evening, we still have the elephant in the room to deal with the fact that we have zero legal counsel at all to provide us with any support. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5730.643s">The</a>  constitution of this community is the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5734.905s">And</a>  for us to move forward in haste without legal counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5738.712s">providing</a>  advice, consent and direction, I think is something that we need to review with great caution and handle with kids gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5747.0s">So</a>  for those reasons and those reasons alone, I will be voting against this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5751.945s">Since</a>  my election to the city council, there's always been some small <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5757.53s">movement</a>  in this community to review or amend the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5762.092s">And</a>  there's been small minority groups that have moved to try to collect the signatures to do such, and they have been able to do so, which tells me that there is a lack of interest in addressing the charter in this community by the general populace. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5777.697s">And</a>  for that reason as well, I will be voting against this paper soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5781.818s">I</a>  thank the Councilor for the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5783.299s">I</a>  appreciate his initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5786.24s">You</a>  know, you got to start somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5788.941s">And</a>  again, you know, it's almost what came first, the chicken or the egg. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5793.502s">You</a>  know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5794.062s">We</a>  don't have the tools to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5796.143s">and</a>  he's put in the paper for this, trying to give us the tools, but it's really a philosophical and theoretical discussion as to how it feels the government should work and what's best practice for good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5807.068s">So</a>  it's for that reason that I'll be voting against it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5810.189s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5810.889s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5813.79s">Any</a>  members of the public wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5815.211s">I</a>  see Sharon D'Eso. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5818.933s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5828.333s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5829.854s">I'm</a>  supporting Councilor Knight and any people in the public who are listening to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5836.739s">Several</a>  years ago, maybe even shorter, there was a group of us who were very concerned about the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5842.743s">Not</a>  that we sought any direct criticism, not that we were after any individuals, but because I think our charter had not been reviewed for about 36 or 37 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5854.351s">We're</a>  really faltering behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5858.525s">progress</a>  in review in comparison to other surrounding towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5864.167s">There</a>  are a couple of councilmen now who are still present, like Mr. Schiappelli, Adam Knight, and Councilor Caraviello, who can attest to a lot of public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5874.93s">I</a>  still have in my home hundreds and hundreds of signatures because it still got stalemated at the State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5884.083s">I</a>  firmly believe that this should go even beyond a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5889.526s">That</a>  still leaves it in the hands of and direction of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5894.428s">We</a>  will be seeking ways that the public will definitely be participating in this, in revitalizing these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5904.092s">And</a>  I want to thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5905.693s">for</a>  going in the favor of charter review anyway, but to leave it in the hands of different groups, et cetera, where you can just override us and make your own amendments to the charter, I don't know quite if that is even legal, but I do really appreciate, along with others, any attention that's given to these movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5927.267s">I</a>  hope to get back on with a couple of pieces of information later tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5931.089s">Thank</a>  you and a happy spring to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5933.191s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5936.018s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, and then we'll go to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5939.7s">I</a>  was probably going to reiterate the point that Vice President Bears made.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5943.223s">Thank</a>  you, and feel free, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5944.964s">I</a>  was just going to say that, yes, there'd be a public hearing, but then it would need to be approved by the mayor, reviewed by the state attorney general, and then voted on by the voters on the ballot as a ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5956.051s">So</a>  it wouldn't just be the city council saying, this is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5960.874s">That</a>  certainly is not how the law works. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5962.575s">It</a>  would be the voters of the city approving a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5965.277s">And</a>  I just want to also add that this is not charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5970.9s">These</a>  are specific amendments to address specific problems that we've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5974.602s">There</a>  are portions of charters that exist in many other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5978.605s">Charter</a>  review, which would look at everything, would look at ward representation, would look at <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5983.307s">you</a>  know, a bunch of other things that would potentially write a completely new charter compared to the charter that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5989.131s">That's</a>  a separate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5990.751s">That's</a>  the thing you can get signatures to collect for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5994.554s">That's</a>  where you can have a home rule petition at the State House to do a comprehensive review. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5999.396s">Most</a>  of the things that people talk about when they talk about charter review, you can't even do through this amendment process, which is very specific to the balance of powers. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6006.64s">You</a>  can't change mode of election, terms of election, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6011.523s">or</a>  the districts that people are elected from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6014.505s">So</a>  this is much more targeted than a comprehensive charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6017.988s">This</a>  is saying very specifically, we have seen what a disempowered council looks like, and that the council by charter does not have the powers that it needs to assert its authority as an independent branch of <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6030.557s">the</a>  city government as to address the separation of powers, and this is specifically targeted at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6036.621s">These</a>  amendments wouldn't even give the city council unilateral discretion on any of this anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6041.304s">It</a>  would just give us an equal share of voice in these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6044.407s">So</a>  thank you for the comments, and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6047.609s">I</a>  hope folks will come to public meetings and voice that, and we can do the education work, and we can also consider what voters are saying and residents are saying about these amendments over the next few weeks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6058.937s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6060.707s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6113.208s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6115.929s">23-099,</a>  offered by Vice President Bears, be it ordered that under the provisions of Chapter 43B of the Medford, I'm sorry, Medford, Massachusetts General Laws, including Sections 10 and 19 of said chapter, Article 89 of the Massachusetts Constitution and any other applicable provision of law, Councilor Isaac B. Zach Bears, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6133.538s">proposes</a>  by written request the city council of the city of Medford the following amendments to the charter of the city of Medford outlined in the acts of 1986 chapter 605, which would have been the existing title and existing text of the first paragraph of the acts of 1986 chapter 605 section one, three, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6150.039s">and</a>  submit such amendment for approval by the voters of the city of Medford section 52 appointments by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6155.745s">Generally</a>  the mayor shall appoint subject to confirmation by the city council by majority vote all members of municipal boards committees and commissions except the school committee officials appointed by the governor and assessors if elected by vote of the people for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the city ordinance or general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6174.009s">All</a>  members of municipal boards, committees, and commissions shall serve terms as defined by city ordinance or general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6179.359s">All</a>  heads of the department shall be appointed by the mayor without confirmation by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6183.827s">The</a>  mayor shall refer to the city council and simultaneously file with the city clerk the name of each person the mayor desires to appoint as a member of the board committee or commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6191.772s">The</a>  city council shall have 45 days after the date on which notice of the proposed appointment was filed with the city clerk to vote to approve or reject the appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6199.797s">If</a>  the city council does not approve or reject the appointment within 45 days, it may file a 15 day extension with the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6207.158s">If</a>  the time period elapses and no extension has been filed, the appointment shall be deemed approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6211.682s">Members</a>  of the boards, committees, and commissions may be removed at the discretion of the appointing authority subject to limitations and requirements imposed by federal and state laws, rules, and or regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6221.63s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6223.512s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, for reading that out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6226.134s">I</a>  appreciate your deference on these. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6227.715s">This</a>  one is the final of the three amendments that would actually amend <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6231.755s">our</a>  existing charter regarding appointments by the mayor to require city council approval of municipal boards, committees, and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6239.959s">The</a>  rest of the language, there's some language in here that remains from the existing charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6245.742s">So</a>  for example, obviously this would not apply to the school committee or officials appointed by the governor or assessors if elected by the vote of the people, as well as it would not apply to heads of departments, which is what our current charter says, but it would apply to members of boards, committees, and commissions created by ordinance of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6262.181s">and</a>  I would follow the same motion to hold these public meetings and hold a public hearing at our May 23rd regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6326.539s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6328.26s">A</a>  bunch of students wrote to me and I also had a chance to talk to a bunch of students at a town hall type meeting at Tufts a few weeks ago where they brought to my attention that during the class change periods, between periods of different classes, a bunch of students are walking on the road because the sidewalk is too crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6350.857s">And</a>  they asked me if we could explore any solutions such as holding <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6354.9s">maybe</a>  a red light just a little, just a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6357.383s">And</a>  look, I mean, I'm not a traffic genius, I don't know the solutions to this problem but I thought it would be good for them for me to flag it for us as a council to flag it for the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6370.615s">And</a>  actually, Todd Lake <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6373.778s">did</a>  write to me and we've been communicating about this recently, and he let me know that there's still some work to be done at that intersection that's been scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6384.406s">Essentially</a>  what we're waiting for right now is for the MBTA, the Green Line Extension, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6392.292s">to</a>  finish up some repairs improvements that they owe us as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6395.897s">There</a>  is an approved pavement marking plan that has yet to be implemented that repaints and realign some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6403.386s">So,</a>  essentially, what might be best is for us to see how that plan works, but he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6410.514s">He</a>  did let me know that the DPW will keep an eye on that intersection, and that there are a lot of competing interests for road space there, and the job, which makes things even more difficult, but that he in the department would explore different solutions.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6432.86s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6433.841s">I'm</a>  just thinking for, you know, this is a great school right I mean it's one of the most prestigious universities around you think these kids might not had across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6441.666s">You</a>  know, but with that being said, maybe we can we can ask our friends up at Tufts University to. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6449.07s">have</a>  a class called look both ways before crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6452.073s">But</a>  I do commend the gentleman for putting the paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6455.595s">But,</a>  you know, there has to also be some personal responsibility, I think, when it comes to pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6460.159s">And,</a>  you know, I think this is one of the perfect examples thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6463.942s">So</a>  with that being said, I'll support the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6465.863s">But</a>  I don't think this is certainly a priority of the Council.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6470.747s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6471.388s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6474.35s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6479.528s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6484.87s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6485.031s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6485.191s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6500.237s">Yes,</a>  seven in front of zero that I get the motion passes to three dash to a one offered by cancer saying, be it so resolved that the city council asked the city administration for prioritization and updates on the resurfacing of slash fixing of potholes on Riverside have comes are saying.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6514.888s">Thank</a>  you President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6515.769s">I</a>  actually had written this resolution up a while ago before Commissioner McGivern posted on Facebook a response to a similar question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6527.92s">Riverside</a>  Avenue is a very heavily trafficked street in our city and I think we all know how awful the state of that road is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6536.985s">I</a>  spent a lot of time in Wellington visiting my parents, and every time I have to get over there, it's like you're riding a roller coaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6543.509s">And</a>  it's not good for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6546.011s">And</a>  I think a lot of residents in that neighborhood think it's a sign of being overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6551.855s">And</a>  it's important for us as a city council and as a local government to say, no, every single street is important, every neighborhood is important, and we have a plan for that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6563.842s">And</a>  so Tim McGivern did get back to me on this, and he told me that there are plans to resurface that road this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6575.151s">They</a>  did a pavement valuation a couple of years ago, and they've been hard at work prioritizing and coordinating work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6583.397s">They've</a>  started a crack sealing program, a box out patching program, and more programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6590.613s">And</a>  they're, they're going to plan to resurface as much as the budget allows, but part of the problem that we're facing here is that the evaluation that our city received was that we should be spending at least $3.5 million in resurfacing roads every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6608.707s">Um,</a>  but for the past in for, um, for many decades, we've only been spending, uh, less than $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6615.974s">And</a>  so there's a lot of, um, a lot of work that we'll have to do to catch up in terms of our repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6622.74s">Um,</a>  he did ask me to convey to people watching this meeting, um, to ask our state reps to advocate for more chapter 90 funding, which is the primary source <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6633.65s">that</a>  we use as municipalities to maintain our roadways and improve our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6640.133s">And</a>  he did ask that if anyone did have any more specific questions about Riverside Ave to contact him, to email him or to call him. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6650.778s">He</a>  did tell me also that they have put this out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6656.041s">And</a>  so he's hopeful that this can get done this year.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6661.464s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6662.723s">Madam</a>  President, on that, I just ask that any work that we do related to Riverside Avenue be coordinated with the MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6670.29s">If</a>  we think back, we had an opportunity to resurface Riverside Avenue for a significant stretch, I believe, from Freedom Way going up towards <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6680.954s">a</a>  narrow bread for lack of a better explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6683.517s">And</a>  the council was looking for some additional concessions curb stones and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6689.643s">But</a>  ultimately, the MWRA and National Grid had a project that would have provided curb to curb resurfacing to that stretch of certain stretch of Riverside Avenue that was in significant need of disrepair for payout. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6701.392s">the</a>  city council request that the administration move forward and resurface that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6706.195s">That'll</a>  put us in a position where we'd have the five year moratorium placed on the road, and it wouldn't be able to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6711.138s">So</a>  we put ourselves in a situation where we had public utilities that were willing to resurface the roadway for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6717.562s">And</a>  now we're doing it, we're paying for it, and we're locking it up for five years and preventing them from doing their underground infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6723.806s">So</a>  with that being said, I just ask that the city engineer be provided with this information as well as Mr. Lasky over at the MWRA.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6730.372s">Would</a>  you like to make that as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6732.033s">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6732.933s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6733.453s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6735.334s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6736.214s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Tseng putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6738.996s">And</a>  I think that this is, you know, for the community, probably one of the better examples, you know, simplest examples that we have about our backlog of capital needs in the community, you know, just demonstrating when we defer maintenance over the cost of, over the length of, in this case, you know, 30 to 40 years, that maintenance over time gets more expensive because we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6759.924s">We're</a>  not paying to prevent or stop the damages that are currently occurring, let alone the ones that we can already, you know, see and observe and that people are reporting on see click fix all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6771.048s">I</a>  know that our engineering department is well aware of the scope of the problem they're doing all that we can I think that it, you know, demonstrates <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6777.03s">the</a>  need to be finding cheaper ways to resurface these roads where we can like Councilor Knight said, and it also demonstrates the strong need to figure out how can we start paying for this more quickly so that these needs for repairs are not mounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6790.973s">And</a>  we're just continually continually playing catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6793.634s">And</a>  I also want to note I've had a lot of friends of mine who are also cyclists specifically complain about Riverside, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6799.835s">you</a>  know, because the pothole situation, basically unbreakable so I just want to throw that in there to let cyclists know everybody is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6807.279s">Everybody</a>  is walking around frustrated because of the road situation in Medford, and you know, cyclists are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6812.141s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6812.902s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6813.462s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, probably the number one concern that I have and everybody streets streets streets is out the poor condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6821.601s">You're</a>  afraid to drive your bicycle down the streets, try driving your car down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6825.962s">That's</a>  Councilor Lighthouse, he's blown on in his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6830.083s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6832.324s">Yeah,</a>  so like I say, forget about the bikes, you drive your car down the street, you take your life in your hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6838.845s">That</a>  seems to be the biggest concern everybody, is the lack of paving on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6844.346s">We're</a>  probably spending millions of dollars a year just patching our streets, never mind fixing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6849.968s">We're</a>  still waiting on a plan <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6852.349s">for</a>  the streets that are supposedly going to be paved somewhere in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6857.452s">And</a>  I would like the mayor to probably within the next couple of meetings to submit the plan on what streets are going to be paved and where is the paving program.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6867.96s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6870.201s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Tseng as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6876.946s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6883.417s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6883.597s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6883.857s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6910.715s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6911.135s">Um,</a>  so this this resolution comes from talking to a lot of, particularly on Spanish and Creole speaking, I'm residents who find it particularly intimidating to go to City Hall because they find it a little confusing to find which office to go to where to navigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6929.384s">As</a>  we keep talking about the beautification of City Hall I think this is something to keep in mind, obviously we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6935.287s">translate</a>  into every single language spoken in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6938.709s">But</a>  I think we can make more of an effort as a city to translate to the most commonly spoken languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6945.514s">And</a>  just to have the basic, even a basic guide at the door or a small sign to translate the word, which number of room numbers offices are in that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6957.122s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6959.063s">Any</a>  other members of the council wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6963.456s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6967.039s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6971.282s">Yes,</a>  seven the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6977.827s">Communications</a>  from the mayor 23-283.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6989.776s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendment to the revised ordinances entitled personnel article two. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7002.248s">Classification</a>  and compensation plan section 66 dash 33 entitled officers and employees, non union by adopting the following change amendment a, the language of calf 19 shall be amended to include the following position human resources director, respectfully committed, submitted analog current motion of the paper ruled out of order Madam President on 321 23 this council disposed of a very similar paper the city council rules clearly indicated the council disposes of a paper a paper of similar matter cannot be reintroduced for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7032.255s">We</a>  have a motion rule I have to look at the past paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7046.268s">And</a>  I know I do know that I was trying to look at the past paper you're actually right that rule does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7075.291s">I</a>  mean, this is this is what the rule states. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7077.993s">And</a>  then that would be so 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7080.454s">So</a>  90 days since it was disposed of.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7089.421s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7091.002s">Would</a>  it be possible for the city council to take the rules out of order?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7096.406s">Someone</a>  would have to make that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7100.19s">Okay,</a>  well, I rule that the paper, yes, I would rule that the paper is out of order based on the city council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7110.115s">The</a>  language of the past paper, it was, I mean, it was introduced so long ago.</p>

    <p>[3gvhm0AovZU_SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7121.862s">One</a>  moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7142.205s">So,</a>  you know, it gets me to it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7144.507s">Ultimately,</a>  Madam President, what it was, was a paper that was going to create a CAF 19 for the human resource directors position as well as other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7152.173s">But</a>  that position was included in the paper and that is a same or similar paper that has been rejected by this body and therefore is barred from introduction.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7163.782s">Yeah,</a>  it was, it was taken off the table though to, I need to, I don't have the minutes in front of me to receive them.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7171.945s">It</a>  was taken off the table to be disposed of that it was disposed of and then it was reintroduced less than 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7179.351s">So</a>  the council voted on it saying goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7182.053s">And</a>  then the mayor brought it back, but the mayor brought it back before the cooling off period. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7197.467s">I</a>  mean, we have rules, but we don't need them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7199.208s">And</a>  we could just throw them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7201.989s">Ultimately,</a>  the rules are put in place is check and balance, you know, be sure that we stay honest and transparent.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7212.815s">No,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7213.275s">I'm</a>  just trying to real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7226.675s">I</a>  would like to motion for a brief recess, but I'm also fine.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7231.057s">Motion</a>  for a five minute recess.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7236.06s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7241.222s">Madam</a>  President, I'm happy to make a couple of comments that may be helpful to the council in considering whether they wish to take this out of order or not.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7249.346s">Yeah,</a>  I think the ruling that has been disposed of in the paper would be <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7257.248s">Not</a>  able to speak on.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7259.47s">Clarification</a>  Madam President, so ultimately the paper was introduced this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7263.333s">I</a>  made a motion to have the paper ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7265.094s">The</a>  paper was ruled out of order and now we're still talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7267.476s">The</a>  paper's been ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7268.737s">It's</a>  time to move on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7271.299s">You</a>  are correct and I just want to look. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7274.702s">I</a>  just want to affirm with our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7284.189s">I'm</a>  just. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7285.504s">Trying</a>  to look at the rules just, I want to make sure that this is disposed of and not, we asked you to come up with this before, things that failed as opposed to being received in place on file.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7304.069s">What</a>  was the initial paper number?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7306.729s">The</a>  initial paper was introduced like a very long time ago.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7309.79s">I</a>  think it was, was it 21631? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7313.131s">I'm</a>  trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7314.675s">just</a>  so we can compare.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7320.26s">I'd</a>  move the five-minute recess.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7322.202s">On</a>  the motion, President Bears for a five-minute recess, seconded by... Second.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7326.325s">Well,</a>  my question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7327.867s">If</a>  the paper's already been ruled on and it's been ruled out of order, what are we recessing on? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7331.991s">Have</a>  you made a ruling? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7333.452s">She</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[3gvhm0AovZU_SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7333.792s">She</a>  made a ruling.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7334.273s">The</a>  paper was out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7335.253s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7335.594s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7336.695s">That</a>  is all.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7341.871s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7343.912s">If</a>  I may, I just want to state for the record, I'm not opposed to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7346.993s">I</a>  think this is something we should discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7348.314s">I</a>  think that it, you know, I certainly understand the argument for not spot changing our rules, but I just, you know, I hope that this is something that we can discuss, you know, after the cooling off period. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7358.018s">If</a>  we've confirmed that, that's, you know, procedurally the action we have to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7361.699s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7363.16s">Madam</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7364.341s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7365.081s">If</a>  I may, as the person who filed the, or who moved to <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7371.192s">receive</a>  and place this on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7373.352s">I</a>  did that at, you know, 14, 15 months after the paper had been filed, not with the intention of starting a cooling off period the day that I moved to receive it and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7382.314s">As</a>  I read the rules, obviously, regardless of my intention, that was its effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7390.356s">I</a>  would move to suspend the rules to take the paper under consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7393.477s">It's</a>  up to the council to vote on that if they want to or not.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7396.037s">Point</a>  of Parliament, we agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7397.337s">Madam</a>  President, the paper has already been addressed.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7399.418s">I'm</a>  gonna dispose of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7401.707s">I</a>  already motioned.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7402.427s">A</a>  motion to overrule is the chair.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7405.549s">So</a>  the motion is... My motion is to... The question of the chair is whether or not the paper's out of order.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7411.953s">Yeah,</a>  the motion is to question whether or not the paper's out of order.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7414.414s">So</a>  the paper will need a supermajority in order to move forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7418.054s">Can</a>  I not also move to suspend the rules to take the paper to suspend rule 25 or whatever it is to take the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7424.775s">We</a>  have the authority to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7425.955s">Paper</a>  was just disposed of.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7428.816s">Okay,</a>  just put it down a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7430.636s">She</a>  just ruled it out of order.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7434.577s">Well,</a>  the rules are set by a majority of the council, which can suspend the rules at any time, which we do often.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7441.378s">Yeah,</a>  I suppose a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7447.171s">That's</a>  where the ruling is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7448.752s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7451.594s">So</a>  90 days from the 321, it could be introduced.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7454.937s">What</a>  was it the clerk puts out a report to do?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7462.403s">It</a>  was from Councilor Knight to add that to reports due. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7469.448s">So</a>  it reports due being that paper be back on.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7475.656s">We</a>  don't want them to forget Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7480.679s">Call</a>  the roll.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7668.4s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, and on both of these orders, I think that I implore, and <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7676.593s">have</a>  my fellow Councilors understand the temperament that we're in right now the climate we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7681.237s">I</a>  received phone calls today I don't know if any of you have also from the school department that the mayor has already shared a very dire situation on the school side, that there will be cuts and layoffs on the school department, and believing that the administration's have a meeting here tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7702.197s">to</a>  rethink that and try to focus on how we're going to stop such a drastic move. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7708.882s">Well,</a>  again, to my fellow Councilors and to the public, I've been imploring all of you, without understanding the budget and without understanding what we're doing with the money in our community, please don't vote anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7727.017s">money</a>  papers because we don't know where this is going to go when it comes to the presentation of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7734.548s">I</a>  beg of you to please consider that I've been saying this and it's coming through fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7741.471s">from</a>  what teachers have called me, and they're appalled, and they don't know where they're going after what was supposed to be good faith negotiations and understanding the climate financially this community, and what is being told to me by the school department of teachers in the school department that they've been told that there will be cuts and layoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7764.335s">So</a>  every dollar right now we should really consider whether we're approving anything, dealing with money anything right now, until we have further understanding of what is going to happen in our community, when it comes to budget time because of the lack of information that have been shared to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7784.114s">We've</a>  been pushing money papers through because quote unquote what you said was, we still need to do the business of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7790.803s">But</a>  what we're doing is something unknown and what might happen is whatever we voted for is going to cause drastic trickle down effect in other areas in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7802.801s">So</a>  this is why I've said it, and believe me, I hate the fact that this looks like it's going to happen, that the budget is dire, that there are severe consequences that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7817.465s">And</a>  I just, you know, I can only hope it's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7820.908s">But</a>  since we haven't had any information from anybody administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7825.151s">I</a>  can only go with the people that reach out to me and share information, and that came directly from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7833.657s">Again,</a>  this is where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7835.918s">You</a>  have your own conscious to vote on this, but understand, whatever you vote for, for one more dollar, whatever you vote on, when it comes to the budget season, and when it comes to the mayor looking at us and saying, we can't do what you want, and we're going to have to look at other positions, and then cut the assistant in the engineering department, or cut this program at the library, or cut this on our side, it falls on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7860.745s">So</a>  again, I know it's a drastic conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7863.346s">But</a>  again, believe me, I wish I was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7867.567s">But</a>  this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7869.267s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7871.388s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7874.128s">I</a>  completely agree with Councilor Scarpelli that we should not be in the position of cutting any positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7880.07s">And</a>  quite frankly, my understanding of the city budget is that it's and the state funding that's coming in, etc, is not that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7890.872s">We</a>  don't have the money to fund things, it's that the money will not be allocated by the single authority who can allocate said monies to fund things. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7898.536s">So</a>  I just don't want us and again I understand exactly where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7902.058s">I</a>  don't want again this council will be put in the position of falling into the trap of the false narrative setup that says we don't have the money because that's just not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7910.463s">It's</a>  how much are we willing to allocate is the mayor willing to allocate for the city budget for the public school system and for the city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7920.207s">my</a>  understanding of the information that we have received which I agree with you is not as complete as we want it to be for sure, is not that the money is not there, it's that we're being quote unquote prudent, and we're being quote unquote fiscally conservative, and I don't believe that we should be doing that at the expense of firing city employees are laying off city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7938.439s">And</a>  I think if we accept that the dollar amount is the dollar amount that the whatever the mayor says goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7944.303s">then</a>  that's coming to us and putting a scarcity mindset on us that actually doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7948.266s">It's</a>  just that we don't have the authority to countervail it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7951.108s">And</a>  that there's only one political actor in the city that does. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7953.45s">On</a>  these specific items, we're talking about a bond issue that we do regularly for sidewalk construction and equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7962.216s">It's</a>  a bond issue, so the costs are going to be over a long period of the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7966.58s">So</a>  the actual costs of the city are significantly smaller on an annual basis compared to the amount of the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7972.544s">And</a>  then the second piece <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7974.205s">is</a>  is cola money that's under $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7977.106s">Four</a>  weeks ago, I think this council unanimously voted to approve $2 million in free cash to go to new fire trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7982.428s">I'm</a>  not saying that was a good thing or a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7984.588s">But</a>  we're talking about an order of magnitude less than that we're talking about 100,000 to 200,000 not $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7990.951s">And</a>  finally, again, like the second piece of it, the cola piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7995.532s">You</a>  know, I don't think teachers should be there should not even be a threat or consideration of any staff at our city at our school system at all being threatened at all in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8004.723s">The</a>  fact that that's a discussion we're having is a choice by the person who says this is how much money you're going to get in the school system which is none of us and quite frankly none of the school committee except for the chair of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8015.155s">There's</a>  cola adjustments for people who work in this community who work in City Hall who haven't gotten raises for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8021.877s">So</a>  when I, when I should that be allowed to happen either absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8028.0s">These</a>  are people who work for the city who deserve fair compensation just like every single worker in the city, and our public school system deserves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8036.145s">Do</a>  I have the choice today to approve a fair union contract for certain workers? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8040.688s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8041.028s">Do</a>  I have an authority to say to the school department, to the mayor, the school department shall have this and there shall be no layoffs? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8046.771s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8047.012s">Do</a>  I have the authority technically before me as one seventh the authority at the very least to say that people haven't gotten raises for four years should get raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8055.386s">I'm</a>  going to say yes to that, because that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8059.07s">I</a>  said this before when we discussed this at its first reading, I don't think the mayor cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8063.816s">I</a>  don't think us voting no is going to change position on union negotiations at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8069.182s">I</a>  just don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8070.515s">So</a>  there's no gain to leave it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8073.918s">In</a>  my perspective, I respect other opinions on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8076.26s">I</a>  respect other positions on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8079.183s">But</a>  there is loss, and I'm not willing to take loss for no reason at all, when that loss could mean city employees no longer working here because they haven't gotten raised in multiple years and want to move to another community or agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8093.495s">So</a>  again, I respect the principle of where everyone's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8096.678s">and</a>  the fact that we need more information, but I don't think that we should allow the scarcity mindset of one elected official in the community to determine how all of us act.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8109.428s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8111.411s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8112.292s">I</a>  appreciate hearing my other colleagues perspectives on this and I, you know, we've we've talked about this issue before we talked about this, we voted on this for first reading, I know that there's a variety of opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8123.446s">I</a>  think people know where I stand my, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8126.59s">Similarly,</a>  we can only vote on what we have the power to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8131.792s">We</a>  cannot affect direct change of the things that we do not have the jurisdiction to affect direct change over. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8138.816s">This</a>  is something that we get to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8140.416s">And</a>  I think that these people deserve raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8142.357s">I</a>  think that everybody deserves a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8143.998s">And</a>  I wish that we had the opportunity to affect that, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8147.179s">And</a>  I also, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8148.68s">The</a>  more important point here I think the it's not really an elephant in the room it's just what's on everybody's mind because I think everybody's really worried about the only piece of the budget that we have had an indication about so far, which is the proposal given to the schools, and it is I think impossible not to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8168.036s">these</a>  expenditures in the context of the really worrying number that was given to the schools over the past couple weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8173.941s">And</a>  I know that that's something that we all care a lot about. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8177.184s">But</a>  I think I want to, you know, kind of underline something that Vice President Bair said, which is that we get to choose, you know, whether this conversation is about <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8189.357s">Well,</a>  I guess we're in the position of having to choose between this loan order or the schools or this proposed wage adjustment or the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8197.101s">That's</a>  not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8198.482s">It's</a>  not a binary. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8200.203s">That's</a>  not the choice that we're being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8203.165s">There's</a>  a version of that narrative where that is what's happening, but that's not factual. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8208.708s">I</a>  think that we all wish that we had been in meaningful, deliberate conversations about crafting this budget for a long time now, and that hasn't been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8218.412s">But</a>  we have meetings and meetings ahead of us where we can be saying what I think is already known about our shared council priorities for this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8227.596s">And</a>  I think it's no secret that, you know, in June of last year all of us were very willing to disapprove the budget that didn't meet a single one of our council priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8237.521s">And,</a>  you know, I go into this budget season really willing to <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8240.862s">communicate</a>  and collaborate and, you know, be in dialogue with the administration about the things that I need to see in the budget in order to be a yes vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8249.131s">That's</a>  no secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8249.952s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8252.198s">know,</a>  obviously, proper funding for the schools where layoffs are not an issue is a huge part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8257.64s">We</a>  go into this with the information that we have, including, you know, a pretty sizable free cash number that we learned about just a couple months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8265.223s">All</a>  of that is context that we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8266.783s">We</a>  know that the money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8267.924s">It's</a>  a matter of appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8269.124s">It's</a>  a matter of allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8270.165s">I</a>  don't buy the narrative that it's sidewalks or schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8273.266s">I</a>  don't buy the narrative that it's non-union personnel or schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8276.467s">I</a>  think it can be both, and I'm willing to have the conversation to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8279.288s">for</a>  tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8280.749s">I</a>  think that these are things that we should approve, and I just wanted to explain my reasoning on that, and I hope that over the next couple months, we can be unified as a council on lobbying for a budget that our community deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8290.656s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8291.597s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8293.792s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, I appreciate my colleagues words, but again I'm going to, I'll say, if there's a reason why the male mayor only allocated a certain amount of money to the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8306.502s">You</a>  can only equate that there is some shortfalls on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8311.246s">So,</a>  this is what we're saying, again, we don't have the information in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8316.777s">The</a>  question about a $2 million, a $200 million fire truck order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8321.201s">The</a>  reason why we, I've always supported that is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8325.065s">It's</a>  a process that had time table on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8328.448s">That's</a>  going to take years before we address that financially, but the vote needed to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8333.073s">That's</a>  why we supported it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8336.916s">So</a>  I, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8340.592s">it's</a>  being a little disingenuine when we have the union heads in front of us, and we tell them that we're supporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8347.518s">And</a>  their, their, their response to us was, I hope you would not support a non union positions raise when we haven't had people in this building that haven't gotten a raise in four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8362.811s">Those</a>  exact words. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8364.975s">So</a>  these are the three points that were raised in my eyes, but I think three points that it's very, very effective to understand when we keep voting, even for another dollar right now, for what I've heard from the school department is really a glimmer of fear that I'm seeing that's going to come in front of us, hopefully by July 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8388.896s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8392.865s">And</a>  I think, and here's, we supported the charter changes that Council B has brought forward for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8400.371s">This</a>  is why we all mostly stood together with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8403.153s">The</a>  fact that we haven't been part of the discussion, the fact that we have been disrespected and treated like our opinions don't count, and the ordinances that we put in place don't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8415.627s">So</a>  there's many different layers to this, but I'll be honest with you, I've been saying this for a long time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8420.948s">And</a>  like I said, I respect everybody behind this reel, and I respect your opinions, but all I'm saying is, and I hope I'm wrong, when it comes to July 1, and we're looking at different drastic cuts, because even a bond, there's trickle down effect on how that money's being dispersed. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8445.178s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8446.359s">It</a>  might be a bond, but if we're using money from one area to take away from another area to pay for a bond because it's spread over many years, until we know that climate or that's explained to us in a thoughtful, reasonable, responsible way that I can go back to the constituents that voted me in, that I could look at them and say, this is why I support it, I can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8471.14s">So</a>  again, this isn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8474.142s">anything</a>  to banter back and forth and say that I don't respect what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8478.071s">All</a>  I'm saying is that's the view that I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8480.516s">So,</a>  and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8481.498s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8484.595s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8485.335s">I'll</a>  be extremely brief because I think we've talked about these two items for months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8491.016s">I</a>  very much respect my colleagues' ways of seeing this, and I think it's not unreasonable to see it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8501.499s">But</a>  I do think it is a false choice, especially when the mayor's announced that we have $25 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8507.88s">And</a>  look, that's not going to fix all of our problems, but it's a starting point for a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8514.662s">Um,</a>  we also have to look at the size of the decisions that we're making and as Councilor bears has referred has has talked about, um, it's voting no on these items won't save any particular program voting yes on these items won't kill any particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8533.801s">I</a>  think that's a false way of, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8536.684s">Maybe</a>  false is a strong way of putting it, but it's not the way I believe that we should look at this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8543.691s">Instead,</a>  I think we need also a bigger picture lens as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8548.756s">We</a>  need to pay attention to employee retention. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8551.679s">We</a>  need to pay attention to <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8554.882s">how</a>  much things cost in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8556.883s">And</a>  if we look at these items, these items speak to those worries and those goals that we have as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8563.607s">And</a>  I think that all of us do share the sidewalk bond, you know, part of that is for bringing machinery to the city for us to bring projects in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8576.134s">And</a>  that requires investment, but that investment is going to pay off in the long run with better roads and with cheaper solutions to our infrastructure problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8586.739s">And</a>  so for me, it's about making an investment in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8590.961s">I</a>  do respect my colleagues' ways of seeing this, and I think we've hashed it out and we've talked about it for weeks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8600.866s">And</a>  so I think I'm ready to vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8606.425s">I</a>  think the Council needs to have an explanation of where the $25 million of free cash came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8613.354s">And</a>  I think the people deserve an explanation on what <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8620.345s">the</a>  $25 million can be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8622.146s">I</a>  think people are hearing the $25 million, they think it's gonna be the savior. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8627.809s">And</a>  that money is not just meant to be pushed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8632.091s">So</a>  I would hope that the administration comes back to explain to us how we arrived at that $25 million number and let the people know what the 25 million can be spent on and can't be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8649.289s">So</a>  I don't want people to have any false sense of security here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8656.734s">I'll</a>  make that into a motion that the administration provide an explanation of where the $25 million of free cash came from and also provide us with a definition of what the $25 million can be spent and can't be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8671.785s">So</a>  like I said, so the taxpayer understands <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8677.604s">where</a>  that money is arriving from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8680.847s">And</a>  the word free, it's not free, money belongs to the taxpayers, it's not, nothing is free.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8686.112s">Would</a>  you like it to be a B paper?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8687.654s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8688.094s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8689.896s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8690.777s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8692.759s">Ultimately,</a>  you know, we have two papers that are before us this evening, one paper for a loan of a sidewalks, and another paper for <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8701.597s">raises</a>  for non-union employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8703.658s">And</a>  when I look at these papers, I say to myself, does our city need sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8707.239s">Ultimately,</a>  that's the first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8708.34s">Does</a>  our city need sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8709.36s">Absolutely,</a>  our city needs sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8714.563s">Ultimately,</a>  this paper that's before us, I think, asks us to borrow more money than the city's been appropriating to repair streets in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8725.227s">They're</a>  asking us to borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8728.829s">And,</a>  you know, I'm sitting there and I'm just thinking back months, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8733.291s">Months,</a>  we've been asking them where they're spending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8737.994s">Why</a>  can't we be provided with the Warren articles? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8741.716s">We've</a>  been asking for it since our prior finance director was run out of town under discrimination suits. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8747.819s">All</a>  right, she was able to give it to us, no problem, with a push of a button. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8751.581s">So</a>  I really don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8754.243s">You</a>  know, so when we talk about borrowing money, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8759.36s">And</a>  we talk about an administration that prides itself on transparency, but this is the same administration that refuses to provide us with the documentation that shows where they're spending their money, as requested by the council on a number of occasions now, probably totaling in the double digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8778.925s">It</a>  raises a red flag, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8780.966s">It</a>  raises a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8782.626s">So</a>  when we talk about the loan, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8785.922s">I</a>  talk about financial transparency and I talk about the request that this council has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8791.887s">The</a>  request that this council has made for months and months and months upon end. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8796.711s">And</a>  the answer that I get when I say, where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8799.133s">Where</a>  are the Warren articles? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8800.954s">Oh,</a>  we don't have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8802.596s">We're</a>  too busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8804.798s">Well,</a>  there are two non-union personnel in this room whose salary total about a quarter of a million bucks that are here before us for a raise, but they're too busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8814.328s">to</a>  provide us with the documentation that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8816.93s">They're</a>  too busy to give us the papers that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8821.273s">I</a>  mean, that's the excuse that we've been given, time in and time out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8826.316s">So</a>  they're not able to provide us with the simple financial data that their predecessors were able to provide us with, or willing to provide us with, maybe is more accurate of a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8838.464s">But</a>  yet, they're here asking for a race. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8844.636s">So</a>  when I hear the term non-union, I think depominate. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8849.76s">That's</a>  what I think when I hear the term non-union, depominate, because that's really what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8853.683s">This</a>  is a race for depominates. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8855.804s">And</a>  when we look at this paper, and we examine this paper in its initial state, when it came before us, when the mayor tried to give herself a raise in this paper retroactively, without disclosure to the council, without a list of titles to the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8874.775s">explaining</a>  what titles were going to be elevated. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8879.016s">And</a>  this is the cost of living adjustment for non-union personnel, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8882.077s">This</a>  has nothing to do with the number of CAFRI classifications that the administration's put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8888.639s">Meanwhile,</a>  the administration's talked <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8891.258s">so</a>  braggadociosly about the opportunity to have a compensation study that's been forecasted from some grant that we were awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8900.386s">I</a>  don't see the compensation study, but week in and week out, I see titles that are coming before us for increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8907.832s">Meanwhile,</a>  the rank and file workers, DPW, our police, our fire, our clerical workers, the people that we pick up the phone every day and call and say, can you fix this pothole farming? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8920.713s">Can</a>  you do a wellness check on this family? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8922.454s">I</a>  haven't seen my neighbor in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8924.956s">My</a>  father fell down, can you come help me pick him up? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8928.019s">My</a>  basement's flooded, can you come over and help pump me out? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8931.502s">Those</a>  are the people that aren't getting the raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8934.904s">And</a>  the people that are getting the raise are the ones that aren't gonna provide us with the information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8941.469s">I</a>  think this is backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8943.251s">I</a>  think a rising tide floats all boats, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8946.453s">But</a>  never ever will I put the management before the working people ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8952.456s">And</a>  that's what the administration is asking us what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8955.758s">And,</a>  you know, I certainly believe that non-union personnel in this community deserve a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8962.441s">And</a>  if you look at my track record, and you go back to previous administrations, you'll see who held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8970.467s">a</a>  raise for non-union personnel when it wasn't equal to what union personnel were getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8976.769s">When</a>  the prior administration asked non-union personnel to take a zero, I held it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8982.151s">I</a>  wouldn't approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8983.272s">And</a>  I negotiated with the administration to defer that zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8986.673s">So</a>  they took a zero one year and they deferred it and got a raise in the end that made up for it, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8990.894s">And</a>  everybody was whole and everybody was happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8993.107s">There</a>  are ways to do this, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8994.949s">There</a>  are ways to work with labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8996.51s">There</a>  are ways to work with the personnel in this building to make them happy, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9000.173s">There</a>  are ways to work in partnership and in concert with this council and with the people that are in this building, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9008.58s">I'd</a>  love to have a hands-on mayor versus a social media influencer. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9011.883s">I</a>  really would. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9013.124s">But</a>  at this point in this game, Madam President, where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9016.787s">We're</a>  no further ahead today than we were in January or the January before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9022.268s">And</a>  for us to take these votes right now is going to send a message to those rank and file workers that have been fighting and struggling every day with the administration whose rights have been trampled to say, yeah, yeah, we hear you, but we really don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9033.78s">We're</a>  still going to reward them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9035.082s">And</a>  we're still going to give them their raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9036.383s">And</a>  you'll get yours too, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9037.725s">If</a>  there's money left and she decides to appropriate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9043.238s">So</a>  I can't, in good faith, Madam President, take these votes this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9048.36s">I</a>  want to support this paper to give the non-union personnel a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9051.641s">I</a>  want to support it when the time is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9053.262s">The</a>  time right now is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9055.363s">I</a>  want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9056.743s">I</a>  want to support these sidewalks, because these are needs that our community have. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9060.345s">These</a>  are needs that our community has. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9062.585s">I</a>  want to support these papers, but I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9065.086s">I</a>  can't, in good faith, look at myself in the mirror tomorrow if I take these votes and vote yes, because I'd find it to be fiscally irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9073.249s">Fiscally</a>  irresponsible, because I've given this same goddamn speech week in and week out, asking about fiscal transparency, asking about where the money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9081.635s">And</a>  I get this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9083.876s">That's</a>  what I get. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9084.576s">I</a>  get nothing but lip service and mumbo jumbo, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9088.339s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9093.262s">I'm</a>  comfortable waking up in the morning, knowing that I took the good vote, knowing that I stood by my principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9101.214s">No</a>  one that I'm not going to be walked over and pushed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9105.536s">Not</a>  taken advantage of, taken for granted, and not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9109.018s">Because</a>  that's what this is about at this point, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9112.059s">The</a>  rank and file workers not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9114.22s">The</a>  council's not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9117.521s">But</a>  we're being asked to do an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9121.983s">I</a>  don't think it's right, and I don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9124.845s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9126.586s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9127.786s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9130.83s">Two</a>  things I'll get out of the way before I get to what I was actually going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9138.62s">there</a>  has been a lot of work by council leadership to get information that shouldn't have taken a lot of work to get, but some of that information is coming through and hasn't come through before. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9148.605s">We</a>  have a quarter three budget to actuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9150.366s">We</a>  have warrant articles for March, 2023 and some prior months. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9153.828s">We</a>  have warrant articles for legal expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9155.889s">Is</a>  it everything we've asked for? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9157.069s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9157.57s">Should</a>  have taken as long as it needed to, to get to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9159.811s">Absolutely</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9160.651s">And</a>  in that, I completely agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9164.053s">Second</a>  piece of this, again, like this is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9168.524s">It's</a>  not that I don't want to stand by my principles, it's that multiple principles are in conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9174.452s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9177.256s">It's</a>  not just department heads who are going to get a coal erase. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9180.617s">And</a>  this, this equipment thing that we're talking about we're talking about Mike Wentzel said the same thing that about chief Friedman's order for the fire trucks that he said about this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9189.548s">If</a>  we put in the order now it'll take a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9191.53s">If</a>  we don't it could take a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9193.592s">Right</a>  now the chief said two years three years that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9196.215s">I</a>  don't want to debate the specifics because principles are in conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9201.972s">The</a>  reason principals are in conflict are the reasons that everyone has said and everyone has shared, which is that the process is not what it should be and we are not included in the people who need to be included in a process to build trust and engender a trust and build a good relationship and get a good work product is not happening and needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9218.546s">Now,</a>  we just earlier tonight voted on specific tools and amendments to give us more leverage and authority that quite frankly, again, I think even the mayor when she was a Councilor said that the council should have to make sure that there's a fair and balanced process. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9232.175s">But</a>  again, my principles are in conflict here because there are people who are not department heads who fall in the non-union category more than you would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9239.516s">Yes,</a>  department heads fall into it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9241.417s">Yes,</a>  department heads fall into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9242.797s">If</a>  I could just, I didn't interrupt you and I'd be happy to hear your response. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9247.538s">The</a>  people who fall into it who say the same thing that I'm hearing from union workers who say they shouldn't have gotten a raise, that they need a raise and they haven't gotten it and there's a reason that they need it because they need to support themselves and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9258.624s">Are</a>  those people gonna leave the city too for the exact same reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9261.185s">And</a>  should I be forced to pit those two groups against each other? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9263.907s">Absolutely</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9264.867s">But</a>  that's not the authority that is given to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9267.669s">That</a>  choice has been made for me by the person who has that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9271.231s">So</a>  now I have the choice of disappointing one group or another group and one group not getting what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9276.293s">And</a>  I don't even have a choice to give them what they want or another group not getting what they want because, and what they deserve, because we're holding up something that they deserve and they have a right to <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9287.852s">because</a>  we're being forced to pit people against each other in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9291.534s">So</a>  again, when I was talking earlier about the scarcity mindset, that's the trap that we're all being boxed into. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9302.038s">One,</a>  because quite frankly, we don't even have the authority that we should have to have an equal voice in the conversation, which is something we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9309.582s">And</a>  two, yes, there is a dearth of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9312.163s">So</a>  I do agree that we should have more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9315.204s">But</a>  again, when we're talking about here, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9317.889s">the</a>  bond order or a less than $100,000 wage adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9321.172s">And</a>  the choice is that we could reject those and probably do nothing because the people listening don't care if we reject it generally, or we could actually make some positive progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9334.603s">I'm</a>  going to pick the positive progress side. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9336.705s">And</a>  it's not that I'm going to feel good in the morning about it or bad in the morning about it, because I'm going to feel both in the morning about it because my principles are in conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9347.959s">And</a>  the principle that I want to put forward to support working people by voting against this, I gain nothing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9356.826s">The</a>  principle to support working people who aren't in the union, I actually harm if I vote against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9363.731s">I</a>  don't want to belabor this anymore, but I also don't want to cut off further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9367.534s">I</a>  respect my colleagues who don't vote for it, but it's really just a question of, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9374.515s">punishing</a>  people who have no role and voice in this, because the people that should have their backs don't have their backs in the way that they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9384.462s">And</a>  I'm not going to be the person at the end of the day who punishes someone and makes them suffer for something they had no role in creating, because I just don't fundamentally think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9394.548s">And</a>  I respect the people who think that that's not holding the line because I want to hold the line too. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9399.091s">And</a>  I'm, I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9400.372s">I've</a>  said it every time we've talked about this, I'm deeply conflicted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9403.255s">But</a>  that principle is what I draw on when I make my final call here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9406.919s">I</a>  could see it the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9410.182s">On</a>  a different day, I could see it the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9412.725s">It</a>  sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9413.606s">And</a>  it's not the position we should be put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9415.287s">And</a>  that's where I think on this larger concept and the larger issue at hand, we do all agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9421.35s">So</a>  I hope that we can, in good faith, work to create solutions that create a better process for everyone so that we're not put in a position of pitting people against each other or punishing or causing harm to people for no reason that they created. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9436.737s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9437.677s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9439.098s">Thank</a>  you, President Bernal. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9439.918s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9441.199s">I</a>  think that the frustration that we felt around some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9450.277s">information</a>  or lack thereof that we've gotten in the city's financial health. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9453.599s">I</a>  don't think that that anger and frustration is fairly directed at the department head so we might be receiving it from I think that it's all a symptom of the same problem, which is that this city does not have the resources and the tools that it needs to be thriving and fully functional and reasonably staffed and have all staff be reasonably compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9469.946s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9474.418s">You</a>  know, I think that we all share the same values here and I really want for us to be able to continue this conversation over the next couple months with our <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9483.786s">knowing</a>  that we share the same values around this and knowing our real roadblock and adversary here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9488.65s">I</a>  do not think that this is unionized personnel against department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9493.775s">I</a>  don't think this is unionized personnel against non-unionized department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9497.218s">And</a>  I don't think that any of my fellow Councilors are saying that for the most part, but I think that we're in the danger of rhetorically falling into that trap. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9505.244s">And</a>  I don't wanna leave the community with that impression because the non-unionized personnel are not the problem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9513.045s">the</a>  folks, you know, everybody deserves that Cola increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9517.367s">We</a>  can't fix the situation of union bargaining in the city by withholding this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9522.67s">And</a>  that's why I'm not going to withhold my vote of support on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9526.05s">I</a>  think I've said all this before, but it's just, it's so important to me that I want to say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9531.212s">I</a>  think we can't fall prey to this misdirection. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9535.014s">We</a>  have to know our real roadblock here because our real roadblock is the one that we all agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9539.796s">And</a>  it's the fact that we don't have the political will to allocate the money that we do have to pay everybody and bargain with everybody the way that they to be bargained with. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9551.658s">That's</a>  why I won't be withholding my vote on this tonight because I don't think that this is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9557.023s">And</a>  we've been talking a lot specifically this evening and also in general about the tools that would empower us to deal with the actual roadblock here, but this isn't it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9566.791s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9570.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9571.332s">Um,</a>  I think it's fairly clear where we all stand on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9574.255s">We've</a>  talked about this for probably more meetings than I can count on my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9580.439s">So</a>  I think, um, I think we should move the question.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9584.882s">Councilor</a>  has requested to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9586.604s">Councilor,</a>  I'm sorry, Councilor Tseng has requested to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9588.665s">Councilor</a>  Knight already did have his hand up, so we'll go to him and take this question.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9592.468s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9593.689s">A</a>  couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9594.349s">First</a>  of all, the rank and file need it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9597.031s">The</a>  rank and file workers need it more because they make less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9601.949s">Right,</a>  the rank and file make less more. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9604.512s">So,</a>  these races have a bigger impact on their life than they were in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9609.197s">Number</a>  two, we don't see our rank and file union workers getting reclassification requests presented to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9620.89s">We</a>  don't have the FOB reclassification plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9623.773s">The</a>  Friends of Brianna reclassification plan, depending on who you are and what role you're in, you might get a raise, you might not, you might get a reclassification, you might reclassify your title. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9633.545s">Number</a>  three, Madam President, these non-union personnel do have a role in the breakdown <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9641.771s">in</a>  labor relations between the rank-and-file workers and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9645.435s">You</a>  can't say that the chief of staff, that the city attorney, that the HR director haven't had a direct impact on the breakdown in the relationship and the morale with our rank-and-file workers in the fire department, in the DPW, in the clerical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9657.87s">You</a>  can't say it, because we've seen them here expressing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9664.603s">What</a>  was requested from the administration some 30 plus months ago was not a dearth of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9671.867s">It</a>  was rather concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9674.409s">A</a>  copy of the Warren articles once a month that shows us where you're spending the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9678.211s">That's</a>  all we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9681.212s">Now,</a>  usually when there's conflict, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9688.663s">You</a>  don't have to act when there's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9690.904s">You</a>  can take a step back and wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9692.705s">So</a>  if your values are being conflicted, wouldn't now be the time to take a step back and not hurt anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9699.267s">Sit</a>  back and wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9699.987s">Because</a>  that's what I'm comfortable doing this evening, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9705.99s">I</a>  don't want to vote him down. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9707.33s">I</a>  just want him to sit right where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9708.991s">And</a>  let's see if some of these issues that we're talking about work themselves out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9712.592s">Because</a>  I'm not comfortable supporting these <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9717.29s">requests</a>  that are before us this evening, based upon the current events that are going on in this community, the circumstances that arise every time we request financial transparency, the circumstances that arise every time we request basic information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9737.709s">If</a>  we keep being the rubber stamp, we're going to get treated <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9741.873s">just</a>  like that, a rubber stamp, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9744.374s">I</a>  rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9745.054s">We've</a>  debated this thing till we're all blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9748.036s">You</a>  know, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9749.016s">It's</a>  a dead horse at this point in time, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9751.317s">But,</a>  you know, when I sat there and I looked at those workers that were standing here, the 200 workers that were standing here, and I told them I stood with them, I meant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9758.42s">And</a>  I'm gonna stand with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9759.52s">And</a>  that's where I'll stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9760.361s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9762.681s">Point</a>  of information, President Barras.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9765.343s">We've</a>  rejected 16 of the 18 CAFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9767.463s">So</a>  by any respect, we are basically the opposite of a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9771.82s">they're</a>  two for 18, wouldn't even be a good record and for a bait, you know, wouldn't even be a good average for a hitter in baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9780.712s">And</a>  again, in my opinion here, the inaction is what is what's going to cause the harm and the actions not going to I respect the other opinion, but I just don't <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9788.82s">I</a>  don't like the idea of it being framed that by doing this, we're not supporting the workers or a rubber stamp because 90% of the time we're doing what they ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9796.845s">And</a>  there are specific cases that come up and we hear about specific harms that may be caused by inaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9802.049s">I</a>  don't wanna be in that position, but I'm also not gonna actively harm people. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9806.732s">In</a>  my opinion, what I feel is active harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9809.113s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9810.274s">I</a>  just don't wanna be pigeonholed, which I felt like that was happening a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9814.317s">Again,</a>  I'm not saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9817.73s">that</a>  you're not supporting people by not voting for it, but you're saying by voting for it, that I'm not supporting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9823.533s">And</a>  that's just, it's a little farther than I'd like this to go, but I respect where you're coming from on this.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9830.357s">Point</a>  of personal privilege on that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9834.779s">Ultimately,</a>  the people that I'm trying to support in this community are the taxpayers, the people that put us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9842.784s">That's</a>  who I'm trying to support because I see this lack of fiscal transparency as a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9847.555s">We</a>  haven't had this with any other administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9850.298s">We've</a>  never had an administration run on a platform of transparency, and then shut all the lights off in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9860.388s">So</a>  we have we've been debating both papers it seems we have two separate papers and we have a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9865.372s">So</a>  I'm going to take them in order we have the loan order for cyber construction equipment bonds eligible for third reading tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9872.632s">We</a>  have a B paper from Councilor Caraviello to get a report on free cash, how we ended up with the amount of free cash we have and what is eligible for use of, and anything I'm missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9882.018s">Yeah,</a>  that's why I said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9884.6s">So</a>  we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9885.701s">So</a>  on the motion from Councilor Caraviello on the B paper, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9891.805s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll for the B paper only.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10170.947s">Director</a>  Dickinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10172.707s">Vice</a>  Mayor, is that a question I think you may have missed?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10176.368s">We</a>  removed at our last meeting, the mayor and the city council were included in the COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10181.869s">And</a>  I'm just wondering if the removal of those positions that we all unanimously voted for has changed the amount of the appropriation for free cash for the COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10202.294s">Oh,</a>  your microphone's not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10203.475s">Shane,</a>  can you turn on the microphone at the podium?</p>

    <p>[3gvhm0AovZU_SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10209.96s">The</a>  calculations are the same.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10213.083s">We're</a>  still finalizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10214.624s">When</a>  you're doing these things where you're doing <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10226.594s">Combining</a>  step increases with cost of living increases every year, everything has to be calculated separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10237.028s">It's</a>  a good number about, I would say, $15,000 to $20,000 worth of that $80,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10244.838s">is</a>  retro pay for people from fiscal 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10249.423s">The</a>  fiscal 2022 amounts have been accrued on fiscal 2022 because they are fiscal 22 expenses, so we actually reserve that money in fiscal 2022 to pay those COLAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10264.258s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10265.893s">The</a>  rest of it, it's probably a little bit more than we need, but we can do budget with just, there should be room in the budgets because the non-COLA, I mean the non-union positions are spread about the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10282.138s">So</a>  there should be enough room in the budgets to cover that if we have some, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10288.62s">probably</a>  about $60,000 worth of free cash to cover that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10292.803s">So</a>  I don't expect there won't be any change in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10299.788s">We</a>  will be able to find the money to do all this, to do the retro pay and finish out the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10312.339s">cover</a>  the salary increases that we will need going forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10317.321s">And</a>  I just want to confirm it that the mayor and the city council are not included in this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10321.703s">Yeah,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10322.483s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10323.443s">I</a>  just want to make sure because that's they were when we first looked at it and then we voted to exclude. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10327.265s">So</a>  thank you, Director Dickinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10329.326s">I</a>  appreciate the detailed response. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10334.248s">Or</a>  the response.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10336.088s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10339.647s">Do</a>  I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10344.551s">Motion</a>  to approve for third reading or just motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10348.254s">The</a>  motion of Vice-President Bears to approve the free crash appropriation of $8,000 for the non-unit COLA adjustment seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10357.042s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10358.923s">Vice-President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10359.764s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10361.766s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10362.526s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10370.933s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10375.116s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10377.758s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10378.179s">Five</a>  in the affirmative, two in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10379.92s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10382.062s">Public</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10382.942s">Do</a>  we have any members on Zoom or in person who would like to participate in public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10388.847s">Anyone</a>  who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10392.51s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10393.611s">Oh,</a>  Matthew Page Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10395.592s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[b-MzuLbfz14_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10399.715s">Yeah,</a>  Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10402.978s">So</a>  there was some conversation earlier, extremely appreciative of Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins talking about pedestrian and bicyclist safety on these roads, especially about potholes, having to navigate when there's a lot of, there are a lot of these works going on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10421.175s">I'm</a>  talking about these really, really ongoing projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10424.805s">to</a>  repair whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10425.706s">Now,</a>  as far as the city, or, you know, I subscribe to the city website, you know, so I get all the notices, I'm sure that I'm like less than 1% of the population that actually has it configured. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10437.934s">So</a>  whatever city has a new blog post, I get an email about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10442.357s">I</a>  think that, you know, I think there's some of this argument that the city isn't doing <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10446.74s">a</a>  great job as far as people always say that the city is not doing a really good job of outreach and informing the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10453.644s">I</a>  think it could always be improved upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10455.965s">However,</a>  as a cyclist, as a pedestrian, I know that a lot of times when I'm trying to, I do have to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10464.21s">Maybe</a>  some Councilors believe that there has to be a course at Tufts so that people have to have personal responsibility when they cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10473.435s">This</a>  is really kind of missing the larger point. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10476.918s">when</a>  we make these kinds of arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10479.285s">But</a>  now, you know, trying to navigate this stuff and knowing that there are these, you know, trucks <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10485.105s">busses,</a>  angry motorists and stuff like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10488.026s">A</a>  lot of times when I'm walking by, I try to ask like, you know, just looking at a project, how long is this supposed to be going on for? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10495.109s">And</a>  why is that project here? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10497.11s">And</a>  so sometimes I have like this kind of question of, does the city council have the ability to kind of set any ordinance that signs will be posted about all these projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10507.495s">This</a>  is our expected, you know, termination date. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10510.436s">And</a>  this is why we're doing this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10513.197s">I</a>  know that this is the end of the night, but it is something I would like to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10515.599s">How</a>  do you follow up and kind of get an answer to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10518.18s">Because</a>  I assume that there's some kind of basic, a very simple answer about, you know, if it's a state project or whatever, but that would be something that I think the city would really benefit from this kind of notices right at the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10528.887s">This</a>  is why we're doing this, and this is when we plan to end the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10531.869s">That</a>  would be very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10534.811s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10538.333s">The</a>  motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Vice Chair Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10540.874s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10553.986s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=10554.907s">Yes,</a>  I'm the first thing that I gave motion passes me in the future.</p>
