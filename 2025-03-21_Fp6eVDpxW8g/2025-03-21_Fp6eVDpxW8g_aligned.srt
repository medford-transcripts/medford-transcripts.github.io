1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,241
Council will come to order.

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,343
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:05,624
Present.

4
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:11,128
With five present and two absent, please rise to salute the flag.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:33,398
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,961
Commendations.

7
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,183
We have two commendations.

8
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:42,825
They were offered by Councilor Knight.

9
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:45,247
So we'll table those for next week.

10
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,171
And motion of Councilor Knight to table those commendations.

11
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:50,871
All those in favor?

12
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,532
All those opposed?

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,259
matter is tabled.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,903
Uh, 15 a dash three 54 offered by president dollar.

15
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:07,531
So be it resolved that the Medford city council received soup on it and members of the Medford relay for life to address the council regarding their upcoming event.

16
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:14,036
Sue is not with us tonight, but Debbie Mitchell is, and we invite you up to address the council.

17
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,059
Just please state your name and address for the record.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,760
Thank you.

19
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:23,348
My name is Debbie Mitchell, and I live at 33 Bay State Road, Linfield, Mass.

20
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:33,150
With me tonight is Ellen Nason, and she's the American Cancer Society rep, and she's also going to be giving a little talk after I finish.

21
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,091
Good evening.

22
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:44,232
Thank you, President De La Russo and city council members for giving us the opportunity to address the council and the community of Medford tonight.

23
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,650
I'd like to start by sharing a speech from one of our past relays that was given during the Luminaria ceremony.

24
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:56,392
What makes a person brave is not letting their fears stop them.

25
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:03,253
This statement defines a survivor, a caregiver, and those currently facing cancer.

26
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,854
Cancer is a disease that knows no boundaries.

27
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,455
It strikes anyone and at any time.

28
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:13,156
Even with today's modern medical technology,

29
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:16,298
It has the ability to outsmart doctors.

30
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,140
And that is why tonight we are all here to celebrate a world with less cancer and more birthdays.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,321
Tonight we celebrate with all our survivors.

32
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:33,402
We also remembered our loved ones who have lost their battle to cancer, and through their experience, they taught us.

33
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,723
Remember their courage.

34
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,583
Remember how they never complained.

35
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:41,464
Remember that each day is a gift.

36
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:46,403
Remember their endurance and determination to keep on fighting.

37
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,627
Remember their hope and their ability to never stop believing.

38
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:57,292
Remember that they remind us that life is very precious and there is no greater gift than love.

39
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:01,856
Remember that there are angels who walk among us.

40
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,980
The first relay for Life of Method Somerville was in 2007.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,404
It was started by my dear friend Linda Corrigan, a longtime Method resident and cancer survivor.

42
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:22,770
Since 2007, I am proud to report that the Relay for Life of Medford Somerville has raised well over half a million dollars for the American Cancer Society.

43
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:30,337
This year's event will take place on Friday, June 5, 2015 at Hormel Stadium, starting at 6 p.m.

44
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:31,858
and will end at midnight.

45
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:40,865
In the past, the Relay was an overnight event, but however, the committee of volunteers, we started planning back in September and decided to change the venue.

46
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:45,373
We currently have 19 teams and 67 participants.

47
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,815
The teams agreed to keep one member on the track at all times.

48
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:56,298
These teams are made up of people from businesses, families, friends, schools, clubs, and churches.

49
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,580
The relay for life represents hope.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,942
Hope that those who left are never forgotten.

51
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,463
Hope that those who are battling cancer are supported.

52
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,285
Hope that researches are funded.

53
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:12,696
and hope that cancer is one day eliminated.

54
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:18,739
Honoring and recognizing survivors and caregivers are a key component of our event.

55
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,962
We start with an opening ceremony, followed with a survival app and a survivor dinner.

56
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:32,167
There is music and entertainment throughout the evening as well as a relay marketplace where teams set up tables and sell raffle items for prizes.

57
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:43,615
At 9 p.m., we have an emotional luminaria ceremony of candles and white paper bags to remember those who have lost their lives to cancer and those who are battling cancer.

58
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:47,178
These glowing bags line the entire track.

59
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:54,323
At this point, there is a single silent lap for all to participate as we follow the bagpiper around the track.

60
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,267
In the stands, we have the words hope and cure.

61
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,232
glowing large for all to see as we make our way around the track.

62
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:04,653
It's very emotional and beautiful.

63
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,474
We invite you to join us this year.

64
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:08,715
We have just over $10,000.

65
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:12,096
Our goal for this year is $100,000.

66
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,278
Yes, we need the community's help to reach our goal.

67
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,859
How can you help?

68
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,020
Become a team captain and have your own team.

69
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,181
Registration is free this year.

70
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,722
Spread the word.

71
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,403
Recruit family, friends, and coworkers.

72
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,382
Become a Relay sponsor.

73
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:32,364
Purchase and decorate luminaria bags.

74
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:36,105
Donate gift cards, raffle items, and food.

75
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:43,368
Your reasons for walking in the Relay for Life are as unique and special as the story that motivates you.

76
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:54,372
This is your opportunity to not only honor cancer survivors and remember people who have lost, but also to raise funds and awareness to help save lives.

77
00:05:55,776 --> 00:06:02,518
Because of your support, we are creating a world where cancer can't claim another year of anyone's life.

78
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:07,260
You are creating a world with less cancer and more birthdays.

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,760
Thank you again for your time tonight.

80
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,921
Thank you.

81
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:12,981
Hi.

82
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:18,003
My name's Ellen Nason, and I wanted to thank you for inviting us and allowing us to speak tonight.

83
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:26,724
Debbie just shared some great information about our upcoming event, the Relay for Life of Medford, and I'm here representing the American Cancer Society.

84
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:43,807
I specifically work with this community, that is, my entire job is to be working with the Metro-North area, helping to implement cancer awareness programs, share information about our patient programs, and work with amazing volunteers like Debbie on our events.

85
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:49,606
So Debbie spoke to why raising this money is so important in this community.

86
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:54,307
And I wanted to share a little bit about what the American Cancer Society does with the money that we raise.

87
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:59,489
So we are the largest nonprofit private funder of cancer research.

88
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,190
And since 1946, we have invested $4 billion into cancer research.

89
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,111
We've seen the death rate decline by 20% since 1991.

90
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,311
And that translates into roughly 1.3

91
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,367
million lives that have been saved as a result.

92
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:19,309
The power of our research is impressive.

93
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,553
We have played a role in nearly every single cancer breakthrough.

94
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:41,505
This includes linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer, dramatically increasing the five-year survival rate of childhood leukemia by 90%, and we have also funded cutting-edge research, including 47 Nobel Prize winners.

95
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:49,161
We have many patient programs and health and wellness programs right here in this area that many people are not even aware of.

96
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:55,249
For example, we have a 1-800 number that's available to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

97
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:56,810
And this is a little bit unique.

98
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:09,860
So unlike calling many 800 numbers where you speak to somebody who may not even be in this country at the moment, when you call our 800 number, you are automatically transferred to somebody who has expertise in your area.

99
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,545
So if you're calling from Chelsea, Massachusetts, you're speaking to somebody who knows the programs in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

100
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,167
If you're calling from Medford, they know the programs in Medford.

101
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,471
and they can put you in touch with people who can help.

102
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:26,352
We have a Boston Hope Lodge, which we are very fortunate to have right in this area.

103
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:34,254
The Boston Hope Lodge provides free housing right near the Boston hospitals for patients and caregivers.

104
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:41,536
And this saves patients approximately $7,000, and patients typically stay up to six weeks.

105
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:47,877
Our road to recovery program provides patients rides to treatment completely free of charge,

106
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:53,130
And in Massachusetts alone, we provided 16,000 rides last year.

107
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,511
So this is huge.

108
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:59,035
This is a program that I actually worked with when I first started with the American Cancer Society.

109
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:04,060
And I would field calls all day long from patients who had no way to get to treatment.

110
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:10,627
And it was a great service to be able to match them up with volunteers right in their area who could get them to and from their treatment.

111
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:28,320
So I think that these programs really speak to why this Relay for Life event in Medford is so important and why we're really hoping that we can get the community on board and we need everybody's support to raise $100,000, which is a very lofty goal and would be the highest that this community has ever raised.

112
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:32,501
So we thank you for your support and we hope to see you in June.

113
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,082
Thank you very much.

114
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:34,542
Thank you.

115
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,542
And Councilor Caffiello wants to speak.

116
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:37,963
Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,783
I'd like to thank you ladies for coming up here

118
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:41,628
and your cause.

119
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,288
My mother passed from cancer.

120
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,950
She battled cancer most of her life.

121
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,851
And it is a deadly disease.

122
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:55,394
And I, myself, have volunteered with Angel Flight for kids coming in from, you know, going, you know, for their treatment in Boston.

123
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:59,716
So I applaud your work, and I hope the whole community comes out and supports you on this way.

124
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:03,798
Thank you very much.

125
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,499
Councillor Knight.

126
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,460
Mr. President, motion to receive and place on file.

127
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,881
Thank you very much, ladies, for coming out today.

128
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,198
On that motion council max.

129
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:11,958
Thank you.

130
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,558
Mr. President.

131
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:20,742
I was just wondering Debbie or Deb, would you like to give out some contact information if anyone is interested in either?

132
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:36,448
donating to the relay For life or wants to put together a team Thank you, we actually have some of these

133
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:45,034
For the viewing audience, maybe if you can give some information on where someone may be able to look you up on an email or website.

134
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:45,354
Sure.

135
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:52,575
The website for the Relay for Life of Medford is relayforlife.org slash method MA.

136
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,215
And you can sign up today.

137
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,996
And again, as I stated earlier, registration is free.

138
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:58,616
There is no charge to register.

139
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:01,877
And then you can also contact Kayla.

140
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:12,430
who is our American Cancer Rep, in addition to Ellen, and it's Kayla.Hindle, H-I-N-D-L-E, at cancer.org.

141
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:23,294
And her direct line, I believe it's on this, the brochure, is 781-314-2630.

142
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:29,656
And you also have that 800 number if someone wanted a call to get some more information from?

143
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,017
Yes, that's 1-800.

144
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:33,023
227-2345.

145
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,906
And I can leave my business cards here.

146
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:38,447
It has all that.

147
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,948
It has our 800 information.

148
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,308
It also has my direct line.

149
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:46,932
So if you need any cancer-specific information or information on our free programs, I can provide that to you as well.

150
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:47,512
Thank you.

151
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,214
Just give those to the messenger, and he'll distribute them to the council.

152
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:55,317
Mr. President, if I could just say, this has been a great event in the city for a number of years.

153
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:59,640
It's due to the many volunteers that get active and involved.

154
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,262
I can't think of one person.

155
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,702
that hasn't been impacted in one way or another by this awful disease, Mr. President.

156
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,344
And it truly has no boundary.

157
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,345
It doesn't discriminate.

158
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:18,266
And it's something that we have to snuff out.

159
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:30,972
And it's people like Debbie and the many volunteers that have put in countless hours trying to keep this in the forefront with all the different things that are out there and different

160
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,112
people pulled in different directions.

161
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:40,616
I think this is such a worthy cause, Mr. President, that we have to do our best to make sure we can eradicate this awful disease.

162
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:45,499
So, again, I thank you both, and I hope it's going to be a big success, which I'm sure it will.

163
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,840
Thank you very much for coming tonight.

164
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:48,861
Thank you.

165
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,623
On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

166
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:53,804
All those in favor?

167
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:54,664
All those opposed?

168
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:56,225
Motion carries.

169
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:57,086
Thank you all.

170
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:17,988
15355 offered by councillor night be it resolved that the metric City Council welcome the building department snoozed employees Steve Campoli Steve Randazzo and PETA Barco councillor night mr. President.

171
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:18,669
Thank you very much

172
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:24,677
Very recently, the building department had welcomed three new employees on.

173
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:33,685
Steve Champoli handling plumbing inspection duties, Steve Randazzo handling some electrical inspection duties, both of whom were classmates of mine at Medford High School.

174
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:37,069
As well as Peter Spock, who's going to be doing some code enforcement, Mr. President.

175
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,912
So I think this is a very welcome addition to the building department.

176
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:45,837
The council's been very outspoken in its need for a code enforcement officer, and we see one that's been put on.

177
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:50,729
I'd like to commend the administration for listening to the council and taking the council's advice.

178
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,412
And I wish these three individuals the best of luck and a healthy, happy, and successful career here in the city of Medford.

179
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:57,132
Thank you.

180
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,173
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

181
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:01,094
Seconded by Councilor Kern.

182
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,075
All those opposed?

183
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,796
Motion carries.

184
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:05,937
15-356 offered by Councilor Knight.

185
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:15,061
Be it resolved that a crosswalk be installed on Forest Street between King Avenue and Cedar Road to allow safe pedestrian travel for knighthood

186
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,846
neighborhood residents to McNally Park.

187
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:25,489
Be it further resolved, the installation of this crosswalk be implemented prior to the completion of the park upgrades.

188
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,169
Councilor Knight.

189
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,430
Again, Mr. President, thank you very much.

190
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:39,154
Last week we had a very fruitful discussion on crosswalks and I think we may have pushed the first domino over and a number of requests will be coming in over the next coming months.

191
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,276
But I was contacted by a family down on King Ave.

192
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:46,978
who was very excited to see that McNally Park was going to be renovated.

193
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:55,399
And one of the number one concerns that they had was the fact that there's no crosswalk for them to walk from their home to the park.

194
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:57,139
So I took a ride down Forest Street.

195
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:02,020
And I think that the first crosswalk would be at Forest Street and Governor's Ave.

196
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,001
And the next one is down in front of the old high school.

197
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:11,782
So I'd like to see a crosswalk put in somewhere that's a little bit closer to the vicinity of the park so that our residents who are willing to

198
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,053
utilize this investment that we just made can get there safely, Mr. President.

199
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:15,894
It's a good measure.

200
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:19,435
So on that motion, Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

201
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:20,796
All those opposed?

202
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:21,576
Motion carries.

203
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:36,843
And FYI, the acting Commissioner of Public Works informed me that the striping of the streets, lines, and sidewalks has commenced already in the city.

204
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:37,703
Councilor Marks?

205
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,397
Suspension of the rules, so gentlemen would like to speak.

206
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:44,818
Motion for suspension of the rules.

207
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:45,699
All those in favor?

208
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:45,979
Aye.

209
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:46,960
All those opposed?

210
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,801
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

211
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:53,423
Hi everyone, thank you.

212
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,865
I'm Jim Bilodeau, Gill Street, Medford.

213
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:59,887
I just want to give my comments and opinions about the Republic parking.

214
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:04,650
I think it was a better system what we had before this all came into effect in the city of Medford.

215
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:10,185
I always found a place to park in the city of Medford, whether it's in South Medford, West Medford, the Square.

216
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,866
I know they talk about these commuters.

217
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,827
All right, you give up a few spots, but you don't have to pay.

218
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:18,008
Now, if you want to shop, you have to pay to shop.

219
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:23,430
I know a lot of my friends won't come into Square, South Medford, or West Medford to shop, because they don't want to pay to shop.

220
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,771
And as far as their contract goes, that's void.

221
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,812
They voided that out many, many numerous times.

222
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:31,593
Look at all the things that they broke on the record.

223
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:32,733
They don't go by the rules.

224
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:39,331
They have signs that say that it's enforced at 7 to 7.

225
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:41,391
But it's 6 to 6.

226
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,052
What is it?

227
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:42,612
6 to 6?

228
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,452
8 to 6.

229
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:45,553
Oh, 8 to 6, yeah.

230
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,734
But the signs say 7 to 7, right?

231
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,174
They just changed that.

232
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:51,314
Are they changing them?

233
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:53,975
There's still some.

234
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,516
I see them in different spots.

235
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,136
And it's illegal.

236
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:59,537
They're charging people before time.

237
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:02,338
They're taking their money illegally to park.

238
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:05,277
So that breaks the contract, it's void.

239
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:07,117
The whole contract is void.

240
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:11,419
I think the city council should take the contract and rip it up because it's all voided out.

241
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,559
Everything that they've done.

242
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,140
They've given people tickets that have handicapped stickers.

243
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,662
They've given people tickets that are going to the kiosks 50 yards away.

244
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:27,548
Sir, I want you to understand that the Memphis City Council doesn't have the authority over the contract.

245
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:32,412
The traffic commission has the authority over the contract, and the mayor is the chief negotiating authority for the contract.

246
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:33,433
The contract is void.

247
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,355
It's voided out numerous times.

248
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:40,959
Just one thing would void it out, but they have a laundry list of things that they've done.

249
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:44,842
I mean, giving handicapped people a ticket, you know?

250
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:51,322
And then people going to the kiosks while they're programming it, they're giving them a ticket on their window.

251
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:54,264
They give them that white little, you know, receipt.

252
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,485
They're getting a fine, for Christ's sake, and they're trying to pay.

253
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:00,067
And, you know, it's just on and on.

254
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:02,248
They have vessels that are going around, they're sneaking around.

255
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:03,989
You don't know who they are.

256
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,391
They come up on top of you and they give you a ticket while you're going to pay.

257
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:09,185
That voids it out.

258
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,608
And a few weeks from now, we're going to have the countable.

259
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,970
Oh boy, can I buy stock in Republic?

260
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,954
They're going to have a field day in this city, huh, with all the people coming in from the other cities.

261
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,696
They'll be ticketing them everywhere.

262
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:22,758
So, you know what I mean?

263
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,720
It's just a bad situation.

264
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,087
So if we can't void it out, then why don't we put it on the ballot and make it a binding question for the people of this city, we'll vote it out.

265
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,632
Yeah, that's all we have to do.

266
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:42,254
There's a methodology if someone wants to put something on the ballot.

267
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,536
And signing petition.

268
00:18:48,056 --> 00:19:00,100
And I don't think anybody here agrees with you that the plan, that disagrees with you on the fact that the plan was rolled out and it was rolled out ineffectively and that it's created quite a bit of hardship for a number of residents and businesses here in the community.

269
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:05,575
I just want you to be aware that this council doesn't have the power or authority to change anything in the contract.

270
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,396
It doesn't have the power or the authority to change anything.

271
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:10,677
Can we get it on the ballot and we can have an opined question?

272
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:12,437
It would have to be a citizen initiative.

273
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:16,158
A citizen initiative by creating a valid question.

274
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,038
We the people by the people.

275
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,620
I would like to let you know that Wednesday the 22nd at 6 o'clock, I believe, 5.30, 6 o'clock.

276
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:25,107
6 o'clock.

277
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:25,667
6 o'clock.

278
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,768
We're having a meeting here in the chambers with the traffic commission.

279
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:29,228
With them?

280
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,249
With traffic commission and representatives from the public.

281
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,250
They're going around and playing my cars and they're giving people tickets.

282
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,011
You don't know who they are.

283
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:36,811
You know what they do too?

284
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,671
They double park in the Medford Square.

285
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:48,995
I've seen them almost cause accidents because they're so in a hurry to give somebody a ticket, they double park out there with no monitoring on their vessels, no flashing.

286
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:49,755
Bang!

287
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:50,355
Accident.

288
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,657
Look at the poor lady that fell this past winter trying to pay for that thing.

289
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,418
She slipped in the ice and went to the hospital.

290
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:59,820
There's so many numerous problems with this situation.

291
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,442
This used to be a friendly city where you could come here and shop.

292
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:04,923
Now it isn't.

293
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,544
It's not a friendly city anymore.

294
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,025
You can't come here and shop.

295
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:10,326
Who wants to pay to shop?

296
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,907
So you just go somewhere else.

297
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,447
All my friends tell me they ain't going here.

298
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:14,088
They got tickets.

299
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,919
I have a friend, a couple in Stoneham.

300
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,840
They live in Stoneham.

301
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,460
They like to go to Medford Square and go to the restaurants.

302
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
They come out and get a ticket.

303
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,641
They ain't going to shop.

304
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,121
They ain't going to go there and eat anymore.

305
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,621
I'm going to go where I don't have to get a fare of a ticket.

306
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:32,183
I mean, it's so, I have other things, too, that I was going to mention, but you kind of forget.

307
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:35,003
But they avoided out this contract.

308
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,044
And they didn't even hire anybody from Medford.

309
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,604
That voids out the contract.

310
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:40,684
What's it supposed to be, 60% of the Medford people?

311
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,225
Thank you.

312
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,205
Counselor Longo, current.

313
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,880
Thank you, President De La Rosa.

314
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,182
I also was going to mention that we do have a subcommittee meeting on this at 6 p.m.

315
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:55,424
next Wednesday, because I think everything you've spoken about, the Council has spoken about numerous times.

316
00:20:55,824 --> 00:21:01,326
Especially last week, we brought up, I and the rest of my colleagues brought up a number of the issues.

317
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,767
Here's another good example for you.

318
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:07,508
As I'm thinking about all the void things that they've done with this contract, they voided it right out.

319
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:08,949
One thing would void it right out.

320
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:09,409
It's no good.

321
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:09,969
It's illegal.

322
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,130
They're collecting illegal money.

323
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,351
They're taking people's money.

324
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:19,965
And people, they're putting in their registration number, and it's coming out another number.

325
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:21,486
And they're getting a ticket.

326
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:26,789
And then they're putting in their charge cards, and it's recording other people's charge card numbers.

327
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,551
And then they get a ticket.

328
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,491
That's dangerous.

329
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:32,972
You can't be doing that.

330
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,173
It's illegal.

331
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:35,353
it's

332
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,412
then we're going to have to put it on the ballot and have it a binding question.

333
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:59,495
And the people in Medford, we the people will vote this program right out of here.

334
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,457
And we can go right back to the way we were.

335
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,778
And everybody will be able to shop free.

336
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
And we'll be able to not have to pay to shop.

337
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,262
That's the way I see the whole situation.

338
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,384
And watch now when the carnival comes.

339
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,565
Oh, my god.

340
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,167
They'll be crawling under cars giving people tickets.

341
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,108
Thank you, and God bless you all.

342
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,610
Thank you very much.

343
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,030
Counselor Garfield?

344
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,329
This will be a good ballot question for the new mayor coming up.

345
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,870
Oh, yes, that's right.

346
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,614
This will be, I think, a number one, one of the big topics in the upcoming election for the new mayor.

347
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:35,598
I'll guarantee you, whoever runs, if he runs again, he will not win in this city ever again.

348
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:36,919
The mayor is not running for re-election.

349
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,580
He isn't?

350
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,080
He is not.

351
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,722
Yeah, so now he's going to stick it to us.

352
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:40,602
In the meantime, huh?

353
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:40,902
We'll see.

354
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,324
All right.

355
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,786
Thank you, sir.

356
00:22:53,102 --> 00:23:06,192
Be it resolved the Council President to sign all resolutions filed in 2014 for which the Council has yet to receive a response to the appropriate subcommittee for further investigation and review.

357
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:06,992
Councilor Knight.

358
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:08,813
Mr. President, thank you very much.

359
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,674
Thank you, Councilor.

360
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:17,300
Last week we passed a resolution, and the resolution suggested that, you know, the Mayor isn't responding to resolutions in a timely fashion.

361
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,963
I think we were all in agreement that the 10-day window is met sometimes, but rarely.

362
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,305
And we discussed putting on the tracking sheet the date that the resolution went forward.

363
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:33,249
And that led me to take a look at the tracking sheets that we have, Mr. President, and the resolutions that have gone unanswered.

364
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:49,624
And I think that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of the residents of the city of Medford for us to take a look at the resolutions that have gone forward that have been unanswered, sign them to subcommittee, and have the subcommittee further investigate and review the matters that were brought before this body, that were passed by this body, and that were sent to the administration.

365
00:23:50,229 --> 00:24:02,911
Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I put this resolution forward, um, with the hopes that, um, you know, my colleagues would support the idea of us actually taking ownership of some of these issues that we sent across the hall to the mayor's office for action where there hasn't been action.

366
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:08,872
Um, and we continuously send the same resolution saying the same thing to the same person to get the same result.

367
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:15,934
I believe Albert Einstein was the person that said that would be the definition of insanity to do the same thing over and over again and expect that it's a different result.

368
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:16,714
Um, so,

369
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:26,556
I looked at this as an opportunity for us to change the way that we do business a little bit here, take ownership of some of these issues that we've sent forward to the administration, and let's roll up our sleeves and get to work and see if we can resolve some of them.

370
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:41,300
So what you're saying in this resolution is that by the vote of this resolution, the council is authorizing the president to act on the councilor's behalf to send all those papers in?

371
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,660
Yes.

372
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,144
at his discretion.

373
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,686
Into the subcommittee structure that we have present, you know what I mean?

374
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,208
And then we can take a look at investigating the matter further.

375
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:52,992
Some of these items that we sent forward that have gone, you know, without an answer may have already been resolved.

376
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:53,973
They might have resolved themselves.

377
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:54,633
Right.

378
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,616
So, you know, I think that it's just, you know, good for housekeeping.

379
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,296
Very good.

380
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:07,044
So I will, in consultation with the clerk, if this meets the approval of our colleagues, act on that once we have an updated list.

381
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,390
Councilor Langel-Kernan.

382
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,350
Thank you, President Knight.

383
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,611
I think it's a good resolve.

384
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:16,352
Just looking at one simple sheet we have.

385
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,812
We get one, I think, once a month on our resolutions.

386
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,213
We have a date responded to, date referred out.

387
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:30,295
And this one, which is from a few months ago, shows that we got responses on 11 out of 34 resolutions.

388
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,796
So I think it's definitely needed.

389
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:32,636
We do need that.

390
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,416
It's a good resolve.

391
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:36,997
I mean, to think outside the box and figure out a way that we can make

392
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,929
be more productive in, you know, what we're doing here every Tuesday night.

393
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:43,489
So I agree with it.

394
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,690
I second the resolve and move approval.

395
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,352
On the motion of approval, seconded by Councillor Longo-Kurt, Councillor Marx.

396
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:52,733
Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:56,614
And I thank my colleague for bringing this up.

398
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:07,138
However, I'm not quite sure what the actual resolution would do to solve any concerns that we may have.

399
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:22,814
with not getting a response from the administration, uh, which is, uh, a response that is set forth under section 55 of the charter, which requires the mayor to respond back to the council within 10 days.

400
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:35,400
Um, if the mayor fails to respond back to the council, I'm not quite sure that having the paper then come back to the council and be sent to one of our subcommittees

401
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:43,877
solves any concern of anything at all, other than we just take the issue and take it off the mayor's plate.

402
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:58,561
My personal opinion is if originally it was sent to the mayor, it was sent because we were looking for a response from the administration or a department head or something that needed intervention from the mayor's office.

403
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:05,303
And to send it back to us to work on it again

404
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:07,172
to me makes no sense.

405
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:16,280
I think we should try to address the reasoning behind why we're not getting responses according to the city charter within a timely manner.

406
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,801
And that would be the issue.

407
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:22,765
And furthermore, you know, the councilor is correct.

408
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:29,831
And it may be things that we're sending to the mayor that are rhetorical in nature that we're really not even looking for a response.

409
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,874
And those things can be vetted out by this council.

410
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:46,249
But for the many resolutions that are sent to the mayor that go unresponded to, I'm not quite sure why we would want to welcome them back, put them in a subcommittee, for what purpose?

411
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,750
I'm still not sure what that solves.

412
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,771
If we want to really address the issue,

413
00:27:53,163 --> 00:28:02,388
We should be sitting down with the mayor saying, Mr. Mayor, we expect under the city charter, and that's the rules that regulate how the city operates.

414
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:06,751
If the mayor chooses not to operate under those rules, there's a larger issue.

415
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:16,436
But to try to circumvent the city charter and now take a paper that was originally sent to the mayor and say, well, we'll take it back because he never responded.

416
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:29,185
I'd like to hear, I'm open for discussion and dialogue, but I'd like to hear how that helps the legislative process and how that helps move issues forward on behalf of this community.

417
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:30,026
I don't see that.

418
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:31,367
Thank you, Council Member.

419
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:32,067
Council Member Nye.

420
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:42,354
Well, Mr. President, I do sometimes have concern about a resolution that starts off on the council floor that says, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss subject X, Y, and Z.

421
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:47,356
And before that discussion's over, the resolution turns into something that's a larger issue.

422
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:48,436
It's not a discussion.

423
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:49,556
It becomes an action item.

424
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:55,057
So, you know, I think that we have an underutilized subcommittee structure that's in place anyway, and I've said that for a year now.

425
00:28:55,517 --> 00:29:01,278
And, you know, I've tried to make efforts to put papers into subcommittee for further vetting and for further investigation and for further review.

426
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:08,619
But the one thing that we can do in subcommittee is we can call department heads to come before the committee and explain themselves as to why this hasn't happened or that hasn't happened.

427
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,460
We can figure out what's going on.

428
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,740
We can figure out the cost of items.

429
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:17,148
We can figure out legally whether or not there's an impediment to the question that we've asked.

430
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,629
We can really roll up our sleeves and dig in.

431
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:26,352
And if it's something that we want to work on, we can figure out what the problems are, why they exist, and then we can come up with a strategy to get around them.

432
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:27,892
We can send it to the administration.

433
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:30,934
The administration can look at it and say, yeah, that's something I'm going to work on.

434
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:33,915
But I also have all this stuff on my desk that I need to work on, too.

435
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,115
So it's going to happen when it happens.

436
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:36,996
Because this is my stuff, and that's what they've sent.

437
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:39,834
And I think that that's what's happening sometimes, Mr. President.

438
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:42,855
You know, it's obviously not an easy job to run a city.

439
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:43,735
I think we all know that.

440
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:47,976
And this body keeps the administration rather busy with our requests.

441
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:52,118
And I think that all the requests that we send across his desk have merit in one form or another.

442
00:29:52,818 --> 00:30:00,140
However, if they're not being addressed, then we need to send 14 or 15 resolutions to the administration relative to the lighting down at the Condon Shell.

443
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,262
And I went on the Internet and pulled up the Condon Shell agreement, and it clearly said, at dusk till dawn is when the shell is open.

444
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:12,295
So it would lead me to believe that because the shelves open just till dawn, they're probably not going to put lights down there until we get special approval from the DCI.

445
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,816
So we sent 15 resolutions on the same subject matter.

446
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,697
I pushed the internet, and they came up with a contract.

447
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,778
So I just think that it gives us another unique opportunity, Mr. President.

448
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,058
I'm not asking to do it with everything.

449
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm asking to do it with the resolutions that have gone forward from 2014 to date, just the resolutions from 2014 that have gone unresponded.

450
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,301
And let's try it out and see if we can do something different and get a better result than what we're getting.

451
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,081
Thank you.

452
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:34,922
Counselor?

453
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:36,542
Madam Vice President.

454
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:47,346
No, I just think what Councilor Marks has merit to, I think we should obviously get responses and we should be on the mayor to respond to our resolutions.

455
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:53,568
But I also think, you know, it is partly our duty to follow up and to make sure our resolutions are getting responded to.

456
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:58,590
So this is a way, another avenue, number one, to push the mayor, number two, to follow up on our own.

457
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,931
I think the mayor's got the administration's got away with it for

458
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:13,346
so long, and every time we bring up the matter and try to get on top of the administration, they'll start responding to more and more, and then kind of fall back and then start again.

459
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:19,230
So I think this is just another avenue to take it into our own hands and get the resolves answered.

460
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,811
So I think, you know, both counselors are right.

461
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:22,692
We need to do both.

462
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:31,577
Mr. President, just if I could, you know, it's this council that takes a vote on whether we send a paper.

463
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:32,718
It has to be a majority vote.

464
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:41,274
to the mayor, or whether we set up a committee of the whole meeting, or whether we send it to subcommittee, it's always this council that takes the vote.

465
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:54,380
So whatever has made its way to the mayor in the year 2014, which the councilor is talking about, was a majority vote of this council, saying we feel that this paper needs to go to the mayor for action.

466
00:31:55,471 --> 00:32:01,494
Now, if the council decided, you know what, we don't feel that's the best avenue to send it to the mayor first.

467
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:03,254
We rather send it to subcommittee.

468
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:10,918
Then it's under the purview of this council, which we do on many occasions, send it to subcommittee or committee the whole.

469
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:17,680
So I'm not, I'm still not quite sure taking a paper back that the mayor has not responded to.

470
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,682
And, and I might add a response.

471
00:32:20,842 --> 00:32:23,563
And I had a discussion just recently with the city solicitor.

472
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:28,106
A response of, I will take this under advisement, is a response.

473
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:31,688
You may not like the response, but it's a response.

474
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:37,432
If the mayor comes back and say, this is something I'm going to be working on, that's also a response.

475
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:40,814
And we could go back and say, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to know what a time frame is.

476
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,915
You know, the 10 days no longer applies.

477
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,717
How long you think you'll be working on this for?

478
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,539
So there is that dialogue that could take place.

479
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:59,586
I would just hate to see that this open up an avenue that the mayor, or not this mayor, or the next mayor, whoever it might be, say, you know what?

480
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,286
The city chart is requiring me to respond within 10 days.

481
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:11,068
However, if I don't, the council's just going to take the paper back, they're going to send it to a subcommittee, and good luck to them.

482
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,688
See what happens with that paper.

483
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:17,469
The slippery slope also is, and I'm not saying this will happen,

484
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:36,097
If I had an issue that was near and dear to me, and it gets sent to the subcommittee that Councilor Caviello sits on, along with two other members of the council, and they're not quite that hip on that issue that I'm hip on, that could sit in a burial for months and years in that subcommittee.

485
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,178
And I would have really no input on getting it out.

486
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:46,300
And I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it would lend itself to that type of activity.

487
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:57,649
I think the process that's in place, which was created by our forefathers of the city charter, definitely needs to be reviewed.

488
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,472
And I've been one of the most active members of this council calling for a review of the city charter.

489
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:08,975
And I've publicly stated what I think needs to be changed in the charter that hasn't been looked at.

490
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:10,735
in 28 years.

491
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:16,536
I mean, what other document would you say that you established 28 years ago is still valid?

492
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:21,057
I mean, no business plan would run on a business plan from 28 years ago.

493
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:38,820
No private corporation or entity would work on such a plan, but the city of Method has, in my opinion, has failed to look at the city charter in the past 28 years to bring it up to a day and age that we all know technology

494
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,098
and many other advances have taken place.

495
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:45,559
So, you know, I appreciate what Councilman Light brings up.

496
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:51,161
I think it's part of the frustration that's been behind this reel on getting answers and so forth.

497
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:55,343
I just don't like that particular avenue of getting to that approach.

498
00:34:55,823 --> 00:35:01,485
I think, honestly, whether it's this mayor or a future mayor, we have to follow the city charter.

499
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:05,406
And as it reads right now, within 10 days, we should get a response.

500
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,347
And I'm not going to go against the city charter.

501
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:12,589
If that's the rule, then whoever the mayor is should adhere to that rule.

502
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:18,553
And if they're not, maybe this council should stand up and take a vote of no confidence and say, you know what?

503
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:20,514
You're not adhering to the city charter.

504
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,575
We're not happy with the Mr. Mayor.

505
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:26,637
This is a vote of no confidence to let you know things better change.

506
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:33,641
But to say, you know what, we'll just take the paper back and scurried into a subcommittee, uh, and let them work on it.

507
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:36,803
You know, it was sent to the mayor for a reason.

508
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:39,663
I'm not quite sure that I can support that tonight.

509
00:35:40,503 --> 00:36:06,073
I would ask that we don't take a vote on this tonight and possibly this may be an issue that we want to discuss before one of the rules committee or one of the subcommittees that we have already established before we come up with such a major, it may seem like a minor piece of legislation, but it has a major profound impact on how this council runs and how we get

510
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,338
questions and answers from the administration, Mr. President.

511
00:36:10,078 --> 00:36:10,979
Thank you, Counselor.

512
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:16,340
So on the motion of approval by Counselors Knight and Longo Kern, Counselor Carvialho.

513
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,421
Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,021
I agree with Counselor Marks on this.

515
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:29,465
I mean, if anything needs to go to a subcommittee, I think this rule does because, like I said, this has an effect on our charter and the way we do business here.

516
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:35,307
So I think before we vote on this this evening, again, whether we go to the Rules Committee,

517
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:41,782
This is something that I think needs a little more discussion so we know that we're going in the right direction with this.

518
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:45,444
And like I said, it is up to the mayor to respond within 10 days.

519
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:52,350
And hey, let's say, if it's something near and dear to me, I'm going to be on the mayor's phone saying, hey, where is it?

520
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,010
Let's get it going.

521
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,613
That's part of our job to do our diligence.

522
00:36:57,313 --> 00:37:04,499
Something that's near and dear to our heart, then get on the mayor and get him to move on it.

523
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,104
Thank you, Councilor Cavillo.

524
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:07,644
Councilor Knight.

525
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:15,070
Again, Mr. President, like I said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

526
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:23,156
Obviously, week in and week out, we have the same people with the same complaints about lack of response from the administration, lack of respect from the administration.

527
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:35,365
I looked at this as a new and creative way for us to approach the way that we do business here, to take ownership of the issues that we send forward, to actually roll up our sleeves and get to work, dig down and figure it out, what's going on, talk with the department heads, talk with the people that are there on the ground,

528
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:37,783
that on the ground level doing this type of work, Mr. President.

529
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:39,183
So that's where I'm coming from.

530
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:46,665
Again, you know, I've been on the council now for a little bit over a year, and I haven't seen any proposal that would, you know, suggest that we change the way that we're doing business.

531
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:51,746
However, I've also sat here and I've listened to the same complaints week in and week out about the frustrations that people have.

532
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:59,328
I'm trying to come up with a solution to a problem, a problem that I feel as though is hindering the ability of this body to move forward and to act effectively.

533
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:01,869
So that's why I brought the resolution forward, Mr. President.

534
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:02,529
I'd ask for a roll call.

535
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:03,330
Thank you.

536
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,950
Mr. President,

537
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,210
Councilor Marks.

538
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,032
There's a thing called accountability too.

539
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:30,309
And I think we have to keep that in mind that, um, you know, uh, under the charter, the mayors accountable to respond back to this council and to remove that accountability, uh, and say that, uh, you know what, it's not important that the mayor respond back to us because we'll just take back any response we already sent to them and send it to a subcommittee.

540
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:33,952
I think sends the wrong message, not only to the members of this council,

541
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:38,185
but to the entire community itself that the process is broken right now.

542
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:50,293
And I can tell you as one member, the mayor came back to us several months back saying that if the council was interested in a dog park, they said, the mayor said, go out and find funding.

543
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:52,774
I took the ball, Mr. President.

544
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,095
I ran with the ball.

545
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:55,836
I organized my own committee.

546
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:56,597
We went out.

547
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:58,178
We found funding for a dog park.

548
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:03,423
So I know how to get things done in the community, and I know how to pick up a phone.

549
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,604
I've been doing this for a long time.

550
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:13,132
I talked to the department heads, but we all know under the city charter, there's one chief executive officer in this community, and he controls

551
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:32,356
a lot of the strings and what goes on in this community, and we need his input, and we need his support, and to, I think, create an environment that the council will work in its own vacuum, and the mayor will do whatever he wants to do, and that's not the way city government should operate.

552
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:43,400
And I don't think, I think it's well-intended, this resolution, but I don't think it suits any purpose other than, honestly, just lip service, and it's not gonna, in my opinion,

553
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,407
do anything to improve the process.

554
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:49,390
If anything, it's going to hamper the communications between the administration.

555
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:56,475
So at this point, Mr. President, I would, after the gentleman speaks, I would respectfully ask that this issue be tabled.

556
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,080
I'll remove it until the gentleman speaks then, Mr. President.

557
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,402
Motion is withdrawn.

558
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,245
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

559
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,194
Michael Ruggiero, I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

560
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:23,476
While I appreciate the frustration that has led to this motion, I strongly suggest that you neither table this resolution nor vote yes for it.

561
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:36,659
This council, if so many resolutions have gone to the mayor and the mayor has ignored them, this council is complicit in

562
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:41,648
enabling an administration that prefers procrastination to action.

563
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:50,553
I urge you, do not simply just re-look at things that you've already gone through and don't table this.

564
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:57,357
Do not allow the mayor's office to coast into the end of its term.

565
00:40:58,138 --> 00:41:02,641
There is too much important work that must be done in Medford.

566
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,923
I respectfully suggest

567
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:22,050
that perhaps the resolution should be, if the mayor does not respond to all 23, if that is the right, 20-some number of unresponded resolutions, then a vote of non-confidence will immediately follow.

568
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:30,713
And also for transparency, may I ask that all of the unresponded resolutions be read.

569
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:31,713
Thank you.

570
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:41,294
We presently have a motion on the floor for approval by Councilors Knight and Lungo Kern.

571
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,054
Councilor Marks?

572
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:43,594
Motion to table, Mr. President.

573
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:54,897
On the motion of Councilor Marks to table, which is undebatable, Vice President would like you to withdraw so she may ask a question.

574
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:58,858
Table it through the chair to Councilor Marks.

575
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:04,300
Table it for more discussion, and if so, at a future meeting or in a subcommittee.

576
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,371
on rules.

577
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:18,374
Want to amend the paper and the paper?

578
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:19,334
I'd be happy to consider it.

579
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:20,355
I don't think that that's a problem.

580
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,176
I don't have a problem going into subcommittee as evident by the resolution that I filed, Mr. President.

581
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:30,798
We have a motion for approval amended by Councilor Mox to send to subcommittee on rules.

582
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:31,498
Subcommittee on rules.

583
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,726
So on that motion, all those in favor?

584
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:35,286
Aye.

585
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,386
All those opposed?

586
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:37,607
Motion carries.

587
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,348
Gone to subcommittee on rules.

588
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:45,129
15-358 offered by Councilor Knight.

589
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:49,711
Mr. President, I'd like to withdraw the resolution as the administration's received a response from the federal government.

590
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,492
Motion request by Councilor Knight to withdraw 15-358.

591
00:42:54,512 --> 00:42:55,452
Motion withdrawn.

592
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,413
15-359 offered by Councilor Knight.

593
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:15,996
Be it resolved, the Metro City Council adjourn this evening's City Council meeting in memory of the late State Senator Charles E. Shannon, as April 5th marks the 10th year anniversary of his untimely passing, Councilor Knight.

594
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:18,139
Mr. President, thank you very much.

595
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:23,525
I had the honor and privilege of working for Senator Shannon from 1999 to 2005.

596
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:32,392
Preceding me there was Councilor Mox in his office, and I believe while I was interning in the office, Councilor Caviello was there with me as well.

597
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:42,199
So it's apparent that Senator Shannon has touched the lives of many of us here involved in government, as well as many citizens in Medford through his hard work, dedication, and diligence on Beacon Hill.

598
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,350
The morning that the senator passed away, I remember it clearly.

599
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:56,775
I was walking into an event being held by the children's trust fund and senate president travolini at the time pulled me aside to make me aware of the fact that the senator passed away.

600
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:04,639
I was a young kid with no cell phone who wasn't able, they weren't able to get in touch with me that easily.

601
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,840
And, you know, it was a very sad day for me.

602
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,700
Charlie was a mentor.

603
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,501
Charlie was a friend.

604
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:10,102
And Charlie gave me a chance.

605
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:13,243
And I sadly miss him, Mr. President, and I think that it's

606
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:26,728
We take a moment to adjourn this evening's meeting in his memory based upon the 10 years of time that's passed since he's been gone and the 20 years of dedicated service that he gave to the residents of the city of Medford.

607
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:27,789
Very good.

608
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:29,551
So on that motion, all those in favor?

609
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:30,772
All those opposed?

610
00:44:31,132 --> 00:44:31,853
Motion carries.

611
00:44:31,913 --> 00:44:37,798
The meeting will be adjourned tonight in memory of the late Senator Charles E. Shannon.

612
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,202
On the motion of Councilor Knight to

613
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:45,085
Take paper under suspension.

614
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:46,966
All those in favor?

615
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:48,306
All those opposed?

616
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:49,606
Under suspension.

617
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,267
Offered by Councilors Camuso and Knight.

618
00:44:52,847 --> 00:45:02,509
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its congratulations to Stella Tenaglia on her recent retirement after 30 years of service to the city of Medford.

619
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:03,189
Councilor Knight.

620
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:05,390
Mr. President, thank you very much.

621
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,410
And on behalf of Councilor Camuso,

622
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:15,887
He expresses his condolences for not being able to be here this evening and his congratulations to Stella for a stellar career in public service.

623
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:17,307
She's a great woman.

624
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:23,288
She's a very hard worker, very diligent, and that's evident by her many years of service to the residents of the city of Medford, Mr. President.

625
00:45:23,748 --> 00:45:30,550
So the next person that comes in to fill her shoes has some very large shoes to fill, and she did an excellent job for us, and she'll be sadly missed.

626
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,871
However, she earned every minute of it, and I wish her the best in her retirement.

627
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:37,520
Great lady, so congratulations to Stella.

628
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,540
All those in favor?

629
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,800
All those opposed?

630
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:53,605
And then while we're on suspension, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its sympathies to the family of Marie Donato on her recent passing.

631
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:54,425
Councilor.

632
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:56,066
Yes, Mr. President.

633
00:45:56,146 --> 00:45:57,926
Marie was a long time Medford resident.

634
00:45:58,446 --> 00:46:02,067
She moved on to greener pastures down to Florida when the weather got cold.

635
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,668
However, we recently lost her.

636
00:46:04,279 --> 00:46:15,647
I was in touch with her cousin, and he expressed some great sadness over the loss and explained to me how much he loved Medford and how much it would mean to the family if, in fact, this council did pass a resolution wishing them sympathy.

637
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:18,609
So with that being said, I filed the resolution, Mr. President.

638
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:21,050
I offer my condolences to the family, and I wish them the best.

639
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:23,011
Marie will be sadly missed.

640
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:26,594
On that motion, all those in favor, please stand for a moment of silence.

641
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:43,657
Motion of Vice President Langel-Kern to return to the regular order of business.

642
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:44,497
All those in favor?

643
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:45,197
All those opposed?

644
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:46,658
Carries 15-360.

645
00:46:47,478 --> 00:46:49,459
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

646
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,840
Petition by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Mass.

647
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:58,663
To speak on public buildings, the Brooks Estate, and Medford Public Library.

648
00:46:59,243 --> 00:46:59,543
Ms.

649
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:00,723
Martin, welcome.

650
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:02,744
Please state your name and address for the record.

651
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:04,145
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

652
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,886
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak.

653
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:12,446
The Brooks Estates needs to be dealt with.

654
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:14,989
It needs to be put to rest once and for all.

655
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,093
They've tried to come up with the money for it, and they can't.

656
00:47:19,193 --> 00:47:23,537
They can't come up with private funding, and there are some issues up there that I need to talk about.

657
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:28,802
But first, I just want to say, we have to remember that the Brooks Estates

658
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,253
comes out of the history, a darker point in our history.

659
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:35,814
They were blue bloods.

660
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:40,858
They made their money off of the shipping industry, the insurance of the industry.

661
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:45,401
They insured the ships that were involved in the triangular trade.

662
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:54,588
So they literally made their money off of slavery and rum, and if there were fires or piracy, they insured against those things.

663
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:56,630
So we just have to keep that in mind when we go forward.

664
00:47:58,971 --> 00:47:59,812
They insured the cargo.

665
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:02,332
that included enslaved Africans.

666
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:10,176
The Brooks family also owned slaves, so the beautiful carriage house was built with blood money.

667
00:48:11,817 --> 00:48:21,763
The well-meaning group of volunteers have not been able to find donors to support the $3.5 million it takes to renovate the place for occupancy.

668
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:32,066
Speaking of occupancy, I hear that there are people living in that house which in no way could possibly pass today's codes.

669
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:39,111
So Mr. Knight, I'm glad we have another person that can check out the buildings, because I want somebody up there checking out that building for occupancies.

670
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:50,700
Also, there is going to be, or might be, I don't know if the baby happened or if it's going to happen, but I heard a rumor that this is a young couple and they could have a baby.

671
00:48:53,024 --> 00:48:53,724
That's a problem.

672
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:58,067
That house must have lead paint, electrical and plumbing deficiencies.

673
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:11,735
I'm a landlord and I hold a certificate of occupancy, an inspection from my insurance company, carbon monoxide alarms, a stove, income taxes with all receipts for repairs, home insurance, and a 21-page lease.

674
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:15,237
And I own a two-family house, okay?

675
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,878
That's just for the renters downstairs.

676
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:26,924
We, the entire city of Medford, are on the hook for any accident or incident that may happen on that property, not just the Brooks volunteers.

677
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:36,852
It is time to move the occupants out, even if it costs the city to move them out, to do it and tear down the buildings once and for all.

678
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:47,720
I know that it's hard for those people that put so much time and energy and effort into it, but then they're not the only ones that have other ideas for the city

679
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:50,849
I have ideas for the city too.

680
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:57,894
I would love to have that dance hall taken down so that when you come off the highway you see this beautiful structure called the people's house.

681
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:08,402
I would love to take the library, invest three and a half million dollars, put another level on there and call it an art center or something so that we can maintain

682
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:16,521
still maintain a library, make it more useful for modern day people because we have the internet and people don't use the library.

683
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:21,987
But if we made it a library slash art center, maybe we could continue that public building.

684
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:30,975
But I can't do that in good conscience and look at the police department, the police personnel, the DPW, the streets, the plumbing

685
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,061
The sewer pipes that aren't getting any younger.

686
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:36,661
The buildings in this area that aren't getting any younger.

687
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,082
I can't do that.

688
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,402
I can't look them in the eye.

689
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,682
I can't look the buildings in the eye.

690
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:42,683
God knows this one could use three and a half million.

691
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:45,183
It just goes on.

692
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:52,205
I also want a center for kids in Haines Square.

693
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,125
That's another one of my pluses.

694
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:55,986
That's another one of my dream sheets.

695
00:50:57,646 --> 00:51:00,867
What I'm saying is that it's a luxury to have the Brooks Estates.

696
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:03,296
And it's one that we can't afford, and we've got to put it to rest.

697
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:03,956
It's got to end.

698
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:10,300
Because we have to get on with the really serious issues that this city is facing in economics and everything else.

699
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:18,804
And I've spoken to some old timers, and they don't want it to be even remained as a green space.

700
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:21,806
They look at that Brooks Estates, and they go, oh, plots.

701
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,267
They have plots in their head.

702
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:27,849
They're dying, their friends are dying, and they want to be buried here in Medford.

703
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:28,870
And they see it.

704
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,736
as future burial ground.

705
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:38,042
I'm not suggesting that we do that, but I'm saying that there are a lot of people who would just like to turn that into that.

706
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:45,087
If you want to keep it as a green space, I'm okay with that, but we have to put to rest the house, the structure, and everything else.

707
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:52,734
That said, the $3.5 million needs to go towards a new police station and to fund 15 more police officers.

708
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:55,536
We need more DPW workers for the streets.

709
00:51:56,023 --> 00:52:03,629
which need to be regularly swept, striped, crosswalks, squares need some life, like flower buckets and lighting.

710
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,871
There are many needs in this city.

711
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:12,517
The Brooks Estates has got to put this to rest, and the city can come together on what we really need to do.

712
00:52:13,117 --> 00:52:15,219
Needs and wants are two different things.

713
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,683
Again, I want to thank those people that have put their attention into it.

714
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:23,705
But they've got to realize that their dream isn't going to end.

715
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:31,251
And they should get about six months to decompress and cry and grieve, because it just has to come to an end.

716
00:52:31,892 --> 00:52:32,232
Thank you.

717
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:34,634
Thank you very much, Ms.

718
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:34,734
Todd.

719
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:39,458
I motion on behalf of Councilor Carrivello to receive the place on file.

720
00:52:51,595 --> 00:52:53,617
for jobs and infrastructure.

721
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:54,737
Mr. Cappucci.

722
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,781
Motion to table by Councillor Maxx.

723
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,202
All those in favor?

724
00:53:02,363 --> 00:53:03,204
All those opposed?

725
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:05,966
Paper is tabled.

726
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:07,888
Reckons.

727
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:14,853
Councillor Maxx.

728
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:16,294
Thank you, Mr. President.

729
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:21,358
Last week we had Mark Crowley from Boynton Road

730
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:40,651
appear before the Memphis City Council along with some neighbors regarding 59 Boynton Road, a home that's been in terrible condition and been marked by the city as a home that should not be entered in disrepair.

731
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:49,574
We as a council asked for opinions from the city solicitor on a number of issues from the Board of Health, Karen Rose.

732
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:54,707
and also Paul Mokey, the building commissioner, regarding what the next steps are on the property.

733
00:53:55,448 --> 00:54:10,958
And I just want people to know that we did receive a lengthy and thorough explanation regarding many of our questions in our packet this week from Paul Mokey, the building commissioner, Karen Rose, and the city solicitor, Mark Rumley.

734
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:18,984
And according to my discussions recently with Mark, he thinks that the court process

735
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:22,004
is probably going to be another six to eight weeks.

736
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:48,284
And hopefully after that, Mr. President, when all the court issues are ironed out, that we'll be able to move forward with the seal of that property and eventually the either knocking the property down or the refurbishing of the home, if possible, to help out with the neighborhood and the residents that have to live alongside that eyesore

737
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:50,604
and public safety concern in their neighborhood.

738
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:56,649
So I just wanted to give an update on that property, Mr. President, and hopefully we can move forward.

739
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:59,871
Thank you very much, Councilor Moxx, for that kind update.

740
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:07,638
Records of the April 7th meeting were passed by Councilor Knight.

741
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:10,200
Mr. Councilor, move for approval, Mr. President.

742
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,761
Motion approved by Councilor Knight.

743
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:12,482
All those in favor?

744
00:55:12,502 --> 00:55:13,223
All those opposed?

745
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:17,046
On the motion of Councilor Knight for adjournment in memory of

746
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,647
The late Senator Shannon, all those in favor?

747
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:22,551
All those opposed?

748
00:55:22,571 --> 00:55:23,994
Meeting adjourned.
