00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,596

46
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:57,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I know that I've talked to a few, and it's my neighborhood.

47
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:05,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I've talked to a few of Mr. Mel guys neighbors, and they are very pleased of how he's running the business.

48
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard him negative.

49
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:08,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,355
[SPEAKER_07]: any negative banter in any way from his business location.

51
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:34,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what he's asking for, I would support and just put a 90 day review on this process as we normally have done with most of these requests that we give Mr. Malgar the opportunity to open from 11 to two.

52
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:45,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And after the 90 days, we revisit to see if we've had any concerns or issues from the neighbors or police or anything like so.

53
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:49,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I would move to approve with the 90 day review.

54
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 90 day review, seconded by Vice President Bears.

55
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

56
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Councilor Knight has to stand up.

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

58
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a couple of concerns relative to a business being open until 2 a.m.

59
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,455
[SPEAKER_06]: seven days a week in a residential neighborhood.

60
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:18,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We know this location, we know where it's located, Lambert streets and right there on the corner, but it's a number of homes.

61
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,485
[SPEAKER_06]: What type of business do you get?

62
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Is mostly a volume foot traffic?

63
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:28,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the applicant give us a little bit more insight into what's going on at the place?

64
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it mostly foot traffic, mostly delivery type of stuff?

65
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:35,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm very reluctant to say yes, they open till two o'clock in the morning on Sunday, right?

66
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,741
[SPEAKER_06]: With foot traffic.

67
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:44,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want this to be the place where people are leaving the casino or the bar room and they're saying, let's stop at Medford at Casa Pizza on the way home because it's right off of the Fellsway.

68
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a concern that I have.

69
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was just wondering, is it mostly a business delivery?

70
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Is mostly a business walk-in?

71
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can just provide some insight to that.

72
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you understand the question?

73
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:04,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I mean, I would do a delivery only the late night after 11.

74
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,947
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no one I'd leave for work.

75
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:13,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the question was, are you planning on mostly having like Grubhub combined take food, or is it gonna be mostly people coming in?

76
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:14,971
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you envision?

77
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,252
[SPEAKER_07]: People walking in at two in the morning?

78
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,753
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not just walking in, just for delivery.

79
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

80
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:27,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So would a delivery only restriction

81
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:40,465
[SPEAKER_06]: be something that would be suitable from 11 to 2am without work for you, and then maybe on Friday and Saturday, allowing them to stay open till two o'clock in the morning for patrons as well something like that.

82
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:47,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, can you say that again?

83
00:05:47,617 --> 00:06:01,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question he said, would you be amenable to, if his request is that you do delivery only from Monday, Monday through Friday, Monday through Thursday, and then from 10 to 11 to two, just do delivery.

84
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:05,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on Friday and Saturdays, open till two o'clock.

85
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, correct.

86
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:06,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you do that?

87
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I will do that.

88
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct, Councilor?

89
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds absolutely correct, Mr. Chairman.

90
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:16,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd certainly support the application with those restrictions in the 90-day review.

91
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:20,929
[SPEAKER_06]: After the 90-day review, if things are going good, then maybe we can move on some of those as well.

92
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:25,572
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd hate to go grant a full approval and then have them come back 90 days after operating.

93
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's maybe ease into this a little bit and take a look at it.

94
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:37,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the 90-day review, if we can lift some of these restrictions or requirements, we might be in a better spot in protecting the neighborhood.

95
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:52,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to review for the Mr. Mel guy, what counsel nights asking if it's okay that we do a 90 day review that you on Friday and Saturday say open till two, but Sunday through Thursday, you do only delivery from 11 to two.

96
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:56,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

97
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:57,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

98
00:06:57,206 --> 00:07:00,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as that goes, then we can revisit in 90 days.

99
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,114
[SPEAKER_07]: He's saying if we, if that, if it shows that there's a need, is that okay?

100
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm amenable to that.

101
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd often lose his conditions, Mr. President.

102
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:14,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a president.

103
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,434
[SPEAKER_07]: As conditions and so I yield to Council night's motion.

104
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:25,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the petitioner will accept that.

105
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:25,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's

106
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,852
[SPEAKER_07]: it could be something we can work on, then revisit again as you need to.

107
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:32,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

108
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:43,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve the petition with a 90-day review under the conditions of delivery only from 11 p.m.

109
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,218
[SPEAKER_05]: to 2 a.m., Monday through Thursday.

110

[SPEAKER_05]: Open till two for walk-in customers.

114
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:52,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

115
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:53,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

116
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:53,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

117
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:54,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion comments.

118
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,125

124
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,439

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:22,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

126
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,799
[SPEAKER_09]: President Morell?

127
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

128
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,700

[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

132
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,845
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-080 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

133
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council reappoint Fred Lasky as the council's appointment to the community garden commission.

134
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:48,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lasky's appointment has expired and his experience and commitment to the commission would be welcomed for another term.

135
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

136
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, miss, Madam President.

137
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:55,756
[SPEAKER_22]: Before we start, if I could wish my wife a happy birthday this evening.

138
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,418
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry she's home alone with me here.

139
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,360
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, happy birthday to my wife.

140
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Carol.

141
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:17,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Madam President, I think this speaks for itself, and I think everybody has a copy of Mr. Lasky's resume, again, which speaks for itself.

142
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Lasky is in the audience this evening.

143
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:26,819
[SPEAKER_22]: I think if we could hear from him, it would be great to hear him just give a little history of himself.

144
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:27,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Fred?

145
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:29,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

146
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:30,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

147
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:46,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, before we delve into the professional aspects of this, I just wanted to note that Mr. Lasky has been such an important person to our Medford community, as with his time living here in Medford.

148
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:58,703
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember very fondly how Mrs. Lasky, who I had as my fourth grade elementary school teacher, brought Mr. Lasky to our class, and he talked to us about the NWRA, talked to us about his job,

149
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:05,967
[SPEAKER_18]: talked to us about the importance of caring about how we use water resources in our community, even brought us some water bottles.

150
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,930
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm very, very fond of those memories.

151
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,231
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think they really exemplify it.

152
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:20,817
[SPEAKER_18]: They really show, I think, epitomize, they really epitomize how much of a positive influence Mr. Lasky has been for our community.

153
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:23,298
[SPEAKER_18]: He's really been there for our kids.

154
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,600
[SPEAKER_18]: He's really been there for our residents in his work.

155
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:37,536
[SPEAKER_18]: with the MWRA and with the different, with the gardening commission, with different commissions has really showed, I think, all of us how important of a person he is to Medford.

156
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:39,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Sagan.

157
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:40,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Olaski?

158
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:50,267
[SPEAKER_05]: name and address for the record.

159
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Frederick Lasky 55 summit road metric mass obviously.

160
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Justin.

161
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:56,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, who knew right.

162
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,054
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a great kid.

163
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,535
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll be a great city council.

164
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Proud of you.

165
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:11,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Several years ago, the wisdom the city method created a garden commission, and the idea of promoting community garden

166
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:14,835
[SPEAKER_21]: and the importance of gardening in the community of Medford.

167
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,698
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was fortunate to be one of the appointees, city council's appointees.

168
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:23,640
[SPEAKER_21]: There were four other appointees who were appointed by the mayor.

169
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:27,103
[SPEAKER_21]: And frankly, they're a great group of people.

170
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:34,127
[SPEAKER_21]: They're hardworking, they're there through thick and thin, and really have a vision for this community.

171
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,191
[SPEAKER_21]: And the importance of gardening.

172
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:39,374
[SPEAKER_21]: And since the inception of this, this commission.

173
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,255
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got the winter garden.

174
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:45,179
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got down at Tufts Park down behind the Curtis School there.

175
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,750
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been working closely with the Housing Authority on Willis, Valley Park.

176
00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:08,814
[SPEAKER_21]: And frankly, a couple of our efforts didn't bear fruit in trying to locate gardens in some of the parks in the city, because there was other pressures there for the athletic groups and people who didn't particularly want that in their neighborhood.

177
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:10,454
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's been a great success.

178
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:13,918
[SPEAKER_21]: And I saw Amanda Bowen here earlier on the TV.

179
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:15,138
[SPEAKER_21]: She's got her fingers in everything.

180
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:18,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything that's good in the city, Amanda's in and around it.

181
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,859
[SPEAKER_21]: And the group is a great group.

182
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:29,062
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to serve another term if you start in your wisdom to reappoint me and keep up the effort and keep up the fight.

183
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:36,364
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also think that I should point that they also not only work to create the new guidance and set up rules on how they should conduct themselves.

184
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:40,605
[SPEAKER_21]: They've raised a lot of, we've raised a lot of money that's gone and funded.

185
00:12:41,475 --> 00:13:00,105
[SPEAKER_21]: the parks and they take it to the educational side to the importance of food and being able to sustain food and the issues around the food desert and, and, and, you know, things like that, the food pantries around, provide them with good fresh vegetables and the importance of fresh vegetables in people's diet.

186
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,447
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's really a great, great group of people.

187
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,069
[SPEAKER_21]: And like I say, I'm proud and pleased to be part of it.

188
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,911
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if you have any questions, concerns.

189
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:22,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions or comments from the council public.

190
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Lasky, thank you for your service.

191
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:27,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember one of the first votes that I took as a city councilor was

192
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,356
[SPEAKER_06]: in support of your appointment to this position.

193
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you've done a great job here as well as at the MWRA.

194
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:37,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's without hesitation that I will support Councilor Caraviello's recommendation this evening.

195
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:49,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with you in various capacities and you continue to put out a great product for the city of Medford and your actions have always spoken louder than your words and your track record is proven.

196
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for all you do for the community.

197
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to stand beside you and support you this evening.

198
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

199
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello.

200
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President.

201
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

202
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:03,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again, just to be redundant because you deserve it.

203
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:17,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Lasky family in general, what you always give back to the community, not only that in your professional life, you've always looked out for Mr. Lasky and it's something that we're grateful for and having, um,

204
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you're a better half working with our children, and you'll always see Mrs. Lasky in the garden.

205
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:32,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I always remember seeing Mrs. Lasky at the McGlynn Garden, and the pride and joy of that area.

206
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:43,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that having you reappointed would just keep this moving forward in a positive way, and I support Councilor Caraviello's motion as well, so thank you.

207
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:48,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually at one point was a youth soccer coach in his behest.

208
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,257
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyway, it's a small town.

209
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,238
[SPEAKER_21]: It is.

210
00:14:53,278 --> 00:15:01,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Further comment on the motion of councilor Caraviello to reappoint Fred Lasky to the community garden commission.

211

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

243
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:57,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

244
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:57,626

[SPEAKER_05]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

250
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,237
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-082 offered by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins.

251
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:21,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas residential streets between Main Street and Mystic Avenue, such as but not limited to Bonner Ave, Hancock Avenue, Billings Avenue, Golden Avenue, and Alexander Avenue are often used as cut through streets to bypass Harbor Street traffic and

252
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:31,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas residents in South Medford have raised questions and concerns about the speed of traffic, pedestrian safety, the quality of residential streets, and the city's temporary and permanent solutions.

253
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:46,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas mobile applications like Waze have exacerbated these issues, be it resolved that the Medford City Council investigate the questions, concerns, and issues listed above and ask the acting commissioner of public works and the traffic engineer for an update on strategies to address these issues.

254
00:17:47,924 --> 00:18:10,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council asked the Department of Public Works and the Engineering Department to consider repaving dilapidated residential streets used extensively by commuters to bypass Harvard Street traffic, adding do not block intersection signage and do not block the box road pains to the Bonner main intersection and implementing strategies to lessen traffic buildup at the intersection of Main Street and Harvard Street.

255
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:20,615
[SPEAKER_05]: be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that this discussion be referred to the Subcommittee on Public Works and Utilities for further discussion with the Department of Public Works and Engineering Department heads.

256
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:21,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

257
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much President Morell.

258
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:32,359
[SPEAKER_18]: So this resolution is something that I was proud to submit with my fellow South Medford Councilor, Councilor Kit Collins.

259
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,802
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this is when I knocked on doors in this neighborhood and in my home neighborhood,

260
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:43,196
[SPEAKER_18]: This was something that came up, basically at every single door.

261
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:51,624
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the issue salience was off off the records was off the charts.

262
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:55,667
[SPEAKER_18]: When you when you walk down these kind of these.

263
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:04,450
[SPEAKER_18]: cut through streets, as they're called, you realize how fast the cars go down them and how heavy the traffic is during rush hour.

264
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:16,254
[SPEAKER_18]: And this poses a threat to the safety of the residents in those neighborhoods when it comes to something as simple as walking across the street.

265
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,155
[SPEAKER_18]: And it actually is a problem for accessibility as well.

266
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:28,646
[SPEAKER_18]: So, on the front on the matters of pedestrian safety when it comes to speed, when it comes to just the mere quality of the streets.

267
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:37,118
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a super important issue for a neighborhood that's been a little bit overlooked over the last few years.

268
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:54,154
[SPEAKER_18]: The proposals, I've suggested the city look at are things that neighbors have written to me and emails in recent weeks, asking us to ask, asking us to explore, you know, they might not be the solutions but I think it's worth having our city.

269
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Look into some of the proposals that our neighbors have brought up.

270
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

271
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:09,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you and thank you for outlining you know just how recurrent this issue is in some of the neighborhoods that we and I'm sure many other Councilors also frequent.

272
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:18,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously our engineering department and our DPW have a full queue of traffic mitigation and repaving projects that they're actively working on.

273
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,388
[SPEAKER_03]: We're lucky to have them on the case.

274
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:25,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Still the area that we've described is very pernicious one for traffic jams as already touched on.

275
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:41,721
[SPEAKER_03]: creates buildups at every peak hour, spills over onto these cut through streets like Bonner Avenue and others, degrades the road surfaces, increases air pollution for the residents of these neighboring streets, and creates very dangerous driving situations like blind turns, impatient behavior behind the wheel.

276
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:52,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously there's no magical solutions, but looking forward to getting some updates from our city staff on what's currently going on to address these issues and hopefully explore what more can be done.

277
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

278
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Favrello.

279
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:55,951
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President.

280
00:20:56,231 --> 00:21:04,497
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, you know, two Councilors brought up is probably the biggest factor of this is Waze and Google Maps and other things.

281
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:09,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Anybody that lives off of a main road suffers from this.

282
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:11,402
[SPEAKER_22]: I suffer from where I live.

283
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:15,024
[SPEAKER_22]: I parallel Route 16 and Ice Street.

284
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,487
[SPEAKER_22]: And you talk to people in other communities,

285
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,170
[SPEAKER_22]: no matter where you go, this is a, this is a problem everywhere.

286
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:42,324
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other problem is, it isn't, it's not so much the people driving, but you know, you've got a, now you've got a major influx of commercial traffic on the streets, from the Amazon drivers, the food delivery driver.

287
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:43,245
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, there's

288
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:50,154
[SPEAKER_22]: There's so much more commercial traffic on the streets than there's ever ever been before.

289
00:21:50,634 --> 00:22:03,745
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's a that's a giant part of this problem do you know they and these are people don't live in the community have no regard for going up and down streets a park anywhere cars traffic jams and, and so on.

290
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:09,847
[SPEAKER_22]: The answer to this is, I don't, I mean, I don't know if you could ever have an answer to this.

291
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:13,069
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't block people from going down public streets.

292
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:23,897
[SPEAKER_22]: It was tried in another community and some residents challenged it and they made him take all the signs down because these are streets that are paid for with public funds.

293
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:26,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have enough policemen to patrol these streets?

294
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,720
[SPEAKER_22]: No, we don't.

295
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:33,904
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we just can't have a, and I say, listen, I know this, I've lived in this neighborhood, but I'm familiar with it.

296
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:46,466
[SPEAKER_22]: at that five o'clock, that four or five o'clock rush hour when Mr. Gav gets back down to Somerville and Main Street gets backed up and then everybody goes down Willis Ave and they're banging up and down the streets.

297
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,271
[SPEAKER_22]: The answer is we don't know.

298
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:57,057
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, but I say, you know, I think, you know, the ways and the, you know, all these driving gaps are probably the biggest, biggest problem.

299
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:00,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, you know, God forbid someone sits at a light for, you know, an extra two minutes.

300
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:06,104
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, if you, if you take the right there, you'll, you'll, you'll pick up 30 seconds and, and you, and you'll go everywhere.

301
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:10,908
[SPEAKER_22]: So I applaud them for bringing these to the, I mean, to the council.

302
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:28,315
[SPEAKER_22]: The answer is I don't know if there is there is ever an answer with all the traffic NSA especially the commercial traffic, which we've never ever had before, with the advent of all these you know food delivery service and Amazon and FedEx and UPS and.

303
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,297
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're all hiring private drivers too to go around private stuff.

304
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:40,544
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, it's just the, I think it's gotten worse during the pandemic because everybody stayed home and now you get the groceries delivered.

305
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:46,027
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think this has been over the last two years, it's gotten worse than it's ever been.

306
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:55,134
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, I welcome any help that these neighbors, and it's not just these neighbors, it's neighbors throughout this whole community that live off of a main road.

307
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:56,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

308
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

309
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

310
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:18,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just wanted to add, as someone who does move through the area and spend some time in the area, I do think some of these don't block the box proposals would be helpful because you just have people sitting, you know, I think you have Bonner and Maine here, but to be honest, we should probably have one at Maine and Harvard and maybe define turning lanes.

311
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:20,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that intersection gets

312
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,691
[SPEAKER_15]: really rough with people, you know, people turning left and then people going around them.

313
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:31,275
[SPEAKER_15]: And then God forbid, there's someone in the intersection, you know, that can cause accidents as well as Harvard.

314
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:38,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't think of the other street right now, but it's about halfway between Mystic and Harvard and Maine and Harvard.

315
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,804
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the cross street of crossing Harvard.

316
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,185
[SPEAKER_15]: For some reason I'm blanking.

317
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:57,682
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be, but yeah, so, you know, I think those interventions would be helpful just to not have the traffic backup also block intersections, which causes backups into the neighborhoods even further.

318
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for putting this forward.

319
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:00,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

320
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:04,567
[SPEAKER_05]: New address for the record, please.

321
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:09,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue, Justin, Councilor Sam, glad you brought this up.

322
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:14,956
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to tell you, what I'd like you to do

323
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:18,309
[SPEAKER_00]: is spend some time down there.

324
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:29,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're in school, so you may conflict with your schedule, but you go down to Willis-Pixave, East Albion Street, go when the kids are getting there to school, okay?

325
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a camera with you and watch what happens.

326
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,266
[SPEAKER_00]: The police are there trying to direct the children.

327
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:35,604
[SPEAKER_00]: for their safety.

328
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:38,345
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even stop the stop sign.

329
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:42,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Police can't go after these people all the time because they're too busy watching their kids.

330
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,750
[SPEAKER_00]: The signage is like spaghetti.

331
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the place.

332
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:46,972
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not right.

333
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:51,034
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a remake of the circle down by the school.

334
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:54,357
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete, it is, it's not right.

335
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:56,098
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic engineer designed it.

336
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:59,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know how he came up with that solution, but it's not working.

337
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:03,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem is by the collect bakeries.

338
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:12,939
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot come out from Bow Street or Ellington Street and have a clear view of the cars coming up from the south side of Main Street.

339
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of kids across there in the morning.

340
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:20,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole thing that has to be done is it has to be enforcement.

341
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:23,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, the police are too busy doing things.

342
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:25,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, well, what do they do?

343
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:26,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they do a lot.

344
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:35,171
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's more important is to get these things and get these people and condition them not to take these streets, okay?

345
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to put some signage up there.

346
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:39,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dangerous.

347
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can hear them coming up from Willis Avenue.

348
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:46,719
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got these low-riders flying down the street there, you know, and they're popping in the music and everything.

349
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kids trying to cross the street.

350
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,683
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do this before somebody gets killed out there.

351
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:52,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

352
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:54,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. J. Antonio.

353
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:58,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Miranda Briseño with their hand up on Zoom.

354
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Miranda, name and address for the record, please.

355
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:04,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Miranda Briseño to Taylor Street.

356
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:09,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I just wanted to echo the concerns.

357
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:16,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't live in South Medford, but I've both walked and driven and biked through it enough to know what these problems look like.

358
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I,

359
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Support signs is an interim approach.

360
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:31,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to slow cars down, whether or not they're cutting through streets is to simply redesign our streets to be a lot safer.

361
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:40,642
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be narrowing lanes, putting speed humps, speed tables onto these residential streets to really force drivers to go slower.

362
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:45,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly relying on enforcement

363
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:52,079
[SPEAKER_02]: really can backfire and be really unsafe for a lot of communities.

364
00:27:52,179 --> 00:28:00,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best kind of enforcement that we as a community can investment is better designed streets.

365
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

366
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:03,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Senio.

367
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Hillary Klein, I see your hand up on zoom.

368
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:07,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Unmute you.

369
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

370
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:15,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

371
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Ellery Klein, 37 Fells Avenue.

372
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a member of Walk Medford, so you're talking to that group tonight.

373
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to sort of confirm the idea that things are not going well right now out there.

374
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:34,867
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a crisis nationwide.

375
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The last year has seen an enormous rise in fatalities of pedestrians and traffic deaths in general.

376
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a 50% rise in pedestrian deaths over the last 10 years nationwide.

377
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So there definitely is a crisis in people driving too fast recklessly.

378
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:58,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we do need to deal with that here in Medford.

379
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to echo what Miranda just said.

380
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:07,573
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a complete streets policy in Medford that Mayor Burke signed on to about five years ago.

381
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the most important thing for people to understand is that

382
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: by redesigning our streets and also using a lot of low cost, high impact interventions like paint.

383
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:28,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just worked with Todd Blake to get four, actually three pedestrian crossing signs on Salem Street that are sitting in the middle of the street.

384
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:33,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And immediately the owner of Your Italy asked if he could get one too.

385
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:40,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was pretty pleased to see that there was a good reaction among the business owners there to something like that.

386
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:48,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But all that does is it's a couple hundred dollar sign that sits in the middle of the road and forces drivers to kind of go around it a little bit.

387
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't just speed down Salem as much as they have been in the past.

388
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like that paint on corners can really have a huge effect for not much money.

389
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:04,460
[SPEAKER_04]: But in general, our city council and our mayor just need to support and fund our excellent traffic engineers.

390
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have two in the city and they're ready to go with

391
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:18,509
[SPEAKER_04]: of ideas and plans, but we do need to make sure that we're funding these things as a city, if we really want to make real change to the way drivers go through Medford.

392
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:19,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

393
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

394
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:21,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Hyde.

395
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:27,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Martha Andres, name and address for the record, please.

396
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:29,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hi.

397
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:30,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Nicole.

398
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:32,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Martha Andres.

399
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

400
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:38,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I like

401
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:55,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also Walk Medford and I'm also the Energy and Environment Committee, a member of that committee and it is a very, Medford has a lot of roads, it has a lot of state roads, we have a lot of traffic, and yet we're trying to be a livable community.

402
00:30:56,675 --> 00:31:00,996
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to remember that and do absolutely everything we can.

403
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:10,159
[SPEAKER_01]: The Complete Streets program has been very successful in the areas where it's been funded, you know, Safe Routes to Schools improvements, for example.

404
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,599
[SPEAKER_01]: We need so much more of it.

405
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:22,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this area between Mystic Ave and, you know, in South Medford is just really crying for better Complete Streets design.

406
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:25,498
[SPEAKER_01]: and we need to work with our engineers.

407
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:36,341
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to bear in mind that people need the option of being able to walk places and they need the option to be able to take buses and transit.

408
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:39,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to think beyond the car.

409
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:49,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Our lives are way too wrapped around the car and it does affect our walkability and our livability as a city.

410
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for considering this resolution.

411
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:54,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

412
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Andres, Vice President Bears.

413
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

414
00:31:58,174 --> 00:32:03,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, definitely completely agree with many of our commenters.

415
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:15,785
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I think I've said this a few times in the past that I will occasionally be a broken record, but this is another broken record moment.

416
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:18,647
[SPEAKER_15]: The backlog

417
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:19,956
[SPEAKER_15]: of repair.

418
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:27,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So just bringing up current streets and sidewalks to good condition in their current design is $170 million.

419
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,311
[SPEAKER_15]: The annual budget of the city is $190 million.

420
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:32,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

421
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:34,536
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe we're looking at

422
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,846
[SPEAKER_15]: A million or 2 million in that budget that's dedicated to street and sidewalk repair every year.

423
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:53,599
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what 7080 years will maybe get there and we all know that the rate of deterioration of streets and sidewalks is much faster so we're actually never going to get there with current levels of investment.

424
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Because of state laws is drastically underfunded.

425
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:11,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we seriously once again need to look at as part of a solution to a variety of problems, something like a debt exclusion to address design issues roads and sidewalks you know if we're talking about $170 million backlog.

426
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:21,341
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just never going to get there with the revenues we have now, the federal money that's coming in for infrastructure and ARPA still isn't going to get us there.

427
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:28,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe it'll make a dent, maybe we'll make a 10 or $20 million dent we don't know exactly what the mayor's proposing around the use of that money yet.

428
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:36,439
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, essentially if we stay status quo with the money that we have now we're going to have poorly designed streets with potholes and sidewalks that no one can walk on.

429
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:45,969
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that's a decision that the community wants to live with and that's a decision that they can live with but I do think it's our obligation as leaders of this community to at least ask that the community and the voters.

430
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,190
[SPEAKER_15]: what kind of community they want to live in.

431
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:53,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And without new revenue, we are not going to solve this problem.

432
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:54,272
[SPEAKER_15]: It will never be solved.

433
00:33:54,752 --> 00:34:02,454
[SPEAKER_15]: So until someone, and again, you know, when it comes to funding, this city council under our current form of government, we cannot initiate appropriations.

434
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:04,955
[SPEAKER_15]: We can only cut, we can only say no or cut.

435
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:13,438
[SPEAKER_15]: So until the leadership of this community wants to put a proposal before this council, maybe for a bond issue or before the voters for a debt exclusion,

436
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:25,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically the answer I can give you is unless we get a grant from the state, which we did on, you know, for some of the safe routes at the Roberts and the safe routes at the Brooks, we will not be able to solve this problem.

437
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:35,004
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is certainly a funding problem and status quo on it means that we're going to continue to have streets and sidewalks that are poorly designed and unsafe.

438
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:35,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

439
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

440
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

441
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:46,832
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

442
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

443
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:53,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

444
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:53,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

445
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

446
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:53,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

447
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:54,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

448
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:12,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

449
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:13,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

450
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:14,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

451
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:15,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

452
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:16,037
[SPEAKER_09]: President Morell?

453
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:16,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

454
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:20,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

455
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,521
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-083 offered by Councilor Tseng.

456
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the 2020 Massachusetts Uniform Citation Data Analysis Report, the report of projects supported by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between race slash ethnicity

457
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:59,417
[SPEAKER_05]: and step on stop outcomes in Medford, or black and Hispanic individuals are more likely to receive criminal citations or be arrested, and Hispanic individuals are less likely to receive written warnings and whereas the report states that there may be a multitude of explanations for these disparities, and how bias may be one among these many explanations

458
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:09,664
[SPEAKER_05]: whereas the report strongly encourages reflection and conversation about the potential causes of these disparities to build and maintain community trust, which is paramount to our public safety.

459
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:27,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Chief of Police investigate potential causes of stop outcome disparities and report back to the City Council on his findings, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the Medford Police Department to publish data on all motor vehicle stops, outcomes of searches, triggering offenses,

460
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: in the duration of stops, the data requests by researchers behind their fort, and post this data on its website.

461
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:43,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And be it further resolved, the Medford City Council asks the Medford Police Department to consider holding a community forum on traffic stop issues in order to deepen community trust and public safety as recommended by the report.

462
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

463
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:45,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Morell.

464
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:55,917
[SPEAKER_18]: So the context behind this resolution is this 2020 Massachusetts Uniform Citation Data Analysis Report, which is a super long name.

465
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,278
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why I'll call it the report.

466
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:07,722
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a project that the state government put out there.

467
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:12,844
[SPEAKER_18]: They found researchers from, I believe, Salem State and Framingham State.

468
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:30,600
[SPEAKER_18]: to comb through data from almost every single municipality in Massachusetts to look at, you know, what is the relationship between race and ethnicity and the frequency of traffic stops and the outcome of traffic stops.

469
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:42,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And what this report found was that in Medford, there's no statistically significant correlation between race and stops.

470
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:50,608
[SPEAKER_18]: But there is a statistically significant relationship between race and stop outcomes.

471
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:54,549
[SPEAKER_18]: And this report is very clear that this is not about blame.

472
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,691
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not about labeling people as racist or anything.

473
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:08,558
[SPEAKER_18]: This race could just, bias could be one of many, many, many reasons for why this is the case.

474
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:19,745
[SPEAKER_18]: But what it does say is that there is a reason, there must be a reason why Black and Hispanic individuals are subject to different traffic stop outcomes.

475
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:23,568
[SPEAKER_18]: And that this is not something that we can just say is a coincidence.

476
00:38:23,628 --> 00:38:25,869
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not something that we can put down to chance.

477
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,670
[SPEAKER_18]: It is something that actually

478
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:29,271
[SPEAKER_18]: has a cause.

479
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:34,773
[SPEAKER_18]: And so this, this resolution is really about public safety.

480
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:43,255
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really about building trust in in our law enforcement building trust in our city government to do what's right and to do what's fair for everyone.

481
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:48,457
[SPEAKER_18]: We there it's it's no secret that that

482
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,076
[SPEAKER_18]: police and racer sensitive issues.

483
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:55,739
[SPEAKER_18]: They have been sensitive issues, especially in the last two years.

484
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:08,387
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of how we should move forward as a community and how this report, this nonpartisan report puts it is that we need to build trust in our government again.

485
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:09,607
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to rebuild that trust.

486
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,150
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to rebuild trust in our law enforcement.

487
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And the only way to do that is to be honest about, to have an honest conversation about

488
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:25,333
[SPEAKER_18]: this data and to have an honest conversation about possible explanations for these disparities.

489
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,954
[SPEAKER_18]: And so again, this is not about placing blame.

490
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:33,775
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not about labeling people names or saying that something is necessarily bad.

491
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:46,278
[SPEAKER_18]: This is about addressing this statistically significant data point and in taking the state's advice and how we should move forward and make our community safer.

492
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

493
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:51,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

494
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,255
[SPEAKER_22]: On this, this paper here.

495
00:39:58,097 --> 00:39:59,817
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't hear the police department getting called.

496
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:03,679
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we're getting calls about people being stopped

497
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:06,599
[SPEAKER_22]: of racism.

498
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:12,681
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard that from the chief or any, any, any of the police, police information.

499
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,982
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not about stops.

500
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,562
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about the outcomes in stock.

501
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,704
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not about the stocks.

502
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:21,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Not everything that happens in this community is race related.

503
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:22,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry to say that.

504
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:29,648
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's what this is saying, that policemen are only pulling over black and Hispanic people.

505
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,308
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not at all what it's saying.

506
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's nothing close to this.

507
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,350
[SPEAKER_22]: It's actually the opposite of what this is saying.

508
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,030
[SPEAKER_22]: It is.

509
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Again- Councilor Caraviello has the floor.

510
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:39,272
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the floor, thank you.

511
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:40,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

512
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:50,496
[SPEAKER_22]: The chief here, under this new chief, he's trained these officers very well in regards of how they operated in the past.

513
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:54,799
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, you know, again, these may happen in other communities.

514
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:01,082
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not saying that they don't happen, but I'm not hearing stories of our policemen just pulling people over randomly.

515
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:08,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, the police, they do have data, they have higher data, people that collect data and all these things.

516
00:41:11,026 --> 00:41:15,568
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, I just, I don't know, Councilor.

517
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:20,810
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we're just going, I think we're going on fishing expeditions when we do these type of things.

518
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:22,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

519
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

520
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:26,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

521
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:27,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Vice President Bears first?

522
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:29,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

523
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:30,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

524
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Councilor Svang for putting this forward.

525
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the comments so far.

526
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:46,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just feel the need to say off the top, you know, I think, you know, given the fact that this is data that's been reported by the state, you know, I think it's a little unfair to call it a fishing expedition.

527
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:53,569
[SPEAKER_03]: when this is data that, you know, is now out in the open, you know, it's not something that Medford requested, it's just something that we have access to.

528
00:41:53,609 --> 00:42:01,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, to me, since this is out there, it's a state report, greater transparency and dialogue around the issue can only be positive for the whole community.

529
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Just having the data and not following up on it doesn't help anybody.

530
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:12,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm encouraged that the report recommends reflection and conversation about the potential causes.

531
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,402
[SPEAKER_03]: of these disparities and gives us a lot of opportunities.

532
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:23,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opportunity for the public to follow up on a concerning issue, you know, demonstrated in the data and get more insight.

533
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:28,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opportunity for our city to investigate and better learn what is the cause of the patterns.

534
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,756
[SPEAKER_03]: As Councilor Tseng said, you know, it's not about blame.

535
00:42:30,796 --> 00:42:36,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about asking what's behind this data, going with an open mind and saying what's behind it.

536
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an opportunity for the MPD to share its perspective, share what goes into its work.

537
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely agree with you.

538
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's been a lot of new hires.

539
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:49,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard from the chief firsthand, you know, how dedicated he is to really comprehensive training.

540
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:51,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that that's genuine.

541
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:54,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be great to have a forum to share that with more of the community.

542
00:42:55,847 --> 00:43:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to me, building and improving ties between MPD and the community.

543
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:05,250
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an existing stated goal that I've heard from many people within the administration.

544
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, a conversation like the report recommends is is walking the talk, you know, following up on the issue holding a forum.

545
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do think it could be a win win because at the end of the day building trust keeps the community safer and it also keeps our public safety professionals safer on the job as well.

546
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:23,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

547
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:25,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

548
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

549
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,006
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what this resolution sites is a state report showing that

550
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:44,750
[SPEAKER_15]: these data are true, that the statistically significant difference and disparities in stop outcomes are happening.

551
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:49,296
[SPEAKER_15]: What this resolution asks us to do is to figure out why.

552
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would guess that this chief, given his decisions,

553
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:05,768
[SPEAKER_15]: given his role to reform the Medford Police Department, given the statements and stated goals of our police department, that if this resolution were to go before the chief, he would be concerned.

554
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,492
[SPEAKER_15]: he would want to know the answer to why these facts are these facts.

555
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:18,157
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that did some, you know, a good role of this council to present information to our department heads when that information comes before us.

556
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:25,181
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, if they haven't seen it before, they can report back to us and say, you know, that was concerning information.

557
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:27,042
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the review that we did.

558
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:28,903
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the reasons we found.

559
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:30,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe that reason

560
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:32,818
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know those reasons.

561
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:36,740
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't say what the reason is until there's an investigation that has happened.

562
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:49,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it's not a fishing expedition when there are facts on the table that indicate that there's a question as to why there's a statistically significant correlation between race and ethnicity and stop outcomes in Medford.

563
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:54,648
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't mean we know why there's a statistically significant correlation.

564
00:44:55,048 --> 00:45:00,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we wanna, as Councilor Marks would say, bury our heads in the sand,

565
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:05,426
[SPEAKER_15]: and not find out the answers to our questions, we're more than welcome to do that.

566
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:11,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the chief and the city and this council and the people of Medford would like to know why the data are the way they are.

567
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:17,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And I look forward to the explanation heretofore.

568
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:18,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

569
00:45:19,078 --> 00:45:19,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

570
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

571
00:45:20,899 --> 00:45:21,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

572
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:24,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for all of you.

573
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:28,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important.

574
00:45:29,347 --> 00:45:33,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I can completely understand why Councilor Tseng would like to see this.

575
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:48,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, I think that in totality, what this resolution says is that, let's ask the chief to gather data on Medford so we can educate and look into this.

576
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:55,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've also, after reading this, I've contacted a few other colleagues in neighboring communities

577
00:45:55,697 --> 00:46:19,584
[SPEAKER_07]: that had similar concerns and what was the outcome of those concerns were totally against what everybody was saying that it was really race related in the sense that how those numbers were attributed, how they were counted, how it was looked at that Medford looks at this as racial disparity.

578
00:46:19,884 --> 00:46:21,565
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the numbers will show

579
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:42,597
[SPEAKER_07]: With what we're asking for that the chief, sit down and look into this process and look at the true data for Medford, not the state because the state's going to show a drastic agreeance what what we're saying because it's, this is definitely an issue in the state, but when you're talking about more method I think that I welcome.

580
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:50,942
[SPEAKER_07]: the process that our chief looks into the data a little bit with the magnifying glass to give us the true numbers.

581
00:46:51,022 --> 00:47:12,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I also understand that what Councilor Caraviello was saying in the sense that I was getting the same phone call saying, why is Councilor Tseng saying that, you know, our police are racist or they're being stopped and that the presumption of, you know, how you interpret the resolution

582
00:47:13,778 --> 00:47:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: is how people are gonna read it.

583
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:24,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Be a further result of the Method Police Department consider holding a community forum on traffic stop issues in order to deepen community trust and public safety as recommended by the report.

584
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:39,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that you're on the right track, but I think before we leap to anything negative connotations, I think that we asked the chief to come in and do a data driven report that states

585
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:43,468
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on in Medford, because I don't disagree.

586
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers are gonna show statewide where you're getting, what these traffic stops.

587
00:47:51,490 --> 00:48:03,593
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a concern, but I also will think that we'll have a better understanding when the police department, the traffic department does a deeper study in the data in Medford.

588
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, like I said, no one's questioning the,

589
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:16,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, unfortunately, there's racism everywhere, and there are good and there are bad everywhere.

590
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:18,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the problem.

591
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:33,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna make sure that we look at this in totality, that I think we really ask the chief to come in to find these numbers before we can all jump and leap to conclusions that, yes, our police force is racist, which isn't what you're saying.

592
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:34,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that.

593
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:48,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but at the same time, it's also give us a true indication of what, what our method stops have been, not just for this year, because you could look at one year and get an understanding, but I think we have to look at method stops over three to five year period.

594
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'll help.

595
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen, if that unearths something that's alarming to this council, I think we move forward in a more aggressive manner.

596
00:48:55,821 --> 00:48:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: But until that time, I think, you know, let's,

597
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: let's ask the chief to do his due diligence.

598
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:03,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I would recommend that.

599
00:49:03,097 --> 00:49:15,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's part of the motion, but I just reiterate that motion that we asked the chief to give us more data on traffic stops, not just for this year, maybe going back two or three years.

600
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:28,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know that what was said in different communities, the numbers were a little skewed because last year during the pandemic year, you had comparison to 800 stops in one community that,

601
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,794
[SPEAKER_07]: previous years that 3200 stops.

602
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:32,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be interesting to see that.

603
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:33,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

604
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:37,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

605
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:41,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President, and I appreciate the comments of my fellow Councilors.

606
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:42,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to

607
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:52,346
[SPEAKER_15]: just for clarity sake, this this report uses data that our police department sends to the state so this report is is Medford specific.

608
00:49:52,906 --> 00:50:03,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's saying the data shows there's a disparity, but it doesn't indicate what the reason it's right and I think that's, you know, no one here is saying we know why there's a disparity.

609
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:08,653
[SPEAKER_15]: And all we know is that in Medford specifically, there's the data, there's a statistically significant correlation.

610
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:19,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think all we're asking is to say, since we have that data that shows in Medford and fairness to you on the pandemic year and data collection, we all know how much of a mess the census was and everything else, right?

611
00:50:20,362 --> 00:50:28,027
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe the data is skewed for 2020, but I do believe this is a relatively new report from the state.

612
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:29,848
[SPEAKER_15]: And all we're saying is,

613
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:44,985
[SPEAKER_15]: All this resolution is saying is, if the data shows that there's a correlation between those two things, let's find out why no one is no one is intending to say that we know why or that we're putting a motivation or rationale or a reason behind that.

614
00:50:45,482 --> 00:51:02,240
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, as I said before, I think all of us in this room would benefit from the answer as to why and if the answer as to why is data collection was skewed or, you know, this other reason or that's important for us to know too because it actually bolsters the case right around community trust and around the fact that things are better.

615
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,364
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's I think where we're where this is trying to go and why I support it.

616
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

617
00:51:08,143 --> 00:51:21,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I shared the sentiments of Council beers because like I said I reached out to colleagues in different communities are going through a similar resolution and concerns and issues and, and what, what was brought back to me were the concerns

618
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,712
[SPEAKER_07]: the state numbers and how it was represented.

619
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:35,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's why having the chief come in and giving us true data what's happening in Medford, with what we're looking at, which is what you're asking the resolution.

620
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:40,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to get that data and numbers, the data doesn't lie.

621
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:46,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing about working in a community like Somerville and having summer stats tell you what you're doing right and wrong every day.

622
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:52,295
[SPEAKER_07]: The data drives a lot of what is the true definition of what's happening.

623
00:51:52,335 --> 00:52:07,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, all I'm saying is having the chief, giving him the information, asking him to compile that information for what we want, we're looking for in Medford, not for what's been questionable in other communities, but the numbers that came from the state that are a little skewed.

624
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:09,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're both saying the same thing.

625
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:18,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Just if I may, just to quickly further add yeah this was pursuant to the acts of 2019 so it is a new state report.

626
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:29,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're taking data that we're generating here, and even what you're asking for is, if we're generating that data and sending the state, why not put it on the city website to right we already created it we already have it so, you know,

627
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:31,357
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a new thing from the state.

628
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:37,860
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, and I also know that this, this police department is doing a lot right now to adapt to changing state law.

629
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was a big focus of a recent meeting I had with the chief.

630
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:46,204
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm, I'm hopeful that this is just another piece of this can be another piece of that process.

631
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have a number of residents who'd like to speak.

632
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:52,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

633
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,971
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's counter saying I'm sorry I'm not familiar with your name yet.

634
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:11,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have to pick up a little bit on Council car violas comment here and a couple of things that I was reading through.

635
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:21,958
[SPEAKER_16]: It is unusual that the part of the report that was taken out regarding this data analysis report has the word bias in it.

636
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:32,147
[SPEAKER_16]: No other causes or reasonable explanations are mentioned in this.

637
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:47,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I really tend to think, because we're, and you can think about this for a second, some people are next to me, well, I'm kind of foggy some days anyway, next to me at a red light for three or four minutes,

638
00:53:48,582 --> 00:53:53,884
[SPEAKER_16]: They could pass me and someone could say to me, did you have a good look at the person beside you?

639
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:55,345
[SPEAKER_16]: He just went speeding down the street.

640
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:56,145
[SPEAKER_16]: I would never know.

641
00:53:56,626 --> 00:54:00,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure half of you will answer the same way that I do.

642
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:17,355
[SPEAKER_16]: I find myself believing in some of these analysis reports on traffic, I believe about 40%, because in that light of being human, I hardly, hardly think that police officers, especially the ones that I've known for many years in Madrid,

643
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:30,197
[SPEAKER_16]: can spot somebody speeding or going through a red light the two blocks away, they really know what that driver looks like their face in the color of their skin, or the mask on and everything sometimes.

644
00:54:30,937 --> 00:54:33,519
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have very little faith in a lot in a lot of this.

645
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:36,361
[SPEAKER_16]: Secondly, I think what they should be doing before.

646
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:49,065
[SPEAKER_16]: before going into a report like this regarding bias, is have the police chief present a report of what is the most common cause of traffic stop, number one, because that's okay.

647
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:54,808
[SPEAKER_16]: And also any type of ticket violations that they have coming during the last few years.

648
00:54:55,208 --> 00:55:00,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm more concerned with the safety of the community right now.

649
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:06,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that should be attacked first, and then going into maybe other data that has been

650
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:07,552
[SPEAKER_16]: presented.

651
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:08,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

652
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:22,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, even with that data I think this becomes more, some of the cars, if there are some people, not, not even the Haitians or anyone else mentioned here, people who are driving maybe even without licenses.

653
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,683
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a big can of worms.

654
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:35,610
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think this type of report needs to be looked at after the we presented what the most stops in the reasons for those stops, because I hardly think police officers

655
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:44,157
[SPEAKER_16]: can see anyone, especially at night, Friday night and Saturday night I'm also interested to know the times of day when most drops are done.

656
00:55:45,618 --> 00:55:50,883
[SPEAKER_16]: You, this wouldn't involve state police, although they are here I see them stopping a lot, this would be method.

657
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:53,585
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would really go I think you went through the back door.

658
00:55:53,605 --> 00:56:02,733
[SPEAKER_16]: I think maybe the other issues are much more important to community safety to spend some of your time on right now, and then go through this problem and see if this

659
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,761
[SPEAKER_16]: type of safety connection after that.

660
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:06,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

661
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:08,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you as a man and present point of information.

662
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:13,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to add, and I think Councilor Tseng presented this when introduced it.

663
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:23,006
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of the good, good news pieces here is the report said that there is no statistically significant correlation between stops themselves and race, which goes exactly to your point.

664
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:24,527
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that

665
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:28,646
[SPEAKER_15]: people are seeing certain people and pulling them over for a reason of race.

666
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:31,168
[SPEAKER_15]: It specifically says that that's not happening in Medford.

667
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:37,112
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the outcome after the fact that there's data that shows there may be, that there's something to ask a question about.

668
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:45,579
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, you know, there's actually good news in the report, which is it proves what people have been saying is that people aren't being pulled over for any reasons of race or bias.

669
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:51,443
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think, you know, I just, yeah, I'll stop there.

670
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

671
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:55,203
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a number of residents on Zoom who would like to speak.

672
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:58,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Giglio, name and address for the record, please.

673
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:01,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Bill Giglio.

674
00:57:02,824 --> 00:57:07,605
[SPEAKER_19]: So first of all, I'd like to say congratulations, Nicole, for the birth of your baby.

675
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:08,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.

676
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:17,488
[SPEAKER_19]: So I like to, on some of these columns that I'm looking at right now, you have a warning, civil, criminal, and arrest.

677
00:57:19,945 --> 00:57:23,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Under the civil, it seems to be pretty much equal, I would say.

678
00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:34,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Civil, I would almost say, is like getting pulled over and a cop saying, you know, getting pulled over, pulling a red light, maybe him saying go or just getting a simple traffic stop ticket for blowing a red light.

679
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:38,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, under the criminal, where it does seem to shift a little bit.

680
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:48,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if there's something criminal going on, let's just say like there's no, they don't have a license, they don't have insurance, they don't have this or that.

681
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:59,113
[SPEAKER_19]: wouldn't you want our police officers who we trust to do their job to, um, you know, to hand out a ticket, uh, you know, it may, it may bring up that percentage.

682
00:57:59,133 --> 00:57:59,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

683
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:02,916
[SPEAKER_19]: But maybe they are, maybe they don't have their license.

684
00:58:03,036 --> 00:58:04,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe they were texting and driving.

685
00:58:04,477 --> 00:58:09,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe they don't have, um, maybe they don't have, you know, insurance or whatever the case may be.

686
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,062
[SPEAKER_19]: What, what would make it a criminal offense, not a civil offense.

687
00:58:13,362 --> 00:58:18,045
[SPEAKER_19]: And as far as the arrest side goes, I'm, I'm always happy if,

688
00:58:18,902 --> 00:58:21,743
[SPEAKER_19]: someone is arrested that should be arrested.

689
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:26,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I personally, I don't think they're just arresting someone just because they're Hispanic.

690
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I see that's the highest number.

691
00:58:28,784 --> 00:58:32,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Whites, Asian-Americans and blacks are obviously low.

692
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:38,086
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, a criminal, a criminal application could be even, you know, just like an unlicensed.

693
00:58:38,386 --> 00:58:45,407
[SPEAKER_19]: But if let's just say somebody is breaking the law, like I'm talking breaking the law, which is an arrestable offense.

694
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,248
[SPEAKER_19]: I would almost think we should be happy

695
00:58:48,867 --> 00:59:06,499
[SPEAKER_19]: that they are being arrested and they're being taken away off the road, whether it be for drunk driving, whether it be for whatever, driving intoxicated, whether it's on marijuana or something, or even texting and driving, which they almost consider as drunk driving now, because it's causing a distraction.

696
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:07,780
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm just curious.

697
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if you do get a report from the chief,

698
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:16,128
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he allowed to even say what the arrests were?

699
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:20,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we just have to go by, oh my goodness, look at this, Hispanics, 20% being arrested.

700
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we be able to see why anyone was arrested?

701
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:30,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Because other than that, I see, like I said, on the civil side, everything seems to be about the same.

702
00:59:31,713 --> 00:59:39,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Criminal is, like I said, a criminal could be a multitude of things, which I would say warrants a criminal.

703
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:46,630
[SPEAKER_19]: And an arrest is an arrest, and what the arrest is for, would that type of data be available?

704
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:54,236
[SPEAKER_19]: And is that what you're going for?

705
00:59:54,276 --> 00:59:59,240
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going for, let's just say, let's put out there why they were being arrested, why someone was arrested.

706
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:07,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be at the behest of the chief, what he puts together, is my understanding.

707
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:15,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I mean, one of the one of the points in this resolution is the word are the words triggering offenses.

708
01:00:15,624 --> 01:00:30,774
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the report tells us that we really in order to dig into these numbers and to explain the statistical relationships, we have to consider triggering offenses is one of the possible explanations right so it totally in this report is really clear it

709
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:38,752
[SPEAKER_18]: There are many, many, many outcomes in this world where this is not actually about bias.

710
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:44,661
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is exactly why we need to release more data.

711
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,804
[SPEAKER_18]: That's exactly why we need to publish more data.

712
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:49,266
[SPEAKER_18]: and make it transparent and open.

713
01:00:49,987 --> 01:00:55,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it comes to the word bias, this is how the report itself was written.

714
01:00:57,371 --> 01:01:11,539
[SPEAKER_18]: I've actually modified the language of the report to be more, I think, representative of how I think of the good character of the people working for a city and to make it less hostile and to make it more reasonable.

715
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,420
[SPEAKER_18]: But I

716
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,406
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll leave it there.

717
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:22,786
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of the skepticism, I think, of this resolution is actually just resolved within the resolution itself.

718
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:45,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's important, I think it's important to keep in mind that the report is actually good news if we're just looking at people being stopped because there is no statistical correlation between, there's no statistically significant relationship between the race of people being stopped in Medford and the traffic stops themselves.

719
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,155
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more about the outcome, right?

720
01:01:48,358 --> 01:02:08,584
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, it's totally possible that triggering offenses could be the reason why, but that's exactly why we need to ask the police chief to dig into the data, as Councilor Bears, as Councilor Sparkoli said, in order to give us the transparency and give us that confidence in our own city's functioning.

721
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:09,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

722
01:02:10,385 --> 01:02:11,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Guillaume.

723
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:14,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. D'Antonio, we have a few people on Zoom, so I just don't want you to stand.

724
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:17,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get to you after we get to that, but I just don't want you to stand there forever.

725
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:22,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Ellery Klein, name and address for the record, please.

726
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:26,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Ellery Klein, 37 Fells Avenue.

727
01:02:27,895 --> 01:02:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm talking on behalf of Wacom-Edford.

728
01:02:31,857 --> 01:02:47,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I just would love to make the point that so often in these conversations, something that's lost is that recently it's becoming more evident that traffic stops and enforcement often have very little effect on road safety and people's behavior on the roads.

729
01:02:48,575 --> 01:03:06,743
[SPEAKER_04]: In July 2021, the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, journal, medical journal, analyzed 161 million traffic stops across, I think it was like 30 something states, and found absolutely no association with reduced road fatalities.

730
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: They did caution that this was like highway stops.

731
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,822
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's other studies that are kind of finding the same thing.

732
01:03:13,882 --> 01:03:24,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're having this conversation, it's worth thinking about again, once again, relying on traffic enforcement to make drivers behave better on the road is often a failing mission.

733
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:39,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we think more comprehensively and work and fund on road design and traffic calming through actual, the way we are built environment operates, we're gonna find a lot more success in the long run.

734
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:50,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I just wanted to make sure that that that thought is out there as we're looking at this greater question of whether or not we should be depending on the police to try to make our roads safer to begin with.

735
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:57,173
[SPEAKER_04]: The studies are showing that it's not really as effective as is popular perceived in people's minds.

736
01:03:57,573 --> 01:03:57,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

737
01:03:59,094 --> 01:03:59,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

738
01:04:00,635 --> 01:04:02,296
[SPEAKER_05]: We're never saying you name and address for the record, please.

739
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

740
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

741
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:19,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just echo what Ellery stated and similar to what Councilor Tseng, Collins, and Bears have stated, the state has already existed, has been provided to us by the state.

742
01:04:19,553 --> 01:04:27,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And so utilizing this data would allow us to understand why that significant difference exists in traffic stops for our Black and Latino neighbors.

743
01:04:28,078 --> 01:04:37,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And to bring this back to the issue discussed on South Medford and traffic concerns, the primary way the general public interacts with law enforcement is through traffic stops.

744
01:04:38,144 --> 01:04:43,128
[SPEAKER_02]: This data from the state is already showing there are disproportionate stops for our Black and Latino neighbors.

745
01:04:43,648 --> 01:04:51,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Data in communities across the country has shown that our Black and Latino neighbors are at disproportionate risk of dying through their interactions with law enforcement.

746
01:04:52,355 --> 01:05:04,285
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, if you overlay old redlining maps that show high disinvestment and neglect in primarily Black and immigrant neighborhoods with where current traffic fatalities and high traffic concern areas are, these are the same neighborhoods.

747
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:18,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, more data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has shown that as pedestrians, black residents of Massachusetts are more than four times likely than white residents to visit the emergency department as a result of being hit by a vehicle.

748
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:22,643
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, nationwide data has shown the disproportionate risk that black residents

749
01:05:23,723 --> 01:05:25,905
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a traffic fatality than white residents.

750
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:43,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, if we're looking to keep our community safe, both from the negative consequences of high volume car traffic, we can also be addressing the true safety concerns that Black, Brown, and other marginalized communities have when interacting with law enforcement by investing more than we are now into safer street design.

751
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:43,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

752
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:45,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

753
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Morseno.

754
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,801
[SPEAKER_05]: A-Town Viner, name and address for the record, please.

755
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name's Eitan Blynard.

756
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:56,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 374 Winthrop Street.

757
01:05:57,504 --> 01:06:00,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to voice my support for this proposal.

758
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:02,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a really good one.

759
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:16,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's the sign of a really healthy society and really healthy police department that when they get news that something seems off, that there's a report that's done by the state that says that things don't look quite right, that they go and investigate that.

760
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And they try to figure out what's going on and get to the root cause of that.

761
01:06:20,373 --> 01:06:29,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And I welcome this resolution, and I hope that it gets adopted, and I hope that we go in and look into this and figure out why these data show what they do.

762
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:31,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Gleiner.

763
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. D'Antonio?

764
01:06:38,884 --> 01:06:39,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

765
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:42,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

766
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:54,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, um, one of the things I think people are not understanding is in the last 10 years, the increase of traffic that comes through the city of Medford, see Medford is a cut through city.

767
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:56,145
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from everywhere.

768
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:58,185
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the same problem in Winchester.

769
01:06:58,445 --> 01:06:58,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

770
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:01,627
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that are working in the marketplace.

771
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:05,128
[SPEAKER_00]: That traffic is on the streets at all hours, three o'clock in the morning.

772
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:05,668
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts.

773
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:10,741
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to the markets, they're going everywhere for work, dirt shift, graveyard shifts, whatever.

774
01:07:10,761 --> 01:07:22,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I think it's unfair to draw a conclusion that because people are getting stopped, it has to do with their color or their appearance or whatever, because there's a lot of bad guys that get stopped.

775
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:34,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would like maybe before you people really get into this, I mean, that young lady that was on before with all the statistics, statistics can be skewed.

776
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:38,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, MMS is in economics and we know how to do that.

777
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:54,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all these facts and figures, but I'm gonna ask maybe anybody in good faith, ask the chief, if you can go on the ride along and the graveyard shift with the police officer, then come back here and tell me what's going on in the streets.

778
01:07:54,514 --> 01:07:54,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

779
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Dean Antonio.

780
01:07:57,236 --> 01:07:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

781
01:07:58,257 --> 01:07:58,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

782
01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:00,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's exactly what this is.

783
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to read from the report, just to make Councilor Tseng's point,

784
01:08:05,697 --> 01:08:11,361
[SPEAKER_15]: It says the significant data indicates observed pattern in the table is real and not due to chance alone.

785
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:24,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the actual report says this report serves as a starting point for further discussion on racial disparities in traffic enforcement in Massachusetts as previously stated statistical analyses of aggregate department level data can only identify disparities in law enforcement citizen interactions.

786
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:29,372
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a number of reasons why disparities may occur in law enforcement citizen interactions and bias.

787
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,774
[SPEAKER_15]: both individual bias and institutional bias is only one of the many causes of disparities.

788
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:48,061
[SPEAKER_15]: The overall goal of this study is to learn more about potential patterns of racial disparities and traffic stops for the purposes of providing an opportunity for reflection and understanding of the causes of these disparities and building or maintaining community trust, ultimately making us all safer.

789
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:49,242
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the language of this.

790
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:51,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with Councilor Tseng that he actually

791
01:08:52,475 --> 01:09:00,601
[SPEAKER_15]: made, you know, was not as intentionally direct as the report was to make sure that there weren't misinterpretations, but yes, there still were misinterpretations.

792
01:09:01,902 --> 01:09:13,411
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we're literally doing what I think what everyone wants us to do here, which is to ask the chief for why, to help us move from seeing disparities to understanding causes.

793
01:09:14,808 --> 01:09:15,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

794
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:15,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

795
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:15,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

796
01:09:15,608 --> 01:09:15,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

797
01:09:15,889 --> 01:09:16,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

798
01:09:16,169 --> 01:09:16,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

799
01:09:16,749 --> 01:09:17,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

800
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:17,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

801
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:17,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

802
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:18,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

803
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:18,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

804
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:18,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

805
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:19,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

806
01:09:19,871 --> 01:09:20,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

807
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:20,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

808
01:09:20,551 --> 01:09:20,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

809
01:09:21,071 --> 01:09:21,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

810
01:09:21,612 --> 01:09:22,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

811
01:09:33,484 --> 01:09:43,308
[SPEAKER_07]: does do a data dive with these concerns, I think we'll be pleasantly surprised with what our officers are doing.

812
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:55,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, and I understand that these are the questions that were also put forth with different communities that numbers might've been skewed in the state level.

813
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:59,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why it's important that we get the numbers from the chief.

814
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:00,816
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'll support this because again,

815
01:10:02,162 --> 01:10:06,084
[SPEAKER_07]: the chief will look at methods numbers and get back to us and educate us.

816
01:10:06,184 --> 01:10:21,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we find something that with method numbers that we have to be, we have to now be cognizant and look forward to directing the chief where we need some support or assistance that we change something that might be hurting our community, then we need to fix it.

817
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:26,694
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that welcoming the data is gonna be what we're looking for.

818
01:10:26,714 --> 01:10:29,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think we're all looking at the same thing.

819
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:31,357
[SPEAKER_07]: We all wanna see the data and it's,

820
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:36,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not for the gotcha game, it's just to get the numbers and let's go from there.

821
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:37,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the chief will welcome it.

822
01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:46,406
[SPEAKER_07]: If we know the chief, he loves these type of issues where he'll answer these questions.

823
01:10:46,646 --> 01:10:53,608
[SPEAKER_07]: He's never, from what I recall, the chief has never shied away of questions like this.

824
01:10:53,668 --> 01:10:57,769
[SPEAKER_07]: So I pose that in support, so thank you.

825
01:10:58,305 --> 01:10:59,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

826
01:10:59,446 --> 01:10:59,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

827
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:00,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Diaz, I need an address for the record, please.

828
01:11:00,907 --> 01:11:02,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Chair and GSO again.

829
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:03,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Briefly, Mass Ave.

830
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:04,729
[SPEAKER_16]: and Circuit Road.

831
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:14,675
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a couple of us who were disparaging with some remarks looked into this in a wider scope, too, because we were a little older.

832
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:16,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm probably four times your age.

833
01:11:17,117 --> 01:11:20,079
[SPEAKER_16]: You can laugh under that mask at that if you want right now, because I can't see you.

834
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,383
[SPEAKER_16]: There were other things added into the formula, not only time of day, et cetera.

835
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,755
[SPEAKER_16]: that their human element, you know, is not even admissible in some of this.

836
01:11:31,156 --> 01:11:32,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And don't forget, we have technology now.

837
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:36,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots of these people are stopped because a policeman is called.

838
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:40,252
[SPEAKER_16]: because somebody just went through a device, is that correct?

839
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:43,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Or a speed trap or something, and then they're called and then they go out.

840
01:11:43,513 --> 01:11:46,054
[SPEAKER_16]: So they don't even have a clue of who they're chasing.

841
01:11:46,374 --> 01:11:47,895
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are really touchy.

842
01:11:48,855 --> 01:11:54,518
[SPEAKER_16]: I think social discussions are always good, especially if you're taking a police chief or something like that.

843
01:11:54,538 --> 01:11:59,320
[SPEAKER_16]: It'd be interesting to see some of the statistics of what the reasons are for the stops.

844
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,381
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you can go into the other reasons afterwards.

845
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:06,523
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm just trying to let you know, because you're so much younger too, that you have to look at the whole

846
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:10,269
[SPEAKER_16]: whole picture before trusting one of these are some other reports.

847
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:11,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for your time guys.

848
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

849
01:12:13,571 --> 01:12:30,701
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I think this, this resolution does ask us to take a very holistic and very open minded view on this and, and, you know, again, that's why, that's why we asked about more transparent data that's why we were asking about triggering offenses, why we're asking that duration of stops.

850
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:36,983
[SPEAKER_18]: et cetera, because, you know, I think it's important to go into this process with a holistic lens.

851
01:12:37,003 --> 01:12:45,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I think most, if not all of us are asking for the same thing, which is that, you know, the police chief just look into this and I trust the police chief.

852
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:49,788
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the police chief would also be happy to do this.

853
01:12:51,108 --> 01:12:53,549
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I'll leave this with a metaphor.

854
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:05,155
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, when you walk into the doctor's office and the doctor sees something, asks you to get it checked out, you get it checked out because you trust the doctor, right?

855
01:13:05,275 --> 01:13:12,498
[SPEAKER_18]: The science is clear and you just, you know, it could be something, it could be nothing, but you trust the doctor because it could be something.

856
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:21,363
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, this very well could be nothing, but I think this is when we go see that specialist and we go get this checked out.

857
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:23,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

858
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:24,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

859
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

860
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval.

861
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:33,671
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Paul.

862
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:37,212
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Bears.

863
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

864
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:47,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

865
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:48,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

866
01:13:49,574 --> 01:13:50,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

867
01:13:50,274 --> 01:13:50,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

868
01:13:50,454 --> 01:13:52,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

869
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:52,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

870
01:13:53,515 --> 01:13:54,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

871
01:13:55,614 --> 01:13:56,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been seeing him pop in and out.

872
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:58,736
[SPEAKER_09]: He might be having connection issues.

873
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:04,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go back to him just in case, but I'm going to skip this Councilor Scarpello.

874
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:04,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

875
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:06,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

876
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:07,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

877
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:08,423
[SPEAKER_09]: President Morell?

878
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:09,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

879
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me check Councilor Knight one more time.

880
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:17,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

881
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So did he indicate which way he's going to vote?

882
01:14:30,213 --> 01:14:31,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been seeing popping it out.

883
01:14:31,874 --> 01:14:34,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So six in the affirmative, one absent.

884
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:38,978
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

885
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:41,700
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-084 offered by Councilor Tseng.

886
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,441
[SPEAKER_18]: I can offer a summary.

887
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:44,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

888
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:46,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins.

889
01:14:46,722 --> 01:14:47,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

890
01:14:48,379 --> 01:14:55,182
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a resolution that Haitian American community leaders actually reached out to me about putting on the agenda.

891
01:14:56,523 --> 01:14:59,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me walk through it first and then talk a little bit more about that.

892
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:06,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Essentially, Boston, Metro Boston is home to the third largest Haitian diaspora in our country.

893
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:17,952
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the Haitian American community has been so vital to Medford in terms of its contributions to our workforce, to the economy and to the culture, general culture of our city.

894
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:28,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the Census Bureau I just looked this up on right before I submitted this resolution estimated in 29 late in around 2019 that I'm 7.9% of Medford's population was of Haitian descent.

895
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:44,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, the, the immigration policy started during the Trump administration and continued under the Biden administration affects Medford disproportionately.

896
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:49,663
[SPEAKER_18]: When we, when we look at what these policies are the policies that deportation.

897
01:15:51,624 --> 01:16:00,826
[SPEAKER_18]: This section of the report actually goes into language from both political and civil rights leaders, civil liberties leaders as well.

898
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:13,469
[SPEAKER_18]: They cite our international, US, our national law and international law in saying that these Title 42 deportations are actually unconstitutional and illegal.

899
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:21,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And so this is a resolution of support, which I think is especially important during Black History Month.

900
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:27,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Support for our Haitian migrants who live in Medford.

901
01:16:27,355 --> 01:16:34,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Support to make sure that they're not deported to a place where they barely know, to make sure that they're not deported to a place

902
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:49,403
[SPEAKER_18]: of political, social, and economic strife, and a statement of support saying that we are a place of refuge and that Medford is a safe place for each and every single one of our community members.

903
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very well aware that this resolution

904
01:16:54,037 --> 01:17:01,540
[SPEAKER_18]: may well not have, you know, a national impact, but I think it's, I think that it's vital that we show our support for Asian neighbors.

905
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:11,585
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and so talking a little bit more about how this resolution came to be, I talked to Councilor, Ruth see illusion in Boston.

906
01:17:11,985 --> 01:17:24,655
[SPEAKER_18]: who is who's working on the coalition to build a coalition of communities to express their support for the Haitian community and to ask the Biden administration to consider reversing their this illegal immigration policy.

907
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:27,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you know, I think it's important.

908
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:37,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's vital for us to show that we are a place that's willing to accept and celebrate our diversity and to and again,

909
01:17:37,765 --> 01:17:46,368
[SPEAKER_18]: to create public trust in our institutions with a population that's so important to our city's fabric.

910
01:17:47,008 --> 01:17:55,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you will indulge me, I just wanted to send a short message to our Haitian American community here in Medford.

911
01:17:55,451 --> 01:18:00,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't speak Haitian Creole, but I speak a little bit of French and I will translate it for the record.

912
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:07,059
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I said was, I wish, I want to make it known that to the whole world and

913
01:18:28,572 --> 01:18:41,255
[SPEAKER_18]: in particular, our Haitian community here in Medford, that it's important for us that Medford is a city where we all feel safe, and that Medford is a city that's welcoming to all.

914
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:43,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

915
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:45,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

916
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:51,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins just had her hand up first.

917
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:53,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

918
01:18:55,918 --> 01:19:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm very impressed by Councilor Tseng's French speaking, so hard to follow that.

919
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:16,445
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to amplify what Councilor Tseng already said and want to thank him for taking initiative on this resolution, as well as for liaising with the other Greater Boston elected officials that are connected to the Haitian community and this coalition, who've been making similar appeals to our federal administration.

920
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:19,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be really proud for us to use our voice as a council.

921
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:30,512
[SPEAKER_03]: to advocate for a more just and fair and legally compliant immigration system, instead of seeing excuses be used to turn away people who came here in a time of need.

922
01:19:30,572 --> 01:19:38,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And as stated in the resolution, Medford has very long served as a place of refuge for immigrants, immigrants from many, many different places.

923
01:19:38,977 --> 01:19:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And federal immigration policy impacts the ability of communities, welcoming communities like ours, to open our arms to new community

924
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:53,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it is very relevant that so many Medford residents are a part of the Haitian diaspora.

925
01:19:53,945 --> 01:20:09,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of anecdotally, one of the most memorable conversations that I had when I was out talking to voters last year was with a Haitian man in my neighborhood in South Medford who, when I asked him what was on his mind with the city of Medford, said, I have relatives who want to come and join me here.

926
01:20:10,112 --> 01:20:13,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of our immigration policy, they can.

927
01:20:13,173 --> 01:20:14,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could see that it was a really heartbreaking issue.

928
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:19,894
[SPEAKER_03]: um and it was it's it stuck with me more than you know most other conversations

929
01:20:20,952 --> 01:20:40,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously it goes without saying that cities cannot directly affect federal immigration policy, but especially as representatives of the city with such a robust Haitian population, I think that the very least we can do is speak up and to hope that with other local leaders across greater Boston, Metro Boston speaking up as well, that these calls will accumulate and be heard.

930
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just to recognize that this policy is still affecting people in our community, even when it's left the front pages of major national newspapers.

931
01:20:48,524 --> 01:20:48,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

932
01:20:49,403 --> 01:20:50,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

933
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarapelli.

934
01:20:51,545 --> 01:20:56,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank Council, it's thanks for bringing this forward, but again, I'm going to stay with my vote.

935
01:20:56,509 --> 01:20:58,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate, I support my Haitian community.

936
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:09,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a lot for my Haitian community, but at the same time, I'll be voting no on this resolution for the fact that I'd like to see this council work closer with our Haitian community in Medford.

937
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:15,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I talked to a few of our Haitian leaders, it's ceremonial, but I'm done doing ceremonial.

938
01:21:16,527 --> 01:21:19,649
[SPEAKER_07]: votes, and I appreciate that, and I hope you can respect that.

939
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:20,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

940
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

941
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

942
01:21:23,492 --> 01:21:23,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Diaso?

943
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Just name and address for the record, please.

944
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:33,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Sharon DSL from having circuit bro.

945
01:21:33,804 --> 01:21:35,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a good time.

946
01:21:35,606 --> 01:21:47,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Council saying for sometimes conversing with some of my Haitian students on front say and they look oh my goodness now, you know when I even told one day that I was going to in French call his mama.

947
01:21:49,073 --> 01:21:51,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you probably probably agree.

948
01:21:51,794 --> 01:21:54,075
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but not not a lot.

949
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:03,780
[SPEAKER_16]: It's wonderful I get to a chance to chat about food, naturally, and different customs and I love the garb that people wear.

950
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's wonderful.

951
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just a little confused about some of the language that's in here.

952
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:17,189
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, first of all, I must admit it says for many years that method has been looked upon as the city of refuge.

953
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:21,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean that that indicates that somebody flew to the city.

954
01:22:22,753 --> 01:22:27,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Not all of them are coming here because they were harmed many of them are educated I teach with them at the college.

955
01:22:28,483 --> 01:22:33,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it should have been like a little corrected in that respect.

956
01:22:33,427 --> 01:22:37,210
[SPEAKER_16]: And refuge also means from an escape also.

957
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:39,232
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not a sanctuary city.

958
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:45,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know what that whole thing means anyway, but we're not legally or lawfully a sanctuary city.

959
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:50,201
[SPEAKER_16]: So that needs to be sort of dismissed out of the formula.

960
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:53,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, it says that you're going to seek help

961
01:22:55,493 --> 01:23:03,979
[SPEAKER_16]: out of the law that still exists that would demand that all Haitian immigrants and migrants be deported.

962
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,101
[SPEAKER_16]: All people who are legally here are gonna be deported.

963
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:10,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't quite understand that.

964
01:23:10,283 --> 01:23:12,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that, is that misinformation?

965
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:14,886
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure it's not intentional.

966
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:23,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, you know, you can see our confusion a little bit on that.

967
01:23:25,145 --> 01:23:48,690
[SPEAKER_16]: And more importantly, I think what we should be doing is maybe writing and asking that we're a city concerned with the problems in those countries, rather than pay and pay and pay and still end up with the same problems that we should be supporting, for instance, like orphanages in those countries where people can safely stay in their own land and funnel our money that way, just as an example.

968
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:49,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Also,

969
01:23:51,414 --> 01:24:07,701
[SPEAKER_16]: near the end of the Trump administration, he did actually admit, not admit, excuse me, he did allow over 3 million children were actually admitted into that DREAM Act.

970
01:24:08,262 --> 01:24:14,024
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are many, many people who were saved in that, but they had to go through the process and do the paperwork, et cetera.

971
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:19,967
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it just needs to be a little bit clearer and sorry about that.

972
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:21,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

973
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:22,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

974
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Diaso.

975
01:24:23,756 --> 01:24:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

976
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:27,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President.

977
01:24:27,619 --> 01:24:30,562
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanna thank the council for bringing this forward.

978
01:24:30,702 --> 01:24:45,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Though I support the bill as it is, you know, Medford has been a welcoming community to the Haitians going back 10, 12 years when there was a problem in Haiti and many of them came here.

979
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:51,561
[SPEAKER_22]: to live as they, when their country was decimated.

980
01:24:51,581 --> 01:25:05,036
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, as Councilor Scarpelli has mentioned, you know, these are ceremonial things and I'm not, we have, we need to concentrate more on medical issues than ceremonial issues, so I will not be supporting this, though we do support the intent of it.

981
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:09,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins, and then there's a few people on Zoom who would like to speak as well.

982
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you to everybody who's commented so far and yeah I just really wanted to you know again just focus back on the, the language of the resolution and just I think what I found, of course it's a somewhat complicated issue what I think you know the important thing to focus on is that the.

983
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:36,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of the ask here is to say, you know, let, we should be letting all immigrants, especially those applying for asylum to go through that process.

984
01:25:36,778 --> 01:25:45,603
[SPEAKER_03]: If that process is not being allowed, that's a problem all immigrants should have the right to go through the asylum seeking process so it's not, you know, any sort of.

985
01:25:46,423 --> 01:26:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: blanket this one action should occur for all immigrants this one shouldn't it's just the option should be open that's what it means to be an equitable and welcoming country and to, you know, do right by what we say we say we're trying to do as a country and as society and just you know also just to focus in on the text of the resolution I don't think this is you know an attempt to re litigate any of the actions of

986
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: past administrations or even present ones, but just to say, you know, because of the trickle-down effects of all federal policies on our local ones, this is what we're advocating for.

987
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:30,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a more personal note, you know, I completely appreciate and respect, you know, councillors who want to keep the purview of what we put on the agendas here to just super local issues.

988
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do understand that and I respect it.

989
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:38,894
[SPEAKER_03]: As I've stated before, you know, my personal posture is that I do want to take the opportunity to advocate for policies that

990
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:42,958
[SPEAKER_03]: affect our community, even if they are things that we do not have authority over.

991
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So I take that as an explanation for why I put on and co-sponsor resolutions like these.

992
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:57,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do hope that in some indirect way, declarations like these do have a cumulative effect in getting the ear of people higher up in government to say, this is what I need.

993
01:26:57,131 --> 01:26:59,313
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we're seeing on the ground in our community.

994
01:26:59,954 --> 01:27:03,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how to make our local levels safer for everybody.

995
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

996
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:05,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

997
01:27:07,186 --> 01:27:09,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew Page-Lieberman, name and address for the record, please.

998
01:27:10,988 --> 01:27:12,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, hi.

999
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:13,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'm Matthew Page-Lieberman.

1000
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:17,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in 15 Canal Street, though I'm visiting family in Florida at the moment.

1001
01:27:17,852 --> 01:27:27,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say that I'm extremely thankful, and I think here in the community, we're extremely fortunate to have Councilors Tseng and Collins advocating and bringing forth this bill.

1002
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:30,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to live with a Haitian family in Medford,

1003
01:27:31,272 --> 01:27:37,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Haitian communities are one of the communities here that I think really kind of created Medford as their home.

1004
01:27:38,055 --> 01:27:40,256
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't see a lot of representation a lot of time.

1005
01:27:40,276 --> 01:27:53,982
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some Haitians in local government or commissions, but it's extremely fortunate now to see like that members of the Haitian community have reached out to Councilor Tseng and then he's advocated for them and that they're actually getting a voice and having people actually fight for them within our community.

1006
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I very, very much support this.

1007
01:27:57,404 --> 01:27:59,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think one of the things that was in the resolution

1008
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:09,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that I recall is if anybody recalls the video of, you know, police or people, you know, people on horses whipping human beings as if they were animals.

1009
01:28:10,097 --> 01:28:16,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's something perhaps we may forget when we're talking about these kind of convenient arguments about it's outside of our purview.

1010
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:25,626
[SPEAKER_12]: That's this whole thing about whether or not it's within our purview, I think is a lot of times it's kind of conveniently applied sometimes we say that something's in our purview.

1011
01:28:26,287 --> 01:28:34,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Other times we just kind of make that up because we don't want to take on an issue that would really request that we stand up and take kind of a principle and expand.

1012
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:40,173
[SPEAKER_12]: expand, you know, what the job of an elected can actually be, you know, to really make calls.

1013
01:28:40,193 --> 01:28:41,213
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a direct thing.

1014
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:46,656
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have a direct impact on whether Haitian people are allowed to come into our community and make it their home too.

1015
01:28:47,217 --> 01:28:56,342
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, I don't know, I think Councilor Tseng and Collins didn't really articulate this, but I think what's within this is there is kind of an articulation for something about freedom.

1016
01:28:56,882 --> 01:28:58,343
[SPEAKER_12]: If we kind of take a look at our country,

1017
01:28:59,503 --> 01:29:06,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Although we don't officially have a religion, many times it's conceived of as, you know, the American religion or the American ideology is one of freedom.

1018
01:29:06,606 --> 01:29:17,350
[SPEAKER_12]: We hear a lot about talk about freedom, especially during this pandemic and when people are opposed to kind of cooperating and taking actions that would, you know, be conscious for all of us.

1019
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:21,972
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that's really off the radar a lot when we talk about freedom is freedom of movement.

1020
01:29:22,652 --> 01:29:29,339
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, freedom of where allowing human beings to go wherever they want to go, wherever they want to live and whatever kind of lives they want to have.

1021
01:29:30,752 --> 01:29:38,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot of us that we want to talk about where people can't live here, they can't do that, they can't drive there, they can't build here.

1022
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,643
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want this many people or people who look like this or that to live in our neighborhood.

1023
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:48,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that one critical thing about freedom is yes, freedom of movement.

1024
01:29:49,188 --> 01:29:50,589
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I completely support this.

1025
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:52,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm completely thankful.

1026
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:57,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that as many people vote for this as possible to allow people the freedom of movement

1027
01:29:58,261 --> 01:30:09,309
[SPEAKER_12]: and for us to stop prohibiting and stop supporting any kind of system or regime that would put us on a pedestal and exclude other people from freedom of movement and being able to live wherever they want to live.

1028
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:09,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1029
01:30:11,351 --> 01:30:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Page, Lieberman, Mr. Giglio, and then we'll go to Mr. Navarre in the chambers.

1030
01:30:17,735 --> 01:30:20,257
[SPEAKER_05]: May I address further record, please, Bill Giglio?

1031
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:26,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, can you hear me?

1032
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:27,022
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, did you unmute me?

1033
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,080
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

1034
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:33,583
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so I have just a couple of quick questions for Councilor Tseng, Councilor Calling.

1035
01:30:33,663 --> 01:30:45,690
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're saying, you know, in Medford, you want them to be, you know, you don't want deportation, how many have actually been deported that live here in Medford and not being deported for a criminal reason?

1036
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:50,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have that number?

1037
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:53,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask questions that the Councilors don't have to reply.

1038
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:54,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a time for cross talk.

1039
01:30:55,020 --> 01:31:00,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You're allowed to state an opinion, state your comments, but the Councilors don't have to respond to questions.

1040
01:31:00,643 --> 01:31:01,664
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't have to, but can they?

1041
01:31:02,984 --> 01:31:05,646
[SPEAKER_05]: For Robert's rules, there's no direct cross talk.

1042
01:31:06,266 --> 01:31:07,327
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand.

1043
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:08,127
[SPEAKER_15]: At the chair.

1044
01:31:08,968 --> 01:31:10,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that's fine.

1045
01:31:11,349 --> 01:31:16,932
[SPEAKER_19]: And then one of the paragraphs I'm reading, it says, whereas in early September, 2021, that they're being sent

1046
01:31:17,463 --> 01:31:20,405
[SPEAKER_19]: anyone crossing over the borders is being held and then sent back.

1047
01:31:20,445 --> 01:31:45,117
[SPEAKER_19]: But I believe wasn't that policy put in because we, that was in the midst of a major pandemic, which I, you know, I've heard for the, like literally the last two years from everybody on this council, we can't even do major things in Medford, but if people are pouring into the country without being tested or we don't know, and they're literally being put on planes and dropped off into, uh, states like New York and here in Massachusetts, is that not concerning to anybody?

1048
01:31:48,217 --> 01:31:49,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to end debate.

1049
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:51,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, why, why?

1050
01:31:52,738 --> 01:31:53,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to end debate.

1051
01:31:54,098 --> 01:31:54,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1052
01:31:54,358 --> 01:31:58,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Guglielmo, do you have any other questions?

1053
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, why does he want to end this?

1054
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:05,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't believe that we should be spewing lies in the public forum.

1055
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:07,001
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the lie?

1056
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:08,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I challenged the lie.

1057
01:32:09,422 --> 01:32:10,402
[SPEAKER_19]: I challenged the lie.

1058
01:32:12,462 --> 01:32:13,643
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no crosstalk.

1059
01:32:14,023 --> 01:32:16,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We have other people who would like to speak and offer their comments.

1060
01:32:16,064 --> 01:32:18,025
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any further comments, please continue.

1061
01:32:18,145 --> 01:32:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we have other people who are waiting to speak.

1062
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:21,147
[SPEAKER_19]: As always, thank you.

1063
01:32:22,268 --> 01:32:23,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Giglio.

1064
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Navarre, can you address the record, please?

1065
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:30,372
[SPEAKER_17]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1066
01:32:30,412 --> 01:32:36,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for recognizing me, Madam President, and I'm glad to see several people here to speak on this issue.

1067
01:32:37,036 --> 01:32:40,138
[SPEAKER_17]: In particular, I heard from a couple of councilors a concern

1068
01:32:41,365 --> 01:32:45,626
[SPEAKER_17]: that I sympathize with to some degree, that this isn't within the council's purview.

1069
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:54,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I read this thing the first time, I sort of said this, you're gonna tell President Biden what to do?

1070
01:32:54,589 --> 01:32:55,770
[SPEAKER_17]: He's not even gonna read this.

1071
01:32:56,370 --> 01:33:06,753
[SPEAKER_17]: But then I learned that this is part of a regional effort of multiple communities in the region who are working on this together.

1072
01:33:08,054 --> 01:33:09,174
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a value in that.

1073
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:13,331
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, it makes it more likely that President Biden will read this.

1074
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:18,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I even heard that Representative Pressley might be presenting it to him.

1075
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:23,194
[SPEAKER_17]: If that's all true, it's more likely he will see it, but that's only one piece of this.

1076
01:33:24,374 --> 01:33:34,317
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also a chance for the regional governments of this area, the governments in this region to express their support for the Asian community.

1077
01:33:35,097 --> 01:33:37,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember during the,

1078
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:42,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lives Matter uprising and so on.

1079
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:47,376
[SPEAKER_17]: We had some meetings in this council and I gave very brief comments on those.

1080
01:33:48,416 --> 01:34:02,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what I told as my recommendation to the council was to use those discussions as an opportunity to make sure that residents of color feel welcome to speak in these chambers and at the time it was on Zoom.

1081
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:08,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that supporting this resolution can help that effect too.

1082
01:34:08,758 --> 01:34:13,359
[SPEAKER_17]: because you're saying you support the Haitian community and you want them here.

1083
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:18,640
[SPEAKER_17]: You want them to come participate in the government of the city at city council.

1084
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:23,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things we talked about a lot wasn't happening.

1085
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:26,502
[SPEAKER_17]: There wasn't enough representation, people of color from the community.

1086
01:34:26,822 --> 01:34:31,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel like it's symbolic, but it could have a real effect in that way.

1087
01:34:32,943 --> 01:34:42,895
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think for those reasons, I would urge you to pass this, even though I respect and sometimes sympathize with the problem that we're just passing a lot of symbolic things.

1088
01:34:42,915 --> 01:34:49,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you don't have to tell me that because I often hear city governments have passed Vision Zero and it doesn't prevent any pedestrian deaths.

1089
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:52,347
[SPEAKER_17]: And I get kind of annoyed, you just passed the symbolic thing.

1090
01:34:53,598 --> 01:34:56,819
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm always talking about various other things, concrete things.

1091
01:34:57,219 --> 01:34:58,079
[SPEAKER_17]: We need more housing.

1092
01:34:58,099 --> 01:35:00,220
[SPEAKER_17]: We get to say we're welcoming and then not building the housing.

1093
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:07,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm always saying these issues, but occasionally this symbolic stuff could be helpful in terms of making the city a more welcoming place.

1094
01:35:08,283 --> 01:35:15,065
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank the councilors who introduced it and I hope the council will report this up favorably.

1095
01:35:15,105 --> 01:35:15,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1096
01:35:15,805 --> 01:35:16,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Ramar.

1097
01:35:16,585 --> 01:35:18,746
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion from Vice President Bears to end debate.

1098
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:21,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Eileen Lerner did have her hand up prior to that motion.

1099
01:35:23,616 --> 01:35:26,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Eileen Lerner, name and address for the record, please.

1100
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:30,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Eileen Lerner, Eileen Adams Circle.

1101
01:35:33,363 --> 01:35:52,358
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to thank Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng for this wonderful resolution that really is speaking directly to the Haitian American community in Medford.

1102
01:35:54,575 --> 01:36:01,839
[SPEAKER_20]: We talk about being welcoming, but then we don't wanna do anything that really is welcoming.

1103
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,941
[SPEAKER_20]: We just wanna say we're welcoming.

1104
01:36:05,702 --> 01:36:22,873
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanna pat ourselves on the back, but we're not doing anything unless we really listen to the Haitian American people in our community who are saying, this is what we need.

1105
01:36:24,213 --> 01:36:26,075
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what we need.

1106
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:33,083
[SPEAKER_20]: And these people, these Haitian Americans are doing so much, they're doing all kinds of work.

1107
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:42,793
[SPEAKER_20]: And I mean, they're taking care of the elderly, some of them, they're in the medical field, they're everywhere doing everything.

1108
01:36:45,395 --> 01:36:47,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Yet there's some resentment.

1109
01:36:47,277 --> 01:36:50,799
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody wants to say, we have to pay and pay and pay.

1110
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,881
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell are you paying?

1111
01:36:52,921 --> 01:36:53,882
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not paying.

1112
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:58,506
[SPEAKER_20]: You're gaining something from these people being in our community.

1113
01:36:58,526 --> 01:37:05,511
[SPEAKER_20]: And let us give them, as Matt was saying, freedom of movement.

1114
01:37:05,832 --> 01:37:09,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Let them bring their families here just like anybody else.

1115
01:37:10,055 --> 01:37:23,422
[SPEAKER_20]: and let us not punish people for fleeing countries that have just had a major earthquake or, you know, whatever the catastrophe is.

1116
01:37:23,662 --> 01:37:26,623
[SPEAKER_20]: We're supposed to be a welcoming country.

1117
01:37:27,183 --> 01:37:29,084
[SPEAKER_20]: How can you forget that?

1118
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:30,625
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1119
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

1120
01:37:32,606 --> 01:37:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Lyra.

1121
01:37:32,906 --> 01:37:34,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng.

1122
01:37:34,867 --> 01:37:35,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to,

1123
01:37:36,832 --> 01:37:45,478
[SPEAKER_18]: start to wrap things up with some of my thinking, kind of response to some of what we've heard tonight.

1124
01:37:45,498 --> 01:37:46,359
[SPEAKER_18]: When I first

1125
01:37:50,017 --> 01:37:54,719
[SPEAKER_18]: I got this idea like when I first got a draft of what other communities were passing.

1126
01:37:55,339 --> 01:37:59,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I too was a little skeptical given how, you know, obviously symbolic and ceremonial it can be.

1127
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:04,583
[SPEAKER_18]: But, as Mr. Navarre has mentioned, then I learned more about this project.

1128
01:38:05,123 --> 01:38:10,606
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned more about how it was really grassroots effort that's happening in many, many communities around the area.

1129
01:38:11,126 --> 01:38:12,766
[SPEAKER_18]: But also not just around the area.

1130
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:18,148
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an effort happening in other metro areas where there are a lot of Haitian-Americans as well.

1131
01:38:19,328 --> 01:38:27,650
[SPEAKER_18]: And Mr. Nabarro mentioned Representative Pressley's letter, or bringing it up with President Biden.

1132
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:36,972
[SPEAKER_18]: She's also been spearheaded an effort to send a letter, which dozens and dozens of Congress people have signed, to the president.

1133
01:38:39,312 --> 01:38:46,976
[SPEAKER_18]: these leaders, these congressional leaders have worked closely with Haitian American leaders and they've decided that this is the right step for our community.

1134
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:51,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Who am I to say that their strategy is wrong, right?

1135
01:38:51,738 --> 01:38:54,199
[SPEAKER_18]: They've obviously thought about it a lot.

1136
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,921
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't deny them of their own agency.

1137
01:38:58,421 --> 01:38:59,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I thought back to

1138
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:10,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, two years ago, I guess a year and a half ago, where, um, you know, our city council was also looking at some more symbolic resolutions.

1139
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:23,380
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thought back to when I was watching city council meetings and when I realized, you know, I know these resolutions are symbolic, but they're important to me, and it's important that it was important to me that our city council.

1140
01:39:24,597 --> 01:39:25,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, introduce something.

1141
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:28,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two, passed something that was symbolic.

1142
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:40,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Because to me, and I think to a lot of people who don't necessarily see themselves represented at the public forum, symbolism is the first step to action, right?

1143
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:43,151
[SPEAKER_18]: And in this case, our city council can't act on much.

1144
01:39:43,691 --> 01:39:48,154
[SPEAKER_18]: But passing something ceremonial, passing something symbolic,

1145
01:39:49,055 --> 01:39:55,717
[SPEAKER_18]: was an important indicator to me that I could trust my city government when I needed it behind my back.

1146
01:39:56,357 --> 01:40:07,920
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think this is what people in our community and people in the Haitian American community are asking for is, can I trust my government to act on even simple symbolic measures?

1147
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if you aren't willing to do the symbolic, you probably aren't willing to take real action.

1148
01:40:13,861 --> 01:40:18,644
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I thought back to that, and then I thought, you know what, this is the right thing to introduce.

1149
01:40:20,385 --> 01:40:23,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I've also, I guess, I want to end with an anecdote.

1150
01:40:24,127 --> 01:40:39,277
[SPEAKER_18]: I've spent much of my week talking to very close family friends in Ukraine, in Kiev, who are people who would likely be targeted if a Russian invasion were to target Kiev, right?

1151
01:40:40,054 --> 01:40:52,026
[SPEAKER_18]: And in talking to them, it was astonishing to see how little they wanted to flee, and how little they wanted to leave their homes, their jobs, their family, their pets, everything that they had.

1152
01:40:52,927 --> 01:41:00,534
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, now the situation is different, and the planning of leaving itself is a logistical nightmare.

1153
01:41:02,918 --> 01:41:17,169
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this isn't me going through the migrant experience, but then I think I thought back to Haitian migrants who moved to Medford, and I thought back to how much they must not have wanted to leave, even though the circumstances were not great.

1154
01:41:17,849 --> 01:41:24,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought back to how difficult it must have been for them to get to a new place, number one, and number two, settle in a new place.

1155
01:41:25,835 --> 01:41:33,580
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's important that our community show them anything it can, even if it is symbolic.

1156
01:41:35,101 --> 01:41:41,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to say, we're behind you, we're standing with you, and you can trust us.

1157
01:41:43,165 --> 01:41:44,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1158
01:41:44,325 --> 01:41:44,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President.

1159
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:45,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpellillo.

1160
01:41:46,386 --> 01:41:59,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be clear, symbolism is important, but when we present symbolic gestures on a weekly basis, more than once, more than twice, all they are is symbols and empty words.

1161
01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:09,456
[SPEAKER_07]: To say that a council that maybe tonight will vote no on the symbolic resolution, but doesn't want to see movement is a total farce.

1162
01:42:09,616 --> 01:42:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we have tried to see,

1163
01:42:12,917 --> 01:42:33,452
[SPEAKER_07]: waited for action in so many ways in the last eight months, and truly have seen nothing but more round table discussions and actual lack of hands on, feet on the ground, getting things done for our community members that have struggled so vitally in the past.

1164
01:42:33,873 --> 01:42:40,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I'm gonna say this, I support my Haitian community, I support the

1165
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:46,438
[SPEAKER_07]: the movement and anything we can do to help.

1166
01:42:46,498 --> 01:42:53,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, when we keep sending out symbolic resolutions, they fall on deaf ears.

1167
01:42:55,820 --> 01:43:09,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it comes time that this council really needs the state delegates or our federal delegates to really understand that we support something that we truly need, this community truly needs, because there's something truly glaringly wrong

1168
01:43:11,242 --> 01:43:15,823
[SPEAKER_07]: we just fall back on another symbolic resolution.

1169
01:43:16,243 --> 01:43:19,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, that's why, again, why I'm voting.

1170
01:43:19,784 --> 01:43:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I don't wanna see movement, because that's an absolute farce.

1171
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:26,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I've lived our lives doing this for people.

1172
01:43:26,145 --> 01:43:34,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think that, careful with the comments, because it's, moving on.

1173
01:43:34,526 --> 01:43:35,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1174
01:43:35,146 --> 01:43:36,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1175
01:43:37,107 --> 01:43:38,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew Page-Lieberman.

1176
01:43:39,225 --> 01:43:40,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, yes, thank you.

1177
01:43:40,646 --> 01:43:51,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just trying to really understand just from at home, I've heard a, fortunately there haven't been too many arguments in opposition to this on the grounds that it was outside of the purview.

1178
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:59,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Mostly what I'm hearing is that it's either symbolic and therefore it would somehow jeopardize any movement on this initiative or that it's ceremonial.

1179
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:06,617
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm really kind of confused because I've watched so many meetings over the past, I don't know, 13 or 14 years I've lived in this community.

1180
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:19,907
[SPEAKER_12]: these city council meetings where we're like congratulating somebody for having won like some championship at the school or we're like we're praising somebody because they're retiring and we love them so much in the community.

1181
01:44:20,247 --> 01:44:27,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Those to me seem very ceremonial but that doesn't get in the way of us like kind of commemorating and taking the time

1182
01:44:28,193 --> 01:44:50,960
[SPEAKER_12]: or doing like a moment of silence or anything for people in our community, it's very strange that I'm hearing an opposition to this idea of ceremonialness, particularly on this issue, or that it's somehow symbolic on this issue, when it's quite clear to me, and it's been made explicit, that this is a call to action, a call to action for the federal government

1183
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:55,663
[SPEAKER_12]: to change its policy in collaboration with regionally, with other people.

1184
01:44:56,083 --> 01:45:06,651
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just trying to understand, are we going to continue to hear when people are opposed to it and they're looking for some bad faith argument that something is ceremonial or it's only symbolic?

1185
01:45:07,432 --> 01:45:08,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what's going to happen?

1186
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:17,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Because from this point on, I can imagine all of us very cynically bring up that something's ceremonial or symbolic every time that happens in the future.

1187
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to understand.

1188
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps somebody can clarify.

1189
01:45:19,621 --> 01:45:19,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1190
01:45:21,895 --> 01:45:22,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Paisley right.

1191
01:45:23,816 --> 01:45:25,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion Councilor calls.

1192
01:45:26,317 --> 01:45:37,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one last thing before I move for approval I just wanted to state for the record you know that I, I've stated my explanations for why I support resolutions like these but I think you know, personally I think that there's like,

1193
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:53,868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason why a genuine commitment and passion for service showing up for the community can't co-exist with a decision to not want to put forth as many advocacy resolutions.

1194
01:45:55,909 --> 01:46:00,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I chalk it up to a difference of strategic opinion.

1195
01:46:00,352 --> 01:46:04,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to put that out there and for my fellow councilors.

1196
01:46:04,994 --> 01:46:05,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1197
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:17,927
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to put on the record that, um, you know what I was saying was, was, was, was just an argument for why, even if it's ceremonial I think we should pass it.

1198
01:46:18,387 --> 01:46:20,768
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't question anyone's intentions here.

1199
01:46:20,788 --> 01:46:24,550
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm actually very fortunate to work with colleagues

1200
01:46:25,257 --> 01:46:31,441
[SPEAKER_18]: each of whom has done a lot for our marginalized communities here at Medford, every single one of us at this table.

1201
01:46:31,941 --> 01:46:45,930
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's something that a lot of people don't necessarily see, but each and every one of us behind the scenes has worked to engage more residents in our community that are traditionally excluded from our decision-making process.

1202
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:47,431
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to put that on the record.

1203
01:46:49,272 --> 01:46:54,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I respect the healthy debate that we're having about resolutions,

1204
01:46:54,923 --> 01:46:56,524
