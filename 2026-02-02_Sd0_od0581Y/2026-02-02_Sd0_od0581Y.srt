[SPEAKER_14]: Paper passes.

20
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,257
[SPEAKER_14]: No reports of subcommittees.

21
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,499
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do have two reports under reports of superintendents.

22
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,080
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galusi to present the Mustang moment.

23
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And Member Ruseau, if you could mark yourself present.

24
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:04,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

25
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:05,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

26
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, good evening.

27
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:25,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us.

28
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:30,859
[SPEAKER_13]: So last week, our meeting was virtual due to the snow day.

29
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:40,901
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the way we normally start our school committee meetings is with Mustang Moment, and it is a chance to elevate the student voice within Medford Public Schools.

30
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:45,502
[SPEAKER_13]: So tonight, we have a really wonderful pleasure of having two Mustang Moments.

31
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:51,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the first one this evening is going to be the high school, Medford High School's Best Buddy Program.

32
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:57,069
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to ask one of the advisors, Mr. Skerry, to come up with three of his representatives.

33
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,636
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to provide a brief overview and then we're going to hear from students around the Best Buddies program.

34
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, thank you for having us.

35
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,089
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is John Scarry.

36
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of the two co-faculty advisors for the Mefferd High Best Buddies program along with Ms.

37
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Goldberg, Ms.

38
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:17,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Casey Goldberg.

39
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, she couldn't be here tonight.

40
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Best Buddies is almost our one-year anniversary.

41
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:24,463
[SPEAKER_12]: In March is our one-year anniversary.

42
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:27,966
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd like to invite all of you folks to come out to our one-year anniversary party.

43
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:41,306
[SPEAKER_12]: We are a club that is about inclusion and friendship and building meaningful connections through inclusion and friendship for our students with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities.

44
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:53,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Things are going great and we truly appreciate the hard work of Dr. Galusi, the mayor and the school committee, particularly the CPAC co-chairs, Tanya Sullivan, Alex Lorick,

45
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:53,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

46
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:54,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Joan Bowen, Ms.

47
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:57,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Cabral, Kim Clinton, and all the faculty and staff.

48
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:03,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to say too much because really the stars are the ones standing behind me.

49
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:07,918
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did share some slides with you folks if you wanted to take a look at them.

50
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, we've got three of our officers here beside you.

51
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:16,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I can give you one little piece of information about us and then turn it over to our officers.

52
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,181
[SPEAKER_12]: So we meet twice a month.

53
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:33,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we, the first part of the school year, last year was kind of like a soft launch in March, but now we're off and running and we have developed, in addition to the group meetings, we have developed one-to-one friendships, one-to-one pairings.

54
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:41,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, my buddy, per se, is one student from Gen Ed and one student from the intellectual developmental disabilities population.

55
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:50,589
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they're certainly going to do things at the meetings, but also outside of the meetings, because a lot of students in that portion of the population don't have a lot of friends outside of school.

56
00:04:51,130 --> 00:05:00,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So our goal is to build lasting and meaningful connections, not just in, you know, and certainly in and during the school year, but then hopefully long ways afterwards.

57
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:08,480
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm here for any questions, but other than that, I'd like to turn it over to our three officers who think they can tell you about their experiences, their names, and just everything about them.

58
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:11,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mrs. Gary.

59
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:12,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

60
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:25,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you go one more slide?

61
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:38,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Savannah, I'm the Best Buddies director.

62
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a sophomore at Medford High School.

63
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I like The Outsiders, Karate Kid, and Supernatural.

64
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in early childhood at the vocational shop and I went and I want to be a preschool teacher.

65
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also on the unified basketball team and the unified track team.

66
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,723
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite activity is when we've done so far in Best Buddies was baking cookies

67
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And this year for Best Buddies, I wanted to make hand turkeys near Thanksgiving and make holiday cards.

68
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful, thank you.

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to introduce yourselves?

70
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:18,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody else?

71
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:20,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Nora.

72
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a junior at Medford High School.

73
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I run track and that's pretty much and I play volleyball and I'm part of Best Buddies.

74
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the vice president.

75
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:34,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I joined Best Buddies just to like be part of a very accepting community.

76
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:40,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's hard for everyone in high school to feel accepted but Best Buddies is a place where we just like all are very

77
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:57,453
[SPEAKER_04]: talkative and accepting of each other and it's a really great club to be a part of and it helps me honestly with my leadership skills because I just feel so like included to like be myself and able to speak up and have a leadership role so yeah.

78
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Catherine Began, and I'm a sophomore at MHS.

79
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:15,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a very outgoing and friendly person, always looking to make new friends, and I'm lucky enough to be given a space by Best Buddies to do so.

80
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently the communications coordinator, which means I run the Instagram, so go follow medford.bestbuddies on Instagram, everyone.

81
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:31,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Buddies is a club with the idea of building new friendships and promoting inclusion.

82
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:35,897
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Best Buddies is no longer just a club for friendships.

83
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:41,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a source of happiness and laughter for tons of kids at Medford High.

84
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:49,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's meeting new friends at club run activities or simple hello in the hallway, the Best Buddies community offers support and appreciation for all.

85
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:58,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And throughout my experience, and hopefully everyone else's in Best Buddies, we've been able to connect with friends and build friendships that will last a lifetime.

86
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:02,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is safe to say that the Best Buddies chapter at MHS has definitely changed all of our lives.

87
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:16,424
[SPEAKER_12]: And just, we are hoping that we can be agents of furthering the Best Buddies programs and communities in Medford.

88
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:23,070
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd love to be involved in getting Best Buddies into the middle schools, and then get, you know, so starting that, those connections and getting them up into the high school.

89
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:30,156
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to take up any more of your time, but if you've got any questions, if not, we'd love to see you at our birthday party next month.

90
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,199
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you for the- Could you maybe highlight- Oh, is it?

91
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, yeah.

92
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you maybe just highlight two of the activities or initiatives that you've done this year?

93
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:38,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

94
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,962
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pick any slide you want, and we'll be happy to talk about it.

95
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,003
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to do one, Savannah?

96
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:43,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one do you want to do?

97
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:45,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Cookies?

98
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:46,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

99
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you find the one about maybe the cookies?

100
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,409
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a popular one.

101
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it matter what I think about it?

102
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,930
[SPEAKER_06]: You can say whatever you want.

103
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had fun with this activity, not going to lie to you.

104
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very, like, fun.

105
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:09,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think we should do this more often because, like, it's something that we get to do.

106
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:14,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And, like, we get to, like, experience, like, the cookies that we make.

107
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, we can share them with, like, our families and stuff like that.

108
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I just enjoy the club itself.

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,844
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Savannah, it was just an activity where you all worked together to bake cookies and had fun.

110
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:29,744
[SPEAKER_14]: That's wonderful.

111
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:30,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

112
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:41,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all right, so another, I'm not sure if it's on the slides, because I think it happened after we made the slideshow, but we did a wonderful activity where we did trick-or-treating in the halls.

113
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:42,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is?

114
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, perfect.

115
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes, okay.

116
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So trick-or-treating in the halls, so we asked a bunch of teachers who, to stay after school,

117
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:55,780
[SPEAKER_02]: and give candy out to our club, and they graciously did so.

118
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent was there.

119
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:58,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

120
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we all dressed up in costumes, as you can see.

121
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:11,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a great bonding activity, because although Best Buddies does focus on one-on-one friendships, we also are all a Best Buddies family.

122
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:17,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was definitely an activity we ought to do as our one community, which I think was really fun and really great to just have that connection.

123
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:23,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And just shout out all the teachers that gave out candy.

124
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Skerry, Ms.

125
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Coyne, Mr. Maldonado, Ms.

126
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey, everyone, thank you.

127
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and we would love to highlight Jack in his pickle costume.

128
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:43,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you.

129
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:44,063
[SPEAKER_14]: That was wonderful.

130
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:44,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're right.

131
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you've made friendships for life.

132
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:54,150
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you see your friends throughout the community, you'll remember each other and be able to enjoy each other's company.

133
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,154
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wish they had this when I was growing up, but I have a lot of friends that had disabilities.

134
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And my kids will say, how do you know so-and-so?

135
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:03,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, I just was kind.

136
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I was kind when I was in high school.

137
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,419
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of kids, I think, want to be involved more than when we were younger, unfortunately.

138
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,840
[SPEAKER_12]: It was longer ago that I was younger than you guys were.

139
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,142
[SPEAKER_12]: But kids want to help now, and this gives them something but some structure to do it.

140
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:19,482
[SPEAKER_12]: But then they take it on their own.

141
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:22,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to tell you, our students are captains of teams.

142
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,604
[SPEAKER_12]: They're National Honor Society.

143
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,024
[SPEAKER_12]: They're well-rounded individuals.

144
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,485
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've got a really good group.

145
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:34,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And the buy-in from the community at large, the Medford High Community at large, teachers staying after school to give out candy and stuff like that, has been great buy-in from everybody.

146
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:36,990
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you to everyone who's helping us make this happen.

147
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:37,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

148
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:38,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Great job.

149
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:38,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep it up.

150
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:39,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

151
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:39,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

152
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,650
[SPEAKER_14]: And next up, we have a recommendation to... No, no, no.

153
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,130
[SPEAKER_13]: One more.

154
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,471
[SPEAKER_13]: One more.

155
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,451
[SPEAKER_13]: One more Mustang moment.

156
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wonderful.

157
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:57,555
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the one that was regularly scheduled for this evening's meeting.

158
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:02,078
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the podium, we have Principal Mr. Tucci from the McGlynn Middle School.

159
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:06,982
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Principal Jennifer Skane with us virtually, Principal from the Andrews.

160
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,324
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a little under the weather today, but she is online virtually.

161
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:15,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Tucci is going to explain the two representatives that Medford has for Project 351.

162
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:17,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

163
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,065
[SPEAKER_07]: What a tough act to follow.

164
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a surprise, though, because we have so many great Mustangs walking the halls.

165
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:27,347
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm here to introduce two fantastic Mustangs at the middle school level.

166
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:39,750
[SPEAKER_07]: On Saturday, January 17, eighth graders Ali Matarazzo and Jovi LaFer of the Andrews Middle School had the opportunity to attend Project 351's annual launch day.

167
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were honored by Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll as Medford's ambassadors to this annual launch and service day in Boston.

168
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:57,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Ali and Jovi, in the class of 2026, were honored for inspiring ethic of service and values of kindness, compassion, humility, and gratitude.

169
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:02,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're gonna think about Ali or Jovi, they certainly embody every characteristic there.

170
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:15,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Project 351 is a non-profit organization that empowers a youth-led movement for change, powered by 8th grade students representing every single city and town and municipality in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

171
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:23,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Allie and Jovi participated and honored Dr. Martin Luther King's life and celebrated what's, quote, a revolution of love.

172
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:36,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Allie and Jovi united with more than 450 ambassadors and alumni mentors representing the Commonwealth's 351 cities and towns to kick off a year of leadership developments, unifying service, and enrichment.

173
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And since 2011,

174
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:47,756
[SPEAKER_07]: 5,930 ambassadors have united across all facets of difference to impact 1.5 million neighbors through service.

175
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:58,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So here to speak more about their experience in Project 351's launch day and also their ensuing leadership within the Medford community are both Ali and Jovi.

176
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna turn it over to Ali first to explain a little bit about our experience at the launch day.

177
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:15,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Project 351, an organization that values kindness, gratitude, and compassion, leads 8th graders from all over Massachusetts to make a difference in our community.

178
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:25,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so grateful to have been chosen as a student ambassador for Project 351 and for the opportunity that it gave me to help so many underprivileged people.

179
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:30,854
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of the experience, I was inspired by kind leaders in our community.

180
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:45,418
[SPEAKER_05]: At launch day on January 17th, eighth graders from all 351 towns in Massachusetts got together to do volunteer service for various nonprofit organizations, including Cradles to Crayons, Your Hometown Food Pantry, and Home Base.

181
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:51,939
[SPEAKER_05]: My group was assigned to Cradles to Crayons, so we went to their factory and worked and sorted through donated clothes.

182
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,020
[SPEAKER_05]: With this in mind, I look forward to helping many others this year

183
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,581
[SPEAKER_05]: and continuing to be a leader for the rest of my life.

184
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:03,862
[SPEAKER_05]: At the beginning of the day, all of the ambassadors from 351 towns in Massachusetts gathered in Faneuil Hall.

185
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:11,844
[SPEAKER_05]: This hall was where many revolutionary meetings took place with historical figures like Paul Revere, John Adams, and John Hancock.

186
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:22,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing all the hall's history is why it was so empowering to be in the same room where people revolutionized the country hundreds of years ago, and now eighth graders were the ones creating a revolution of love.

187
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The theme of 351 is a revolution of love.

188
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: This means that we are creating loving community by replacing negativity with kindness.

189
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:40,242
[SPEAKER_05]: While we were at the historical hall, we got to know our service hero teams and listen to the founders of the organization and other inspiring leaders discuss how important it is to be a kind leader.

190
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:48,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Being around 350 other amazing students and countless leaders for just one day made me feel inspired to do more to help my community.

191
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: The adults helped us ambassadors realize that even though we are young, we can still make a difference in thousands of people's lives.

192
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: From Faneuil Hall, my group took a bus to Cradles to Crayons in Newton.

193
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:07,956
[SPEAKER_05]: During the time we spent there, we sorted donated clothes into numerous piles, making sure that they were high quality.

194
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: To end our day, we traveled to the JFK Library and learned that we changed 2,303 lives at Cradles to Crayons in just one day.

195
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:23,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The thought that a group of young teens could change that many lives in just a few hours puts it into perspective of how easy it is to help our community.

196
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: As my next step in helping our community, I will run a clothing drive for two weeks at my school with the help of friends and family.

197
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:38,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We do this as a spring service at Project 351 because in Massachusetts, one in three children are at risk for clothing insecurity.

198
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:44,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of this, all donations that we collect in Medford will go to the nonprofit organization Cradles to Crayons.

199
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of Project 351, 230,000 children have been served at Cradles to Crayons, and I hope that I can contribute to changing more lives this spring.

200
00:16:56,665 --> 00:17:00,989
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first learned about my selection in November, I had no clue what I was getting myself into.

201
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:07,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing words like leader and representative, I was unsure how well I'd be fit for the role of an ambassador for Project 351.

202
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: However, over the past few months, I've been able to learn more about what the organization actually is and the part that ambassadors will play in as we embark on a year of service.

203
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:27,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Though I had doubts about my capabilities, being able to actually meet the other ambassadors, people my age with the same motives as me, made me feel so much better, and I'm extremely honored to be part of something so big.

204
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting on the bus on launch day, I didn't know what was going to happen.

205
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:35,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very nervous, mostly excited for whatever activities we'd partake in throughout the day.

206
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,120
[SPEAKER_03]: From the moment I stepped in Faneuil Hall, I was filled with the thrill that stayed with me for the rest of the day.

207
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to meet the ambassadors on my service hero team, listen to influential figures, and connect with such an empowering community was amazing.

208
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:58,043
[SPEAKER_03]: When my team went into Chelsea to serve at La Collaborativa, we were able to experience a lot of great things, from making valentines scarves and bookmarks to being able to hand out food to the community.

209
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,004
[SPEAKER_03]: After such a great day with such incredible opportunities,

210
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:08,046
[SPEAKER_03]: We all came together at JFK Library to recap the impact we made, to have fun, and to relax until it was time to go home.

211
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step in our service journey is spring service.

212
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:17,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the next few months, ambassadors will go through the Service Leadership Academy in preparation for April's spring service.

213
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:22,789
[SPEAKER_03]: In support of Cradles to Crayons, ambassadors will be able to lead a product drive in their hometown.

214
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Spring service, the largest youth-led service in Massachusetts history, will allow ambassadors to apply leadership skills, strength, and kindness, and build generosity.

215
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:35,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Round of applause for Allie and Joby.

216
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:42,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions?

217
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:47,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Take a picture of both groups, Best Buddies and Project 351.

218
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:47,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

219
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions before we do that?

220
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:51,461
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

221
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,142
[SPEAKER_14]: We're proud of you.

222
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:52,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Great job.

223
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:53,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

224
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:54,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

225
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:56,464
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to come around, we'll take a picture right here.

226
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:36,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks again.

227
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:42,493
[SPEAKER_14]: And next up we have a recommendation to approve the proposed educational plan for the Medford High School building project.

228
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:49,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Suzanne Galusi, Interim Superintendent, and Dr. Kimberly Talbot, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions.

229
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:54,143
[SPEAKER_14]: We did.

230
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:02,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

231
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:11,003
[SPEAKER_13]: So last meeting, Dr. Talbot and I presented on the educational plan as part of the MSBA project.

232
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:20,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Just as a quick refresher, this is, as we refer to it, kind of the North Star, the guiding document for the high school project.

233
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:30,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So we put it out for some edits or some feedback, but the document on whole remains as it was last week, so there are no

234
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:34,039
[SPEAKER_13]: updates or feedback to present at this meeting.

235
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:42,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And so after a vote, Dr. Talbot and I are here and happy to take any feedback or answer any questions.

236
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:49,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions or feedback?

237
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Reinfeld and Member Graham?

238
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:56,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham, anything before we move approval?

239
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:16,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, if we could just maybe amend the approval to give the superintendent permission to make non-substantive changes in the lead up to the deliverable at the end of the month, that will inevitably be needed to tie everything together for MSBA.

240
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,556
[SPEAKER_14]: I accept the amendment.

241
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:20,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve by Member Reinfeld as amended by Member Graham.

242
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:21,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

243
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:22,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

244
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,097
[SPEAKER_14]: By Member Graham.

245
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:24,077
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

246
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:24,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

247
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we take a roll call?

248
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call has been requested, please.

249
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:33,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

250
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:33,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

251
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:34,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mastroboni?

252
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:34,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

253
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Oliphante?

254
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:36,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

255
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Parks?

256
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:37,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

257
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:38,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

258
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:39,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

259
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:39,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

260
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:40,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

261
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:40,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

262
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:41,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

263
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

264
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Paper passes as amended.

265
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:47,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Guzzi.

266
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:56,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we move on, I just wanted to acknowledge and say thank you that we do have our representatives from left field and SMMA on the call virtually with us.

267
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:04,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I do see Jen Carlson from left field, Matt Rice from SMMA as well as Rosemary Park.

268
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:10,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want to say their guidance throughout this process was also instrumental.

269
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,947
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to make sure I acknowledge that they are here at this meeting.

270
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:14,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being here.

271
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:17,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you can log off.

272
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:18,920
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been approved.

273
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:21,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Lucky.

274
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:25,396
[SPEAKER_14]: No presentations of the public.

275
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:28,535
[SPEAKER_14]: and student advisory council.

276
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:48,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to go on to continued business, which is 2026-05 offered by member Graham, whereas the Medford School Committee recognizes the importance of establishing a thoughtful process for deciding how to appoint a permanent superintendent on July 1st, 2026, and whereas the school committee wishes to ensure opportunities for public input and engagement

277
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:50,803
[SPEAKER_14]: as part of this process.

278
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:59,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, therefore, be it resolved the member's school committee will determine its approach to appointing a permanent superintendent at its public meeting today, February 2nd, 2026.

279
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:03,848
[SPEAKER_14]: And be it further resolved that the school committee invites feedback from the public during this meeting.

280
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:17,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And be it further resolved that the members of the school committee, the school committee will review emails from the community who are not able to attend but want to provide input by submitting feedback via email.

281
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:24,659
[SPEAKER_14]: to the email address medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

282
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham, do you want to start us off?

283
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:30,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

284
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:44,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you know as we have been really for an entire year now sitting with an interim superintendent we it's time for us to make decisions about how we're going to move forward.

285
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:51,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought it was important that before we made those decisions given that we had a year and a half that we

286
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,169
[SPEAKER_10]: do a couple of things.

287
00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:04,074
[SPEAKER_10]: One was to stabilize the district in what was an unexpected transition from our prior superintendent who left before her contract was over.

288
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:06,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was like the sort of the first order of business.

289
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:16,119
[SPEAKER_10]: The second order of business in my mind was to make sure that we were not compromising the strategic work that we had ahead.

290
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:40,129
[SPEAKER_10]: by trying to insert and infuse like another process into the mix all while trying to navigate through onboarding our team for the MSBA MHS high school project and to negotiate what is like one of the most pivotal teacher contracts that Medford has seen in a really long time made possible by

291
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:44,011
[SPEAKER_10]: the override, but also to like do the budget and do all the things.

292
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:58,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was sort of the secondary thing was in my mind to say we have some really big important things to do and we can't do those things effectively if our leadership is unclear about the role that they're going to play.

293
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:05,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, as we continued forward, the work doesn't really stop.

294
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:09,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've been sort of, we continued into the fall where,

295
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:32,028
[SPEAKER_10]: it seemed like the right time for us to start talking about strategic planning and to solicit input and feedback from the community about the things that they want to see us do and undertake, and to ask questions much like we did when we did our superintendent search all those years ago about the kinds of qualities and preferences people have for a superintendent.

296
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So we did that that launched at the beginning of January.

297
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:43,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, we made a strategic decision not to launch that in December because no one wants to be filling out surveys in December.

298
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,582
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to be eating cookies and.

299
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,733
[SPEAKER_10]: working on reasons to have a New Year's resolution in January.

300
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:54,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So that sort of kicked off in January.

301
00:26:54,077 --> 00:27:00,761
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in the middle or we'll close out six public input sessions of that strategic plan later this week.

302
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:04,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And then sort of like next thing you know, we're here.

303
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:09,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And the superintendent has been with us for a year, which is a typical timeline where you would evaluate a superintendent.

304
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:12,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, you know,

305
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:27,154
[SPEAKER_10]: This process and what we do next has been on my mind since the day that we appointed Dr. Galussi, but I really felt like given all that was going on, it was really important for us to fairly evaluate her because she had been here for an entire year.

306
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:32,057
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of moving past sitting in the chair and holding down the fort.

307
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:35,519
[SPEAKER_10]: And she has taken the reins as our superintendent.

308
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,540
[SPEAKER_10]: So we did that last week.

309
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:41,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, just last week, the week before.

310
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:44,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm mixing up the dates and times.

311
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that was

312
00:27:49,743 --> 00:28:10,970
[SPEAKER_10]: really fascinating in the course of that process to collect feedback and input from six people who don't seven people who don't always agree on everything and who have different experiences with with various members of the district to see the consistency with which we evaluated the superintendent I thought was remarkable.

313
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't ever remember having a

314
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:22,003
[SPEAKER_10]: superintendent evaluation with the level of consistency that we saw and accepted last week.

315
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:28,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that is a really important note and I would also say that the scores that we

316
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:40,457
[SPEAKER_10]: collectively came to through an averaging of everybody's scores and interests are that of a superintendent that no district would be looking to move on from.

317
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:46,501
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of, from my perspective, the process that has led us here.

318
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:56,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think it's important for clarity for everybody involved, for the committee, for the interim superintendent, for the people watching, for the parents, for the community, for the kids.

319
00:28:56,522 --> 00:28:59,323
[SPEAKER_10]: For all of those people, it's important for us to decide.

320
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:02,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important for us to decide tonight what our path will be.

321
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:14,348
[SPEAKER_10]: When I think about my preferences about that path, like I've been listening and hearing from lots and lots and lots of folks who are super supportive of Dr. Galussi and the work that she's doing.

322
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:39,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I have heard from, you know, we, I think we all have heard from a handful of people who believe that a search is necessary, not because they think Dr. Glucy is not the right person, but because they think that and respect that process in an important way, and I don't want to diminish the need for good processes, but for me,

323
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:57,562
[SPEAKER_10]: For right now, I look at this and say, from where I'm coming from, is that we have sort of two choices given where we are in this trajectory, in this timeline, having had Dr. Glucy serve for us, on behalf of us, for a year.

324
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:02,586
[SPEAKER_10]: We can treat her like an interim superintendent, in which case a search makes lots of sense.

325
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Interims are meant to sit in the chair and hold down the fort.

326
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:14,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we can treat her like a sitting superintendent who had a stellar evaluation and moved to enter into contract negotiations, and that would be my preference.

327
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:16,333
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to hear from my colleagues.

328
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:16,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

329
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

330
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:28,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Button on first.

331
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:29,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking around.

332
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not good at keeping my thoughts organized, so I wrote it down.

333
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:42,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So over the past year, Dr. Glucy has been leading this district, not in theory, but in practice.

334
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:52,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We have had the rare opportunity to observe her leadership in real time, how she communicates, how she makes decisions, and how she responds when challenges arise.

335
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,031
[SPEAKER_09]: That level of clarity is not hypothetical.

336
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:56,772
[SPEAKER_09]: It is earned and it is invaluable.

337
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:00,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Our students, educators, and families deserve stability.

338
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,542
[SPEAKER_09]: They deserve continuity.

339
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:09,608
[SPEAKER_09]: They deserve a leader who already understands both the complexity of the work and the relationships that make that work possible.

340
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:15,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Galussi has built those relationships deliberately and authentically, and I know that

341
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:24,043
[SPEAKER_09]: not only through my own experience, but through the many emails I have received from staff and caregivers expressing trust in her leadership.

342
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:33,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Every email, regardless of whether someone wanted a search or not, included a lot of praise for Dr. Galusi, which I think

343
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:43,111
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely seems unlikely to be a normal, common experience for people when it comes to this type of setting, this situation.

344
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:48,975
[SPEAKER_09]: She has demonstrated consistency, transparency, and a deep commitment to the values of our district.

345
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:52,317
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not guessing how she will lead.

346
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:53,097
[SPEAKER_09]: We know.

347
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:01,603
[SPEAKER_09]: There is also a clear alignment between Dr. Galusi's priorities and the goals we as a community have set.

348
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:09,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it is advancing equity, supporting educators, or strengthening communication, she has already been moving this work forward.

349
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no learning curve here, no pause, no reset, and no loss of momentum.

350
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Equally important is the working relationship between Dr. Glucy and the school committee.

351
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:26,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been a collaborative, open, and productive relationship, exactly what effective governance requires.

352
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:28,124
[SPEAKER_09]: That partnership matters.

353
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:36,247
[SPEAKER_09]: It ensures accountability, transparency, and that the will of the community expressed through our electoral process is meaningfully represented.

354
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost done.

355
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:44,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to acknowledge that some members of our community and this committee sincerely believe that conducting a search

356
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:48,006
[SPEAKER_09]: A superintendent search is the right course.

357
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I respect that perspective and I recognize the values behind it.

358
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:55,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Transparency, inclusivity, and diligence.

359
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:58,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Those values matter and they matter to me as well.

360
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:05,150
[SPEAKER_09]: However, for me, this decision is not about comparing candidates or speculating about the strength of a potential applicant pool.

361
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,411
[SPEAKER_09]: It is about recognizing the strong, steady, and proven leadership we already have.

362
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:14,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be clear about why I do not support conducting a superintendent search at this time.

363
00:33:15,198 --> 00:33:16,819
[SPEAKER_09]: A search is not a neutral act.

364
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:23,701
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires significant time, attention, and energy from staff, from this committee, and from the superintendent herself.

365
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:32,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Given where we are as a district, particularly with the intensity and pace of our new high school project, something would eventually have to give.

366
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:43,439
[SPEAKER_09]: There are only so many hours in a day, and I do not believe we can sustain our current momentum while simultaneously pausing to conduct a full search, to perform a full search process.

367
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Galussi has overseen the MSBA process from the beginning.

368
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:49,304
[SPEAKER_09]: She has attended every meeting.

369
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,967
[SPEAKER_09]: She has presented at every community forum held by this committee.

370
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:57,391
[SPEAKER_09]: She has built relationships with current and former school committee members.

371
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:01,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And through those relationships, she has earned my unqualified trust.

372
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:08,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also seen how she responds when students reach out, especially when the school committee is copied.

373
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:15,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Those moments reveal character, they reveal judgment, and they remind me that some people are truly called to this work.

374
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:18,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I can say without reservation that this is her calling.

375
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:27,965
[SPEAKER_09]: For all these reasons, stability, continuity, proven leadership, and the needs of this moment, I believe appointing Dr. Galusi as a permanent superintendent

376
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:33,271
[SPEAKER_09]: without conducting a search is the right decision for our students, our staff, and our community.

377
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:35,693
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a decision to settle.

378
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:39,916
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a decision to lead with confidence in what we already know works.

379
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:40,977
Thank you.

380
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:43,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

381
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,302
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just piggyback on that.

382
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:49,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Member Parks?

383
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:52,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know if anybody else was going to speak.

384
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:56,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't prepare a speech, but great job, Member Ruseau.

385
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:08,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to piggyback a little bit on the amount of work that's going on among subcommittees, this committee, and, of course, Dr. Galussi's at every meeting, like Member Ruseau said.

386
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,077
[SPEAKER_14]: The time and effort it's taken.

387
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,643
[SPEAKER_14]: to get ready for a new high school.

388
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:19,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Our middle school consolidation, we cannot slow down on that project.

389
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:29,147
[SPEAKER_14]: The after school programming issues and building a task force like Dr. Galussi has and already expanding after school care for it was so desperately needed.

390
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:33,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I know many in our community consider it a crisis.

391
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:37,910
[SPEAKER_14]: That is being resolved and handled in such an efficient manner.

392
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,391
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so pleasantly surprised and happy.

393
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:44,168
[SPEAKER_14]: just wanted to point that out.

394
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:49,051
[SPEAKER_14]: The strategic plan, I think there's been six meetings over the last month.

395
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:52,112
[SPEAKER_14]: That's on top of every other meeting that has gone on.

396
00:35:52,132 --> 00:36:00,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I'm on top of trying to create a security task force, which Dr. Galusi is buying into and has that as one of her priorities.

397
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,357
[SPEAKER_14]: The capital improvement plan, IT upgrades,

398
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:09,289
[SPEAKER_14]: academics, of course, which I am not the one to speak on that, but enhancing sports and so much more.

399
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:18,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like we are all doing the work, but it's on Dr. Gallucci's shoulder as the leader of the school committee and the school system, and the work is getting done.

400
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:21,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So I definitely want to hear from the community.

401
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:25,739
[SPEAKER_14]: I, too, received plenty of emails about how wonderful you are, Dr. Gallucci.

402
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:30,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I did also receive four or five emails from residents and parents who

403
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,068
[SPEAKER_14]: are interested in a full search, but I just know the work can't slow down.

404
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:41,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So adding on top of everybody else's plate a search, when we have somebody fully qualified, capable, and willing.

405
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:47,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it needs to be done, so I'll leave it at that and pass it over to you, Member Barks.

406
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:49,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

407
00:36:49,325 --> 00:37:12,332
[SPEAKER_11]: So as someone who was not part of the discussions or decisions a year ago, I kind of did the approach that I typically take, which is I dove into research and reached out to many different districts and the MASC, which is the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to find out.

408
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:16,638
[SPEAKER_11]: what this process is about and I learned a lot.

409
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:24,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean I've learned from the community as well and I heard all of the different amazing things that everyone had to say about Superintendent Galussi.

410
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:34,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean I also have strong feelings about how successful she has been in just the work I've done on the after school subcommittee as well.

411
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:42,285
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have had many you know of the people that have reached out 83 percent.

412
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:46,909
[SPEAKER_11]: think that she should be appointed immediately.

413
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:52,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So without a search, and that says a lot.

414
00:37:52,871 --> 00:38:04,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And of those that think there should be a search, as Jenny said, it should be noted that it's not because they don't believe in her, it's just because they believe in a process.

415
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:11,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So I looked into the process, and things that I learned about the process are that

416
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:22,617
[SPEAKER_11]: About one-third of MASC member districts actually promote from within or hire their internal superintendents.

417
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:27,899
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason many don't would be because they just don't have a viable internal candidate.

418
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:36,929
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of a search timeline, a rigorous transparent search would require us to post in August.

419
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:51,218
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be either last August or this coming August because the reality is starting now when most districts have either already made their offers or are finalizing interviews means we'd be competing for an already limited pool of candidates.

420
00:38:53,080 --> 00:39:09,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd already be kind of behind the ball or we'd be putting Superintendent Galussi through another year of uncertainty, which I don't personally feel is a fair way of having someone sit in a position.

421
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:16,267
[SPEAKER_11]: On search challenges, many districts have experienced significant difficulties with external searches.

422
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Between 5 to 10% fail and must restart entirely.

423
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:27,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Others have had applicants withdraw due to public pressure or better offers from other districts because that pool is small.

424
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Multiple people are applying for multiple positions.

425
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:36,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, others have had to rescind offers because of issues discovered through, frankly, a simple Google search.

426
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:57,537
[SPEAKER_11]: And additionally, as we've seen in Cambridge, I learned when an intern superintendent has been in place for too long with strong evaluations, as committee member Graham talked about, the search posting doesn't attract serious candidates because it begins to feel like a formality.

427
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:07,259
[SPEAKER_11]: On cost and continuity, a search costs anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 or more, with no guarantee of a better outcome.

428
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:19,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond the direct costs, we would lose the investment we've already made in Dr. Galicia's professional development throughout her career with the district, and we would lose critical institutional knowledge at a time when we're managing multiple major initiatives.

429
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:27,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Galusi brings institutional knowledge, proven leadership, and a demonstrated commitment to Medford.

430
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:31,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I've read time and time again in all of the emails that were provided.

431
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:39,776
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very clear that people have a very high regard for Dr. Galusi and she cares about our community.

432
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,057
[SPEAKER_11]: She's earned the confidence of our community and our staff.

433
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:48,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Her evaluation last week was stellar and I believe it was a fair representation because it was

434
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:55,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Both current and former school committee members completed it and their evaluations were consistent with one another.

435
00:40:56,505 --> 00:41:07,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a district, as a steward of our district's resources, I must weigh the certainty of a qualified, experienced leadership against the costs and risks of an uncertain external search.

436
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:16,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is why I would vote in support of moving forward with appointing Dr. Galusi.

437
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Parks.

438
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Olapade.

439
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:23,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

440
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cover this, my perspective, on two accounts.

441
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:36,532
[SPEAKER_00]: The first account is going to be the school committee combined data that we put together last week in our meeting, that I compiled the information from separate school committee members.

442
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:39,573
[SPEAKER_00]: As Member Graham mentioned, we had seven separate

443
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:46,283
[SPEAKER_00]: data points to use, as referenced when we discussed the interim superintendent's tenure thus far.

444
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:52,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Across those data points, we saw consistency that at no point in any of the nearly 25

445
00:41:55,918 --> 00:42:01,885
[SPEAKER_00]: thresholds of success or performance, did the interim superintendent fall below satisfactory?

446
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:14,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pointed out by member Reinfeld during that meeting that more often than not, MASC recommends that you do not use exemplary or highly proficient unless absolutely necessary because there's always room for growth.

447
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:27,155
[SPEAKER_00]: At no point, really, is everyone in the district going to be completely satisfied with the central administration, the school committee, because there's always room to improve and there's always more work to be done for our students.

448
00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:35,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look at the data points that our seven members came together to sign off on their John Hancocks,

449
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:45,009
[SPEAKER_00]: at no point did anyone indicate to me that there was major concerns or really relatively small concerns with the interim superintendent's capacity for this work or her commitment to our district.

450
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:52,831
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, more of them were closer to exemplary than not, and the feedback reflects that.

451
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really important to consider when we talk about

452
00:42:55,792 --> 00:43:10,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering a search, I also appreciate and understand why some members of the community say that at the very least, we as a district are deserving to consider other candidates because there always could be someone who is more qualified than what we're used to.

453
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:16,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that there's that belief as a possibility, but there's no guarantee that that exists.

454
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:23,925
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I've seen as a committee member, our intern superintendent has been more committed, more willing to learn,

455
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:31,228
[SPEAKER_00]: more adaptable in her role thus far, and I see no reason to believe that that'll change going forward.

456
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:36,070
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, she has been on a year-long job interview.

457
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been asking her to rise to the occasion time and time again, and she has done that.

458
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,642
[SPEAKER_00]: at least by my understanding and by the seven members who conducted this feedback.

459
00:43:46,462 --> 00:44:00,430
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, no one indicated to me that there was any major concerns about her capacity or her willingness to grow if there was a shortcoming or some skill that she was, quote unquote, deficient in, which again, never came along.

460
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,412
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the data that I'm looking at to consider my point.

461
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:09,135
[SPEAKER_00]: From a more personal perspective, an analogy that I'm considering is,

462
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:33,155
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking for, let's say, a job that exists in, let's say, in Chicago for the conversation, but I know I want to live my life and continue to grow in my career here in Massachusetts, if I consider an opportunity in Chicago, but I don't know the people in the city, I don't know what the work will look like, I don't know if I'll even enjoy the city, I know nothing other than the prospect of it.

463
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:42,319
[SPEAKER_00]: On paper, there is an opportunity there, but I know what I have here, and it's phenomenal here in the city of Medford and Boston, Massachusetts.

464
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that our interim superintendent has been phenomenal by all accounts thus far.

465
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:54,410
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, there's always room to grow, and of course, there's always the question of what could there be out?

466
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there more, is the quote unquote grass greener?

467
00:44:57,491 --> 00:45:00,331
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, more often than not, is something considered as a fantasy.

468
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:11,735
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always opportunity there, but who's to say if we find a candidate that we're excited about, a candidate that speaks to us as a district, someone who's willing to move here or come here, whatever that may look like,

469
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,855
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll rise to the occasion that our superintendent has thus far.

470
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:17,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not convinced that that's a guarantee.

471
00:45:17,896 --> 00:45:36,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thought of losing our interim superintendent or to continue to have another year-long job interview when one doesn't feel to be needed, I think is a missed opportunity to continue the momentum that we've been growing the last couple of years and will continue to grow, I think, under our interim superintendent.

472
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not in favor of an outward search.

473
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been given a

474
00:45:41,440 --> 00:46:02,000
[SPEAKER_00]: reason from members of the committee or from my own research that suggests that we should have one other than there could be somebody else, or we should do it to cross our I's and our T's and such, which again, I totally can understand that immediate consideration, but nothing substantiates that other than it's what other people have been doing.

475
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:11,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Our superintendent has been committed, has been consistent, has risen, as I've mentioned, multiple times, and I believe that she's due.

476
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:16,590
[SPEAKER_00]: She deserves to continue her work here in the district because nothing suggests otherwise.

477
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

478
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Olapade.

479
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:21,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Reinfeld?

480
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

481
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:26,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I also didn't prepare a speech.

482
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to hear what my colleagues would say and then fill in some of the things that I maybe didn't hear.

483
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So one point that... Yeah.

484
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:42,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna note that we would be having a very different conversation if this were a year ago.

485
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:45,100
[SPEAKER_08]: As people have said, we've

486
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:56,930
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a year of evidence in front of us about what's happening, about where the room to grow is, and part of the reason I really pushed to incorporate

487
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:11,529
[SPEAKER_08]: The hopes and dreams for district leadership within the strategic planning survey is to do that matchmaking service of what people need and want and what we have and to be able to look at that really authentically.

488
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:17,014
[SPEAKER_08]: When we first appointed, made the interim appointment, I immediately reached out to MASC.

489
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:19,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really concerned about how little community input

490
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:23,859
[SPEAKER_08]: we had the opportunity to collect given the time frame of that.

491
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:34,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that they said to me is absolutely look at your community values and think about it over the course of the interim appointment.

492
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:45,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Also think about the message that you're sending to people with a high performance review and to other potential candidates about how you treat people.

493
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:47,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I very much

494
00:47:49,499 --> 00:48:04,610
[SPEAKER_08]: hear the challenge of navigating the process versus the person, and I think it's been very clear that while nobody is perfect, there is incredibly strong feedback on the person and the process.

495
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:12,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard and read and seen and had the conversations with people about running a search on principle.

496
00:48:12,475 --> 00:48:14,617
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I was really struck by in a lot of the

497
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:21,120
[SPEAKER_08]: communications that we received is the people who explicitly said do not run a search.

498
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:28,642
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in those reasons were cited as being in practice that we have this moment we have this momentum.

499
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:36,925
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not have time to break in somebody new to stop the work we're doing.

500
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:44,808
[SPEAKER_08]: There has been a lot of change in this district over the last few years and more change

501
00:48:45,986 --> 00:49:04,802
[SPEAKER_08]: is coming, we have brought in pretty much an entirely new leadership team, most of whom, you all are fantastic, you did not come from the Medford system, we have a lot of outside perspectives that are in the room right now, and I heard in the emails

502
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:22,487
[SPEAKER_08]: the communications, the strategic survey, and the conversations, there was a strong theme of the deep knowledge of Medford, the consistency, and having that perspective to balance rather than having a whole new leadership situation.

503
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:26,210
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor mentioned a lot of the work that's been underway.

504
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:41,441
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I've been really concerned about is as federal policy has changed, there has been increasing tension between what the state requirements are and what the federal government is mandating.

505
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:48,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time I have reached out to the leadership team to say, hey, this new thing happened, what are we doing?

506
00:49:50,820 --> 00:50:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: on top of it, we're already thinking about it, meetings are already set up, and that need to clarify and to understand what has been happening, why decisions were made, and to keep making them is really, really important to me.

507
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:26,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a hard, I see all sides of this, but ultimately I think what I heard, particularly looking at the strategic survey, every single Medford educator who responded and asked for an appointment

508
00:50:27,284 --> 00:50:38,910
[SPEAKER_08]: mentioned that stability and consistency and I see that as a really important part of actually I appreciate what you said, Member Parks, of stewarding the resources.

509
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:46,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am also coming down on the side of let's keep this work going.

510
00:50:46,734 --> 00:50:55,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's remain open to the feedback and understanding where we still have room to grow and doing that together as a community.

511
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:58,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

512
00:50:58,864 --> 00:50:59,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Mastraboni?

513
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:03,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

514
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be brief.

515
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:06,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your comments.

516
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows a couple of us are new here.

517
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:17,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I rely on what I heard from residents, what I heard from the evaluation that you all did, and that the two former members did.

518
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:19,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really the key for me.

519
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard really strongly from residents.

520
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:27,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not gonna belabor this, but in support of hiring Dr. Galusi as a permanent superintendent.

521
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you all, I also discuss with folks what it would look like to run a process.

522
00:51:35,182 --> 00:51:38,583
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, and this is hard to say, I'm a process guy, I do this,

523
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:42,499
[SPEAKER_01]: for a living process is not important than results.

524
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know.

525
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:52,437
[SPEAKER_01]: like my colleague, like member Olapade, I think we've actually gotten more than a process over the last year.

526
00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:53,578
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten a tryout.

527
00:51:54,018 --> 00:52:00,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that goes well beyond what a superintendent search would tell us about the person sitting in the chair right now.

528
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm basing my decision to support entering into negotiations immediately based on your all work, the comprehensive review that we discussed last meeting.

529
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:18,377
[SPEAKER_01]: but also with my own experience over the last few months.

530
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:27,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Dr. Galusi, everywhere I go, you're there ahead of me, even if I think I'm early, even if I think I'm going to the most obscure meeting, you're always there.

531
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:37,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, to talk about a tryout, I feel like we all have room to grow, and I think everybody here recognizes that, but I think you've aced the tryout.

532
00:52:37,983 --> 00:52:40,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm feeling really great.

533
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:49,392
[SPEAKER_01]: All things considered, so to wrap up, all things considered, I think the choice to pair immediately best matches the moment that we're in right now.

534
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:56,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm prepared to endorse the superintendent and especially the team that she's put together.

535
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:59,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what really I can't stop talking about.

536
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:01,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for consistency.

537
00:53:01,795 --> 00:53:03,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for perspective of that team.

538
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:07,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for your focus on staff up and down the organization.

539
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:15,398
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard from residents, and you guys all read the same emails, what I heard from staff was how much you support the folks up and down the organization.

540
00:53:15,438 --> 00:53:16,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep seeing that.

541
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:21,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all those things together means, tells me that we're on the right track.

542
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:22,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm prepared to support this team.

543
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:25,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

544
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:35,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have some emails from people in the audience, but if anybody else wants to comment or you want to say more, please.

545
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:41,399
[SPEAKER_10]: On Zoom or anybody in the room who would like to speak.

546
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:45,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, nobody on Zoom.

547
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:49,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

548
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:59,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I would like to make a motion to appoint Dr. Galusi to be Medford's next superintendent pending successful contract negotiations.

549
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:02,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion on the floor by Member Graham.

550
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:03,256

[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

570
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:31,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

571
00:54:31,573 --> 00:54:33,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

573

[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Galussi.

574
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:01,659
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not going to be the most eloquent thing I've ever said.

575
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:05,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to say I'm very humbled.

576
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:16,727
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not necessarily think I would be sitting here a year ago, but when put in the position to be interim, I was fully committed.

577
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:19,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I have always said how dedicated I am to Medford.

578
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:21,850
[SPEAKER_13]: It holds a very special place in my heart.

579
00:55:22,551 --> 00:55:23,611
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where I grew up.

580
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:28,195
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also where I grew into this profession, and I feel very honored.

581
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:35,147
[SPEAKER_13]: and very humbled to be leading formally in this position.

582
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:44,438
[SPEAKER_13]: I know in positions like this, there is not going to be 100% approval, let's just say.

583
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:49,441
[SPEAKER_13]: I am somebody that really values collaboration and community.

584
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,122
[SPEAKER_13]: It's why I try to show up as much as I can.

585
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:59,827
[SPEAKER_13]: The point of that is because I want to hear voices in the community, and I want there to be a partnership.

586
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:10,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I really would welcome people to reach out if there are things that they haven't seen that they would like to see or for people to just share their opinions.

587
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:24,320
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my goals is definitely to be working on communication, making sure I'm a little bit more responsive in that way is mentioned in my evaluation.

588
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:31,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that everyone knows we've done a lot of work in this past year

589
00:56:33,828 --> 00:56:43,076
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of that work is making sure that we have coherence and that we have consistency in our academics, in our operations, in our community engagement.

590
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:48,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And so continuing that work that we've started is really critical and necessary.

591
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm very excited for the work ahead.

592
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:55,326
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not standing still by any stretch of the imagination.

593
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:58,228
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still a lot, a lot of work to do.

594
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:17,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel very grateful and I appreciate your trust in me and I promise that to this body as well as to the community of Medford that I will continue to work as hard as I have been with an open heart and open mind and open ears.

595
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:19,650
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank you very much.

596
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:20,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

597
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:21,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

598
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: To our next superintendent.

599
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:44,846
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 o'clock, I mean, but because we have no new business, I think we expected to be here for quite some time, but I think people chose to email as their main point of communicating with us.

600
00:57:44,986 --> 00:57:50,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, congratulations, and no new business, no reports requested, no condolences.

601
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:58,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next regular meeting is next Monday, February 9th, 2026, here in the Alden Chambers, in addition to Zoom.

602
00:57:58,216 --> 00:57:59,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

603
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:03,889
[SPEAKER_14]: by Member Olapade, seconded by?

604
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

605
00:58:05,631 --> 00:58:06,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham, all those in favor?

606
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:07,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

607
00:58:08,273 --> 00:58:08,973
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

608
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:09,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Meeting's adjourned.

609
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:10,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everybody.
