1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:02,470
And we are live.

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:07,393
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:09,094
It is great to be back.

4
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:16,939
I'm really excited today to be talking to Molly Kivy, who I met while we were knocking on doors.

5
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,180
She's a resident of the 34th Middlesex.

6
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:21,822
And we are going to be talking about unemployment.

7
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:33,029
As I'm sure everyone watching can understand, unemployment is one of those policies that has really kept tens of thousands of families afloat.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,313
It's unbelievably important to people who have been put out of work by the pandemic.

9
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,777
But it also is in some ways sort of keeping our economy going right now.

10
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:50,020
So it's a crucially important program that

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:56,833
I think most people think it's probably running fine, but it actually has some very deep structural problems.

12
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,997
And I'm really excited to talk to Molly.

13
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:01,939
And let's go ahead and bring Molly on now.

14
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,701
Hi, Anne.

15
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:05,584
Thank you for having me.

16
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:07,666
I'm excited to talk about unemployment.

17
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,958
and kind of dive deep into the tax structure.

18
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,138
Fabulous.

19
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:18,359
First, I would love to just ask you a little bit about why this is so important to you.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,941
When I read through your proposals, I see so much work has gone into this.

21
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,522
It's really incredible and very impressive.

22
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:36,764
And I would love to hear your story about why this is so important to you and why you've decided to spend so much of your time trying to fix unemployment.

23
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:45,190
So unemployment as a social insurance, it dates back to the 1930s in response to the Great Depression.

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:54,919
This was FDR, this is one spoke of the New Deal legislation that FDR created to bring, to help the American public bounce back.

25
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:04,872
It is used as an economic stabilizer to stop the individual from entering economic crisis.

26
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:15,023
And if you stop the individual from economic crisis, then you're helping the macroeconomy not dip into an economic crisis.

27
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:38,323
to put money into the pocket of somebody who lost their job at no fault of their own, you sustain their purchase power, meaning that they're not going to experience unexpected housing issues, unexpected issues with food or with medical necessities.

28
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,084
Unfortunately, right now,

29
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,494
The tax itself and the way it's levied on employers is not equitable.

30
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:53,999
And that has created a lot of systemic issues with the program itself.

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:04,547
But before we dive into that, I'll explain just why I feel very passionate about the subject.

32
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:11,473
Personally, growing up, I grew up on a farm and that farm was not making enough to put

33
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:22,673
food on the table, so my dad got a job in construction, and cyclically or between jobs, my family would rely on unemployment to put food on the table.

34
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:32,900
So I have a personal connection with understanding how people rely on the social insurance to take care of their families.

35
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:39,044
And I understand that the benefit payments, they do not,

36
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,991
Currently they do not, they don't consider purchase power.

37
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:51,393
So I know that there are families hurting out there and not being able to pay their bills and not being able to feed themselves.

38
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:03,878
Yeah, it's an incredibly important program and it sounds like you,

39
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:11,569
because of your upbringing and the cyclical nature of certain jobs, there are jobs where that's the job, right?

40
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,951
And it's just a crucially important program.

41
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:25,254
Can you talk a little bit about what are some of the problems?

42
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:32,877
And not too much, we can dive in, but if you can kind of summarize some of the problems at first, then we'll dive in.

43
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:38,868
So there's five main problems that I would like to highlight.

44
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:49,794
There are others, but these are the main structural issues that if they are fixed, it would help the Massachusetts out a lot.

45
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:53,236
And the first one is sustaining purchase power.

46
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:55,557
Purchase power is the

47
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:11,926
It's the concept that an individual has the ability to afford food, housing, health care, and basic needs.

48
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:21,893
When FDR first developed this program, the main objective was to sustain purchase power of the individual.

49
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,795
So that is not being considered with benefit payments.

50
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:30,618
Number two is the tax structure itself.

51
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:46,330
is regressive, meaning that the small business owner is paying a higher effective tax rate than a larger business owner.

52
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,711
Yeah, when I first heard that from you, I thought that was crazy.

53
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,731
I had no idea.

54
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,271
Yeah.

55
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,432
Yeah.

56
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:57,573
It was really surprising for me to look at it, and it didn't make sense

57
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:01,691
economically, like why it's behaving like that.

58
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:08,517
But we can dive into how this legislation gets passed and how it's a problem for decades now.

59
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:18,565
Three, the way the tax rate is calculated, it is through an experience rate system.

60
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:27,212
So if an employer experiences layoffs, their tax rate goes up.

61
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:39,881
This sounds like a good idea, and like it's incentivizing stable employment throughout the economy.

62
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:45,705
But there are studies that show that it does not actually have that effect.

63
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:52,970
And that tax rate actually ends up going higher for smaller businesses.

64
00:06:56,936 --> 00:07:02,197
during economic recessions when they can least handle a tax rate hike.

65
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:09,799
The fourth issue is smaller businesses effectively pay a higher tax rate.

66
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:25,662
And this is because smaller businesses in aggregate pay their employees a smaller wage and

67
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:49,586
larger businesses can afford to pay their employees a larger wage, and because of the tax ceiling, what ends up happening, smaller businesses end up paying the same nominal amount in taxes as a larger business that has a larger proportion of salary to pay their employees.

68
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:54,070
That part I could definitely explain a little bit more later.

69
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:04,993
Is that the part where there's like a cap on the amount that, is that that part you're talking about, that there's a cap on the amount that businesses pay?

70
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:06,034
Exactly.

71
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:23,525
So the way the unemployment tax is levied, it's levied on the employer and it is a tax rate multiplied by the base, and the base of this tax is the employee's salary.

72
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:24,706
Now,

73
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:30,182
Instead of the base being the employee's full salary, it is capped at $15,000.

74
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,983
Wow.

75
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:31,544
Oh man.

76
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:32,885
Okay.

77
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,209
Okay.

78
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,210
Yeah, I got it.

79
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,271
That's the fourth one.

80
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:38,612
Right.

81
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,733
And the fifth one?

82
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:41,515
Fifth.

83
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:45,179
That would be the trust fund solvency.

84
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:55,609
Now, what that means is that there's a bucket of money that the taxes go into and that the benefit payments get paid out of.

85
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:10,397
And that bucket of money, it is over, there are certain benchmarks that the Department of Labor has set for

86
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,162
to make sure that there's enough money for normal times and recessionary periods.

87
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:31,211
Unfortunately, our representatives have decided to ignore those benchmarks and not create a solvent trust fund.

88
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,654
We run out of money, right?

89
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:36,674
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:51,509
In a report that came out from Mass Budget and Policy just yesterday, they agreed with some of my research saying that, yeah, our reps have decided to just kick the problem down the road.

91
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,350
So let me see.

92
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,871
I don't know if I can remember the five.

93
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:56,451
Let me try.

94
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,613
So one is it doesn't pay people enough to get by.

95
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:00,373
Yes.

96
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:01,074
Right?

97
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:02,134
Number two is that

98
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,253
Number two was something about small businesses paying into more than big businesses, but not the cap, right?

99
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:11,494
Right, yeah.

100
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,195
It's a regressive tax structure.

101
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,695
It's a regressive tax structure.

102
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,677
It just by its nature, even without the cap, it's a regressive tax structure.

103
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:23,580
Number three is that, I forgot this one.

104
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,662
Yeah, so the employer's tax rate increases at times of recession.

105
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:30,023
Oh, man.

106
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:31,564
Yeah.

107
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:39,579
That's crazy, that just doesn't, it punishes businesses that have to lay off workers.

108
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:50,987
Which in the end does not do, just as in punishing people for criminal offenses does not in the end lead to people behaving better, same thing with businesses.

109
00:10:51,487 --> 00:11:01,414
And surprisingly, we're the only nation, nevermind the only developed nation in the world that uses the experience rating system.

110
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:03,669
Well, that tells you a lot.

111
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:16,637
Number four is the cap, but they cap the amount that the salary that gets taxed, and then businesses that pay above that salary, that the tax is not applied.

112
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:30,726
And the fifth one, which in some senses is a giant one that affects all sorts of things, is that Massachusetts does not, we don't have money in the funds to pay for this program.

113
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,185
And I'm excited to hear you talk about it, because I only know all of this stuff from you.

114
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:45,029
But apparently, because we don't meet these standards, we now don't get interest-free loans.

115
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:50,351
We now have to pay all this money to, I presume, Wall Street banks.

116
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,952
Just to service the loans, I'm being able to pay for the unemployment.

117
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:56,393
So it's really problematic.

118
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:11,222
So the Department of Labor, they set these benchmarks to create a solvent trust fund so that the state would be prepared for tough times like this.

119
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:21,906
And to incentivize that solvency, there are two main mechanisms to incentivize a healthy program.

120
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:29,428
One is the state is eligible for interest-free loans, like you were just saying.

121
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:38,907
So we would borrow that from the federal government and that would get us through those tough times to pay out the benefit payments.

122
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:49,110
Currently, the trust fund is projected to be $4.7 billion in the red for 2021 compared to 2008,

123
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,196
the Great Recession.

124
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:05,660
We were, let me check my figure for a second.

125
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,228
We were $2 billion in the red.

126
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:20,534
So right now we are in a lot worse of a situation than we were in 2008.

127
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,156
Yeah, and before COVID,

128
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:27,528
were we already not solvent?

129
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:28,389
Correct.

130
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:34,671
We have not hit Department of Labor benchmarks for decades.

131
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:41,833
The last time, in 2011 and 2014, there were talks within our state legislature to up the wage base.

132
00:13:54,315 --> 00:14:06,642
In 2011, at that time, increasing this tax was thrown into the same conversation of increasing the minimum wage.

133
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:21,511
Special interest groups like the Boston Chamber of Commerce and AIM, they were saying that they would entertain the idea of increasing the minimum wage if

134
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,603
the reps did not increase the unemployment tax.

135
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:27,684
Wow.

136
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,965
Um, what ended up happening?

137
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:34,006
No minimum wage increase was enacted that year.

138
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:44,170
And the wage base, it was increased by $1,000, but they, um, they edited the tax tables.

139
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,612
So it netted into a tax decrease on total payroll.

140
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:52,414
Um, and 20, uh,

141
00:14:54,978 --> 00:15:05,121
The other spoke of that problem, if we don't hit these benchmarks, is there's a business tax credit that is tied into it.

142
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:09,842
This tax credit is a payroll tax credit.

143
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:16,824
It's called the FUTA tax credit, and it's worth up to $420 per employee.

144
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:29,601
when we do not pay back these loans in a timely manner, we can lose out on that credit.

145
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,124
And that could cost the American economy $1.4 billion.

146
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,907
That's the American economy, or the Massachusetts?

147
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:38,867
Massachusetts.

148
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:39,708
Ah, the Massachusetts.

149
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:39,988
Yeah.

150
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,630
So that costs Massachusetts $1.4 billion.

151
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,391
Yep.

152
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:49,795
And FUTA, just because I know we're going to be talking about FUTA, it stands for the Federal Unemployment?

153
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,277
Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

154
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:53,738
And FUTA

155
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,979
is State Unemployment Tax Act.

156
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:57,799
Great.

157
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:58,019
OK.

158
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,340
Just because I know we're probably going to mention those a few times on this.

159
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,580
Yeah.

160
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:01,820
Good.

161
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,560
Good.

162
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:13,144
Well, I don't know if we want to dive into some of these problems individually, or if you want to start talking about solutions, or maybe both.

163
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:20,886
Maybe start with one of these that you feel like can be solved and how you might solve it.

164
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:21,746
I'm going to let you lead.

165
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:21,906
OK.

166
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:44,869
I think that, so there are four main points that I believe that should be, that a proposal should be made and a bill should be passed as soon as possible.

167
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,514
But after I state those, I'll go back to which one I think that is most important.

168
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:52,956
The first one is,

169
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,661
sustaining purchase power for the individual during an economic crisis.

170
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:05,584
The second possible solution is abolishing the experience rating system.

171
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:18,810
The third one is levying this tax on both the employer and the employee, which I was surprised that I came to

172
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,820
to thinking that that may be a good solution, but we can dive into that more later.

173
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:33,328
And then four, it should be full wages.

174
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:42,777
The first solution that I think that is the most important is getting more money into people's pockets right now.

175
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:58,289
This recession, it has disproportionately affected Latina X, Black Americans, and women.

176
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:10,712
A recent report that was issued by Opportunity Insights from Harvard, they were explaining that people that are affected during a recession, they don't just bounce right back.

177
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,602
This economic devastation, this is going to last years.

178
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:27,366
And right now, these communities that have been affected by unemployment, they need help, not just right now, but in the future too.

179
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:37,190
Another item that Opportunity Insights pointed out is that when it comes to stimulus money,

180
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:57,506
Programs like the PPP loans or the stimulus checks, they didn't have a great, the American public didn't receive a benefit, a big benefit from them.

181
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:02,150
What the American economy did receive a big benefit from

182
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:13,696
was stimulus through unemployment, that extra $600 that went out to people who are unemployed, that stimulated the economy more than anything.

183
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,378
Yeah.

184
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:30,864
So what our reps could do right now is increase, oh, sorry, my video lagged a little, is increase

185
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:41,510
benefit payments to people who receive benefit payments that are below purchase power, which is $815 a week.

186
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:45,171
Can you talk a little bit about purchase power?

187
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:55,975
What does it mean, and what is the definition that makes it not working now, and how would we define it differently to make it work?

188
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:06,655
So unfortunately, this steps into another problem, the fact that our minimum wage is below purchase power.

189
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:14,220
So there are people who are living, say, above poverty line, but they are below living wage.

190
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:28,090
So say if somebody is making $30,000 at their job, and they receive unemployment, the calculation for the benefit payment

191
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:38,272
is 40% of what they make averaged at the two highest quarters of the year.

192
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:44,015
And after taxes, that ends up being 40.

193
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,077
I'm going to rewind a little.

194
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:54,541
It is 50% of what they typically make, and it ends up being 40% of their take-home pay after taxes.

195
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm recommending that anybody who makes below the threshold of being able to sustain purchase power that they receive 90% of what they typically make up until a cap of $823, which is the cap that is on the book right now.

196
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,460
Great.

197
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:30,721
That sounds like a simple change, right?

198
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:35,885
So 50% or 40% of what they're getting paid is not enough if what they're getting paid is not enough.

199
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:39,688
So we want to just increase the percentage of that that they get through unemployment.

200
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:49,796
And this solution, it still keeps, there is a thought out there that somebody needs to make less on unemployment

201
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,971
than what they usually do to incentivize the individual to go and find work.

202
00:21:55,991 --> 00:22:04,314
This idea still, it still complies with that thought.

203
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:13,656
Right, it still complies even though we're in a pandemic, we're literally like tens of millions of people have been thrown out of work and there's no way that those people can all find jobs.

204
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:15,497
Totally impossible no matter how hard they try.

205
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:27,534
You're suggesting something that would be great in normal times and absolutely necessary for what is happening to people right now.

206
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,175
Love it.

207
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:30,256
Great.

208
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,137
What's the second thing?

209
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,758
What's the second fix that you've got?

210
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:34,119
Experience rating.

211
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:43,004
Instead of punishing businesses for experiencing layoffs,

212
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,331
just make it a flat tax, just make it a flat rate for everybody.

213
00:22:50,613 --> 00:23:13,512
If us as constituents or the state reps do not feel that that is correct or okay, there are other measurements than the layoff calculation right now that are better at representing

214
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:21,511
or that are better at disincentivizing layoff.

215
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:25,432
Just right now, the experience rating, other countries don't use it.

216
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:26,553
Why are we using it?

217
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:27,293
It doesn't work.

218
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:28,473
Yeah.

219
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,994
This is something I love.

220
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:36,415
I think that should be done way more often is to say, well, what do the other, you know,

221
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:46,866
50 countries most similar to us do, and if they all do something different, then maybe we're, you know, maybe there's something wrong with the way that we're approaching it.

222
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:55,527
And it's okay that, it's okay to evolve, and it's okay that what we were doing yesterday isn't working for today.

223
00:23:55,547 --> 00:24:05,229
I think change is okay sometimes, and I think that we need to, yeah, start being okay with it, and start doing things that are

224
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,944
to make more sense for the day and age that we live in right now.

225
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:10,485
Absolutely.

226
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:27,955
Yeah, so someone has a question about, because our last Solidarity Live was about MMT, modern monetary theory, and the fact that our national government does not have the restrictions on spending, right?

227
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:28,815
It's not actually spending.

228
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:29,816
They're creating, right?

229
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:33,358
They're increasing the number when they spend, the national government spends.

230
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:35,942
You're increasing the number of dollars that exist.

231
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:45,304
And so there is no reason at all why the national government can't create a jobs program, do the Green New Deal, pay for Medicare for all.

232
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,684
All of these things are, there is no how can we pay for it.

233
00:24:48,565 --> 00:25:01,407
And so the question is, how does that relate to the Massachusetts budget and the need to have those funds in that trust fund?

234
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,973
Okay, so this is a good one.

235
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:18,684
So the way our country is, the way the laws are set, states need a balanced budget.

236
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,087
The federal government can run a deficit.

237
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,068
This is

238
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:38,757
This makes sense because the federal government needs that leverage to be able to build programs and to be able to basically invest in today with tomorrow's dollars.

239
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,400
And the federal government creates dollars, but the state governments don't.

240
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,923
So the state governments are just like you or me or a company or your city.

241
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:50,745
They can't just create dollars.

242
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:52,626
They have a budget.

243
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:55,408
And so their budgets are just as fixed as yours or mine.

244
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:01,148
So the trust fund, I'd love to hear more about that.

245
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,430
Let me think about that for a second.

246
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:14,732
And how you would fix the problems that we have at the Massachusetts trust fund that it's not solvent.

247
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:25,676
So one of the great, one of the things that is the benefit out of having a solvent trust fund

248
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:35,645
for the Unemployment Trust Fund is that those dollars, they get held by the Treasury Department.

249
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:41,508
And those dollars then get reinvested in our national debt.

250
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:55,275
So what this does, it creates, it stabilizes investing in tomorrow, or investing in today with tomorrow's money

251
00:26:55,862 --> 00:27:17,088
by, so the more money that states have in these trust funds, the more we can invest in a healthier economy right now and be able to put more dollars into the economy through legislative, through Keynesian economics.

252
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:19,009
Yep.

253
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,970
And how do we fix this trust fund problem here in Massachusetts?

254
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:24,878
We need to collect more money.

255
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:33,204
We need to tax businesses in an equitable manner.

256
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:50,057
I believe that employees, we can be taxed at a small rate to invest in this unemployment trust fund so that enough money is flowing into this bucket of money.

257
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,086
Yeah.

258
00:27:52,106 --> 00:28:06,573
And by removing the cap on salaries that are taxed, do you have an idea, a sense of how that would affect the amount of money in the trust fund?

259
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:07,874
Yes.

260
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:20,180
So right now with to make it solvent and a model

261
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:37,425
that I created, it would need to be 3% on full wages, at least 3% of full wages, so split between the employer and the employee at 1.5%.

262
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,246
That would not bring the trust fund to solvency.

263
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:44,748
That would just be enough to cover the benefit payments at 10% unemployment for a year.

264
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:57,392
So in my proposal, I'm not recommending that high of a tax rate because it's just, you can't put that burden on businesses right now.

265
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,153
And you can't put that burden on people right now.

266
00:29:00,814 --> 00:29:03,495
So right now we need the help of the federal government.

267
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:06,957
We need those loans.

268
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:15,801
And what my solution is, is a 0.5% tax rate on the employee and the employer.

269
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:29,394
So the nominal value that they're paying at the end of the year in taxes, it's not as burdensome as it could be.

270
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:31,716
So basically, it's not going to be solved this year.

271
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:32,577
It's a problem.

272
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,278
The program has changed.

273
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:35,278
Yeah.

274
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:38,320
I mean, it makes sense because we're in a huge crisis right now.

275
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:46,106
So asking to suddenly make a fund that was insolvent for decades to make it solvent during a

276
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:50,690
you know, gigantic crisis where we're doing nothing but pour funds out of it.

277
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,892
Obviously, I think that's too much to ask.

278
00:29:54,553 --> 00:30:00,138
But it sounds like removing the cap would bring in a lot more money.

279
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:00,818
Yes.

280
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:01,359
Yes.

281
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,301
Removing the cap widens the base.

282
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:11,487
And by widening a base, you can collect more revenue in an equitable manner.

283
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:25,801
The way I like to think about ceilings and caps and taxes, I like this example where, I like to use property taxes as an example, just to quantify it in my head.

284
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:34,303
So say somebody on the same street, one person has a $2 million house and one person has a million dollar house.

285
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:38,364
If the tax cap is at $500,000 of the base,

286
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:47,951
that $2 million house and that million dollar house, they're gonna be paying the same amount in tax at the end of the year.

287
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:51,412
Yeah, yeah.

288
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,493
Yeah, and you said that it's at 15,000?

289
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,774
Yeah, which is- That's insanely low.

290
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,715
It's insanely low.

291
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:09,219
Only like the very smallest companies are paying like, you know, the full, I mean, it really is- Full wages.

292
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, the full wages.

293
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:20,202
And it really makes it clear that only companies, the more you pay your employees, the less and less and less and less and less you pay.

294
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:34,449
And the companies that can afford to pay their employees more, they are, in tax theory, they are reaping more reward from those highly skilled workers.

295
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:40,732
So they should be paying an equal amount

296
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:48,955
or maybe even more in a more progressive manner because they are reaping more reward off those higher earners.

297
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:50,896
So it's very backwards.

298
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:53,577
Yeah.

299
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,238
I'm curious what sort of pushback you've had.

300
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:04,981
I know that you've been sort of talking to some folks in the State House and trying to get some interest in some of these policies.

301
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:06,601
And I don't want to

302
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:17,393
out anybody by name or anything, but I'm just curious a little bit about sort of what have people been like, oh, this is great.

303
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:19,714
Like, I'm really excited about this part of it or that part of it.

304
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:22,496
Have people just been not interested?

305
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,456
Is it too much change?

306
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:24,817
Is it too wonky?

307
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:30,761
I mean, I hope nothing's too wonky for people at the state house because that's kind of their job.

308
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:37,965
So without pronouns out there, the major pushback that I've gotten is that special interest groups

309
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:57,253
like Boston Chamber of Commerce and the, let me just make sure I'm saying their name right, Associated Industries of Massachusetts, groups like that, they will be against this because they represent larger institutions.

310
00:32:57,493 --> 00:33:07,842
And if smaller institutions are paying dues to those special interest groups, sometimes small businesses, their best interest isn't

311
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:11,643
It's not what they're lobbying for.

312
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:30,139
So the main pushback that I've had with local reps and with people representing committee groups is that if those special interest groups are not interested in that, it's dead in the water.

313
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,982
OK, so did they tell you why?

314
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:36,898
I mean, we all know this is what happens, right?

315
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:41,259
But, like, I'm a little surprised that they're, like, just saying it straight out.

316
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:47,020
Like, well, you know, if the giant corporations don't like it, then what?

317
00:33:47,040 --> 00:34:00,983
So when I ask why, they explain that they are the people that are showing up and are there when debate happens.

318
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:11,196
But it's not a full answer.

319
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:22,403
Because we have lobbying and because they're allowed to just pay people, you know, $100,000 a year to sit, you know, to show up at the, ah, I'm sorry.

320
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:26,266
I'm getting a little aggravated about my whole money in politics thing.

321
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,127
It sounds like, you know.

322
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,769
The problem is that those are the people in the room.

323
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:31,989
That is the problem.

324
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:47,444
They are the people that are emailing their reps, that are making the phone calls, that have the time and the access and the money to put research and advocate for themselves.

325
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:55,750
So their wants and needs get taken care of.

326
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:01,814
And then the people who, you know, we are the one who make up this country.

327
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:08,949
It's people, and I... I'm sorry.

328
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,290
It's a terrible way to say that.

329
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,730
Actually, it's people.

330
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:16,071
You're supposed to be representing people.

331
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:29,034
But I was very surprised that they are all very open with saying, hey, it's, you know, these special interest groups, if they're not in, this isn't going to happen.

332
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,595
I've talked with some labor unions,

333
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,680
And they have ran into the same problems.

334
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:49,509
They've given me examples of the last major legislation that was brought up about taking care of people, and it was about health insurance.

335
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,572
And they wanted health insurance taxes to be done in an equitable manner.

336
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:57,815
But on the debate floor,

337
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:15,587
Instead of it being that those taxes being levied equitably, the larger interest groups explained how nominally the larger corporations would be paying more.

338
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,249
So then it's not fair.

339
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:18,970
It's not fair to them.

340
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,854
And then it passed, and those taxes aren't done equitably either.

341
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,777
So this is a systemic problem.

342
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,811
Yeah, I'm just trying to shed light on it.

343
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,852
And I'm hopeful.

344
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:41,856
I think that COVID has given us an opportunity to learn more about how this country works.

345
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:47,879
And maybe we'll all participate a little bit more.

346
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:52,021
Speaking of participate, I'm so glad you said that, because great segue.

347
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:52,801
What can people do?

348
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,409
You have so many great ideas.

349
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:59,930
You have done so much incredible research into this.

350
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:07,993
I really encourage anybody, if you're open to it, to call you and talk to you about this, because you have all the data to back it up.

351
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:12,514
And I would love for you to just let us know, what can we do?

352
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:13,975
How can we help?

353
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:19,717
Contact, find out who your local reps are.

354
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,918
Even if you don't agree with my proposal,

355
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:28,206
or with fixing unemployment, contact your local reps and tell them your problems.

356
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:30,027
All of them.

357
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:34,288
Because businesses are telling them their problems.

358
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:37,829
So what I'm really asking is just participate.

359
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,930
Create an email, call, do whatever.

360
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:50,553
Now, if you want to get involved with social insurance, and specifically unemployment reform, I'm on Instagram and Facebook.

361
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,214
My name is Molly Kivy, message me.

362
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:14,784
If you have questions about my proposal, if you want to read it, if you have suggestions, if you want to help out, build a coalition, because right now I'm trying to build a coalition with research groups, labor unions, and I'm trying to get more special interest groups to really support something like this.

363
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:22,245
The part that's very tough is getting a grassroots campaign happening.

364
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:25,167
because we're all stressed right now.

365
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:34,309
We're in the middle of a traumatic event, and finding the time and the energy to participate is tough.

366
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:43,631
So I'm here for any questions and how you wanna, and if people wanna help, then I can guide them, yeah.

367
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:44,391
Awesome, awesome.

368
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:48,352
Do you wanna spell your name for folks so they can, and they can look you up on Instagram and Facebook?

369
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:49,473
M-O-L-L-Y.

370
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,975
And then KIVI is K-I-V-I, Kilo India, Victor India.

371
00:38:59,075 --> 00:38:59,416
Nice.

372
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:01,217
Awesome.

373
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:02,338
Great.

374
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:03,899
Is there anything else?

375
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:09,984
I mean, I think my sort of wrap up about this is, number one, unemployment is super broken.

376
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,585
I had no idea.

377
00:39:11,605 --> 00:39:12,006
It is.

378
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:18,634
And I'm sure that the budgetary problems are affecting other parts of our state budget, right?

379
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:24,097
We're spending, what did you say, like $60 million a year just on interest.

380
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:27,479
That's $60 million a year that we cannot spend on other things.

381
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:34,963
Yeah, projected for 2021, that interest will be levied on the business owner.

382
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:38,845
And right, the businesses are strapped right now.

383
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:42,467
We're losing businesses one out of every four.

384
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,040
right now.

385
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,241
Okay, so it's actually, it is a separate thing.

386
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:49,501
It's not going to affect the rest of the state budget, but it is going to be levied on business owners.

387
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:54,603
So this is going to hurt the economy and hurt small businesses a lot more than large businesses.

388
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:57,983
No, it's the worst time.

389
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:01,464
Yeah, but number one, the unemployment is deeply broken.

390
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:12,267
Number two, that our legislature, they're just saying it straight out, like special interest rule,

391
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,642
And if you can't get them on board, tough.

392
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:15,422
Yep.

393
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,663
Ah, drives you crazy.

394
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,484
Yeah.

395
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:31,448
It's been eye opening, but I think it's, I love your idea that people just, just like, just open up your email or pick up the phone, call your state rep, tell them everything.

396
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:41,212
This is, this is what, we're all part of a community and there, if, if your neighbor is having an issue,

397
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:49,320
It's likely that you're probably experiencing a similar issue.

398
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,325
We all don't live in a vacuum, but our reps, they don't know of these problems unless we communicate with them.

399
00:40:57,826 --> 00:41:04,991
We can communicate with each other too and really start to dig into what we need to live in a more equitable society.

400
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:07,253
Wonderful.

401
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:08,934
Fantastic.

402
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:10,155
Any last words?

403
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:11,316
Anything else you want to

404
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,914
get out before we finish up?

405
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:24,699
I guess I just want to say I hope that everybody's taking care of themselves and their family to the best of their ability right now.

406
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,480
It's not a good situation.

407
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:30,682
We all have a responsibility to ourselves and to each other.

408
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:36,685
And it's really tough because I know that we're all lacking all the resources that we need.

409
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,846
So I guess my heart goes out to everybody.

410
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:41,167
That's all.

411
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:42,943
Yeah.

412
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:43,883
Always a pleasure.

413
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:44,824
Likewise.

414
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:45,864
Thanks so much for coming on.

415
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:47,464
I love the work that you're doing.

416
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,424
Thank you.

417
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:49,544
OK.

418
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:51,545
Bye.

419
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:07,227
Frank, are we off the air?

420
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:07,647
Not yet.

421
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:09,768
You're muted.

422
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:10,568
Yeah, OK.
