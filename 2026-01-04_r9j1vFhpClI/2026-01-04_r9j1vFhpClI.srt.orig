1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,358
[SPEAKER_19]: If I can have everyone's attention, please.

2
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,139
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like everyone to get seated.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,000
[SPEAKER_19]: We're about to start soon.

4
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:53,661
Trust me, take it off while you can, Chris.

5
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:14,706
[SPEAKER_05]: 250 years ago, I helped organize a quick-on in this world.

6
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:26,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that as a mother of a Boston teapot and a Bucket Hill, I served a patient conflict, your blessing, for the wounded patriots.

7
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also served General Washington.

8
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,572
Indeed, I did.

9
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband, John, was alive with our nine children.

10
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: He lived near the Pratt Bridge.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,122
[SPEAKER_05]: John worked at the Hall of Silver, making fine leather clothes.

12
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:07,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, he moved to a football house on Gold Road, Texas.

13
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:16,033
[SPEAKER_05]: later named my honor as Colton Street.

14
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:23,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I trust you know that, sir?

15
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:33,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, I now reside, or I am at the same, I now reside, or I am at the same street there as I was.

16
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has reached me that,

17
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:42,864
[SPEAKER_05]: a statue of himself, himself, of a student of the FBI, let him see it all, this brief.

18
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep your attention to the FBI.

19
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:21,440
[SPEAKER_19]: I am glad that you still have faith in Washington and in Dr. King.

20
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

21
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

22
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,901
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could have everyone please rise so I can admit the school committee.

23
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:33,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford Police Honor Guard.

24
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

25
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:11,216
That was the post.

26
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,337
That's the interface.

27
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:17,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace out.

28
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you to the Metro Police Honor Guard.

29
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,373
[SPEAKER_19]: At this time, we'd like to admit the school committee.

30
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to start with Jenny R. Graham.

31
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Michael Mastrobone.

32
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Aaron J. Olopade.

33
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:20,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Jessica Parks.

34
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Erica L. Reinfeld.

35
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,719
[SPEAKER_19]: And Paul R. Russo.

36
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:51,280
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could have everyone please remain standing so I can admit the members of city council.

37
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,341
[SPEAKER_19]: First, Back Bears.

38
00:05:54,361 --> 00:06:11,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Emily Nazaro.

39
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:20,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt Lemming.

40
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Liz Mullane.

41
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:38,928
[SPEAKER_19]: George Scappelli.

42
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,370
[SPEAKER_19]: And Justin Tseng.

43
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:02,489
[SPEAKER_19]: And please help me in welcoming Honorable Mayor of the City of Medford, Brianna Longo Kern.

44
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,877
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could have everyone please take a seat.

45
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,709
[SPEAKER_19]: So my name is Chris Zuma.

46
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,193
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the recovery coach here for the city of Medford.

47
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,959
[SPEAKER_19]: And I am also the guy who's going to be making sure that things go from one step to the other through this process.

48
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to tell you a little bit about me really quickly, and I'll make it brief.

49
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm the recovery coach for the city of Medford.

50
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:42,910
[SPEAKER_19]: And for anybody who doesn't know what a recovery coach is, I help people when they're addicted.

51
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,432
[SPEAKER_19]: For this job, it requires lived experience.

52
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,094
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am in recovery myself.

53
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:54,217
[SPEAKER_19]: And today, I just want to share for where I've been and where I'm at.

54
00:07:54,977 --> 00:08:03,559
[SPEAKER_19]: And when people watch this today and they see somebody that they can relate to, someone who's dealing with substance use disorder, I mean, for me, this is making it.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,301
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there was a time when I couldn't get out of bed.

56
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,221
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't function normally.

57
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:12,662
[SPEAKER_19]: And here I am in front of all of you fine people.

58
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:16,223
[SPEAKER_19]: And what an honor it is that was bestowed upon me.

59
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And I am so grateful to be here.

60
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:21,425
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm so honored, beyond honored to be here.

61
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,606
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just a little bit about my backstory.

62
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:30,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, in terms of accomplishments that I've made, you see it right here.

63
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,471
[SPEAKER_19]: This is one of my greatest accomplishments.

64
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:39,056
[SPEAKER_19]: I never thought that people that I look up to and admire would welcome me in, in the way that people have.

65
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's an amazing thing.

66
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:45,040
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm so grateful to be here.

67
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,202
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna make sure that that's said over and over again.

68
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,894
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you, when I came to Medford, I was nervous.

69
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,854
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not a guy that normally gets nervous.

70
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,875
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually love being in front of crowds.

71
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you guys can tell by that.

72
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:11,076
[SPEAKER_19]: But I was nervous because I'm embarking on a new adventure.

73
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:12,557
[SPEAKER_19]: There's new people I have to meet.

74
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:13,537
[SPEAKER_19]: There's new people.

75
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:16,378
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how they're going to feel about me, if they're going to welcome me in.

76
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:22,360
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have to say, the city of Medford and everybody in it has been exceptional.

77
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,404
[SPEAKER_19]: From day one, I have been made to feel as though I belonged here and I should have been here years ago.

78
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:31,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody was welcoming.

79
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody was loving, supportive.

80
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,566
[SPEAKER_19]: How can we help?

81
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:35,666
[SPEAKER_19]: What can we do to help?

82
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,728
[SPEAKER_19]: It just goes to show what a fantastic city Medford is.

83
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:52,801
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of the elected officials, I can't speak highly enough about everybody in this room right now.

84
00:09:55,005 --> 00:10:23,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously coming in here Again, like I said, you know you're in front of people that at one point in my life I would dare to be in front of because they're probably going to try to throw me in jail but today I'm here and I'm welcomed in and first time I came in I remember I met our mayor and Fantastic the way I was welcomed in the ability to

85
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,493
[SPEAKER_19]: use her position to shed light on recovery and what we bring to the table.

86
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:33,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Super involved in everything.

87
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:42,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Being welcomed to city council to share the Board of Health, the Prevention and Outreach Department.

88
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,662
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I can't stress enough how welcoming everybody has been.

89
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,623
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's amazing to be here.

90
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,944
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing to see everybody here.

91
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:54,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

92
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Please let this be all about me.

93
00:10:59,543 --> 00:10:59,763
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

94
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:05,647
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could have everybody please stand for your leaders and the Pledge of Allegiance led by the Medford Scouts.

95
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:33,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

96
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,007
[SPEAKER_19]: You all may be seated.

97
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:51,692
[SPEAKER_19]: At this time, I'd like to welcome up Rabbi Jessica Dallara from Temple Shalom to lead an invocation.

98
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:09,228
[SPEAKER_15]: The greatest sages of the Talmud never worked alone.

99
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,384
[SPEAKER_15]: They operated in chavruta, an Aramaic which is chaver, meaning friend or peer.

100
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:30,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the best chavruta, a study partner, this is a Jewish tradition that continues to this day, a study partner that you learn with on a regular basis, is not someone who always agrees with you on every issue.

101
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:38,248
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, the best chavruta is the one who shows you when you're wrong, who tells you when you've got the wrong end of the stick.

102
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:56,845
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a line from Mishlei, from Proverbs, that says, barzel b'barzel yachad, iron sharpens iron, and this is the founding principle of learning and seeing the world through the lens of chavruta, principled partnership and opposition.

103
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:07,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Two of the most famous rabbis of the Mishnaic period, the Talmud, were named Shammai and Hillel,

104
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,657
[SPEAKER_15]: If you've heard of either of them, you've probably heard of Hillel and not Shammai, because Hillel takes precedence, generally.

105
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:24,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Tractate Erevin of the Talmud says that for three years, Beit Shammai, the students in the tradition of Shammai, and Beit Hillel,

106
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:29,508
[SPEAKER_15]: the students learning in the tradition of Rabbi Hillel, pressed their arguments.

107
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:36,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, a bat kol, a divine voice, proclaimed, Elu ve'elu divrei elohim chayim.

108
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,912
[SPEAKER_15]: These and those are the words of the living God.

109
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,734
[SPEAKER_15]: However, the ruling is in accordance with Hillel.

110
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:51,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, why does Hillel get this privilege of taking precedence?

111
00:13:51,938 --> 00:14:06,403
[SPEAKER_15]: He's the one who ruled, many of you may be familiar with the holiday of Hanukkah, that the number of candles should go up from day to day so that the light increases in the world over the course of the day, whereas Shammai went the other way, starting with eight and counting down.

112
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:10,024
[SPEAKER_15]: The argument being, we always go up in holiness.

113
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,897
[SPEAKER_15]: So why are the words of Hillel prioritized?

114
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:21,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the students of Hillel were civil and forbearing with each other and with their opponents.

115
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Only their own statements, but those of Shammai as well.

116
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:46,796
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a tradition that's carried on in Judaism, a multivocal tradition, where the reason the Talmud is so long, it's something almost 3,000 pages long, is because all of the arguments for and against, no matter which ultimately took effect, are recorded, are studied, are thought about, and sharpened.

117
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Iron sharpens iron.

118
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if you don't have the right chavruta, the one who will tell you,

119
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,549
[SPEAKER_15]: when you're off base.

120
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,191
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be literally fatal.

121
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,636
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a story also in the Talmud about Rabbi Yochanan and his chavruta Resh Lakish.

122
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:15,625
[SPEAKER_15]: To spare a long story short, they had a falling out, a careless remark, wounded Resh Lakish, his lifelong chavruta, so badly

123
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:24,969
[SPEAKER_15]: that they fell out, and despite the pleading of Rabbi Yochanan, who was Reish Lakish's wife, caught in the middle of this, they never reconciled.

124
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Reish Lakish got sick and died, and Rabbi Yochanan had to find a new chavruta who was not satisfactory.

125
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:42,136
[SPEAKER_15]: In every matter, Rabbi Yochanan would speak, and Rabbi Eleazar ben Padat, that's his new chavruta, would say to him, here is a teaching that supports your opinion.

126
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:56,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Rabbi Yochanan cried out, with Rish Lakish, he would raise 24 difficulties against me, and I would answer him with 24 answers, and the ruling itself would become strengthened.

127
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:07,614
[SPEAKER_15]: So my wish for our city council, for our school committee, for our mayor, for our city is that we honor multivocality.

128
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:22,160
[SPEAKER_15]: We are blessed to live in a city of people from many different kinds of backgrounds and many different kinds of opinions that we may always seek out the voices of everyone agree with us already and those who do not agree.

129
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:36,649
[SPEAKER_15]: who may never agree, and finding value in the exercise, finding value in the iron that sharpens iron of coming together civilly and with forbearance and teaching each other.

130
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:45,514
[SPEAKER_15]: May we all be the chavruta for each other, the one who helps us sharpen our minds and improve our outcomes.

131
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:46,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

132
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:59,628
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to introduce the Poet Laureate, Max Hall.

133
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for having me.

134
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:19,497
[SPEAKER_17]: My poem is called Begin, dedicated to the inauguration.

135
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:22,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

136
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Begin with the new year.

137
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:36,074
[SPEAKER_17]: matching your mind to the calendar, aligning your readiness and intention, asking for ennobling work in a world that needs it.

138
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:42,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Begin with what is needed from you and a will that wants resistance.

139
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:48,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Muscle cannot grow without tearing, nor legacy blossom in shade.

140
00:17:49,912 --> 00:18:00,036
[SPEAKER_17]: We live now in interesting times where we have normalized fearing the headlines, fearing for neighbors whose diverse beauty creates our city.

141
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:12,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Begin with yourself, all the love and luck that brought you where you find yourself today, remembering the power one voice wields raised in the service of others.

142
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:24,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Begin in this room with an oath and an honored promise for the days ahead when you're confident and your ideals emerge as you shape the moment.

143
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:29,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Begin to see the years ahead as a chance at greatness.

144
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:37,623
[SPEAKER_17]: What else would this fair city and our miraculous world deserve and be destined for?

145
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:52,468
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to introduce Carmen Catherine Clark to give remarks, please.

146
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:58,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

147
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

148
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:01,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy New Year.

149
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,712
[SPEAKER_14]: And Chris, thank you for starting us off with gratitude and for the rabbi for inspiring words.

150
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:17,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to make a new note to myself to never follow the poet laureate of Medford.

151
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:17,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

152
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Max, for that.

153
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:32,774
[SPEAKER_14]: To be here with the citizens of Medford and all of you, friends, families, supporters, and also with our state delegation, Representative DenBarber and our state senator, Pat Jalen.

154
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,336
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for joining us.

155
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:48,623
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am truly pleased to be here with you, Madam Mayor, our city councilors, and school committee members.

156
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:56,149
[SPEAKER_14]: As a veteran of the Melrose School Committee, I have a special place in my heart for school committee members.

157
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I still think the toughest job in politics.

158
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are grateful to all of you.

159
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:10,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And congratulations to each and every one of you for the city has placed in you.

160
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:16,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for stepping up to serve the people of Medford.

161
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Public service is alive and well in this city, in the Commonwealth, and in our country.

162
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:31,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And that people of integrity and compassion and love for their neighbor are still

163
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:38,442
[SPEAKER_14]: choosing to devote their time and energy to a better future.

164
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:49,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And despite everything we're seeing on the national stage, we have leaders who still believe that the rule of law isn't a suggestion.

165
00:20:50,625 --> 00:21:02,348
[SPEAKER_14]: A community that believes quality public education is the right of every child, that climate change is real, that health care and child care

166
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,824
[SPEAKER_14]: and food are more important than billionaires.

167
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:32,857
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have leaders like Mayor Lungo Kern, who has given decades of service to this community, who guided us through a pandemic, and who is now guiding through Medford through all the chaos that we see coming down from Washington.

168
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:40,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are in a chapter of our history where it seems sometimes that the worst voices are the loudest.

169
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:53,225
[SPEAKER_14]: But today is a reminder and a reaffirmation that we fight back by building a strong community and a strong city here in Medford.

170
00:21:53,865 --> 00:22:02,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And while the administration dismantles the Department of Education, we will continue to do right by our children and invest in Medford schools.

171
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:14,826
[SPEAKER_14]: While our immigrant neighbors are terrorized, we will continue to stand with them.

172
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:26,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And while our families struggle to get by, we will prove what we know to be true, that in the end, greed and cruelty lose.

173
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:30,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the end, it is justice that endures.

174
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am so grateful to be your partner in governing.

175
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:38,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank you for to stand up and put your name on the ballot.

176
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:41,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank you for choosing to serve.

177
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:47,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thank you for choosing to fight for a future that is of all our children.

178
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:50,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations again, and thank you for having me.

179
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,269
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's OK, I'm going to go a little off script for a second.

180
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Congresswoman, you mentioned gratitude.

181
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Gratitude, in my opinion, is the cheat code to a happy life.

182
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:14,677
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I mean by that is if we can turn our thoughts into positive thinking, gratitude just happens to come.

183
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:19,400
[SPEAKER_19]: And I tell everybody, if we can focus on the positive, we're going to find the positive.

184
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Because our thoughts become our beliefs.

185
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,463
[SPEAKER_19]: Our beliefs become our behaviors.

186
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Our behaviors become our habits.

187
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:31,206
[SPEAKER_19]: become our character, and our character determines our destiny.

188
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:36,568
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we can start our day with a little bit of gratitude, there's a positive outlook right around the corner.

189
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,792
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to introduce City Council Member Zach Bares to give remarks, please.

190
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you weren't expecting to hear from me and add yet another speech to our program, so I promise I'll try to be brief.

191
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:12,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the mayor for accepting my request to make sure that the city council was represented today.

192
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:22,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everyone who's spoken so far for bringing light into this space in an hour that I think many of us feel has been dark, especially the last couple of days.

193
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all of you for being here and joining us.

194
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:33,698
[SPEAKER_00]: We gather in these chambers once again at the start of this new year, filled with new possibilities for our beloved city.

195
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:42,942
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent months, I've been reflecting on how much we all share, our pride in Medford, and how meaningful it is that we've each chosen to build our lives and our futures here.

196
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:48,236
[SPEAKER_00]: our desire for a city government of excellence and lives up to that expectation.

197
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:57,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Government that's not just a safety net, but a launching pad for us to do great things, both big and small, to make life better for all of us who call Medford home.

198
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:08,861
[SPEAKER_00]: These past few years, I've heard from too many people who say they've lost faith, who feel that we stand too far apart, who feel alienated from their neighbors,

199
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:15,805
[SPEAKER_00]: who aren't sure that we can come together and be excellent and do great things if we can't trust.

200
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:23,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I stand here today with hope for renewal, hope for reconnection, hope that we can restore faith in our city and our council.

201
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:37,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to each of us, especially our elected leaders, to reflect and act on the responsibility we share to make city government a place where we each have faith that by working together, our hopes can be made real.

202
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to announce that the city council will begin holding regular neighborhood ward meetings to hear directly from residents.

203
00:25:50,263 --> 00:26:02,468
[SPEAKER_00]: This expands on the great work that Anna, Emily, Matt, and Justin did last term on the resident services and public engagement committee by establishing our city council listening sessions and council newsletter and so much more.

204
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:11,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm even more excited to announce that George and I will work in partnership on that effort along with the entire council and our newest colleague, councilor Liz Mullane.

205
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:31,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I will work my hardest to center compassion for our community at the heart of my work, because for each other, and at the very least, hear each other out with an open heart, even across our biggest differences and disagreements.

206
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:41,862
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the foundation of what it means to be proud of our city, of what allows us to strive for excellence, of how we work to restore faith in our city and in each other.

207
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:51,287
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great projects to accomplish for Medford over these next two years, especially our new Medford High School that we're about to hear about from member Graham.

208
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:54,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And we must come together to achieve them.

209
00:26:55,371 --> 00:27:00,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I will bring my deepest well of compassion and dedication to seeing those accomplishments become reality.

210
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And I welcome every neighbor to walk that path together.

211
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:03,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

212
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:16,921
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to welcome school committee member Jenny Graham to give an update on Medford High School.

213
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:31,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone.

214
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:39,617
[SPEAKER_01]: for asking me to speak today, and for all the work that we've done together for the last six years.

215
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:46,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like the longest and shortest six years of my life, as many of you know.

216
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:54,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really set out to be a politician, and I still don't think that quite fits what I would call myself, but I'll talk a little bit about the high school.

217
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:02,253
[SPEAKER_01]: In my first campaign, my palm card said, develop a comprehensive and holistic plan to address the future of each of our school buildings.

218
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:06,374
[SPEAKER_01]: See the first go around, you walk some fine lines because you want to be elected.

219
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:09,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I am a politician after all.

220
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:15,437
[SPEAKER_01]: In that first year, I also said something like, work for increased and fair funding for our schools.

221
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I'd be more direct.

222
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,539
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a new Medford High School, and our schools are underfunded and need more.

223
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my six years ago.

224
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:39,004
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've learned along the way is people appreciate that directness, and people appreciate people who will stand up and say, there's something wrong, and we have to fix it.

225
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:43,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott and I have lived here for 10 years, and we are new by some standards.

226
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been welcomed by many people who have been here much, much longer than us.

227
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:53,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And when our kids were very young, we had to go to Medford High School, and it was stunning.

228
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I stepped back in time.

229
00:28:57,062 --> 00:29:02,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I stepped further back in time than even my high school, and I graduated in 1995.

230
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:07,972
[SPEAKER_01]: My high school felt more modern in my memory than what I was looking at in Medford High School.

231
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:14,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually gave me pause to say, is this really the place for us for the long term?

232
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:21,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we put our kids in school and we got to know our neighbors and we're like, yes, this is the place for us.

233
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:26,618
[SPEAKER_01]: But wow, high school still looked like a relic.

234
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:29,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept hoping that somebody

235
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,665
[SPEAKER_01]: would do something to fix it.

236
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:34,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast forward, here we are.

237
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, I'm one of the somebodies who would do something.

238
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:42,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super excited because we're finally getting to do something.

239
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:48,541
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, the list of volunteers and the somebodies who are going to do something is in the hundreds at this point.

240
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:51,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming a very long spreadsheet that will get longer as we go.

241
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:56,427
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2022, we submitted a bid to the MSBA and we were finalists.

242
00:29:57,187 --> 00:30:04,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of record inflation and the number of programs that were competing for a limited amount of money, we did not proceed, we did not go forward.

243
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,711
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2023, we did it again and we got in.

244
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yes, as the kids say, let's go.

245
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:16,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we learned that this process is a process.

246
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:21,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And the MSBA takes its role as stewards of taxpayer dollars really seriously.

247
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:30,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've worked alongside them through the process, which is tedious at times, but we push, and I'm pushy, and we want to move fast because that's what our kids deserve.

248
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:41,733
[SPEAKER_01]: As the chair, we have found a bunch of equally pushy people willing to push through these initial phases just as fast as we can because this community values action.

249
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,276
[SPEAKER_01]: In this instance, though, paperwork comes first.

250
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:48,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we've been up to for the last two years and what feels like an eternity.

251
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thrilled, though, to say that we're on the paperwork phase really rapidly.

252
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,388
[SPEAKER_01]: We've hired a project management company and an architect.

253
00:30:56,968 --> 00:31:08,815
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on board and they're working hard and fast to explore the site, to understand, to talk to our educators, hundreds of them, and ask our educators to tell us what we want to do in this new building.

254
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:18,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on all the nation, the architects will be presenting initial concepts this month to our building committee, which will be held, I believe, on January 14th.

255
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,061
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Wednesday.

256
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:23,183
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been told is that those will be like

257
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:28,275
[SPEAKER_01]: circles and shapes of where things might be on the property.

258
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:33,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they want us to understand that this is a very beginning step.

259
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll have initial cost estimates in February.

260
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:41,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And by June, we will have a design that will move forward.

261
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:46,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So although the paperwork seems to have taken an eternity, we're ready to move really quickly.

262
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out my own newsletter a couple of days ago that outlined some of these important steps in some more detail over the course of the next three months in particular.

263
00:31:55,727 --> 00:32:04,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do tune into those opportunities to participate and provide input because this is a transformative that should have something for literally everyone in this city.

264
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:12,431
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes enhancing education for our students, making our vocational student services more available to the community and our seniors at large.

265
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:21,535
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving the pool, increasing the amount of field space that's available to our community sports teams, and creating a theater space that properly houses the arts we're so proud of.

266
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:27,278
[SPEAKER_01]: To my fellow elected officials being inducted today, welcome to the project.

267
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:29,499
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nowhere to hide.

268
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And this project is going to take all of us.

269
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking for your help.

270
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:45,342
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that we hear from all corners of our community and that we work together, despite how we may disagree, to bring this project to fruition.

271
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:53,024
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work together to maximize our state reimbursement for the project and to create revenue streams that alleviate the project's cost for our residents.

272
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:58,266
[SPEAKER_01]: A state grant to pay for half of the total cost is a good start, but we can do more.

273
00:32:58,646 --> 00:32:59,807
[SPEAKER_01]: This project is for Medford.

274
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,088
[SPEAKER_01]: and the road ahead will depend on all of us.

275
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Since this is my fourth inauguration, I'll be direct.

276
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:12,633
[SPEAKER_01]: In the spring of 2027, we will need to work together to pass a debt exclusion to pay for our share of the high school project possible.

277
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:13,813
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be us.

278
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:18,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be calling on each of you to participate at every step and make sure that we get this done.

279
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:27,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also super excited to announce that we've secured three MSBA grants to replace our roof and HVAC systems at the Roberts, the Missittuck, and the Brooks.

280
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the McGlynn and the Andrews, these systems are old.

281
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,785
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at the end of their life and they require replacement.

282
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:39,069
[SPEAKER_01]: These grants will pay for more than half of each project.

283
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a few short years, we'll have modernized systems and a new high school.

284
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:59,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we can finally stop talking about the internet at Medford High, which I know would be a welcome change to the educators and the students who spend a lot of time there.

285
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:09,790
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those listening here in person, online, or later, if you'd like to watch public access television, please reach out any time.

286
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:13,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my role as an elected officiator seriously, and I care what's on your mind.

287
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:16,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this together, because for sure.

288
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:18,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

289
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:20,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way forward.

290
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

291
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:42,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to say, you know how they say that when you get married, if it rains, that's supposed to be good luck?

292
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:47,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if you have an inauguration two times in a row and it snows, what does that mean?

293
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Something's telling me we made the right choice, so fantastic.

294
00:34:54,459 --> 00:35:02,562
[SPEAKER_19]: At this time, I'd like to welcome up Bailey Kern to deliver the oath of office to Honorable Mayor Brianna Lunga.

295
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,931
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to say, you see that?

296
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:21,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Class.

297
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:30,466
[SPEAKER_16]: I, state your name.

298
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I, Brianna Lungo Kern.

299
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:39,415
[SPEAKER_16]: do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as Mayor of the City of Medford.

300
00:35:48,418 --> 00:36:00,089
[SPEAKER_16]: according to the best of my ability, and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.

301
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, great job, great job.

302
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:34,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Congresswoman Clark, our state delegation, city council, school committee, my mother and father.

303
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:41,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning and thank you for coming to the 2026 Medford inauguration.

304
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,501
[SPEAKER_12]: will be my state of the city too, so bear with me.

305
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:48,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to get a lot in, and it's not everything.

306
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:53,527
[SPEAKER_12]: But I hope you've enjoyed our program so far this morning as much as I have.

307
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:58,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to Chris Sumer, our recovery coach, for bringing such energy to the hosting duties.

308
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to our newest poet laureate, Max Heinig, for his inspiring words, and Rabbi Jessica.

309
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:13,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Congresswoman Clark for sharing your perspectives and all that you do for us and the state, and everyone who's making this ceremony possible.

310
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:27,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the team who planned this event, led by our Community Relations Director, Lisa Coliani, and Director of Communications, Steve Smerdy, and my Chief of Staff, who both are here, who helped me write this speech.

311
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:40,159
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the tireless work of our department heads, city staff, and volunteers who have continued to do so many amazing things despite the challenges that emerge from running a city.

312
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:47,354
[SPEAKER_12]: The people who work here are some of the brightest and most dedicated people I've had the pleasure of working with.

313
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:53,515
[SPEAKER_12]: So to everyone who works in this building and for the city as a whole, thank you for making Medford such a special place.

314
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:59,396
[SPEAKER_12]: What makes Medford so special can also make it challenging at times for us electeds and us managers.

315
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:07,378
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all passionate about our community, making it more sustainable, making it more affordable and making it more resilient for our future.

316
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:09,418
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are not perfect.

317
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Public service is not for the thin.

318
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,021
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard and it's grueling and it takes a toll.

319
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:24,969
[SPEAKER_12]: But doing the hard work and making the hard decisions that you hope are the best decisions, and it's something we never take for granted.

320
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,733
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a privilege in doing something hard and taking the criticism.

321
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:36,119
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a privilege in adjusting your look, listening to other voices and pivoting your view based on new information.

322
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,671
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a privilege in being tasked with guiding a community.

323
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:46,332
[SPEAKER_12]: For those getting inaugurated for another term, I know you share this with me.

324
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:52,454
[SPEAKER_12]: You wouldn't go the process of governing and campaigning again without having a deep desire.

325
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:59,595
[SPEAKER_12]: To those of you here for the first time, please cherish this moment and realize what is being bestowed upon you as an elected leader.

326
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:01,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

327
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:14,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy this day, cherish the road that brought you to this point, and never lose sight of the ultimate goal, serving all of the people of Medford with pride, purpose, and professionalism.

328
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:21,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to continue the relationships with those reelected and forge new partnerships with those for the first time.

329
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:29,207
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of hard work to do, but I have faith in this group, and I look forward to moving Medford forward together with you all.

330
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:36,311
[SPEAKER_12]: For more than four decades, Medford has been governed by a city charter that no longer reflected who we are.

331
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:40,483
[SPEAKER_12]: how we operate as a modern growing community.

332
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:48,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Written 40 years ago, our charter had become increasingly out of step with the needs of residents, city staff, and elected officials alike.

333
00:39:49,188 --> 00:40:00,955
[SPEAKER_12]: As early as 2016, when I took my first vote as a city councilor to review the charter, I believe strongly that Medford deserved a governing document that was transparent, representative, and built for the future.

334
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:19,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, together, our residents, our city council, our school committee, our state delegation, the Collins Center, myself, and most importantly, the Charter Task Force, advanced a charter that modernizes Medford's governance while respecting our values and traditions.

335
00:40:20,515 --> 00:40:28,157
[SPEAKER_12]: This included changes to council representation, mayoral term limits and lengths, and the overall structure of city government.

336
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:36,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much to the voters for recognizing the need to revamp the charter and sharing in our vision for a document that better serves our community.

337
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:47,531
[SPEAKER_12]: As we reflect on the progress we've made together, few conversations about the future of our city are as important as the work underway to update Medford zoning.

338
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:56,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoning shapes not just what we build, but how we live, how our corridors grow and how our community adapts to opportunities and challenges.

339
00:40:57,675 --> 00:41:02,296
[SPEAKER_12]: This comprehensive review is essential to guiding Medford into the next decade and beyond.

340
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:06,677
[SPEAKER_12]: That said, the journey has not been without its challenges.

341
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:14,978
[SPEAKER_12]: The speed and scope were outpacing the capacity of our residents and staff, and we needed to refocus our efforts on better communication and public trust.

342
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the Medford City Council for collaborating with me on a path forward that puts our community first in this process.

343
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:38,915
[SPEAKER_12]: We are extending our contract with the Innis Land Group to continue work through May 2026 on critical areas, including Medford Square, Tufts Institution, and Boston Avenue, while clearing the way for a broader request for proposals to be put out in March of 2026.

344
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:46,822
[SPEAKER_12]: As with all the work we do, we remain committed to open and transparent communication with the public.

345
00:41:47,662 --> 00:41:54,667
[SPEAKER_12]: We know our responsibility on all issues, including rezoning, is to lead with honesty, accountability, and accountability no matter what.

346
00:41:57,169 --> 00:42:01,592
[SPEAKER_12]: After years of careful planning, we have taken a major step towards revitalizing Medford Square.

347
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:12,440
[SPEAKER_12]: The city has selected Transcom Rail Estate as our partner in transforming three underutilized city-owned parcels behind City Hall into a vibrant mixed-use destination.

348
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:20,957
[SPEAKER_12]: This project will create a true village square atmosphere and ensure ample parking for our seniors and patrons of the Chevalier Theater.

349
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:25,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Transom's proposal reflects the values we share as a city.

350
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:37,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It includes both market rate and affordable housing anchored by 13,500 square foot grocery store across from our senior center and designed with pedestrian access and safety at the center.

351
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:42,611
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a vision that aligns with the comprehensive plan and advances the goals laid out in our RFP.

352
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:47,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Square that is walkable, welcoming, and filled with opportunity.

353
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:53,537
[SPEAKER_12]: As we activate the square, we are reconnecting our city to one of the greatest natural assets.

354
00:42:53,757 --> 00:43:03,658
[SPEAKER_12]: This past summer, the Clippership Connector opened, linking more than 10 miles of continuous waterfront greenways and inviting residents and visitors of Medford in a new way.

355
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:07,199
[SPEAKER_12]: We are already seeing the results of this renewed energy.

356
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:12,860
[SPEAKER_12]: The opening of the Great American Beer Hall has created a new regional strengthening in our commercial tax base,

357
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,093
[SPEAKER_12]: and brought new life to Mystic Avenue.

358
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:20,215
[SPEAKER_12]: We finally have a coffee shop in Medford Square and another new one in West Medford.

359
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:27,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet as we grow, we remain aware of the challenges those successes can bring, namely as it relates to affordable housing.

360
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:32,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford is confronting a housing crisis that is shared across the region and the nation.

361
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:37,640
[SPEAKER_12]: We are meeting it head on with a comprehensive approach that includes new funding tools,

362
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:43,520
[SPEAKER_12]: zoning reform, work from our affordable housing trust, and stronger development partnerships.

363
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:58,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Through firm negotiations, we secured tangible community benefits from our two 40B projects, safer streets, better transit access, more open space, and more affordable homes prioritized for Medford residents.

364
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:03,767
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thrilled to see that both of these projects have shovels in the ground and are on their way to being built.

365
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:09,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Those two projects alone will bring in 161 affordable units to Medford.

366
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are ensuring that no one is left behind.

367
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Our commitment to veterans is unwavering.

368
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,139
[SPEAKER_12]: To many veterans facing housing instability,

369
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:29,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Through a meaningful partnership with our office, our city, the Veterans Service Office, American Post Legion 45, Suffolk Construction, we are taking a critical step.

370
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:41,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Together we are working to transform the American Legion site at 321 Winthrop Street into transitional housing that will provide veterans with stability and a clear path forward towards permanent housing.

371
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:45,249
[SPEAKER_12]: This effort reflects the best of Medford.

372
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:54,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Suffolk Construction has stepped up to fund a full feasibility study for the project and committed an additional $15,000 in facility upgrades.

373
00:44:55,034 --> 00:45:01,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Through a community fund grant, the city is investing alongside them to ensure this project moves forward with care and intention.

374
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:07,141
[SPEAKER_12]: That is what true public-private partnership looks like, shared responsibility, shared purpose, and shared impact.

375
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:11,887
[SPEAKER_12]: As our city grows, so does activity in our neighborhoods.

376
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:19,412
[SPEAKER_12]: New residential and commercial projects bring new energy, new foot traffic, and inevitably more vehicles on our streets.

377
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:25,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Growing demands that we plan not just for today, but for how people move safely and efficiently through Medford tomorrow.

378
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:32,021
[SPEAKER_12]: That is why we are making deliberate investments to improve traffic flow and create safer streets across our community.

379
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:43,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Through our complete streets initiatives in places like Haines Square and Riverside Avenue, we are redesigning roadways to better serve every driver, cyclist, pedestrians, and transit users alike.

380
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:53,299
[SPEAKER_12]: In collaboration with MassDOT, our state delegation, and the city council, we've advanced plans to reconstruct high crash intersections along Main Street.

381
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank our traffic and transportation team for leading this work.

382
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,143
[SPEAKER_12]: and for expanding blue bikes across the city.

383
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:09,073
[SPEAKER_12]: We now have 16 stations making sustainable transportation more accessible than ever, with the hope of opening three more in 2026.

384
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:13,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Safe, well-designed streets are not just a transportation priority.

385
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:17,442
[SPEAKER_12]: They are central to our development goals and to the safety of our neighborhoods.

386
00:46:18,168 --> 00:46:22,351
[SPEAKER_12]: To support that vision, we are investing in the basics, our roads and sidewalks.

387
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:31,118
[SPEAKER_12]: With the dedication of our engineering team and Department of Public Works, we are making steady progress, although slow, on the decades of backlog.

388
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:39,984
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, we invested hundreds of thousands in sidewalks repairs and completed patchwork improvements on seven of our more heavily traveled roads.

389
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:47,390
[SPEAKER_12]: We have significant sidewalk repair on Salem Street, Park Street, and at the intersection of Spring and Central Avenue, just to name a few.

390
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:58,197
[SPEAKER_12]: We are also investing in our urban canopy and neighborhood appearance, removing nearly 400 tree stumps in 2025 and planting 200 new trees once again.

391
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:03,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to this amazing work, we now have less than 100 stumps left on our current list.

392
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:05,520
[SPEAKER_12]: We have not seen a number this low since 2009.

393
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:15,045
[SPEAKER_12]: We have also made targeted investments in the facilities at both Andrews and McGlynn to ensure our buildings support safe and conducive learning environments.

394
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:26,927
[SPEAKER_12]: We are beginning the work thanks to a second MSBA grant on the roofs at Missitech, Roberts, and Brooks, another $20 to $25 million undertaking that the state will help fund.

395
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:33,653
[SPEAKER_12]: These investments are essential to maintaining strong, reliable school buildings, value we place on education in Medford.

396
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:54,682
[SPEAKER_12]: and as you just heard from member graham we are at the forefront of transforming our high school and into an innovative and state-of-the-art best equipped to shape the young minds that will enter its halls this effort is now in the feasibility study phase of the msba process in the months ahead the school committee building committee

397
00:47:55,163 --> 00:48:03,548
[SPEAKER_12]: which I'm proud to serve on, will begin exploring design options that reflect not only the needs of our students, but the values and aspirations of the entire Medford community.

398
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,850
[SPEAKER_12]: This will remain an open and transparent process.

399
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:13,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Residents will be invited, continue to be invited to share their perspectives in our community forums throughout 2026.

400
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:20,258
[SPEAKER_12]: This is how we build a Medford that honors its present and invest boldly in its future together.

401
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:25,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the most valuable resources we have here in Medford are extensive green spaces.

402
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:44,347
[SPEAKER_12]: As we continually work to maintain and improve these areas, the largest projects is Carr Park, which, thanks to Congresswoman Clark for the very healthy grant, entered its first phase, and we will break ground on the second phase, or actually third phase, in the spring.

403
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:56,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Other projects around our parks include resurfacing the basketball court and upgrading the splash pad at Capen Park, adding a natural play area at Logan Park, shade improvements at Riverside Plaza, and much more.

404
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,777
[SPEAKER_12]: This is truly a team effort with many departments collaborating on these projects.

405
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:08,607
[SPEAKER_12]: including Medford Recreation, Procurement, Finance, CPA, DPW, and PDS who has taken the lead.

406
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:18,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the past year, we've been taking a closer look at how people get around Medford and what obstacles may be in place when trying to find your way through the city.

407
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:32,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Working with Mass Development and the design firm Over Under, we kicked off a citywide effort to improve our wayfinding so it's clearer, accessible, and more consistent, and more welcoming for residents, visitors, and businesses alike.

408
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:40,659
[SPEAKER_12]: The next step is refining these designs with the hope that project is finalized early next year.

409
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:53,718
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also making sure accessibility is front and center by working with the Institute for Human-Centered Design to review and draft sign types and host a focus group with people who bring a wide range of user perspectives.

410
00:49:55,159 --> 00:50:00,160
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of the day, this is about making Medford easier to navigate and more welcoming for everyone who spends time here.

411
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:08,202
[SPEAKER_12]: To better prepare our city for the future, we are continuously working to expand sustainable and climate-focused goals.

412
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:20,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Using the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan as our framework, we're laying out our strategies to reduce our energy and waste consumption throughout the community and mitigate the impending effects of climate change.

413
00:50:21,347 --> 00:50:25,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Composting is a key way to reach our climate goals through sustainable waste management.

414
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:33,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Our curbside composting program with Garbage to Garden has been an enormous success, so 8,000 active households participating now.

415
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:39,395
[SPEAKER_12]: We're innovators in the space and have been highlighted by both regional and national agencies for our efforts.

416
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:45,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Expanding our composting program is essential to reducing the amount of waste we produce as a community.

417
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:57,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Recently, we secured $200,000 from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to bolster waste reduction efforts and put us on to adjusting our trash collection strategy in July of 2027.

418
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:00,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you've heard about this.

419
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:06,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Trash is a personal topic, and I know everyone has an opinion on how we should move forward.

420
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,732
[SPEAKER_12]: We will continue with our community listening to all of the data and adjust our plans accordingly.

421
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:22,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Our new Keep Medford Beautiful chapter is another way we're keeping the city clean, accountability through action, and foster social responsibility for our public spaces.

422
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: We have formed a committee who will help coordinate more neighborhood-centric cleanups and develop more ideas and plans on how we can help to beautify our downtowns and open spaces.

423
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,663
[SPEAKER_12]: So look for more information this spring.

424
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:47,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Our latest Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant for $750,000 is currently funding our MedforConnects program led by our Office of Prevention and Outreach.

425
00:51:47,996 --> 00:52:00,502
[SPEAKER_12]: This program connects vulnerable residents to essential city resources and funds a wide variety of programs and events throughout the city, including our amazing multilingual and multicultural community engagement team.

426
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:15,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Another way in which we are working for underserved communities through a $300,000 grant from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to create our Electrify Medford program, which aims to strengthen outreach and support for vulnerable communities.

427
00:52:16,654 --> 00:52:19,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Our goal is to make sustainable to all Medford residents.

428
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:33,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford is participating in the mass CEC on street charging program, which looks to reduce barriers to electric vehicle adoption for renters and residents without a dedicated driveway garage or parking space.

429
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:39,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally, the city owns 11 operational level two charging stations and plans to add more.

430
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,907
[SPEAKER_12]: We are also committed to making our facilities as accessible for the public as possible.

431
00:52:45,177 --> 00:53:01,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank our facilities team, our school leadership team, and our DEI director for coordinating ADA projects at the McGlynn Middle School and here at City Hall that will help make the experience of interacting with public spaces more inclusive and efficient.

432
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:03,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm almost done, sorry.

433
00:53:05,638 --> 00:53:11,182
[SPEAKER_12]: None of this work happens without the dedicated people who show up every day at City Hall to serve this community.

434
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:19,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Real progress only happens when you have the right people in place, people who lead with integrity and are united around a shared purpose.

435
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:23,470
[SPEAKER_12]: That's been a core focus of my administration from day one.

436
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:34,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Changing culture is never easy and it doesn't happen overnight, but we're doing it one day at a time, one department at a time, leading by example and making decisions on what's best for you,

437
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:36,873
[SPEAKER_12]: people of Medford.

438
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:45,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Despite the noise, we are deeply committed to those values, and I'm proud to say that nearly everyone across City Hall shares that commitment.

439
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:48,179
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we're able to get so much work done.

440
00:53:49,199 --> 00:54:03,666
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also made important leadership moves to strengthen our operations, including hiring our interim superintendent, Suzanne Galluzzi, our new elections manager, promoting Chief Evans to our permanent fire chief,

441
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:07,995
[SPEAKER_12]: and hiring a new facilities maintenance director who starts in a couple of weeks.

442
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And the results speak for themselves.

443
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:17,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Our 2026 budget earned the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Office yet again.

444
00:54:18,197 --> 00:54:24,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Our community relations continue to grow from Lunar New Year to PorchFest, Run Medford, and so many others.

445
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:33,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Our arts scene is thriving, including our inclusionary programming is expanding, and community participation has never been stronger.

446
00:54:34,932 --> 00:54:37,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to everyone inside City who make this work possible.

447
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I could keep going, but I'm not going to.

448
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:42,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Last page.

449
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:51,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the City Council and the School Committee for all the important hard work you do each day to improve the lives of our students, our staff, and our residents.

450
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:59,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford is lucky to have such caring, hardworking individuals leading their city, and I look forward to continuing this progress alongside you.

451
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:14,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Thoughtful collaboration is the key to unlocking the city's potential, and while each new term is brought with it to tremendous partnerships, there's always an opportunity to strengthen our relationships, forge new ideas, and bring our city even closer together.

452
00:55:15,384 --> 00:55:17,345
[SPEAKER_12]: to include life to serve as your mayor.

453
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:18,966
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my home.

454
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:21,548
[SPEAKER_12]: It's where I choose to raise my family.

455
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,510
[SPEAKER_12]: It's where I chose to start a business and grow my career.

456
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to my family.

457
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:37,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw my husband pop in after hockey in the back, my daughter, Bailey, Cody, and Calloway, who are at hockey, my parents, Ed and Sue, for your support, your understanding, no matter what the day may bring.

458
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:43,748
[SPEAKER_12]: To conclude, I'll never take this job or the trust you've all put in my team for granted.

459
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:49,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait to continue this work and deliver even more success for everyone who calls Medford home.

512
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,067

513
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:16,074
[SPEAKER_15]: But the word Medina can also mean the city that we live in.

514
01:04:16,975 --> 01:04:22,983
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a piece written by my hometown rabbi, Rabbi Mark Bloom of Temple Beth Abraham in Oakland, California.

[SPEAKER_15]: Our God and God of our ancestors, we ask you to bless our city, its government, its leaders, its citizens, and its land.

520
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:19,189
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer a prayer of support to the leaders of our government, understanding that leading a city with such diversity and freedom is a daunting task.

521
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:29,388
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer a prayer of action to the citizen city that we may understand our obligation to be involved in making our city a better place for all who live here.
