    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=29.229">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=32.692">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=44.337">All</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=44.557">Thanks</a>  so much for joining us today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=46.38">You</a>  could just start by introducing yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=48.884">So</a>  saying your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=53.155">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=54.036">My</a>  name is Frances Nwaje. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=55.577">I</a>  am the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for the City of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=62.022">My</a>  pronouns are she, her, hers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=65.065">However,</a>  I don't use my pronouns in meeting spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=68.948">So</a>  when people look at my name, they don't see them because I need to give space for people who are not yet comfortable to share their pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=78.175">So</a>  that is, you know, that's one of the observations that people have made that they don't see my pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=84.818">And</a>  I like to explain that to them because everyone is not comfortable yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=89.121">And,</a>  you know, I want people to come when they are ready to come, share their pronouns when they are ready to share their pronouns and have a deep understanding of what that means. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=100.466">My</a>  office is located out of City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=103.448">I</a>  am on the first floor, room 101. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=108.23">And</a>  I am always open to engaging and meeting residents Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=114.012">My</a>  role is for those who live and those who work in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=119.873">So</a>  always open to hearing new ideas, suggestions, and some, you know, sometimes in hearing new ideas and suggestions, you hear about the challenges that people are facing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=131.037">So</a>  looking forward to collaboration and partnership as that is what builds community.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=137.008">Thank</a>  you, Frances, and we'll follow up on, I think, a few of the things that you brought up already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=142.07">Before</a>  we do that, though, I want to ask you the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat at Medford and what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=152.235">What</a>  is my favorite place to eat in Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=155.337">Okay,</a>  so let us be serious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=157.858">I</a>  am very concerned about my 20 pound weight gain since my start of working in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=167.505">You</a>  know, I'm a vegetarian, so sometimes that can limit your options, but not in the 02155. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=173.831">I</a>  mean, there is always something that you can eat and enjoy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=181.918">And</a>  there is always somebody who wants to feed you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=186.202">I</a>  have had the pleasure of having everything from, you know, just a local space down the road. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=193.721">at</a>  the square to, you know, places that are more, you know, more exclusive, like more meal style. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=200.347">So</a>  a quick slice of, let's say, pizza from one of our local pizza shops to like a lovely, delicious Italian meal from an Italian restaurant on the South Medford side. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=212.218">I</a>  don't, I'm not so sure that I can find one place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=216.882">I</a>  seem to like them all so far.</p>
