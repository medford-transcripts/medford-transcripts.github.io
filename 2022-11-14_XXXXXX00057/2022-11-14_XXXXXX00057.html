    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=9.177">Hey</a>  listeners, this is Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=10.938">And</a>  Shelley. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=12.179">Shelley</a>  is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=15.121">And</a>  Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=18.503">And</a>  this is the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=21.485">Every</a>  two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=29.229">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=32.692">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=44.337">All</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=44.557">Thanks</a>  so much for joining us today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=46.38">You</a>  could just start by introducing yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=48.884">So</a>  saying your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=53.155">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=54.036">My</a>  name is Frances Nwaje. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=55.577">I</a>  am the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for the City of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=62.022">My</a>  pronouns are she, her, hers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=65.065">However,</a>  I don't use my pronouns in meeting spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=68.948">So</a>  when people look at my name, they don't see them because I need to give space for people who are not yet comfortable to share their pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=78.175">So</a>  that is, you know, that's one of the observations that people have made that they don't see my pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=84.818">And</a>  I like to explain that to them because everyone is not comfortable yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=89.121">And,</a>  you know, I want people to come when they are ready to come, share their pronouns when they are ready to share their pronouns and have a deep understanding of what that means. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=100.466">My</a>  office is located out of City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=103.448">I</a>  am on the first floor, room 101. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=108.23">And</a>  I am always open to engaging and meeting residents Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=114.012">My</a>  role is for those who live and those who work in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=119.873">So</a>  always open to hearing new ideas, suggestions, and some, you know, sometimes in hearing new ideas and suggestions, you hear about the challenges that people are facing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=131.037">So</a>  looking forward to collaboration and partnership as that is what builds community.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=137.008">Thank</a>  you, Frances, and we'll follow up on, I think, a few of the things that you brought up already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=142.07">Before</a>  we do that, though, I want to ask you the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat at Medford and what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=152.235">What</a>  is my favorite place to eat in Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=155.337">Okay,</a>  so let us be serious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=157.858">I</a>  am very concerned about my 20 pound weight gain since my start of working in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=167.505">You</a>  know, I'm a vegetarian, so sometimes that can limit your options, but not in the 02155. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=173.831">I</a>  mean, there is always something that you can eat and enjoy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=181.918">And</a>  there is always somebody who wants to feed you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=186.202">I</a>  have had the pleasure of having everything from, you know, just a local space down the road. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=193.721">at</a>  the square to, you know, places that are more, you know, more exclusive, like more meal style. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=200.347">So</a>  a quick slice of, let's say, pizza from one of our local pizza shops to like a lovely, delicious Italian meal from an Italian restaurant on the South Medford side. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=212.218">I</a>  don't, I'm not so sure that I can find one place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=216.882">I</a>  seem to like them all so far.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=219.885">Well,</a>  I'm glad you've been able to get out and try some different spots and enjoy what we have to offer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=224.387">I'm</a>  also a vegetarian and I found a lot of good places to eat and like lots of things don't have meat in them like doughnuts and ice cream, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=233.231">Stop</a>  it!</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=234.832">You</a>  said the magic words. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=237.793">Ice</a>  cream and it's walking distance.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=243.636">Access</a>  is important.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=245.237">Access</a>  is very important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=247.879">And</a>  donuts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=249.56">Oh</a>  my, yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=251.762">Lots</a>  of fabulous yum-yums all around in the many different parts of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=258.373">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=259.434">Do</a>  you want to jump in? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=260.315">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=260.795">All</a>  right, cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=261.616">So</a>  for those who are listening, Frances is a mentor, is a colleague, is a person who provides support to me on the regular, and I've enjoyed getting to know her since she came to us in April, am I? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=275.466">No,</a>  March, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=276.427">March.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=276.827">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=277.288">I</a>  was close-ish, not really. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=278.529">Very</a>  close. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=280.29">So</a>  I'm hoping to start out with a broader question and get your thoughts on DEI as sort of a burgeoning field. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=289.432">Just,</a>  yeah, talk a little bit about how this field has grown as sort of an occupation, as a role, as an identity, and what it means for cities to be onboarding said role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=300.554">And</a>  then maybe a little bit about how that has affected Medford from your perspective.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=306.207">So,</a>  you know, what is the diversity, equity and inclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=311.273">Really,</a>  I has always been around, however, we may not have seen it a lot on the municipal level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=321.345">It</a>  is the real true office of affirmative action or some people may have been in spaces where there was an office of equal opportunity and civil rights. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=335.584">However,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=336.305">with</a>  the evolution of language, because that's what we do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=341.106">I</a>  said this to someone yesterday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=343.747">It's</a>  language becomes like fashion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=346.208">Things</a>  evolve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=347.708">We</a>  change language based on generation-based understanding, but it just is a recycling, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=356.431">When</a>  you say the Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, it sounds extremely technical. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=363.015">do</a>  people who are in the organization, corporation, actually understand what that office is? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=369.643">It</a>  sounds more compliance, which is really what DEI is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=373.668">It's</a>  compliance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=375.27">It</a>  is almost like your moral quality assurance check and compass for your agency. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=381.63">organization,</a>  city, town, school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=385.533">And</a>  there are factors, there are legal factors that affect the scope of your work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=390.917">Affirmative</a>  action is a federal law. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=395.841">It's</a>  guided by federal laws. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=398.183">So</a>  if your organization, town, city is acquiring federal funds, or if you have over a certain number of people, there are certain things that you need to track and you can't track them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=411.213">range.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=412.594">How</a>  does DEI become your moral compass? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=415.277">Well,</a>  everybody's got a great mission statement and everybody's mission statement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=419.842">We</a>  talk about, you know, we, you know, we strongly encourage women, people of color, I believe they've changed the equal opportunity term for minorities to state people of color because these are specific tracks, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=434.776">veterans</a>  and persons with disabilities to apply. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=437.857">So,</a>  you know, you slap that on there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=439.877">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=440.737">That's</a>  just checking the books.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=442.918">What</a>  are you actually doing to either bring those groups in or create a path, right, for those groups to apply?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=455.905">So</a>  the end comes like things like a reasonable accommodation, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=460.266">So</a>  I'm, you know, I want to really apply for the job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=463.886">I've</a>  got the skill set. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=465.287">However,</a>  I'm a visual language user. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=468.387">For</a>  example, ASL. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=470.428">There</a>  needs to be a pathway for you to be granted an interview. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=475.088">You</a>  know, the, the, the organization or the group does not get to say, well, we don't have any ASL interpreters and that's going to take too long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=482.91">No.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=483.87">So</a>  this is where DEI comes into place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=487.373">How</a>  do we specifically recruit veterans? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=490.936">It's</a>  not enough to put words on paper. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=493.999">What</a>  are the actionable steps that you are taking to bring things to fruition? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=500.545">So,</a>  you know, that's more of the broad compliance scope of DEI. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=504.768">Amongst</a>  that, policies, right?

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=565.212">If</a>  you have internal staff that are Black, Indigenous, or other persons of color in a workspace that is primarily or dominantly <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=577.938">How</a>  do you support the staff to feel that they are a true part of the organization? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=585.062">And</a>  it's too painful because you have to provide spaces for the staff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=593.447">to</a>  feel that they can express what their concerns are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=597.088">An</a>  expression of concern is not a, somebody's doing something wrong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=603.029">It</a>  is how that person is feeling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=605.769">If</a>  that person is not feeling supported, they cannot thrive, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=610.931">And</a>  you have to provide education to the other space because it's 2022. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=618.748">And</a>  there are still people who have never worked alongside anybody that is different from them in any visible way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=628.761">Now</a>  let's look at the other aspect of DEI where confidentiality really comes into play. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=635.907">somebody</a>  has a disability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=638.81">There</a>  are visible disabilities and there are invisible disabilities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=644.016">Those</a>  don't belong in HR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=646.618">Those</a>  are shared in confidence or disclosed by that person, that person's choice to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=656.329">Office</a>  of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, to the Office of Civil Rights, to the Office of Equal Opportunity, People, Culture, and Belonging, whatever the name is now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=666.634">And</a>  you keep hold of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=668.495">It</a>  is separate from the personnel file. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=673.158">And,</a>  you know, I think, I feel I've had the pleasure of being in the role prior to the murder of George Floyd, prior to the pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=684.179">So</a>  I had a pleasure of working in the role in a different space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=688.704">What</a>  I saw happening, though, was a reactionary response to the murder of George Floyd, but without the preparation that is needed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=702.498">And</a>  I say that because, you know, I review a lot of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=707.203">agency,</a>  organization, and corporation job descriptions, because you also have to do your own education to stay one step ahead of the game, to see where the trends are, what's going on, what could impact your hiring, what could impact your retention and promotion for your organization. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=725.577">And</a>  I read some of these job descriptions, and I said, well, people don't get it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=731.221">Your</a>  DI person is not going to come, be hired, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=736.55">and</a>  create a space of what I believe it was cultural humility. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=743.511">That's</a>  a term, putting it in air quotes, because that is a term that I have stolen from my colleagues, Shelley, cultural humility. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=754.133">Hiring</a>  a DEI person does not automatically create that space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=759.494">That</a>  is just, okay, you can check that box that you've brought somebody on board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=764.403">Now,</a>  what is that person going to do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=767.144">And</a>  some of the things that I have seen, you know, around are not realistic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=773.407">In</a>  that testament, even in the way the job descriptions are written, it says to me, you still don't understand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=780.19">You're</a>  operating from a reactionary place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=784.272">When</a>  you see language like, within the first three months, a person will do this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=789.855">You</a>  cannot put a timeline on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=792.696">We're</a>  working with humans. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=794.596">I</a>  see this from a humanitarian lens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=798.417">If</a>  you have a culture that is embedded in working in a certain manner for a certain period of time, it is going to take double or triple that time to effect the change that is needed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=814.241">Reframing</a>  an organization does not happen overnight.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1373.81">And</a>  that was huge.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1375.133">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1375.574">I'm</a>  curious, I think as you've been talking, what I think about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1379.592">a</a>  place that is implementing like a DEI person in this way that especially, you know, in the climate and like the climate of, you know, as Chalene was saying, this like speed to address racism in our city, that I think that there can be this assumption of like, OK, like we're on board with this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1395.781">We're</a>  going to listen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1396.681">We're</a>  going to try. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1397.542">And</a>  and I think like like you all were saying, that puts a lot of pressure on the person in that position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1403.485">And</a>  as a white person, like I've learned that like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1406.827">There's</a>  a lot that I've had to look at that those the people in those roles have to look at like I'm part of this system that is creating this environment that might not feel. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1417.01">equitable</a>  or like a safe space for folks that aren't white. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1420.954">And</a>  so I wonder, like, I think there can be like all this energy in the beginning of like, yeah, we have this plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1426.239">We're</a>  going to take these steps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1427.36">We're</a>  going to work with a consultant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1429.122">And</a>  so hearing that that was back in April, I'm wondering like what you've seen since sort of how that follow through has been and where you hope it's going.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1439.211">So</a>  I would say that it has been great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1441.632">Now,</a>  remember, because I'm one person for the community, I've had to do things in chunks because that's what's manageable, you know, and that's what's realistic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1453.342">So</a>  I'm happy with where I am at this point with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1459.445">We're</a>  at the stage of let's now create. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1463.547">What</a>  is this going to look like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1465.568">Because</a>  more than likely, I will be time, you know, I shouldn't use the word time, but I will be utilizing a consultant's time for an extended period. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1477.373">So</a>  we don't, you know, it's not a blanket approach where we're giving the foundations of bias. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1484.679">If</a>  I'm working with the police department, right, we need to understand their issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1490.484">We</a>  need to have a little bit of understanding about their guiding principles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1495.227">Very</a>  different, not what we wrote, but their guiding principles, their foundational mission, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1501.252">and</a>  their experiences so that we now design something that is going to be realistic, a realistic approach, experiential learning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1517.746">not</a>  your standard we're gonna sit here and everybody watch this video and let's talk that's not realistic for them because what they might face different from me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1527.47">So</a>  we are at that stage which is huge but in addition to that I've been invited I get invited to their oh my gosh community engagement meetings <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1539.594">when</a>  they, you know, when they're putting on big events and I get to sit, I get to listen to their plans, I get to chime in and say, that sounds great or that's absolutely horrible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1553.261">Like,</a>  why would you have a poster like this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1556.182">Like,</a>  I would look at this and not feel, you know, like this speaks to me, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1562.425">But</a>  it does not get to be confrontational. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1565.467">I</a>  get to hear certain logistical things like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1569.507">Well,</a>  we didn't really have, you know, much in our database to use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1575.41">And</a>  I get to provide guidance and advice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1577.711">And</a>  then I get to sit back and see improvements. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1582.293">But</a>  I also get to see wonderful things like the diversity of new hires. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1590.256">So</a>  I've only been from, I would say March to now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1594.558">I</a>  went in one day and there were seven people in the chamber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1599.433">And</a>  I was shocked, out of those seven people, four. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/16jU3hW5pc4Q54KEEmd7Z3?t=1603.814">And</a>  when I say would fit the EEO4 category, I'm looking at this through the strict lens of if I was reporting for the federal government.</p>
