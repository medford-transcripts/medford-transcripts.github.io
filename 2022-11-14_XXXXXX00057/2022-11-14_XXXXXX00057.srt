1
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:28,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:44,537
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

10
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:46,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us today.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just start by introducing yourself.

12
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:52,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So saying your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

13
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:53,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

14
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,557
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Frances Nwaje.

15
00:00:55,577 --> 00:01:01,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for the City of Medford.

16
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:04,904
[SPEAKER_04]: My pronouns are she, her, hers.

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't use my pronouns in meeting spaces.

18
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:17,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people look at my name, they don't see them because I need to give space for people who are not yet comfortable to share their pronouns.

19
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:24,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is, you know, that's one of the observations that people have made that they don't see my pronouns.

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to explain that to them because everyone is not comfortable yet.

21
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I want people to come when they are ready to come, share their pronouns when they are ready to share their pronouns and have a deep understanding of what that means.

22
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:43,328
[SPEAKER_04]: My office is located out of City Hall.

23
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I am on the first floor, room 101.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am always open to engaging and meeting residents Medford.

25
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:59,413
[SPEAKER_04]: My role is for those who live and those who work in Medford.

26
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:10,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So always open to hearing new ideas, suggestions, and some, you know, sometimes in hearing new ideas and suggestions, you hear about the challenges that people are facing.

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:15,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking forward to collaboration and partnership as that is what builds community.

28
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:21,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Frances, and we'll follow up on, I think, a few of the things that you brought up already.

29
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:31,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, though, I want to ask you the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat at Medford and what do you like to eat there?

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,197
[SPEAKER_04]: What is my favorite place to eat in Medford?

31
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let us be serious.

32
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:46,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very concerned about my 20 pound weight gain since my start of working in Medford.

33
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:53,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm a vegetarian, so sometimes that can limit your options, but not in the 02155.

34
00:02:53,831 --> 00:03:01,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there is always something that you can eat and enjoy.

35
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:05,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is always somebody who wants to feed you.

36
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had the pleasure of having everything from, you know, just a local space down the road.

37
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:20,287
[SPEAKER_04]: at the square to, you know, places that are more, you know, more exclusive, like more meal style.

38
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So a quick slice of, let's say, pizza from one of our local pizza shops to like a lovely, delicious Italian meal from an Italian restaurant on the South Medford side.

39
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:36,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I'm not so sure that I can find one place.

40
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to like them all so far.

41
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:44,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you've been able to get out and try some different spots and enjoy what we have to offer.

42
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:52,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a vegetarian and I found a lot of good places to eat and like lots of things don't have meat in them like doughnuts and ice cream, right?

43
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it!

44
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You said the magic words.

45
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice cream and it's walking distance.

46
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:04,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Access is important.

47
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:07,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Access is very important.

48
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And donuts.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, yes.

50
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:17,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fabulous yum-yums all around in the many different parts of Medford.

51
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening.

52
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:20,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to jump in?

53
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:20,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

54
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, cool.

55
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:34,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those who are listening, Frances is a mentor, is a colleague, is a person who provides support to me on the regular, and I've enjoyed getting to know her since she came to us in April, am I?

56
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,107
[SPEAKER_05]: No, March, yeah.

57
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:36,727
[SPEAKER_05]: March.

58
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:37,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

59
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:38,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I was close-ish, not really.

60
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Very close.

61
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:39,730
Okay.

62
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:49,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping to start out with a broader question and get your thoughts on DEI as sort of a burgeoning field.

63
00:04:49,432 --> 00:05:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, yeah, talk a little bit about how this field has grown as sort of an occupation, as a role, as an identity, and what it means for cities to be onboarding said role.

64
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:05,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe a little bit about how that has affected Medford from your perspective.

65
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, what is the diversity, equity and inclusion.

66
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:20,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I has always been around, however, we may not have seen it a lot on the municipal level.

67
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:34,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the real true office of affirmative action or some people may have been in spaces where there was an office of equal opportunity and civil rights.

68
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,065
[SPEAKER_04]: However,

69
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:40,646
[SPEAKER_04]: with the evolution of language, because that's what we do.

70
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I said this to someone yesterday.

71
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,848
[SPEAKER_04]: It's language becomes like fashion.

72
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Things evolve.

73
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:55,931
[SPEAKER_04]: We change language based on generation-based understanding, but it just is a recycling, right?

74
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:02,293
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say the Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, it sounds extremely technical.

75
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:09,623
[SPEAKER_04]: do people who are in the organization, corporation, actually understand what that office is?

76
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds more compliance, which is really what DEI is.

77
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:14,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's compliance.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It is almost like your moral quality assurance check and compass for your agency.

79
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,333
[SPEAKER_04]: organization, city, town, school.

80
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:30,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are factors, there are legal factors that affect the scope of your work.

81
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Affirmative action is a federal law.

82
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It's guided by federal laws.

83
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:50,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So if your organization, town, city is acquiring federal funds, or if you have over a certain number of people, there are certain things that you need to track and you can't track them.

84
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:51,593
[SPEAKER_04]: range.

85
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,857
[SPEAKER_04]: How does DEI become your moral compass?

86
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:59,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everybody's got a great mission statement and everybody's mission statement.

87
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:13,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about, you know, we, you know, we strongly encourage women, people of color, I believe they've changed the equal opportunity term for minorities to state people of color because these are specific tracks, right?

88
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,777
[SPEAKER_04]: veterans and persons with disabilities to apply.

89
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you slap that on there.

90
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:20,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

91
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,998
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just checking the books.

92
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:34,221
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you actually doing to either bring those groups in or create a path, right, for those groups to apply?

93
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So the end comes like things like a reasonable accommodation, right?

94
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:43,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm, you know, I want to really apply for the job.

95
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the skill set.

96
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:47,887
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm a visual language user.

97
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:49,828
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, ASL.

98
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,728
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be a pathway for you to be granted an interview.

99
00:07:55,088 --> 00:08:02,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the, the, the organization or the group does not get to say, well, we don't have any ASL interpreters and that's going to take too long.

100
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,010
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

101
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,833
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where DEI comes into place.

102
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,856
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we specifically recruit veterans?

103
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:13,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not enough to put words on paper.

104
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:19,744
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the actionable steps that you are taking to bring things to fruition?

105
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:24,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's more of the broad compliance scope of DEI.

106
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Amongst that, policies, right?

107
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been involved, we've all probably worked in spaces where certain policies sound great.

108
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:41,100
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes in writing a great policy, you're creating a hardship or a burden or you're marginalizing a specific.

109
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:42,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

110
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So DEI again, uses that lens.

111
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we say, not just necessarily policies that are written by the organization, think about other things like contracts.

112
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So there could be language and union contracts.

113
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:07,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the responsibility of the DEI person to step forward and to, you know, alert.

114
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:15,086
[SPEAKER_04]: the leader and say, hey, I think that there is some concerns in this area.

115
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:20,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It is always a working, fluid, moving relationship.

116
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,412
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you support your internal staff?

117
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:35,258
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have internal staff that are Black, Indigenous, or other persons of color in a workspace that is primarily or dominantly

118
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:44,922
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you support the staff to feel that they are a true part of the organization?

119
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:52,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's too painful because you have to provide spaces for the staff.

120
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: to feel that they can express what their concerns are.

121
00:09:57,088 --> 00:10:02,829
[SPEAKER_04]: An expression of concern is not a, somebody's doing something wrong.

122
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It is how that person is feeling.

123
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,990
[SPEAKER_04]: If that person is not feeling supported, they cannot thrive, right?

124
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to provide education to the other space because it's 2022.

125
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:27,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are still people who have never worked alongside anybody that is different from them in any visible way.

126
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:34,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's look at the other aspect of DEI where confidentiality really comes into play.

127
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:38,129
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody has a disability.

128
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,335
[SPEAKER_04]: There are visible disabilities and there are invisible disabilities.

129
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Those don't belong in HR.

130
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:55,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are shared in confidence or disclosed by that person, that person's choice to the

131
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:05,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, to the Office of Civil Rights, to the Office of Equal Opportunity, People, Culture, and Belonging, whatever the name is now.

132
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And you keep hold of that.

133
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It is separate from the personnel file.

134
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:23,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think, I feel I've had the pleasure of being in the role prior to the murder of George Floyd, prior to the pandemic.

135
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a pleasure of working in the role in a different space.

136
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: What I saw happening, though, was a reactionary response to the murder of George Floyd, but without the preparation that is needed.

137
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:46,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say that because, you know, I review a lot of

138
00:11:47,203 --> 00:12:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: agency, organization, and corporation job descriptions, because you also have to do your own education to stay one step ahead of the game, to see where the trends are, what's going on, what could impact your hiring, what could impact your retention and promotion for your organization.

139
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And I read some of these job descriptions, and I said, well, people don't get it.

140
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:14,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Your DI person is not going to come, be hired, right?

141
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,491
[SPEAKER_04]: and create a space of what I believe it was cultural humility.

142
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:33,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a term, putting it in air quotes, because that is a term that I have stolen from my colleagues, Shelley, cultural humility.

143
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:39,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiring a DEI person does not automatically create that space.

144
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: That is just, okay, you can check that box that you've brought somebody on board.

145
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what is that person going to do?

146
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:52,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the things that I have seen, you know, around are not realistic.

147
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:59,710
[SPEAKER_04]: In that testament, even in the way the job descriptions are written, it says to me, you still don't understand.

148
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You're operating from a reactionary place.

149
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:09,415
[SPEAKER_04]: When you see language like, within the first three months, a person will do this.

150
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot put a timeline on it.

151
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working with humans.

152
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I see this from a humanitarian lens.

153
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:33,481
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a culture that is embedded in working in a certain manner for a certain period of time, it is going to take double or triple that time to effect the change that is needed.

154
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:37,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Reframing an organization does not happen overnight.

155
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:39,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

156
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:55,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So a person with maybe a Chelly lens or maybe a Medford Bites, maybe a Chelly Danielle lens might wonder, is there a supremacist sort of structure that aligns with this onboarding of the DEI role?

157
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:59,868
[SPEAKER_05]: To your point, after Floyd, we see agency after agency.

158
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:03,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, we have 100K for this DEI role.

159
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:05,273
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to onboard this person, we're going to

160
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:19,239
[SPEAKER_05]: arbitrarily designed deliverables that we need in three, six, nine, 12 months, and the role will likely be onerous and burdensome and take an incredible emotional toll from whatever individual steps into that role.

161
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,881
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your thoughts on that perspective?

162
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I, what I genuinely feel is I'm not sure if it is a supremacist, um, like foundation.

163
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that

164
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:39,531
[SPEAKER_04]: people really think that you put, you change the words around and it changes the meaning.

165
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:42,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Research needs, yeah.

166
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Research in addition to your point.

167
00:14:46,001 --> 00:15:06,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of looking at hiring data or salary data or attrition rate or following the dollars, what if we just add this one role and then kind of wash our hands of the actual shakeup of infrastructure, which is... I have seen, and that is exactly what I have seen in a lot of organizations.

168
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:12,088
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I belong to a white group of a support system for regional DEI people.

169
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is what I have seen and heard in my role and career as a DEI person.

170
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a lot of, OK, we're going to get this role and this person is going to do this.

171
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:29,377
[SPEAKER_04]: fabulous, but you have not clarified the vision to the current people that are there.

172
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:41,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But even more importantly, you don't have an understanding of the role because there were so many other components that have not yet been done.

173
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, do you understand your organization?

174
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

175
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

176
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the very beginning.

177
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And an internal person, internally, that understanding does not come from internal.

178
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:11,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to come from external, because external means that whoever, whether it's a consultant, a study, can be as objective, right?

179
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it living the status quo?

180
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:16,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

181
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that equates perfectly into a next thought.

182
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,611
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2020, the city of Medford declared racism a public health crisis.

183
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:35,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like irrespective of what people's reactions, we saw a lot of very quick moving political energy kind of pop up all over the city since Floyd.

184
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:41,150
[SPEAKER_05]: For all of the understandable reasons, people have to figure out whatever their new normal is.

185
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to kind of come out of lockdown.

186
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:47,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That means a lot of things for a lot of different people, their families, their children, work, whatever.

187
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And things move and shift.

188
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: To your point about what is the vision?

189
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we doing?

190
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,797
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as the potential pipelines to you?

191
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: really, you know, get back in touch with that energy and leveraging in the goals, around the goals and moving forward.

192
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:19,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I started to do was part of what actually attracted me to the city of Medford was a social justice roadmap that I read.

193
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not from Medford.

194
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't live in Medford.

195
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:33,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I read that, I was like, well, 2018, all right, I need to look at this 02155 a little bit closer because they seem like they want to do something.

196
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:37,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It predicted what was happening.

197
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:42,885
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2020, and I started to take a closer look at it.

198
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,827
[SPEAKER_04]: You said something that is extremely important.

199
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:50,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Racism is a public health crisis, period.

200
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a public health crisis, you know, and many people that I have worked with along the way

201
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:14,741
[SPEAKER_04]: have actually expressed whether or not being a person of color can be looked upon as a disability, given their lived experience in a variety of different spaces that have been unpleasant.

202
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, racism is a public health crisis.

203
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the social justice roadmap, I was very attracted to the way that things were

204
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:31,616
[SPEAKER_04]: raised me and choose some of the work plans.

205
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:38,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming on board, I had to figure out, okay, who do I go to?

206
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is in charge of what?

207
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:50,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized that the Office of Prevention and Outreach was already doing a lot of equitable work

208
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:56,768
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of equitable work on a broad health spectrum.

209
00:18:57,988 --> 00:19:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Without calling it DEI, they were really approaching their work from like an equitable lens.

210
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I contacted our police department.

211
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that I would have to start from scratch.

212
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:37,732
[SPEAKER_03]: with the police department did not realize that they are actually a little bit ahead of the game, i.e., social work, which requires a different style of address for our unhoused people who are not committing a crime.

213
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: They're unhoused, or our people that may have mental health challenges.

214
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:45,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were already

215
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: coordinated.

216
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:59,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also realized at that point that there was a whole nother unit, like a lot of what I thought I would have to help build was already in existence prior to my getting there.

217
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:05,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So that gave me hope and I used that as the springboard.

218
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:07,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately,

219
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:15,535
[SPEAKER_04]: As I sprung, I was caught and welcomed versus caught and pushed away.

220
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:34,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say caught and welcomed, in, I mean, in terms of conversation, where I, not the, not the resistance that many of my colleagues that work on a municipal level face, real genuine conversation.

221
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is, you know, unfortunately there are certain aspects that I can't discuss.

222
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

223
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:49,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is, there is a level of understanding of what my expectations are.

224
00:20:49,931 --> 00:21:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the biggest honor for me was when our chief and lieutenant walked into my office one day and I thought, oh dear, they're coming to bring news that

225
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,481
[SPEAKER_04]: is not going to be palatable.

226
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I shall just prepare my game face.

227
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:10,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to have a conversation with me.

228
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,784
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in end of, yeah, it was April, was mid April.

229
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:29,170
[SPEAKER_04]: To have a conversation with me about bringing on the, I think like a step two of their plan, bringing on a consultant for a series of trainings, workshops and seminars.

230
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

231
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had that conversation, I think we'd spent about 45 minutes and it was great, you know, and then they left and I was like, all right, maybe it's just another check the box thing.

232
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I says, well, I'll test the waters.

233
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:45,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I called, it was the last week of April.

234
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I called and within a two week period, consulting to myself and the chief,

235
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,233
[SPEAKER_04]: and the lieutenant were already engaged in a meeting.

236
00:21:55,854 --> 00:22:01,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't, you know, and I say this because it wasn't just words and, oh, okay, let's get together.

237
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why don't we schedule something for two months from now?

238
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,200
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was words followed by immediate action.

239
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

240
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:11,082
[SPEAKER_04]: A meeting was supposed to be an hour.

241
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:15,524
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting was two and a half hours long.

242
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:16,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

243
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:20,847
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it was a real discussion.

244
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: about internal blind spots, addressing internal issues and working to build something.

245
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as we all know, it's, it's true.

246
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like one-time training.

247
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:39,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody goes for two hours and then we come out.

248
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:44,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're all enlightened and we're all different, you know, to build something.

249
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:51,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I'll use the word curriculum for lack of a better word that could address the vision and drive.

250
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:52,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

251
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was huge.

252
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:55,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

253
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, I think as you've been talking, what I think about

254
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:15,661
[SPEAKER_00]: a place that is implementing like a DEI person in this way that especially, you know, in the climate and like the climate of, you know, as Chalene was saying, this like speed to address racism in our city, that I think that there can be this assumption of like, OK, like we're on board with this.

255
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:16,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to listen.

256
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:17,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try.

257
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:22,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I think like like you all were saying, that puts a lot of pressure on the person in that position.

258
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a white person, like I've learned that like

259
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:35,812
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that I've had to look at that those the people in those roles have to look at like I'm part of this system that is creating this environment that might not feel.

260
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,694
[SPEAKER_00]: equitable or like a safe space for folks that aren't white.

261
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:46,199
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wonder, like, I think there can be like all this energy in the beginning of like, yeah, we have this plan.

262
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,320
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take these steps.

263
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to work with a consultant.

264
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:57,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hearing that that was back in April, I'm wondering like what you've seen since sort of how that follow through has been and where you hope it's going.

265
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that it has been great.

266
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:12,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, remember, because I'm one person for the community, I've had to do things in chunks because that's what's manageable, you know, and that's what's realistic.

267
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:19,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy with where I am at this point with them.

268
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:23,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the stage of let's now create.

269
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this going to look like?

270
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:36,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Because more than likely, I will be time, you know, I shouldn't use the word time, but I will be utilizing a consultant's time for an extended period.

271
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't, you know, it's not a blanket approach where we're giving the foundations of bias.

272
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm working with the police department, right, we need to understand their issues.

273
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:54,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have a little bit of understanding about their guiding principles.

274
00:24:55,227 --> 00:25:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Very different, not what we wrote, but their guiding principles, their foundational mission, right?

275
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: and their experiences so that we now design something that is going to be realistic, a realistic approach, experiential learning.

276
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:27,030
[SPEAKER_04]: not your standard we're gonna sit here and everybody watch this video and let's talk that's not realistic for them because what they might face different from me.

277
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:38,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are at that stage which is huge but in addition to that I've been invited I get invited to their oh my gosh community engagement meetings

278
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:53,201
[SPEAKER_04]: when they, you know, when they're putting on big events and I get to sit, I get to listen to their plans, I get to chime in and say, that sounds great or that's absolutely horrible.

279
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why would you have a poster like this?

280
00:25:56,182 --> 00:26:01,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I would look at this and not feel, you know, like this speaks to me, right?

281
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does not get to be confrontational.

282
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to hear certain logistical things like,

283
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:14,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't really have, you know, much in our database to use.

284
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get to provide guidance and advice.

285
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:21,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get to sit back and see improvements.

286
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:29,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also get to see wonderful things like the diversity of new hires.

287
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've only been from, I would say March to now.

288
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I went in one day and there were seven people in the chamber.

289
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was shocked, out of those seven people, four.

290
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:54,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say would fit the EEO4 category, I'm looking at this through the strict lens of if I was reporting for the federal government.

291
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

292
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:56,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Four out of seven.

293
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about women.

294
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:05,734
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about when people of color, some set multiple categories.

295
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:08,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is huge.

296
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:18,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we think about the current state of the police department, we still don't have a lot of women across the board.

297
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the men of color in

298
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Law enforcement across the board, speaking nationally, that came on board with the origin of affirmative action, as I learned yesterday there at retirement age.

299
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be all soon to be retiring.

300
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:44,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Learned this yesterday.

301
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:47,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what does that do?

302
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:58,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is important to have, you know, your law enforcement and your municipality that is really actually serious about DEI.

303
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:05,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got to hear about our own situation where there were actually more candidates.

304
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:09,945
[SPEAKER_04]: The candidates didn't make it because they couldn't pass the physical.

305
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm being asked,

306
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,072
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have any ideas or any suggestions?

307
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm like me, I just gained 20 pounds in my little time, you know, but that, those, those types of conversations are authentic conversations.

308
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says to me, someone is trying that is bigger than any wonderful thing that you can put on paper.

309
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So this brings up a conversation, Frances, that you and I had, and you shared something brilliant with me, and it's been on my mind maybe for months at this point.

310
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:54,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You had quoted a colleague around a conversation of the difference between allyship and co-disrupting.

311
00:28:54,058 --> 00:29:07,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were discussing the potential dangers in having folks moving out in the world, self-identifying as allies, and sort of maybe even historically putting on a hat in the morning and marching around in space.

312
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:10,909
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of carrying an identity that may or may not be real.

313
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was wondering if you might speak to that.

314
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:14,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

315
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I think it's really important when people use the terms and say they're an ally or they're a co-dis, or they're a co-disrupt.

316
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm both, you know.

317
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say I am both, it means that I will always do what is right to raise the awareness as an ally, to stand by and support, not stand up for, because I do not wish to take the voice away, but to stand by in support of the individual.

318
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And if called forward by that individual, then I will speak.

319
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,535
[SPEAKER_04]: As a co-disruptor, I will step in in the moment.

320
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to wait till it's safe or comfortable.

321
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:14,631
[SPEAKER_04]: As a co-disruptor, if I witness, I am stepping in at that time because that is when that person or that group will need me the most.

322
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:17,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are many different ways that one can step in.

323
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:33,446
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I like the bystander intervention style where you shift the focus back to the individual, back to the group, and you draw so you are not giving attention to the doer.

324
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:36,354
[SPEAKER_04]: of the action.

325
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:49,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's very important for people to understand when you were speaking with marginalized groups and you were flying the, I am an ally flag,

326
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,440
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing as an ally?

327
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be big.

328
00:30:56,202 --> 00:31:01,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're only stepping into the space once a month for a meeting, I'm sorry, you're just checking the box.

329
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:06,668
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're only just showing up, you're just checking the box.

330
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:14,352
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a responsibility associated with being an ally.

331
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:26,271
[SPEAKER_03]: and there is an expectation associated with being a co-disruptor.

332
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:35,016
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are my ally and I am in a space where, let's say, something happens, right?

333
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:38,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Do nothing, you say nothing.

334
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: But afterwards,

335
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:43,487
[SPEAKER_04]: You come back and check in with me.

336
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: How exactly are you supporting me?

337
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:52,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever relationship that we have built is questionable.

338
00:31:54,158 --> 00:32:03,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times, when I have challenged people that say that they're allies, the response is, well, I didn't know, you know,

339
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,651
[SPEAKER_03]: you to do, then why didn't you ask the question?

340
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't you ask the question?

341
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:19,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Because had you simply asked the question at that moment, Francis, would you like me to intervene?

342
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have said yes, and I might have said no, but I still would have felt supported.

343
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:29,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about the tension between being an ally

344
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:36,849
[SPEAKER_05]: on paper and the emotional work that it takes to actually be an ally.

345
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:51,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I sometimes wonder about the archetype of person who would like to call themselves that ally, but actually isn't available for, in my mind, if you're showing up properly, then you begin to adopt some modes

346
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: the lived experience of the person you are claiming to support.

347
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:59,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that hasn't happened yet, then you probably are not showing up as an ally.

348
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you can talk to the tension there.

349
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:09,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I feel is that, again, you know, it's with language, right?

350
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:15,099
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have embodied the term ally.

351
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But those who have embodied the term ally are people that actually have a good heart.

352
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not about having a good heart.

353
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's here to challenge your good heart.

354
00:33:28,063 --> 00:33:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Your good heart and your good nature is welcome, but it's detrimental, I mean, if you don't really understand the foundation of what's going on.

355
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the tension gets

356
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:54,719
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it starts to drink at that level.

357
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It is best to say, I want to stand in support.

358
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

359
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:05,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Than to say, oh, I'm an ally.

360
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:09,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

361
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:13,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because you want to stand in support.

362
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:20,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you an opportunity to weigh your own comfort level, right?

363
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You say you're an ally, then I'm going to order you.

364
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to help organize this.

365
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:28,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to do this.

366
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to go deliver this here, right?

367
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:37,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get all, you know, you start to spin because that's not at your comfort level, right?

368
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:45,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you start to either back out or provide excuses or just like ghost out.

369
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So a good heart is always welcome, but allyship is something different.

370
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:55,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a mission.

371
00:34:57,694 --> 00:35:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it is your willingness to put your boots on the ground and do something.

372
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the next, it is the next step.

373
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:18,767
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your sense of the difference between diversity initiatives and pro-Black agendas?

374
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:24,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the word diversity.

375
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:28,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity initiatives and pro-Black agendas.

376
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:32,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a loaded one.

377
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

378
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:36,480
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I sum this up?

379
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,901
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only one more question after that.

380
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,483
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the diversity initiative?

381
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is a pro-Black agenda?

382
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:51,847
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it always is, what is the ultimate goal?

383
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:53,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I look at.

384
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: look at what's the ultimate goal.

385
00:35:57,431 --> 00:36:02,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I would describe myself, my clinician friends who listen to this will understand what I'm saying.

386
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:05,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I use more of a backward chaining method, right?

387
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:11,023
[SPEAKER_04]: When they teach me how to make a sandwich, I need to taste that sandwich first so that I'm motivated, right?

388
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:18,971
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then step back, step back, step back, and I learn the process backwards and then I'm able to do it from the beginning.

389
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:24,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me it's really what's the ultimate goal or who is that goal serving?

390
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes, you know, sometimes get caught up in words

391
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity initiative.

392
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:38,133
[SPEAKER_04]: There are still people who think that my role is to come and run multicultural events.

393
00:36:41,754 --> 00:36:43,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is the ultimate goal?

394
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,476
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we trying to do?

395
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We want a healthy community.

396
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:53,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first of all, are we all on the same level as to how we define health?

397
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we're on the same level.

398
00:36:56,863 --> 00:37:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how are we going to get that healthy community?

399
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:07,375
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when you bring somebody in to help us identify our barriers.

400
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:12,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Through that, you will find little tributaries.

401
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:22,093
[SPEAKER_04]: part at different aspects of our community are going to need more or are going to need less.

402
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,535
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not that one is more important than the other.

403
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It is simply that the need is greater.

404
00:37:32,237 --> 00:37:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you look at what can we take on and please make it realistic.

405
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

406
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Please make it realistic.

407
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,286
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have the resources to do?

408
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:51,909
[SPEAKER_04]: People who have worked with me will understand that I am a one, two, three goal person, no more.

409
00:37:52,609 --> 00:38:03,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's one goal, let's take that one and let's hit it out of the ballpark and ensure that it is going to be sustainable and organically move on.

410
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:13,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that I will wrap up with one last question which is what can the City of Medford do to support you in this DEI role?

411
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:19,393
[SPEAKER_04]: What can the City of Medford do to support me in this DEI role?

412
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:27,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first thing that I would love everybody that is listening to understand about me is that

413
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, this role is both personal and it's both professional.

414
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,286
[SPEAKER_03]: This role is not political.

415
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:46,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get to take my blackness off and relax.

416
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:51,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I live this, I walk this, I speak this.

417
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It is important that when people approach me,
