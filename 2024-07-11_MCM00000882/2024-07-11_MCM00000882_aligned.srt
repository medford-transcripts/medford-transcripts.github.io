9
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:58,157
Our agenda is succinct.

10
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:02,880
We are here to develop a transportation survey to understand the needs of the Medford community.

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,781
So let's call the roll.

12
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:08,222
Member Reinfeld?

13
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,343
Here.

14
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:12,064
Member Rousseau?

15
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,212
Here and Graham here, so 3 present none absent.

16
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:22,474
So off we go by way of context.

17
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:23,074
Right?

18
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,055
So we passed this resolution.

19
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:26,596
I think back in the fall even.

20
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:49,765
And the goal of the resolution was for this group to start to meet to assemble a survey to assess the needs of the district from a transportation perspective, knowing that our contract with Eastern Bus comes to an end at the end of next school year.

21
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:56,787
So what we wanted to do was sort of proactively try to create

22
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:19,301
a way to sort of weed out fact from fiction around what folks want and need from transportation and get a feel for the kinds of things that we should be considering both from a policy perspective, there's a slew of

23
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,386
rather outdated policies, in my opinion, around transportation in our policy manual.

24
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:39,398
But also to say, like, if we're going to shape an RFP that describes anything different than what we have today, it should be based on, like, sort of real needs of the district rather than perceived needs.

25
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:42,421
And the example I've been thinking about a lot is

26
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:50,398
the desire of some to move away from using MBTA buses to bus students to the high school.

27
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:55,703
And I think I've had conversations with folks that say, we should definitely do that.

28
00:02:56,123 --> 00:03:00,808
And then I've had conversation with other folks saying, high school kids don't wanna ride yellow buses.

29
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:08,134
So you could put up a lot of yellow buses and the high school students are gonna sort of elect to do something different anyway.

30
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:20,024
And I think that's an important question to know the answer to what really is the, you know, what really is the perspective and opinion of those impacted is something that's sort of on my mind.

31
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:28,774
And then I think along the way, we hear lots of questions about like the policies around how far

32
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:41,339
We will bus, I drive by the high school somewhat regularly at about the time kids are already supposed to be in class and there's still like an endless stream of cars dropping kids off.

33
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:50,503
And I do wonder how anybody gets to school on time because the number of cars going in and out, you know, clearly dropping people off is pretty staggering.

34
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:55,467
Which suggests that we're not providing transportation in some capacity.

35
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:07,921
So, I think the goal is just for us to think about, like, what kind of survey we could provide that would help us start to get some, like, answers grounded in the people who use the services.

36
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:21,602
to really think about what are the problems, whether they're solved by a new contract or they're more immediately solvable, and how do we have some facts to move forward with?

37
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,865
So that was the goal of this whole effort to begin with.

38
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:37,194
But I did see earlier today that the district launched a Smart Routes to School survey, and I was curious if anybody could tell us about that and what it's

39
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:45,619
what the questions are and who gets the data and what the goals are, because I think that does complicate anything we're going to do here.

40
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:54,545
Like we can't put out two transportation surveys in hot succession and expect that people are not going to be confused by that.

41
00:04:54,605 --> 00:05:00,349
So when we ultimately get to talking about what goes in the survey and timing, I think that'll be important.

42
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:04,732
So I don't know if anybody could tell us a little bit about what that survey is even all about.

43
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,193
that went out today.

44
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:11,417
Dr. Cushing, are you able to respond to member Graham's question?

45
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,061
He has been involved with Safe Routes to School.

46
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:21,105
So let me just try calling him to see if I can jump back on.

47
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:21,485
Thank you.

48
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:35,405
And if he can't, my wife has been involved with this group so I can speak to it and I spoke with Ellery as well, but I'd love to hear where the district is coming from on this, but it is a three question survey.

49
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:36,826
I can pull it up actually.

50
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:37,426
Oh, okay.

51
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,267
I literally just saw it as I was signing in and I was like, yeah.

52
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:49,330
I had reached out to the Safe Routes to Schools people to say, hey, is there anything you'd want us to keep in mind?

53
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,412
And they said, oh, actually, this thing that has been kind of chugging along slowly is set to launch tomorrow.

54
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,232
So it was, yeah.

55
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,253
So the...

56
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:08,174
The survey itself is run by Safe Routes to Schools, which is a statewide group that does local advocacy and assessments.

57
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:12,976
And it is a very basic survey, right?

58
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:23,602
So if you click on where you live, whoops, and then you answer questions about your child.

59
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:24,703
How do you get to school?

60
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:25,824
How do you get from school?

61
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:27,465
And this is it.

62
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,639
So it's not comprehensive.

63
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:41,906
I know this group is interested in getting more data about what stops people from active transportation, walking, biking, rolling, this.

64
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,208
But this survey is just this assessment.

65
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:49,891
I believe it goes to the state organization of Safe Routes to Schools.

66
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:54,334
They do the data and provide a report.

67
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,201
I have the report from the Roberts from 2018.

68
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:05,226
It used to be done by school, and I think they're pretty excited.

69
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:15,854
Hi, Kitty, about having a comprehensive approach from the district on this, but it's really focusing on alternative transportation.

70
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:15,914
OK.

71
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,476
That is super helpful.

72
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,817
Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

73
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:25,602
So I thought what we could do today is use the time that we have to start to

74
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:29,188
Brainstorm and think about like.

75
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,150
Sort of the questions that we have that we would want to have vetted by the survey.

76
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,672
And to the extent that we can craft any questions that we have, and then perhaps Megan and I can work offline.

77
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:48,434
To sort of flush out a draft to bring back to this group at a future meeting.

78
00:07:50,194 --> 00:08:05,702
And so I have a literal blank piece of paper here that I'm happy to share, and we can walk through and just do some brainstorming until it can sort of evolve into something a little bit more formalized, if that works for the group.

79
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:06,462
Yeah?

80
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:08,263
OK.

81
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:11,664
I'm going to share my screen.

82
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,007
OK.

83
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:18,768
You all see my screen?

84
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:20,098
Yes.

85
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,619
OK.

86
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:35,946
OK, so I think sort of one thing that we probably want to be clear about is our questions to answer via the survey.

87
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:45,231
And then the other thing is, what survey questions are we thinking we'll ask?

88
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,511
My typing always goes downhill when I'm sharing my screen.

89
00:08:58,153 --> 00:08:58,353
Okay.

90
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:12,175
So I would be happy to hear from any of you if you, I have some thoughts, but I will yield my thoughts to the group if anybody has anything they want to throw out there.

91
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:24,618
So I did just Google for some examples of transportation surveys for school districts.

92
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,802
This one has 21 questions, which I am just reading right now.

93
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,084
There are questions about

94
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:41,529
The bell schedule, which is interesting to have as part of that survey.

95
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:53,053
I can't see the answers because the dropdowns have presumably lots of options, but it is a survey that is closed, so they won't let you drop down and see what's behind there.

96
00:09:55,334 --> 00:10:04,157
There's questions about transportation experience, positives, surprising, that kind of stuff.

97
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:09,367
I also put into the chat the safe routes to schools.

98
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:15,950
I believe this is a sample of what their actual report looks like.

99
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:24,913
And it does have, as member Reinfeldt pointed out, it's very basic.

100
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:37,224
you know, when people are using it is sort of what I'm getting at, getting is how do people get to school, percentages, days of the week, the morning and the afternoon.

101
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:46,432
And interestingly, they have a thing about weather conditions, which is good.

102
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,375
You know, if we plan everything around everybody bikes,

103
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:56,290
and the entire system falls apart because it isn't always biking weather, for instance, that could be a problem.

104
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,651
Yeah.

105
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:23,043
Yes, one meta question I have is whether we're looking to have an assessment and understand the what are the obstacles to participating in district provided transportation or alternative methods versus what could the district do differently that would shift your transportation behavior?

106
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:27,005
Because those are kind of two different approaches to asking the questions.

107
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,410
Yeah, I think that's a good question.

108
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:50,422
And I think the other thing on my mind is we need to, I think in terms of like how we get responses, we need to know like at baseline, each person who's answering the survey, how did they get to school today?

109
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:50,502
And,

110
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,840
does that meet their needs?

111
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,443
And if it doesn't, what is it that they would identify as the thing that would meet their needs?

112
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:13,549
So as an example, my ninth grader walks to school, and that meets my needs because we live less than a half a mile from the high school.

113
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:24,192
I might feel differently if my ninth grader walked to school, but we live two miles from the high school, which technically means she's supposed to walk to school.

114
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:29,816
And I might say, in that case, my kid walks to school, but it does not meet my needs.

115
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:36,022
And I would like the district to provide transportation so that she doesn't have to walk two miles to school.

116
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:42,887
So I think understanding how it works today for the respondents

117
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:55,804
whether that meets their needs or not, and if it doesn't, like what would, I think is an important way to think about how we want to drive out these questions.

118
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:13,851
And I think it maybe is both of those things, Member Rheinfeld, like maybe it is like, is it that I need the district to do something different, or I need to do something different, like what, you know, is it that,

119
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:18,787
there's some barrier that's not allowing me to do the thing that I want to do?

120
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:24,312
Or is it simply like, I need a yellow bus to come pick up my kid in order for me to say that this meets my needs?

121
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:28,417
And I think we're going to get a whole bunch of different answers.

122
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:38,307
But when it relates to like students, the high school students in particular, I think one question, you know, I would sort of want to dial in on is like, if they are

123
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,846
using a bus to get to school today, what kind of bus are they using?

124
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,267
And like, does that meet their needs?

125
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:59,733
And if it doesn't, what would, which might help us understand, like the MBTA question around like, what are the preferences of the students riding and their families for that matter?

126
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,595
So that we can

127
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:11,985
respond accordingly, you know, and consider like what that means for us.

128
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,969
I'm going to share this document.

129
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,972
So is this being created in your personal Gmail or in school?

130
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:22,913
Okay, just check.

131
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:23,593
Nope.

132
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:27,296
I hate that.

133
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,259
I also, I think that

134
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:42,352
As you were just speaking, I was wondering about whether or not, you know, looking at the survey, Safe Routes to School survey, this appears to be a survey to parents.

135
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:51,037
And I think that's an important group to ask.

136
00:14:51,977 --> 00:15:00,842
We have questions for parents, caregivers, but I feel like there needs to be questions

137
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:06,491
to the users, the students as well, especially for the high school.

138
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:12,256
And I feel like they're very different kinds of questions.

139
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:14,798
Oh, it is.

140
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,319
OK.

141
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,360
And high school students.

142
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,301
Thank you, Tom.

143
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:23,386
Good.

144
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:27,209
Looking at their data, though, I'm frankly nervous.

145
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:40,648
Each day, the morning and the afternoon, transportation, the data broken up by each of those, which is 10 different things, which, of course, makes sense to want that.

146
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:44,311
It's a lot of data.

147
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:51,216
And I'm hopeful we don't have to replicate anything that we have coming out of Safe Routes to Schools survey.

148
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:57,981
Hopefully, we can scratch it off the list instead of asking those questions again.

149
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:06,805
Well, I'm not convinced, well, first of all, I'm not convinced that we would even have access to that data in a raw form, right?

150
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:14,727
Like this is, I mean, I suppose we could ask for it, but more than likely we're going to get a report, right?

151
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:23,689
That provides, I think we're going to have to ask some, maybe some questions more than, you know, again, because I think we would want to be able to attribute them

152
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:31,635
within our own data set, right?

153
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,636
And Megan, I'm so glad that you're able to join us.

154
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:53,084
I know that you and I have talked about this a few times like over the course of time, but I'm curious, you know, based on what your office feels in terms of questions about transportation, like what's on your mind as we think about like what people, what information we need to get from people?

155
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:00,592
Oh, you can't unmute.

156
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:02,253
Hold on.

157
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:02,993
Oh.

158
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:04,753
Did it go?

159
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:05,834
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:07,934
OK, there we go.

161
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,075
So I mean, we certainly.

162
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:19,437
So I, you know, I am right in the middle of it because I know what can be done with the resources as they exist and then what the policies say.

163
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:28,040
So if we were to change some of the policies to meet some of the the unmet demands of the families, we wouldn't be able to meet those.

164
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,021
policy demands now because we don't have the infrastructure for it.

165
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,662
So this bus driver shortage thing is so real.

166
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:50,089
However, I'm with you, Jenny, that like the hardest part was we cracked down a little bit on the policy distances and we got rid of some bus stops that were, especially at the elementary school level, we got rid of some bus stops that were inside the one mile mark.

167
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:53,630
So we weren't obligated by policy to bus those students.

168
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,411
And then the families just, you know, they got savvy and they just walked up to the next bus stop.

169
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,532
And it was like 30 kids.

170
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:16,557
And so, you know, I was preparing myself to crack down on those 30 kids, but I was thinking specifically about which families they were, what neighborhood they come from, and what the sort of PR fallout of having such a huge group all at once would be.

171
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:27,162
I mean, I know that that's, that's, that's, you know, a lot of kind of anecdotal parts of the details, but it's an important part for this group to be thinking about.

172
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:34,566
But I think that what I would see a lot of is to rethink those policies because they are too far.

173
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:48,703
and we as a district, and I'm committed to doing this this summer, need to also commit to kind of rebuilding community to talk to them about how to not be super scared of walking to school.

174
00:18:49,343 --> 00:19:02,789
So luckily, the new manager at Eastern Bus and I, we have just a sort of plan in place for this summer that we're gonna, she's gonna, we're gonna drive all the routes together and she's gonna make them more efficient and we're gonna make them,

175
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,911
to policy so that we're not taking too many kids that are not eligible.

176
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:20,036
And I'm going to reach out and talk to families in the neighborhoods that have historically been kind of like getting on the bus but they're not eligible to and offer meetups.

177
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:26,479
I'm going to work with the Metro Family Network where it's appropriate to offer meetups to be like, let's all walk to school together.

178
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,239
And this is where

179
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,701
I'd like to work with Ellery.

180
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:36,925
Ellery reached out to me, and I haven't had a chance to get back to her about Safe Routes to School to find out what resources we have to do this.

181
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:49,392
It's sort of teaching people how to walk to school, which sounds funny that we need to be so explicit about it, but we do, and introducing people like, this is who you would walk with, and it's okay.

182
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:51,753
You can trust your kids with these people to walk to school.

183
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:55,006
I don't know.

184
00:19:55,046 --> 00:20:01,028
Those are a lot of anecdotal stories, but that's what I'm constantly working between.

185
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:07,489
The push of families saying, it's too far for my kids to walk, so I need a seat on the bus.

186
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,170
And the bus is all being overcrowded because there's a driver shortage.

187
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,931
So even students that are eligible, there aren't enough seats, and so the bus has become unsafe.

188
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:22,533
And the pushback that I want to give to say, we need to build some independence in the kids and start walking with them.

189
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:26,135
So that's where we are with that.

190
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:34,297
But as far as at the high school level, adding yellow buses at the high school, I've just done informal surveys with those students.

191
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:39,998
I would love to see a formal survey with actual student voice to find out how they feel about that.

192
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:51,660
Because I think that if we went to the expense of adding the yellow buses for all of the high school students that are eligible for them, we would have a lot of empty buses.

193
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,780
Hi, Lucy, I'm sorry, I'm on a Zoom call.

194
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:02,708
We would have a lot of yellow buses that were barely full and it would be very expensive.

195
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:18,120
In fact, I did the math once and said that it would be cheaper for us to pay for all of the MBTA M cards for every student in the high school than it would be to have the 14 required yellow buses to bus every kid.

196
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:21,143
Now,

197
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,263
Again, I don't know how many of the kids would use those, so that would be a waste.

198
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:35,490
The other part about this is what a waste of money it feels like, because when we were paying for MBTA buses for students, we could tell that a lot of them weren't even using them.

199
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:45,238
So we were spending $30 on a month for students, just in case one day a week that they might use it, but otherwise they were getting a ride from their friends, or they were driving themselves, or they were getting it from their parents.

200
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,543
So that didn't, that was just painful to watch all that money kind of fly out the window.

201
00:21:51,763 --> 00:22:04,913
So I think that the high school survey would be very valuable, very interesting to see and their parents, you know, because we just got an email today from a parent saying that she's very uncomfortable with her student driving in cars with friends and that he does take the yellow bus.

202
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:08,395
And so I think the parent's voice needs to be in that survey as well.

203
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:09,196
Yeah.

204
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:10,417
Yeah.

205
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:13,359
And then Megan, I know the,

206
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:19,140
the questions or the concerns probably are different at different levels, right?

207
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:28,107
Like at elementary, I would expect to see lots of different kinds of feedback than at middle school and at high school.

208
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:42,499
So I'm curious if there are other questions, like what else do we want to know about in terms of our bus

209
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:50,998
ridership, I guess I'll say, or transportation that we haven't talked about so far.

210
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:55,481
And one thing that comes to mind is like some explicit questions about late busing.

211
00:22:56,502 --> 00:23:04,347
And so I know, you know, over the years, that's even been a question at the elementary school level, like there have been a handful of instances where we've provided

212
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:15,274
yellow late buses to programs at the elementary school, although it always struck me as like a one-off thing that was sort of happening.

213
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:27,356
Yeah, the only one I know about that was when we had ESSER funding and we were doing sort of tutoring, like ESSER, the catch up tutoring for elementary school.

214
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:29,257
And so we provided transportation for that.

215
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:30,217
Right, right.

216
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:38,119
And so, but I think late busing in general is a question that we should probably try to get the answer to.

217
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,860
I know I've heard like, and I sort of wondered about this for forever.

218
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,221
My middle schooler does after school sports.

219
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:48,741
They're very scheduled.

220
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:50,042
They're totally predictable.

221
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,663
They start after the late bus leaves the middle school.

222
00:23:53,743 --> 00:24:07,929
It feels a little bit insane that we would have a school-sponsored activity and we would intentionally start it after transportation options exist for the kids.

223
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:12,410
When I think of the late bus, I think of that.

224
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,052
My kids, because when they're in middle school, they ride past the high school.

225
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:24,138
they report about overcrowding on days where there's middle school athletes going from the middle school to the high school.

226
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:30,863
I hear the same thing about the library, which is a hot spot for middle school dating, which always makes me giggle.

227
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:42,552
So there's like sort of hot spots around the city that sort of flare up at different times of the day that I think are worth sort of pursuing as well.

228
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:45,795
I see somebody from,

229
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,599
Is that Peter, is that you with your hand in the air?

230
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:51,236
It is.

231
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:55,818
I was thinking that one question might be specifically around what you were saying.

232
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,018
The late bus tier.

233
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:12,903
Some districts do have two tiers of light buses now realizing that's an additional cost, but they have a say like a 330 late bus and then maybe a 630 or 6 o'clock late bus once activities after school things of that nature are done.

234
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:16,304
So that might be an additional question to ask.

235
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:19,385
I think another thing that needs to be very clearly articulated

236
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:29,527
is that the survey needs to be filled out for each individual student, not each individual family, especially if they have multiple at various schools.

237
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:30,687
I don't know if that was stated.

238
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,848
I also just spoke with our rep from Safe Routes to School.

239
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:41,369
She is going to ask if we can't have access to the raw data.

240
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:46,990
It is normally a report shared with the principal, but she will ask if we can have access to the raw data.

241
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:53,439
That would be great.

242
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,060
Member Reinfeldt?

243
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:07,386
So I will note that Member Russo and several other members sat in on the Student Advisory Committee or Student Advisory Council meeting last week, and they raised some challenges with the busing.

244
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:16,050
Some of it was around how it is implemented at the schools in terms of stopping points and lines and crowding, and some of it was around timing.

245
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,069
Which school was this?

246
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:20,469
The high school.

247
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:21,289
High school, okay.

248
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:30,373
Yeah, so I would echo what member Russo said earlier that getting student feedback, certainly at the high school level, and I think the middle school level as well.

249
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:40,497
I think my question is, to what extent is this survey about the quality of the experiences of the services being provided versus the, you know,

250
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:46,456
the, which services should be provided and are going to be used.

251
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:59,444
Cause you know, the things that we keep hearing about, about overcrowding on the buses or lack of bus monitor or vaping on the middle school bus, those sorts of questions, as you say, distinguishing fact from fiction, how prevalent are these issues?

252
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,865
I saw Megan's hand go up, so.

253
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:10,210
Yeah, just cause my, my only fear about asking for an evaluation of the, you know, the quality of the service would just be opening up a ramp

254
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,839
CAVE, you know, so that's that would be my worry and and.

255
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:25,946
And especially because we know why we have an explanation for why some of the things are not working well, it's partly this driver shortage.

256
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:32,712
You know, and so if we didn't know and everything was working the way it was, we were fully staffed, everything was great.

257
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:35,694
And then people told us like, no, it's not exactly what we want.

258
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:36,955
I think that would be more valuable.

259
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:50,425
But like right now to say that the buses are overcrowded or the bus drivers are grumpy when we're in a position where we can't really address, we can't afford to fire anybody.

260
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:57,130
I mean- I think my question there is to, is it,

261
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,643
Can we phrase those things in terms of obstacles?

262
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:07,086
Are people not putting their kids on the bus because of X, Y, or Z reasons?

263
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,947
So I think that phrasing is useful.

264
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:11,347
And Russo?

265
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:15,889
Yes, I think I certainly understand Megan's concern.

266
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:19,171
Nobody really wants a report that says, my God, everything's terrible.

267
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:27,354
Especially when we, first of all, I'm not saying everything is terrible, but when we know there are problems and we know what they are and we know the solution,

268
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,488
and right now that is not solvable.

269
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:38,652
I do think there's value, however, in understanding it because it provides us with a priority list.

270
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:48,557
You know, when we decide how to spend money, which we don't have enough of, I think knowing, you know,

271
00:28:49,814 --> 00:29:00,224
If 92% of all students who ride our transportation think it's the worst thing that they've ever experienced in their lives, that's different than 20% complaining.

272
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:10,434
And it'll help us understand in the context of other services in the district that we don't provide or can't provide or might be cutting or whatever else.

273
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:39,066
You know, I think one thing about the survey in general that worries me is, like other surveys we have done, such as our superintendent search, which is the one that is most prevalent in my mind, because I did the survey, not alone, but is we really struggle with outreach is an understatement.

274
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:44,770
The people that responded to the superintendent search, to say they were not a slice of Medford

275
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:50,528
a representative slice of Medford is the biggest understatement I could possibly ever say.

276
00:29:51,289 --> 00:30:00,275
And so, I mean, I appreciated all of their feedback and we got a very good number, but like the number one income level for people that responded was over $250,000.

277
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:04,398
And that is not the average of Medford.

278
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:11,423
So I worry about how we can get a meaningful set of responses

279
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:21,516
So that we are, first of all, not skewing the data so much into just people with a grudge, which is always a concern.

280
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:32,578
But I also, you know, the late school bus stuff that was just brought up, you know, I don't know how many times I can tell my story, but some of the faces on the screen changed.

281
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:36,118
So, but, you know, I lived in a rural district.

282
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:39,379
I was the furthest student from the school.

283
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,496
the furthest student.

284
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:47,861
And to say it was well over an hour each way every day was no exaggeration.

285
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:50,484
And there were no late buses at all.

286
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:58,891
And I participated in exactly zero after school activities my entire 7 through 12 education, because it was a 7 through 12 high school.

287
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:05,437
So I think, you know, certainly my strong preference is that we prioritize stuff like that, because

288
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:12,672
Now, granted, this is not rural New Hampshire with 13 towns going to one school far, far away.

289
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:18,015
It is definitely a different situation and there might be alternatives.

290
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:26,259
But I'm just very sensitive to our students not participating in activities because transportation is the reason they can't.

291
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,964
And how we get at those students and get those answers, I don't know.

292
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:46,072
But I think that should definitely be a priority because they're the people who are not necessarily getting served at all.

293
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:50,576
May I share a map of our school radiuses?

294
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:52,217
Sure.

295
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,980
All right.

296
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,883
So these are our schools.

297
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:00,997
Oh, my toolbar's in the way.

298
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:02,137
There it goes.

299
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:14,300
Right, and so this is within half a mile, and then the lighter shading is one mile, and then these dotted lines are the three miles.

300
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:26,242
So particularly when we're looking, right, Fulton Heights, I know we do a bus at the high school here, but we've also got a lot of outside the radius for the high school, and a lot of these neighborhoods

301
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:29,263
are a particular demographic.

302
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:32,606
And so there's a huge equity issue and understanding.

303
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:38,329
I love Megan's idea of reaching out specifically to families, right?

304
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:43,833
The elementary schools have these radii, but even some of that is not being heard.

305
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:45,929
captured in this.

306
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:51,592
And then there's also, I think, the stigma issue that needs to be talked about, right?

307
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:54,853
Riding a bus, the kids who are able to park.

308
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:57,135
Is parking free for high school students?

309
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:58,345
Yes.

310
00:32:58,985 --> 00:32:59,265
Okay.

311
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:03,706
But that of course requires owning a car or having access to a car.

312
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:20,511
And so I don't know to what extent stigma is informing, you know, we can ask about how would your behavior change if we made these changes, but some of it is not, some of it is really rooted in, you know what, even if you give me these buses, I wouldn't take them.

313
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:33,406
or even if I knew how to walk to school, I wouldn't, or my family, my parent drives past the school every day, and so they drop me off, and I'm never gonna switch to something else.

314
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:43,670
So what we're hoping to accomplish, is there an ideal situation that we want to achieve here, or is it just, you know,

315
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:55,868
Yeah, I think in my mind, if we can craft the questions correctly, like we can ask people about what they do today and is it.

316
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:57,919
Is it their preference?

317
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,240
And if it's not, why not?

318
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,923
So that we can acknowledge that not everybody has the same.

319
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:10,826
My mom drives by the high school every day, and she's going to drop me off.

320
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,587
And that's my preferred way to get there, right?

321
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:14,668
I'm fine with that.

322
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:22,792
And if you sent a yellow bus to my driveway, I wouldn't take it because I'm going to get in my mom's car, and she's going to drop me off, right?

323
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:28,348
I don't have a parent that can drop me off.

324
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,129
And so I walk a mile to school every day.

325
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:31,770
I think those are different things.

326
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,993
And I think individually, it's impossible to make everybody happy.

327
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:46,960
But I think if you can get enough response to the survey, so back to outreach, if you can get enough response to the survey, you can see trend.

328
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,662
And you can see global preferences.

329
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:58,210
And that data might be useful in order for us to be able to say.

330
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:06,230
you know what, like the high school kids have no issues at all with the MBTA buses bringing them to and from school.

331
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,711
What they care about is that they're late.

332
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:14,275
For example, like maybe they care, maybe they don't care what the bus looks like, but they care that they can get to school on time, right?

333
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:19,419
And so I'm fine with the MBTA, but it makes me late every day.

334
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,382
And that was actually their complaint that they're too busy and they're crowded.

335
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,272
Yeah.

336
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:34,722
So I think there's like a lot of different like, you know, when you talk about like what works for people, like what works for people works for them and not necessarily for anybody else.

337
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:43,490
But I mean, there is a finite number of versions of what exists versus what we would like it to be.

338
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,495
And I think we could see if we can get enough participation, like I think we could see

339
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:59,590
something that informs like, are we trying to expand the number of buses we have and by how many, for example, or by none?

340
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:02,472
Like maybe the survey says like, none is the right answer.

341
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:03,653
I don't know.

342
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:05,594
Peter, did you have your hand in the air?

343
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:08,075
Yeah, I do.

344
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:08,996
Quick question.

345
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:15,160
Member Reinfeldt, what year, I wasn't able to see, what year was that data from on those radii?

346
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,901
That is a great question.

347
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:18,942
Let me find it again.

348
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,402
And the only reason I ask is we are actually working with the city and safe routes to update those.

349
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,923
So I can provide as soon as we have it, I can provide them.

350
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:36,466
We've sent the addresses in with no identifying information to do that.

351
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,346
So we are working on that right now.

352
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:49,050
The other thing too, just to consider when it comes to parking is, there may be a project, there will be a project in the next few years that may significantly limit

353
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,852
high school parking.

354
00:36:51,232 --> 00:37:00,667
And so it's just something as we're considering transportation moving forward, you know, the effects of reduced student parking potentially in the future.

355
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:09,879
I was actually going to bring that up, Peter, in a slightly different way.

356
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:31,752
But, you know, aside from the probable need to have less parking available, assuming that the high school is done where it is now, there's also the need to understand when we, you know, if we are building a whole new high school, how much parking lot are we building?

357
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:48,501
I don't suspect the MSBA actually will have an answer for that in some formula, but they may have a formula for like minimums or something, but that we probably have more than is normal just because of the lot we have right now.

358
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:58,488
So understanding if we end up having to have less parking, how much less can we have before it becomes a

359
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:16,270
a real problem, you know, because also the parking is, for me, is about the, you know, the ins and outs of the high school, getting your kid in and out for parents and for buses and for students that are driving.

360
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:22,775
You know, the current setup is, of course, everybody can agree is terrible.

361
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:28,080
And whether or how much we

362
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:34,684
think about and care about that in a new design, it kind of matters.

363
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:43,709
If we were to change the pattern and make it work beautifully, would we suddenly have far more people driving their kids to school?

364
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:45,770
Would we have far more students trying to park?

365
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:56,389
You know, that kind of a change, if it was not so painful, I think there might be more people who are like, I'll just drop you off at school.

366
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:04,993
Because I know that on Wildwood, across from the high school, people are lined up there early.

367
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:06,834
I'm sometimes one of them.

368
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:11,696
And we won't even go up to the high school, because it's so awful.

369
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:15,948
Yeah.

370
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:18,870
Understanding what people might want to do.

371
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,092
I feel like there is two things here.

372
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:25,755
The evaluation of what they have, but then there's sort of the blue sky.

373
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:34,841
If let's pretend we were building a Medford High from scratch and we didn't have students and we were just creating a high school from the beginning, what would people want?

374
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:40,645
Which isn't necessarily what they would do, but I don't feel like we know that at all.

375
00:39:44,905 --> 00:40:01,429
I think the other thing that I hear about often, well, and usually like at the beginning of the year, is that there are times where our reliance on MBTA buses is like misaligned with what service they're going to provide, right?

376
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,370
So like when we

377
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:08,768
when we start school in August, right?

378
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:11,671
It's like, oh, we don't have service those days.

379
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:12,351
Sorry, guys.

380
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,993
Get yourselves to school some other way.

381
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:28,065
So I think the other sort of thing I'm interested in, I think my other interest in doing the survey is to be able to present a really full picture of transportation in the district.

382
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:38,917
you know, like, dispel the fiction, right, wherever it exists, and describe, like, what we do and why.

383
00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:53,102
So for example, like, I'm under the impression, I could be totally wrong, that we don't have late start snow days because the MBTA buses aren't going to get our kids to school if we put a two-hour delay on.

384
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,742
I could be completely wrong about that.

385
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:55,883
I have no idea.

386
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:58,877
That's what I've always heard.

387
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:01,263
That's what I tell people if they ask me.

388
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:05,153
But we also, I think, need to be able to...

389
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:17,212
sort of like layout, like here's what we do transportation wise and why, so that we own our story.

390
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:28,121
So like Megan, my sort of immediate reaction to you saying like, we know what the problems are, was my thought was like, I don't think anybody knows that you know what the problems are.

391
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,148
Like, I don't think the community thinks that at all.

392
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,734
Like, I don't think they think we have a handle on it at all.

393
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:41,463
And that is like, you know, Medford dies hard around being disorganized.

394
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:49,820
So I think if we have answers to these questions, this is also an opportunity for us to say, here's what the data tells us about this survey.

395
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:55,303
And like, here's like a level set of what we do and why and like what we're already working on.

396
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,865
So like, I think you're working on lots of great things.

397
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:00,926
I just don't think anybody knows about it.

398
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,747
And it's always a timing issue, right?

399
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:04,888
Like when do you tell people?

400
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:07,129
that you're working on something.

401
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:16,214
And I think we have a lot of history around like misfiring on that timing question, you know, in all kinds of ways.

402
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:21,337
But this could be an opportunity for us to say, like, as we go forward, here's what we're looking at.

403
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:25,960
And we have a set of recommendations based on the data and our current practice.

404
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,902
And the recommendation is, we're going to change the

405
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:55,157
you know the one mile radius to one and a half miles or we're going to change the two mile radius to one mile like whatever those things are that we're going to decide out of this like this is an opportunity for us to strategically say like this is the need this is what we have and this is where this is like this is what we think we should do over the next x years and that's how we're going to go forward with a plan um around you know all things transportation

406
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:13,126
I think the other question I have is like how do we wrap in all the transportation like the individualized transportation that the district provides because I think that's an important aspect to all of this is to make sure we understand that piece of it too and how

407
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:35,000
you know, what the set of questions are around that individualized transportation, whether it's to schools within our district or schools that are out of district, like what, you know, we have to sort of craft some questions about that as well for the impacted individuals who, who take that kind of transportation from the district.

408
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,182
Megan, did you have a question or a hand up?

409
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:45,888
Oh, yeah.

410
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:46,749
Okay, there we go.

411
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:47,049
Thanks.

412
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,257
Um, no, I was, uh, let me go back and think if I can remember it.

413
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:57,804
Um, yeah, I would love to have the sort of place to

414
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:04,706
sort of, I don't know if it's airing dirty laundry, but sort of give our reasons, our stories.

415
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:13,590
And like, because nobody has, nobody likes to hear the answer of where there's a driver shortage.

416
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,431
It's unbelievable.

417
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:15,992
People are like, so what?

418
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:16,732
That's your problem.

419
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:17,432
Make it happen.

420
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,553
Tell the company that they've got to figure it out.

421
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:19,954
And I'm like,

422
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:42,499
the company is working with us so closely and she calls me every time she's got a new person that they're training and she calls me every time that there's somebody that they had to let go for like safety reasons that we all support so but but for strategic planning I agree with you and we should be planning it not like like assuming it's going to get better um and I do like the ideas of the survey

423
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,982
I wanna walk back my thoughts on not evaluating it because I do hear what you're saying.

424
00:44:48,002 --> 00:44:50,143
Do you guys need me to close this door?

425
00:44:50,203 --> 00:44:50,803
Is it too noisy?

426
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:51,984
No, we can't hear it at all.

427
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:53,244
Okay, good.

428
00:44:54,245 --> 00:45:06,952
To walk back because I do hear, see the value in knowing whether the reason people aren't using it is because they've heard of these bad things about it, because that would be important, or they've heard, or there's a discomfort about it.

429
00:45:07,032 --> 00:45:10,193
I think that that would be valuable information to know that more people would be using it.

430
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,451
So I just wanted to say that part too.

431
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:17,653
There was something else, but I, I'm sorry, I got distracted by the.

432
00:45:17,693 --> 00:45:19,994
No, it's okay.

433
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:21,955
Thank you.

434
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:22,535
Bye Jerry.

435
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:34,182
Um, um, you know, um, yesterday I believe Framingham, uh, public schools voted to take all transportation in house and,

436
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:45,231
because apparently they need 77 drivers, but they have 54, which to say that creates problems, I just can't even fathom.

437
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:46,973
How does anybody even get to school at all?

438
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:50,377
And now that Jerry's not on the call,

439
00:45:54,228 --> 00:45:55,108
I'm kidding.

440
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:56,869
I mean, I would have said it if he was on the call still.

441
00:45:56,949 --> 00:46:02,110
But when we talk about driver shortages, we really are also not talking about driver shortages.

442
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:13,073
There are enough human beings to drive buses and enough human beings that would be willing to drive buses, but not for the wages that bus companies pay.

443
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:20,314
But when I think about what they're doing over in Framingham, these are probably going to be a unionized group.

444
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:23,275
They're going to have benefits and retirement, and they're going to get paid.

445
00:46:24,403 --> 00:46:27,784
a boatload more than any bus company was ever going to pay them.

446
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:32,444
And I'll bet they won't have as much trouble finding any bus drivers.

447
00:46:32,765 --> 00:46:42,466
So, you know, I realize this particular fiscal year is probably not the year to have that conversation, but the bus driver shortage is not a real thing.

448
00:46:43,186 --> 00:46:46,987
It is a made-up thing because we refuse to pay people a reasonable wage.

449
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:52,948
We have a bus driver shortage when McDonald's has to shut down because they can't get workers.

450
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:55,319
But they don't shut down.

451
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,501
So they're our workers.

452
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:03,146
And I'm not trying to, this is not an attack on you, Megan, or anything.

453
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:05,908
I understand that's how this is talked about.

454
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:11,753
But I think it's just really important to talk about it as it really is.

455
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:16,377
We somehow want people, it's the same with the after school conversation.

456
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:23,676
There are people who could work those jobs if we were willing to actually provide the benefits and retirement and enough pay.

457
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:24,876
That's a reality.

458
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:27,657
I mean, come on, we all know that.

459
00:47:28,498 --> 00:47:30,959
So, Framingham's doing this.

460
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,320
It'll be very interesting to see how it works.

461
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,081
And I realize financially they're a very different district.

462
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:38,782
I think the Student Opportunity Act has been kind to them.

463
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:45,965
And so they may well, in fact, be flushed with cash to be able to do something like this that we couldn't do right now.

464
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:56,662
The other thing, though, is I signed the warrants, and I see what we pay to transport our students out of district.

465
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:08,566
We pay per student more than we pay assistant superintendents, like $6,000, $8,000 per student.

466
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:14,259
go to school 20 days a month.

467
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:36,028
So, and actually, I don't know if that works out to being what I have to pretend to make, as soon as we pretend it makes, but my point is just that's far more than we would ever pay a unionized retirement eligibles and benefits eligible person to do that work, far more.

468
00:48:37,804 --> 00:48:48,654
And so, you know, I get that there's not a lot of time and a lot of energy and it takes a lot of energy and money to talk about getting ahead of it.

469
00:48:48,814 --> 00:48:49,976
It's like you're always...

470
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:52,891
a day behind on this kind of thing.

471
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,613
Oh, we have a student, we got to transport.

472
00:48:54,913 --> 00:48:59,097
Well, you're not going to like, okay, let's post a job for a new person to come and become our driver.

473
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:03,783
Like, no, the person has to be trans, the student has to be transported tomorrow morning, starting tomorrow.

474
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,186
And so how do we get ahead of that?

475
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:08,227
Because I don't,

476
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:15,012
know the exact numbers, but we spend a shocking amount of money on out-of-district transportation.

477
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:30,060
And there is just, I mean, without a spreadsheet in front of me, there's like no way we cannot do that for less if we just hire people ourselves, take the hit, put them in the pension and salary and all that other stuff.

478
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,442
There's just no way that it's cheaper.

479
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:38,225
And it also is a huge amount of effort for our staff to be on the constant

480
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:46,300
treadmill of trying to find a new person to, you know, find a company that's willing to transport a student.

481
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:49,702
Some of that stuff doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

482
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:56,485
And it's some of this is this isn't really about the survey, though, I don't think.

483
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:01,847
Because a lot of this, I think it's about sort of what do you do with the survey afterwards, right, which is okay.

484
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:02,628
I think that's fine.

485
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:04,692
Yeah, I think that's a good point.

486
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,555
It's like, you know, we're going to get data from students.

487
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:08,676
We're going to get data from parents.

488
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:13,481
But we already also have a lot of data of our own that is very relevant to this.

489
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:18,125
And I appreciate that electrification of fleet was just put there, because then I don't have to say it.

490
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:27,535
Did the students at the Student Advisory Council meeting have other transportation-related things to talk about?

491
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:33,773
Yeah, so they raised five concerns, and I just need to find that tab that has it.

492
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:37,394
So there are five concerns.

493
00:50:37,474 --> 00:50:38,135
Where did it go?

494
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:39,775
Wait, nope, that's your document.

495
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:40,835
This one's my document.

496
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:41,916
All right.

497
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:44,096
Was... Oh.

498
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:54,424
I have it right here.

499
00:50:54,744 --> 00:51:06,094
Yeah, it was the student safety in the bus lines, the setting designated arrival and departure position positions to reduce crowding more buses for North Medford and other underserved areas.

500
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:09,176
The route 101 was running every.

501
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:18,381
five and 10 minutes, and it wasn't consistent as to when the arrival time was, and it wasn't time to accommodate people staying late, so that's your late bus question.

502
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:26,905
And then the 95, either comes very early, very late, the early bus is very crowded, the late bus doesn't get people to their jobs on time.

503
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:30,486
Member Russo, did I miss anything?

504
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:36,049
You did not.

505
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:36,909
Okay.

506
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:38,990
So I think we have a lot of

507
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:45,639
Well, I think we have a lot of questions to answer in the context of the survey.

508
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:50,420
Well, I think a potential setup is just the baseline.

509
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,540
What do you do now?

510
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:55,442
What would you like to do?

511
00:51:55,702 --> 00:52:03,884
Or do we have questions about getting fewer people taking buses, more bike pool, more walk pools?

512
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:05,945
But what do you do now?

513
00:52:07,282 --> 00:52:10,405
what would you do if the options were there for you?

514
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:14,329
And what are the obstacles to getting to those ideals?

515
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:24,017
Whether it's walking, biking, buses, carpools, parking.

516
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:29,503
I think that is how this is shaking out for me in assessing what you do.

517
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:33,644
what would you anticipate doing?

518
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:37,425
And I wanna recognize Megan's point that there's some education around that.

519
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:43,227
I think we could absolutely aim to have fewer cars in the school drop-offs and pickup lines.

520
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:45,347
That's gonna be some education.

521
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:54,050
There's gonna be some resistance in the community, but understanding what the barriers are for walking, biking, carpools, busing.

522
00:52:55,792 --> 00:53:05,294
is important, so where you're going, and that's specifically what the obstacles are, or as I asked in the beginning of the call, what could we do to facilitate your ideal situation?

523
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:09,215
But I think obstacles is probably the way to go on that.

524
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:17,097
That's what people are experiencing, is they're saying, oh, I'm not doing this because X, Y, or Z. Okay.

525
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:18,057
Member Rousseau?

526
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:24,127
We also did hear actually, I didn't write it in my notes, but I remember it now from the meeting.

527
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:39,054
Students, I don't know how many, but some students are not biking to school because the city made the decision to not do the safe.

528
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:40,254
Protected bike lanes.

529
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:41,955
Thank you, protected bike lanes.

530
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:47,157
So that was a decision the city made to allow for some parking spots.

531
00:53:49,345 --> 00:53:55,290
And the consequences are that there are more people getting other ways.

532
00:53:56,271 --> 00:54:00,574
I don't sense that the people who would have been biking to school are instead getting on the bus.

533
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,195
They probably have a parent dropping them off.

534
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:08,120
And so, you know, when the city makes decisions like that, there are consequences.

535
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,244
And I think that we have to remember that

536
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:25,376
Again, getting back to the project that is the big project that's happening, there are intersections between the city's decisions and our goals.

537
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:28,417
Because I think having many kids biking to school would be great.

538
00:54:28,857 --> 00:54:34,219
I frankly don't want to have many kids biking to school if we once a year have to go to a funeral.

539
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,862
So that's the blunt reality of not having protected lanes.

540
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:44,164
I wouldn't let my kids ride a bike to school.

541
00:54:47,625 --> 00:55:04,991
For whatever it's worth, the city, I spoke to Todd Blake, city engineer, and they're saying they're in the process of mapping the school addresses of students who take the bus and kind of looking at which roads are getting the traffic and what kind of shape they're in.

542
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:10,893
So there's some coordination with the city once we have these results as well.

543
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:15,080
but they're interested in understanding that.

544
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:23,254
Especially since I will note that a lot of these neighborhoods have changed since I imagine the last time we did any kind of transportation assessment.

545
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:29,263
We only have a few minutes left, and I want to be mindful of the time.

546
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:31,563
I think this was a really, really good discussion.

547
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:37,284
And Megan and I can take some work on to craft some questions and things like that.

548
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:46,786
But I think the other question, to your point about outreach, I think we do need to think about how do we get participation.

549
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:50,067
I think we certainly

550
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:56,165
You know, we could think about, like, the timing of the survey and when it goes out.

551
00:55:56,205 --> 00:56:04,752
Like, are we interested in this going out, like, in September when we can, like, send it with, like, all the other paperwork that goes home and ask people to do it?

552
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:06,294
Is that a terrible time of year?

553
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:12,939
So really interested in, like, what the right timing of this is that would allow us to

554
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:24,366
collect good data and still position us to use the data to inform any sort of RFP we need to do for our yellow bus service next year.

555
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:36,572
But also think about what are the mechanisms where we are the most likely to be able to convince people to do this?

556
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,114
And how do we capitalize on

557
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:51,873
high participation kinds of moments to get people to engage.

558
00:56:51,913 --> 00:57:03,198
I think students, we have options like using their advisory blocks, and we can even have a drawing of some kind.

559
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:07,580
We could do something that incentives people to reply from a student perspective.

560
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,202
I think that's less, what's the right word?

561
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:22,774
motivating maybe to parents who are like, I get 100 emails a day, I'm not going to take the time to do this right for a $5 gift card.

562
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:31,665
But, you know, are there other reasons why I think there's a swath of families that will be highly motivated to do this, but I am equally concerned that

563
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:40,948
we want to hear maybe more from the families who don't fill it out, or at least as much.

564
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:45,369
So how do we create a way to get to them too?

565
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:47,209
Member Rousseau?

566
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,110
Thank you.

567
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:58,612
You know, when I was looking at the state schools survey results, you know, while they have this like morning, afternoon, a beach day thing, which I think is great, and you see some fascinating variability,

568
00:58:00,307 --> 00:58:20,703
I kind of, I'm struck that there's, and believe me, nobody wants to put out a survey with 350 questions, but I am struck by the fact that there seems to be no recognition that what you do in January versus what you do in May and September

569
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:30,249
If you're a hardcore biker, you may be like, all right, we have two feet of snow this entire February, every Monday, and maybe I won't bike.

570
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,131
There's no seasonality.

571
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:32,731
That's the word.

572
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:37,235
And I'm hoping that Safe Schools is always like, this is the date.

573
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,877
Otherwise, that data seems like that would be a little questionable.

574
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:44,460
But it seems important also because

575
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:50,893
If we put the survey out in September, it's beautiful out.

576
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:52,895
People who want to bike are biking.

577
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:58,479
We may get a false sense of how much traffic there's going to be.

578
00:58:58,499 --> 00:59:03,924
And if we did some change, how much actual use of busing is there going to be.

579
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:07,907
Yeah, I just feel like that seasonality stuff.

580
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:09,388
And it isn't just seasonality.

581
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:10,149
I mean, it's weather.

582
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:13,171
I would put a slash weather on that because

583
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:21,456
I mean, I'm assuming that, you know, when the orchestra comes through, there might be fewer people biking.

584
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:23,857
Possibly.

585
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:30,622
Erika, remember, I know those things don't put her off, but for the less hearty of us.

586
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:32,483
Yeah.

587
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:39,050
OK, it's 531, so we'll wrap this up here.

588
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:45,756
If there is anything else that you all are thinking about, just go ahead and shoot me a note.

589
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:51,961
And then Megan, I will connect with you and we can find some time to get through the next steps here.

590
00:59:52,321 --> 01:00:00,587
And then once we have that, I will be back in touch to schedule another meeting for us to review, because the thing after that,

591
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:06,433
will be to bring this to the full committee, which I think we said we would do by June.

592
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:16,376
I'm noting Megan's comment in the chat here about asking families to sign up for the bus in May this year.

593
01:00:16,736 --> 01:00:27,618
Does that mean there's content you'd like to have ready with that sign up to say, you're not asking for a preliminary survey response, or we shouldn't try to push things to meet that?

594
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:39,475
Because if this is the moment when everyone's ready to talk about their transportation needs, I don't want to miss an opportunity.

595
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,117
No, I don't think that we should rush it.

596
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:55,699
I think that this is, especially because we're talking about the end of next year being when our contract is up, I think we should be thoughtful about this survey and take time and not try and squeeze it into this May.

597
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:08,963
I'm just asking for the signups in May so that we can better get a handle on who's signing up that's not eligible and if there's any rerouting that we need to do and notifying families ahead with plenty of time.

598
01:01:09,323 --> 01:01:10,743
It's just to buy myself more time.

599
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,584
I think that makes a lot of sense.

600
01:01:13,944 --> 01:01:32,209
Yeah, I think rushing the survey would be too much, but if we happen to have it ready to go, we might give it at the same time, saying nothing's changing yet, but we're just, you know, everything's in place for next year with some, you know, we reserved the right to make a couple of changes, but we just wanted to ask this survey for strategic planning for the future.

601
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,830
That's what I would recommend.

602
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:43,376
Member Graham, do you know if this kind of assessment is going to, for a new high school, would this be a separate effort to understand the needs there?

603
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:47,122
Um, good question.

604
01:01:47,142 --> 01:01:50,643
I think it can be, but I think if there's data that we can.

605
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:57,865
Like, use and leverage, we can certainly provide that to it would really be to the folks doing the feasibility study.

606
01:01:57,965 --> 01:02:04,427
So I think they, they would be interested in, like, sizing sort of what those needs are from a feasibility perspective.

607
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:07,348
So I think if we have input that we can provide them, that will be useful, but.

608
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:16,314
I assume that they also will have their own ways that they recommend sort of getting answers to those questions, so.

609
01:02:16,414 --> 01:02:20,658
Because I know building and grounds are separate entities for people.

610
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:23,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,563
So, yeah, I think probably both is the short answer.

612
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:28,404
Thanks.

613
01:02:28,424 --> 01:02:29,565
Okay.

614
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:32,307
I heard a motion to adjourn by Member Rousseau.

615
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:34,560
Oh, I can second that.

616
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:36,867
Seconded by Member Reinfeld.

617
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,011
So I'll do a roll call.

618
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:39,235
Member Reinfeld?

619
01:02:39,617 --> 01:02:39,878
Yes.

620
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,122
Member Rousseau?

621
01:02:41,804 --> 01:02:42,065
Yes.

622
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:43,048
Member Graham?

623
01:02:43,068 --> 01:02:43,349
Yes.

624
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,199
Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

625
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:47,102
The meeting is adjourned.

626
01:02:47,303 --> 01:02:48,206
Thank you, everyone.
