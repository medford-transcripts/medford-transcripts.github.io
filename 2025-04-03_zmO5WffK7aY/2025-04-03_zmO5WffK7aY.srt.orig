1
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:27,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Mic check one, two, mic check one, two, check microphone one, two.

2
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:34,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

3
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:43,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting.

4
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:46,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, will you please call the roll?

5
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:47,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

6
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

7
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:49,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lozaro?

8
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

9
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli is going to be absent tonight.

10
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Hsieng is going to be late.

11
00:19:58,272 --> 00:19:58,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lemming?

12
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

13
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:05,006
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Councilor saying told me that he's stuck in traffic.

14
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:16,652
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first thing that will be working on tonight is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for the month of April.

15
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:20,933
[SPEAKER_08]: For the sake of editing, I'm just going to hold on a minute.

16
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to share my screen real quickly.

17
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:46,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just got a new computer, so there does seem to be a bit of an issue with the sharing at the moment.

18
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, just opening settings.

19
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:13,898
[SPEAKER_08]: One moment, I'm just gonna have to quit and reopen Zoom.

20
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:16,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, new computer, so I'm just trying to share my screen.

21
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,822
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, going back into Zoom.

22
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:57,050
Yep.

23
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,292
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here's to be good.

24
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,934
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, perfect.

25
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

26
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:22,984
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we have a version of the Medford City Council newsletter, which was

27
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:29,408
[SPEAKER_08]: passed, which was created by Councillor Callaghan.

28
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:36,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing this paragraph here saying it was our first newsletter.

29
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:40,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So, oh wait, no, sorry, this is April 2024.

30
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:46,482
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sorry, this was the, my apologies, I had the April 2024, this is the March 2025 version open.

31
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:49,258
[SPEAKER_08]: bad window.

32
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:50,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

33
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:51,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Okie dokie.

34
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:03,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm also just going to, for this one, I'm just going to note here that we need to put in the note about the underlying words being

35
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:15,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we included, last time I know it, about the underlying words being linked to the previous newsletter.

36
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:29,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Got some, I believe Councilor Lozaro had some notes from Councilor Sang, who's running a little, who's stuck in traffic at the moment, saying he had some edits to the current draft of the newsletter.

37
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:34,726
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to share those really quickly, and I could just do the edits here.

38
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:36,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

39
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:37,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to do that.

40
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:45,878
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing he said is to make sure we link the city council's budget requests and individual counselor requests.

41
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:50,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my editorializing on that is probably we would want to

42
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:56,507
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight the ones that we ended up proposing to the mayor.

43
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: His second thing is, actually, do you want to take a second to do that, or should I go through all of them?

44
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:08,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually provide the hyperlinks during when I'm actually formatting.

45
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:19,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if he meant from the note that he just wanted us to provide hyperlinks to those documents, or if he wanted us to actually outline what individual, oh, he just, Councilor Sang is here now.

46
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:21,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

47
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:26,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Councillor Singh go for it.

48
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:36,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, we were, Councillor Singh, we were just talking about one of your notes to link to individual councillor requests for this.

49
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you mean just throw in hyperlinks during formatting or actually out?

50
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all I meant.

51
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:44,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right.

52
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:50,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I usually do that during the, I usually just do that during the formatting process.

53
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:51,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

54
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Make a quick explanation of what the Salem Street Corridor District in the green score is.

55
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:01,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okie dokie.

56
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:05,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the Salem Street Corridor District in the city's green score coordinates.

57
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:08,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe something like...

58
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:47,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that seem like a sufficient?

59
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:51,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

60
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:52,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

61
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:57,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And since we're talking about budget, okay.

62
00:25:59,144 --> 00:25:59,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

63
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:06,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for budget outreach at the discussions included to do.

64
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:15,642
[SPEAKER_10]: want to do.

65
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,062
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I also am wondering, so this is a slightly different formatting.

66
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:48,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally we would have like on March 4th and March 11th, blah, blah, blah happened, although the dates are noted here.

67
00:26:48,985 --> 00:27:01,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a little bit briefer, which is nice, but I'm wondering if the consistency of the format matters to anybody but me, Councilor Lazaro.

68
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate this formatting.

69
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the other formatting, I mean, for consistency, I think we were all well, I'll speak for myself, I was just trying to keep it consistent.

70
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:24,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was feeling redundant to have to repeat that phrasing the same way.

71
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:26,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I also kind of like that.

72
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:33,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, you know, regular city council meetings and it says March 11th as like a subheading.

73
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like that.

74
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:41,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I, I don't think anybody is too, um, is, is following our.

75
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:48,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this isn't true, but I'm not sure that there's anybody that's reading our newsletters with a fine tooth comb yet.

76
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:58,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, we may still be early enough in the process that we can try a few different things, um, and see which feels like the most efficient.

77
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:01,899
[SPEAKER_02]: and aesthetically pleasing.

78
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:03,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't hate this.

79
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:05,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

80
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:06,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I concur.

81
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:13,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have to worry too much about consistency between them with something with a change as small as this.

82
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,169
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

83
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good to me.

84
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:21,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

85
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:30,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And then looking ahead in April, we'll bring more budget hearings, zoning proposals and resident engagement initiatives and encourage more residents.

86
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:31,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

87
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:39,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

88
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other comments?

89
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:45,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we go through the rest of what I had sent you?

90
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:49,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was only the three comments, but, oh, right.

91
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:54,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was going through the numbered list, but then they stopped being numbered after a while.

92
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no worries.

93
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:56,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

94
00:28:59,027 --> 00:28:59,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Okey dokey.

95
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:07,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other one is the money for the lead pipes as well.

96
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember which meeting that was at?

97
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Lead pipes was, we made that final vote at the March 25th meeting.

98
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:15,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

99
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:26,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's some language in old newsletter that we probably pull from as well.

100
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just quickly get that for you.

101
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:29,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I am.

102
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:39,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I am remembering that we previously, but it's like a two vote thing, like preliminary approval, like first reading and then the final vote.

103
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:40,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

104
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:57,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And alongside that, we also passed some free cash to fix for a water main project that is also lead related.

105
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:58,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

106
00:29:59,291 --> 00:29:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

107
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:06,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the one that we pulled in from Unfinished Business.

108
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:06,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

109
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might have just been a free cash paper.

110
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:11,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And the main, the third reading is Unfinished Business.

111
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:12,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

112
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I can pull that up too.

113
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:24,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did get a note about the last newsletter.

114
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:33,424
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason it's on my mind is because somebody sent a note about the fact that it was phrased as repair and not repair slash replace.

115
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:37,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just kind of thinking like, OK, well, this phrasing does make sense.

116
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:40,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for remembering.

117
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:40,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

118
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like celebrity repair statements, insurance,

119
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:07,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Councilor Lozano.

120
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:09,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

121
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:16,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I am wondering, last time we did this, we did update on things that had happened like that week.

122
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:26,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We just moved the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance out of committee to the regular meeting last night.

123
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could add something about that from public health and community safety.

124
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:34,689
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

125
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.

126
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we need to include but that was the 1st of April.

127
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think oh, that's true.

128
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: That was April.

129
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:46,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, but we kind of have been doing this calendar month.

130
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:50,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I've been doing for this is okay.

131
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:51,304
[SPEAKER_08]: The months aren't perfect.

132
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:57,570
[SPEAKER_08]: My my rule of thumb is just to cover every event that we've had since the last newsletter.

133
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So up to you.

134
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:08,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I also generally fuse committee of the whole with the regular meetings, but whichever.

135
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:31,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor, Councillor Lazar, would you, are you on the document right now?

136
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:32,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

137
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:43,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you feel free to feel free to write out the language for that since you're the chair of the committee and driver behind the ordinance, I figure you'd probably.

138
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:03,842
[SPEAKER_10]: uh...

139
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,215
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably the most informal committee of all.

140
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:41,118
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably the most informal committee of all the city council meetings.

141
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:45,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all are just like eating bagels and just kind of palling around over there.

142
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:51,967
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a serious chamber with serious stuff going on.

143
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:57,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all gotta be more serious.

144
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:58,353
[SPEAKER_08]: You're eating blackberries?

145
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:00,855
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

146
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well.

147
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:03,214
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Councilor Lazar, are you good with that?

148
00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:07,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm comfortable with that if that's cool with you.

149
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:12,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

150
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:19,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura, you have the document on your computer, or do you want me to just like scroll through on this screen if you don't?

151
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this, this is for the next item.

152
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,560
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just wondering if like you, if you have a, if you're on the document or if you have a link.

153
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm not on the document, but this is okay.

154
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:31,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

155
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:38,183
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think, I think we got, we got everything from your notes.

156
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have everything as well.

157
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

158
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:50,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for, for, for putting this together and for doing that.

159
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:51,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's.

160
00:35:52,550 --> 00:36:02,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that during some of the formatting like this whole like bullet and sub bullet points could end up showing up weird on the latex when I'm doing two columns.

161
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:09,022
[SPEAKER_08]: So do whatever formatting.

162
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:10,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

163
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:11,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

164
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Well I'll just, I'll just change that really some.

165
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:58,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's actually

166
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:04,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Discussions.

167
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:16,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one quick question.

168
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:17,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

169
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:20,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we say the council or council and sometimes we say we.

170
00:37:20,897 --> 00:37:22,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably fine.

171
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,603
[SPEAKER_08]: we could either be... Sorry, can you speak up?

172
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:27,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

173
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:34,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look under March 25th, we say council submitted, and later we say the council received, and then later we say we approved and we passed.

174
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we make it a little bit more consistent and either say the council or we?

175
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:48,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it nice to have the language be a little inconsistent for the flow?

176
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:54,320
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, the differences can be kind of nice to read that way.

177
00:37:55,001 --> 00:38:00,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should hold a roll call vote on this important issue.

178
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I am happy either way.

179
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'd ask.

180
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:05,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

181
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:09,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we can make this a midnight meeting.

182
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:12,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do that if we really need to.

183
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:13,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

184
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:36,302
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, nevermind, I'll just keep it this way.

185
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:44,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, does anybody else have any other additional edits they'd like to see?

186
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a motion to approve?

187
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

188
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:53,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

189
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

190
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,456
[SPEAKER_06]: motion to approve.

191
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:28,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

192
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:30,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro?

193
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

194
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

195
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:34,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang?

196
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:35,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

197
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:35,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lemmon?

198
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:36,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

199
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:38,608
[SPEAKER_08]: On the affirmative, one absent.

200
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:42,812
[SPEAKER_08]: The newsletter is approved.

201
00:39:42,832 --> 00:39:45,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be working on the formatting of this as soon as I can.

202
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:48,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Next item.

203
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had on here a resolution to discuss the modernization of the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance.

204
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:03,159
[SPEAKER_08]: This year was put on the agenda largely as a

205
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:15,492
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, preliminary measure in case, uh, Councillor saying, uh, had, uh, concluded his discussions with the mayor on this topic.

206
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:24,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it my understanding is that we probably need to wait another month before we could really move forward on this.

207
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:27,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

208
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we the mayor and I had a productive conversation yesterday.

209
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:40,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We mostly worked through most for the most part, works through smaller technical edits, there are one or two.

210
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:49,789
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger picture items that she wants us to reconsider, such as providing stipends to boards and commissions in general, as a policy.

211
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And to this one in particular, with certain circumstances around them, but I asked the mayor to

212
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:04,659
[SPEAKER_05]: put give us something in writing for counselors to consider because it seemed to be more complex conversation there.

213
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:22,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, in the past, our counselors, both on the city council, but the city council in general, historically has been supportive of stipends for people who are serving on boards and commissions, or taking that time out of their day, maybe hiring babysitters.

214
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that's an important issue to us.

215
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: The other

216
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:46,175
[SPEAKER_05]: main big edit was the big suggestion I guess is to have us lock in a solid number for members of the commission instead of having it be variable and her strong recommendation is to cap it at nine members to keep it at nine members but I

217
00:41:48,975 --> 00:42:00,800
[SPEAKER_05]: where we ended up in the conversation was that we would talk with community members and to talk amongst us as councillors on our next committee meeting to see if there was the right number.

218
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:16,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else, there are some smaller substantive edits, but there are things that I do want to talk to community members about first and to have some time to write into the ordinance, but they're more,

219
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:26,201
[SPEAKER_05]: they lean more, they're less substantive than those others.

220
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my general update.

221
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:37,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I know a lot of advocates who wanted to speak on this and to provide their input for it couldn't make this meeting as well.

222
00:42:38,646 --> 00:42:39,626
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of folks who are

223
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: out of town or they had prior commitments.

224
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:54,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So out of an interest of fairness and to also get more details from the mayor about some of her more substantive objections, I think it would be wise to wait a month.

225
00:42:54,677 --> 00:42:56,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

226
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:57,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have to make a motion on that or?

227
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, a motion.

228
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:01,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't.

229
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:06,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you need to move it off the table or anything because

230
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,467
[SPEAKER_06]: it's already basically tabled pending legal review.

231
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think you'd need to make any motions on it.

232
00:43:12,628 --> 00:43:16,591
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, cool.

233
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:26,357
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, moving on resolution for the public engagement plan for the FY 26 budget.

234
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:37,887
[SPEAKER_08]: 25-041 be it resolved that the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee design and implement a public engagement plan for the upcoming FY 2026 budget.

235
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:53,277
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of this is basically to get a couple of ideas on the table to talk about engaging the public a little bit more in our budget process, increase transparency,

236
00:43:55,756 --> 00:44:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you'd like to say anything about this or just to, like, let us know what you're kind of thinking counselor saying, yeah, um, I this is something I'm really excited about to get more community input for in during the budget process.

237
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,761
[SPEAKER_05]: and to kind of orient what we advocate for on the city council.

238
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:25,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we've met with a lot of folks in the community over the last few months and compiled that kind of list of asks requests for the mayor.

239
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:32,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, this is always a continuous process of getting more feedback and, you know, really seeing what we're hearing from the public.

240
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:35,767
[SPEAKER_05]: There are tons of ways to go about it.

241
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure councillors have ideas that will be really good.

242
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I did two years ago was put out basically a Google form for people to be able to send in ideas.

243
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:54,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had some kind of guiding questions for them.

244
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We collected demographic data with that as well.

245
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:06,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made clear that this was not a poll, that it wouldn't be treated like a poll, but just rather like an input survey.

246
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:19,225
[SPEAKER_05]: That got 100, I'm looking at the results now, I think it got 135 responses, which was a lot.

247
00:45:19,705 --> 00:45:25,226
[SPEAKER_05]: That was more feedback than we've gotten over a lot of different budget formulation periods.

248
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:35,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was nice to get that feedback before our final votes, before we really got into those community of whole meetings on the budget.

249
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:45,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do it last year because we changed up the budget timeline to what we are doing now.

250
00:45:45,678 --> 00:45:46,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just kind of slotted.

251
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:49,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have slotted in a little bit awkwardly.

252
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:59,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this time, it would make sense for us to think about how we could bring back some more concepts and to also expand this concept.

253
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:03,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Because just putting one Google Form is not going to get

254
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:09,532
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the most representative feedback or be the best way of getting feedback for a lot of folks in the city.

255
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:14,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I know, counselors on this committee have a lot of ideas with regards to that.

256
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:19,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So very happy to, you know, put that out in the open and to hear ideas.

257
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:21,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also happy to run through.

258
00:46:24,142 --> 00:46:33,506
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wrote are what the guiding questions and demographic questions we asked in that last survey and then see what we want to keep for this time.

259
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:42,529
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what questions we want to ask on top of those if we want to go, you know, put this out there and what kind of other demographic data, we might want to collect or not collect

260
00:46:45,343 --> 00:47:00,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and I should also note, um, now the city, city council, especially this committee has more mechanisms to get input from the public than before, like the community meetings with, uh, through liaisons at the senior center with community members.

261
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:08,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, um, other counselors to have, uh, more robust mechanisms to getting community members engaged than before.

262
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:10,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really nice.

263
00:47:10,832 --> 00:47:11,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so.

264
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:19,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have the newsletters, we have other kind of ideas floating out there too.

265
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:30,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be nice to think about how those new mechanisms that are open to us now can help inform the resident feedback mechanism.

266
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

267
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:36,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Any comments from any of the councilors?

268
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:45,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm personally, um, excited about that.

269
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:46,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a

270
00:47:47,790 --> 00:48:05,378
[SPEAKER_08]: In previous years, when you did put out the survey, was it run entirely by individual counselors or is there generally any city support for distributing the survey using the official city mailing lists or did counselors just sort of put it out on their own social media channels?

271
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:10,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just put it out there myself and I posted it on all my socials.

272
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:12,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted it in Reddit.

273
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:14,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted it, I

274
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think.

275
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:26,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I did those mechanisms in particular, and I know other counselors shared it, so they re-shared it on their personal social media.

276
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:32,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking, I can't really remember if I did this, but if I

277
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: If I didn't, I think it would be a good idea to have printed toppings at the senior center at the library and and at City Hall as well for people to be able to provide written written feedback because I know tech isn't the best way for a lot of people to But yeah, that's how it was distributed in the past.

278
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:03,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Josh Triplett Oh, seeing no other.

279
00:49:04,468 --> 00:49:12,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you planning on drafting a version of that and then presenting it at the next meeting or Yeah, like sending out sending us informally.

280
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:35,157
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah i think um i i think it would make sense for us to work on it as a committee um rather than rather than do it uh informally as individual counselors because i think number one it has more more weight people will trust it more than you know their counselors who engage with individual are residents who choose to engage with individual counselors and maybe

281
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,000
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want to when they're the ones putting it out.

282
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's more neutral if it's our committee putting it out, for example.

283
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:55,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just think, you know, this would benefit from the ideas of a bunch of different counselors and we can kind of like really hone in and like workshop things a bit more.

284
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was thinking there are two options.

285
00:49:59,432 --> 00:49:59,912
[SPEAKER_05]: One is

286
00:50:00,612 --> 00:50:05,235
[SPEAKER_05]: we really just work on it tonight and then we vote on distributing it.

287
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:26,848
[SPEAKER_05]: We work out the questions and also how we're gonna distribute it and then we motion to vote something to that effect tonight, or we work on it, we collect ideas during this month and then I can spend some time making it a show and then present it at the next meeting for a vote on distributing it.

288
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So either way I think works.

289
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a timeline question.

290
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:32,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

291
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:42,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the end result I want to have is that we end up having something solid to like something workable to vote on at the next meeting.

292
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:48,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, personally, what I'd like to see out of any survey is pretty

293
00:50:51,515 --> 00:51:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: basically a thorough collection of the demographic aspects just so that we know how balanced or in balance the feedback is, because I think a problem in previous surveys that have been put out by the city is that they have been quite a skewed sample.

294
00:51:06,424 --> 00:51:11,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So that does tend to be a systematic problem in municipal surveys.

295
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:20,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also generally like to, I'm not really too sure if we should have like

296
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:35,493
[SPEAKER_08]: like some kind of like a feedback section for like which departments people think should be funded or if it should just be sort of like general areas that they think should be emphasized.

297
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do they think the school should be more funded?

298
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:45,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they think, you know, what is your ranking when you're comparing like the Department of Health versus like, you know, do you think we should put more money into the planning department?

299
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:53,306
[SPEAKER_08]: something like that, I guess a good starting point would really be just to see what, just if you have the previous survey on you.

300
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:55,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yeah, I do have the previous survey on me.

301
00:51:55,827 --> 00:52:01,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So last time I chose not to ask very specific pointed questions and I kept it decently open-ended.

302
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So substantively, so this is like aside from demographics, I had, I had, okay, so I had

303
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:15,447
[SPEAKER_05]: four questions mostly just about issues.

304
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:20,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one was, what are Medford's most concerning issues or problems?

305
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what do you think are Medford's most important needs for the next 12 months?

306
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:28,573
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think are Medford's most important long-term needs?

307
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:32,115
[SPEAKER_05]: What new services or programs should Medford fund?

308
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:34,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, do you have like that on a screen that you could share?

309
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:37,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of in a messy format right now.

310
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,798
[SPEAKER_05]: If you give me one sec, I can make it cleaner.

311
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had another bucket of questions that was more about the process.

312
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:53,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked, what is the easiest way for you to participate in the budget process?

313
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a checklist of options.

314
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I asked, how are you keeping up to date with the city budget process with a checklist too?

315
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of these checklists, or that checklist, I believe,

316
00:53:10,248 --> 00:53:13,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know how, like, section.

317
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:22,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had an open-ended question about, is there anything you'd want to know about the city's budget or about city council?

318
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:24,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a more general question.

319
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:29,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put this in like a neater format and then find a way to project it.

320
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,062
[SPEAKER_05]: There are questions I want to workshop.

321
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:36,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, like, having done it the first time, now I have a better idea of what works.

322
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me, Councilor Lozada, I can see your hand raised.

323
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

324
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this committee is a great place to sort of orient this plan.

325
00:53:52,213 --> 00:54:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we, because of our experience with the newsletter and our experience with the listening sessions that we've had as an ongoing project, I do think that this

326
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of a plan originating here or us taking a deliberative approach to this kind of project and taking our time with putting out something like this.

327
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:33,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Also observing what we have in the last few months with the results of some municipal surveys that we've taken in and that have resulted in real

328
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:38,253
[SPEAKER_02]: concrete suggestions for ways to move the city forward.

329
00:54:38,994 --> 00:54:51,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But knowing that like maybe some of the methodologies or results, maybe there are ways that we could learn more or dig into the results a little bit better.

330
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:56,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a great opportunity for us to try to do some of that stuff.

331
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:03,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really am eager to get started on this project and I'm

332
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:06,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankful that Councillor Singh brought it to us.

333
00:55:06,234 --> 00:55:08,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're a good spot for it.

334
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:14,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would be happy to support this project.

335
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

336
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:20,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I just sent you the Google form.

337
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:25,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a copy of it, so it wouldn't have people's responses.

338
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:26,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see what I put out last time.

339
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:29,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know if you have it.

340
00:55:34,229 --> 00:55:35,550
[SPEAKER_08]: you send that to my email?

341
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:36,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

342
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:37,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Callahan.

343
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:39,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

344
00:55:39,613 --> 00:55:49,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am going to make a suggestion, which is that we use this not only as an opportunity to get feedback, but as an opportunity to educate.

345
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that at one point during

346
00:55:56,232 --> 00:56:09,078
[SPEAKER_03]: the fall, it was incredibly educational for the people that I talked to, to actually see a pie graph of our budget and to understand which of the elements in that pie graph are things that are discretionary and which are things that we cannot change.

347
00:56:09,198 --> 00:56:19,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, sometimes like insurance, which is our second budget item, our first is our school district and our second at 15% is insurance, that insurance in fact goes up.

348
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:25,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't even keep it at 15% because it goes up by 10% this year.

349
00:56:26,264 --> 00:56:29,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love it if we could include

350
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:37,592
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of education along with this and just have like a pie chart that shows our current budget.

351
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we can, I think this is the 2024, which is, you know, or 2020, whatever the fiscal year starts in, in, in the summer.

352
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I forget, is it the 2025 one, whichever is the current one.

353
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:50,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And

354
00:56:53,792 --> 00:57:13,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one that's colored, but I think what I would want to do is gray out the sections that are not discretionary, just to educate people on what parts of the budget do we actually have any ability to increase or decrease on our own, so that people have some idea of like what our budget actually looks like.

355
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:18,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Once people see it, I think they often are like, oh, wow, like I had no idea.

356
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:36,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And they stop arguing about things like, you know, all the stuff in there that's like 0.5% of the budget, you know, they're less concerned with how much it costs to do these, you know, incredibly small departments that are very mighty in their ability to help our city.

357
00:57:38,632 --> 00:57:39,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really excellent.

358
00:57:39,814 --> 00:57:41,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd love to see that.

359
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:52,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that some sort of a, instead of having this very nice photo right here, probably having a pie chart.

360
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if a pie chart would fit in a banner.

361
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:59,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's my only thing, but we, yeah.

362
00:58:00,236 --> 00:58:03,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have to be something that we guarantee people see though.

363
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It is true that I'm not thinking of too many like,

364
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:14,279
[SPEAKER_08]: too many ways to fully describe the city's budget and a Google dog banner, but it would be nice if that were achievable.

365
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:24,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kind of worried about the idea of having a separate document explaining the budget, or maybe it could be the first page of the survey.

366
00:58:24,443 --> 00:58:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we would put this on the first page and have it be right there integrated into the survey.

367
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can do that.

368
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:48,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah and another thing about how I designed the survey last time was it was on three pages so like the three buckets I mentioned like the first bucket being budget specific that was the first page and then there was the demographic page which was right next to that and then the access page

369
00:58:49,729 --> 00:59:08,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made the demographic information required, at least most of it was required answering for you to be able to submit the survey, because it's so important to collect the demographic data of who's actually engaging in the process, so for us to have a better sense of how equitable it is.

370
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:23,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All that is to say, you know, if we put it on the first page and we do something similar structurally where the demographic information's on the second page and required, they'll have to click through, read through the first page to submit the survey.

371
00:59:24,376 --> 00:59:24,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

372
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:26,458
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the Zoom is not responding.

373
00:59:26,578 --> 00:59:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: It's covering the whole screen here just so you know.

374
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:30,540
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

375
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoom is not responding.

376
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's covering the whole screen so no one can see your screen anymore.

377
00:59:35,102 --> 00:59:36,383
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, hold on.

378
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:37,544
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

379
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:39,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting at home.

380
00:59:41,427 --> 00:59:42,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, huh.

381
00:59:42,888 --> 00:59:45,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Councilor Callahan, that was on this end of things.

382
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,012
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just removed that pop-up window, so it should be all set.

383
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:55,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going through the survey, survey on my own.

384
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:29,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does look like the previous survey was collecting demographic information, but it did mainly rely on, I think a lot of it relied on short-form answers, particularly on the first page.

385
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think, um, in terms of survey design, I, uh, like my experience has kind of told me that it's when you're asking about like subjects, issues, policies and stuff like that, it's really tough to have, um, a multiple choice unless, because you, you'd have to kind of frame it really well of saying like, okay, these are the arguments in favor.

386
01:00:51,742 --> 01:00:54,743
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the arguments against what's your stance, right?

387
01:00:55,253 --> 01:01:04,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I think with the budget, there's so many different, you know, pieces that we're looking at so many different facets that, um, that can be a little tough.

388
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:07,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's why I prefer keeping things in short, short form format.

389
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:13,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like open-ended, um, but people also don't feel obligated to have to write an essay about stuff.

390
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, that was my thinking back then.

391
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:17,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

392
01:01:18,783 --> 01:01:19,463
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that makes sense.

393
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so to clarify the way that,

394
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:43,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the specific suggestions for how to change it are to collect more, or to include more educational content within the survey itself, just about the nature of the budget, and be a little bit more detailed in the demographics that we're, demographic information we're collecting.

395
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:56,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I also think, I will say, even though the questions I asked about the most concerning issues and the needs, they're fundamentally still a little different.

396
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:08,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that, generally, there was enough overlap where if we just kept the questions about short-term and long-term needs, I think that kind of covers what people were saying.

397
01:02:12,402 --> 01:02:14,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you got like a hundred people last time.

398
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:14,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I got 135.

399
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:15,484
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

400
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:17,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

401
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: What were some of the main points of feedback then?

402
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Like any trends you noticed?

403
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:24,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

404
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:30,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, so actually what I did with this, um, let me actually pull it up.

405
01:02:30,136 --> 01:02:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I did with this is that I. You can share the screen, right?

406
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:35,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.

407
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:38,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to log into the zoom meeting.

408
01:02:38,242 --> 01:02:38,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

409
01:02:41,211 --> 01:02:50,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially what I did was I kind of compiled this into a memo, even though I don't like using surveys and presenting them as polls.

410
01:02:50,553 --> 01:03:01,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the best way to compile that data is to basically go through and code the responses and be like, okay, so X number of people talked about this issue.

411
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:17,905
[SPEAKER_05]: The like this was the frequency at which it came up and we saw this issue be more pertinent to, you know, certainly groups, you know, people with children or people without children and stuff like that and I still that into a memo for the mayor for consideration.

412
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:30,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just have a question I'm excited to bring up in a public meeting so I can ask my fellow counselors if anyone wants to work with me on this.

413
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:50,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Many years ago when I was the president of the board of a 432 person housing association, I did a participatory budgeting measure where I actually invited everyone who lived there to

414
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:59,969
[SPEAKER_03]: basically put in like they got to see the exact budget and they, you know, got to

415
01:04:00,844 --> 01:04:02,385
[SPEAKER_03]: make their own adjustments to it.

416
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:09,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was advisory, but it got a lot of interest and it was very educational.

417
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:28,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if any of my fellow city councilors would be interested in working with me to put together something similar that would allow our residents to really kind of dig into the budget and make their own recommendations as an advisory to our budgetary process.

418
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:31,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

419
01:04:33,193 --> 01:04:44,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think, I mean, I'd be happy to I know other counselors would likely be happy to I think, I guess like practically like what what components are there, how can we help.

420
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to have a co sponsor.

421
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's one person that can work with me on it I can kind of put it together and then.

422
01:04:51,398 --> 01:04:57,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can, I guess if we're trying to, are you, like, maybe make a paper number for it at the next meeting or something?

423
01:04:57,381 --> 01:05:09,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly, like, put together, just somebody that we can put together a motion and then we can chit-chat about, like, how to put together the first draft so that when it comes to committee, we'll be able to... I'm personally happy to step in for that.

424
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:18,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Councilor Sang is, seems like he's, does have, like, a lot of experience with, a little bit more experience than I do than,

425
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I would welcome him as the proposed co-sponsor as well.

426
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:29,447
[SPEAKER_08]: We could also discuss this offline since we're not, since, you know, we can.

427
01:05:29,987 --> 01:05:31,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're three members of the committee right now.

428
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:32,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

429
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just looking for somebody.

430
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:36,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know who it is that I can work with.

431
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:41,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having one other co-sponsor and not two because we're all on this committee and it's going to come to this committee I think is best.

432
01:05:42,719 --> 01:06:05,832
[SPEAKER_02]: um so good well i'm glad somebody's interested i won't be alone yeah matt and i can sort it out okay because i think there's some arguments for beautiful fantastic thanks um i also think it sounds great but i uh it doesn't it wouldn't um i don't think i would be as good at it as um some others but i i think it sounds thumbs up

433
01:06:11,962 --> 01:06:24,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I, Carol, I mean, I did send you, um, I did send you what I sent the mayor last time, which was, um, the survey results, like a guide to the results.

434
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:28,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a, there's a third document here.

435
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:31,133
Sorry.

436
01:06:32,174 --> 01:06:34,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Just going to, I'm going to try to share that screen.

437
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:38,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to do my best to share the screen and try to

438
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:45,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think in looking back at it, I think there are ways I wish I presented the data differently.

439
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:51,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So last time, I broke it down by percentage, but realistically, that makes it look like a poll, which it's not.

440
01:06:52,114 --> 01:07:05,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's maybe a better way of just saying, this many people talked about this issue, and then attach some quotes about that people sent in, giving anecdotes about why that issue is important to them.

441
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:10,707
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be a better way of presenting it than what I did here.

442
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:17,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think in general, I think there's a mix, right?

443
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:23,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think then if it's just pure numbers, it can be a little hard to compare points against each other.

444
01:07:23,332 --> 01:07:27,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that's also, I think it makes it look too much like a poll.

445
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:33,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I did comment, the poll first page is basically saying like, don't treat this as a poll, treat this as a survey.

446
01:07:33,657 --> 01:07:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

447
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:53,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand the point that you're making earlier about having open-ended questions, but the part of me that likes to save time is just thinking to take some of these and put them as a bullet points in the next, like put them as check boxes or rankings in the next version of the survey.

448
01:07:53,643 --> 01:07:59,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my hesitancy to that is that oftentimes the respondents

449
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:27,732
[SPEAKER_05]: um like response is guided by what they see and so if we like give them check boxes of stuff like this um they start to be guided to think through these lenses like through like they start to think about like schools infrastructure housing whatever and and then we start to actually really miss out on like on things that people actually are thinking about that they don't see on the checklist even if we include like an open option at the end right

450
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:38,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that's just my kind of like, at a curiosity, how much time did it take you to go through the 135 short form responses and come up with this?

451
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:39,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to do it for work.

452
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:44,960
[SPEAKER_05]: We did like, we did thousands in a day, so it's not awful.

453
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:50,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all, all it really takes is having like a good code system.

454
01:08:50,103 --> 01:08:53,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you go through on the spreadsheet each next to each one and just code it.

455
01:08:54,252 --> 01:09:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you and then you just compare like you compile like okay we have this many ones this many twos threes and one corresponds to schools or two is like infrastructure or something yeah it's not too too bad it does take any like uh maybe i think this took me an hour maybe an hour or two to code and then you had like the demographic stuff like this we actually just had options because yeah and so these demographic questions i pulled out of um

456
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:33,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I pulled out of like an old city survey that maybe the community liaisons or the health department did during COVID.

457
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:36,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where these questions came from.

458
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But I honestly think like it could be, this is one of the things I want to revisit is what questions, what data are we collecting on this front and what do we want to see?

459
01:09:49,193 --> 01:09:50,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at this right here.

460
01:09:50,514 --> 01:09:58,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is, this is kind of like, yeah, it is maybe slightly better than the community.

461
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:11,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, it does remind me of the charter study committee survey, which was just like that sort of similar to that 80, 20 split, uh, between homeowner renter, which really 50, 50, uh, in the city.

462
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:12,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I,

463
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:22,691
[SPEAKER_08]: can't think of a way, like if there are any ideas for reaching out to renters more.

464
01:10:22,711 --> 01:10:25,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think this is really tough.

465
01:10:25,933 --> 01:10:27,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really, really tough.

466
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we should maybe find a way to work with folks who are in the Medford Housing Authority, like and to ask them if they can find a way to send it to their residents as well.

467
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:44,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Similarly, residents who are really engaged in like

468
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the city, a lot of them might live in apartment blocks, which could be helpful as well, like asking them to help us.

469
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:56,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So more informal ways of just getting the survey out.

470
01:10:56,777 --> 01:11:12,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would just add that the specifics of our city and the fact that we have, we don't have that many like giant apartment buildings, but we have a lot of like duplexes where one or both of those

471
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:17,116
[SPEAKER_03]: are rented out, it is super hard to reach those people.

472
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:17,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't.

473
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:19,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very, very difficult.

474
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:20,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

475
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think what we've seen over the last few years is the real best way to do that is what a lot of us do, and just knock on the doors and ask.

476
01:11:30,528 --> 01:11:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

477
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't know which doors.

478
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:35,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but we don't know which doors, yeah.

479
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:37,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have enough data about it.

480
01:11:38,218 --> 01:11:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was just going to say, imagine we had a rental registry.

481
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:45,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should have a rental registry.

482
01:11:45,604 --> 01:11:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It would help with this.

483
01:11:50,048 --> 01:11:50,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It would help.

484
01:11:50,728 --> 01:11:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, guys, there was once another registry somewhere.

485
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,218
[SPEAKER_04]: The registry of motor vehicles, right?

486
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.

487
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:13,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, if you go to South Medford and you knock on a door, there's a pretty good chance that some of the folks living there are renters.

488
01:12:14,223 --> 01:12:19,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the thing with handing it to the Medford Housing Authority is they

489
01:12:21,885 --> 01:12:30,948
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the public housing that they're in charge of does represent a lot of renters, but I feel like a lot of, like a huge number of renters are also just people who are like renting from private landlords.

490
01:12:31,468 --> 01:12:38,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's not a way, there's just not a good way I can think of to, you know, systematically reach out to that, to that demographic.

491
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,971
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard.

492
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:46,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

493
01:12:46,743 --> 01:12:46,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

494
01:12:47,083 --> 01:13:00,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I, I do remember when the charter study committee, they, they put, they actually did put a lot of effort into trying to bump up the survey numbers, but they're, they still were not able to like kind of get rid of that skew between.

495
01:13:00,746 --> 01:13:02,726
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, yeah.

496
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:06,967
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an inherent problem with polling in, in the city, I suppose.

497
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:09,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not with polling, just with, uh,

498
01:13:10,943 --> 01:13:12,364
[SPEAKER_05]: with the way that we do surveys.

499
01:13:12,384 --> 01:13:17,828
[SPEAKER_05]: If the administration, like, I mean, I've passed a bunch of resolutions about this.

500
01:13:17,888 --> 01:13:24,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the administration would like to get polling data, that's not necessarily very hard.

501
01:13:26,595 --> 01:13:31,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I read somewhere, well, I heard one time that it would cost like $7,000 to do a professional poll.

502
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:33,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about right.

503
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:33,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

504
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:34,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

505
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:36,282
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds about right.

506
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.

507
01:13:38,324 --> 01:13:39,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know,

508
01:13:40,564 --> 01:13:43,528
[SPEAKER_05]: $7,000 in the grand scheme of what a city budget.

509
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:51,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is me like going on a tangent about what I would do differently if I were in a... This meeting will go on till midnight, I'm telling you.

510
01:13:53,982 --> 01:13:56,445
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want to take this meeting in a certain direction, but

511
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:10,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think $7,000 in the scheme of a $200-plus million budget is worth it to get residents input about what they want to see in that budget.

512
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:12,198
[SPEAKER_05]: But I digress.

513
01:14:13,759 --> 01:14:14,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

514
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:18,280
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

515
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:19,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

516
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:21,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So in terms of specific action items,

517
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:28,696
[SPEAKER_08]: either myself or Councilor Singh is going to work with Councilor Callahan on a co-sponsorship.

518
01:14:28,956 --> 01:14:47,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to design or draft an additional survey which will contain some very high level overview of the nature of the budget and how it was allocated in previous years.

519
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:57,376
[SPEAKER_08]: and then do a lot of what Councilor Sang did with the previous survey only take a lot more detailed demographics data as well.

520
01:14:57,396 --> 01:14:59,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that about a summary of?

521
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I think that makes yeah makes sense.

522
01:15:05,183 --> 01:15:13,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my only question is let's really lock in what we want to do at this meeting and what we want for the next meeting.

523
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:18,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I want to quickly look at the timeline again for the budget process but

524
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:27,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make sense maybe for me to collect the questions that people want to ask.

525
01:15:27,826 --> 01:15:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So like motion to have counselors send in what they would want to see on the next budget survey and ideas about distribution.

526
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I can come to the next meeting with a draft for distribution.

527
01:15:44,427 --> 01:15:49,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can vote out like the distribution and the distribution plan at the next committee meeting.

528
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.

529
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:57,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll provide, I'll bring my pie chart and I'll gray out the ones that are not, you know, actionable, not discretionary.

530
01:15:58,075 --> 01:15:59,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we can vote.

531
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:00,116
[SPEAKER_03]: We like it.

532
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:01,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I should change colors and whatever.

533
01:16:01,977 --> 01:16:02,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

534
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:07,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, could that, could the request for feedback go to the whole council as well?

535
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Just yes.

536
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:08,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

537
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:09,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

538
01:16:10,122 --> 01:16:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so in the form of a motion,

539
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:14,885
[SPEAKER_01]: for Adam.

540
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:34,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I would motion to send out a request for feedback about what Councillors would like to see included on the survey and ideas Councillors have about distributing the survey ahead of our next scheduled committee meeting.

541
01:16:36,584 --> 01:16:37,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second?

542
01:16:37,966 --> 01:16:38,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

543
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:39,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

544
01:16:41,554 --> 01:16:45,097
[SPEAKER_08]: on the motion by Councilor Sang.

545
01:16:45,117 --> 01:17:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could give me just one quick minute, I want to make sure that we're not gonna be so deep into the budget process by the next meeting, just in case that timeline doesn't make sense.

546
01:17:02,312 --> 01:17:03,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, take your time.

547
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:06,376
[SPEAKER_05]: My email is just, my inbox is stacked.

548
01:17:16,801 --> 01:17:28,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know we received the preliminary budget schedule.

549
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of timeline, if you did figure out that we needed to do it, we needed to have everything in sooner,

550
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:49,579
[SPEAKER_08]: what would really be the option in terms of approval?

551
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:54,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So would we potentially have to do another RSP meeting in the middle of the month next month?

552
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:57,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, yeah, I think that's about right.

553
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:11,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I worry, I think, because we might want to give at least a two-week window for this survey as well, if not a three-week, maybe even a month for people to give feedback.

554
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the timing is important.

555
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:18,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we need to get it close enough to him keep the budget is on people's minds.

556
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:24,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And where we get more information from the administration about what they foresee the budget to look like.

557
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:27,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've talked informally with the mayor.

558
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:35,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's given me some general hints about what she sees as problems in the budget and what she sees are not problems but challenges.

559
01:18:39,128 --> 01:18:50,151
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we also need to be able to have time to field the survey and then get it back in time for us to actually have an impact in informing our approach to the budget this year.

560
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:56,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So you think just another committee meeting in two weeks, I mean, would make sense.

561
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think another committee meeting in two weeks.

562
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can have it be a shorter meeting too.

563
01:19:00,795 --> 01:19:01,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be

564
01:19:02,877 --> 01:19:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the committee calendar looks like, just for the other committees as well.

565
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:13,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could also just be a short like 6pm meeting or even like a 5.30pm meeting over Zoom.

566
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, would you have the city council calendar?

567
01:19:39,278 --> 01:19:40,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have it in front of me.

568
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:41,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's downstairs.

569
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:43,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to grab it if you want me to.

570
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:43,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

571
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I just found it in the box.

572
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:51,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So our next scheduled resident services meeting is May 7.

573
01:19:52,343 --> 01:19:56,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would fall after three budget meetings.

574
01:19:57,605 --> 01:20:02,366
[SPEAKER_05]: If we send it out May 7, we probably would want to get it back by the end of the.

575
01:20:02,907 --> 01:20:03,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be too late.

576
01:20:05,018 --> 01:20:17,468
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think it's possible that the budget would be on the regular committee, regular council agenda on May 27th if I am doing my math correctly.

577
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess a meeting in two weeks would be ideal.

578
01:20:23,453 --> 01:20:25,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

579
01:20:25,114 --> 01:20:31,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you want to amend your motion to request the council president that we schedule a meeting two weeks from now?

580
01:20:33,313 --> 01:20:33,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

581
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

582
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:38,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of next scheduled, like ahead of the next scheduled meeting, just the next meeting.

583
01:20:39,518 --> 01:20:43,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's the motion I made.

584
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So the motion I made was like ahead of the next scheduled meeting.

585
01:20:46,963 --> 01:20:49,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the next scheduled meeting is May 7.

586
01:20:49,485 --> 01:20:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So just next meeting, whenever that might be.

587
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:54,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, so.

588
01:20:55,329 --> 01:21:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: To schedule our next meeting, this committee's next meeting for two weeks from now.

589
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:00,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

590
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:00,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

591
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:01,254
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

592
01:21:01,374 --> 01:21:01,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

593
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:07,274
[SPEAKER_06]: If you leave it as the next meeting of this committee, then you can schedule that at any time.

594
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:09,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

595
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If you leave the wording as the next meeting of this committee.

596
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:13,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

597
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't have to worry about when it gets scheduled for.

598
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:15,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

599
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:16,308
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

600
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:17,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

601
01:21:17,725 --> 01:21:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, so if we are able to do that, let's say we meet on April 15 or 16, we can field the survey, have it be due back by like the first week of May, either at the beginning or the end of that week.

602
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:41,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would put us, that would give us three committee meetings, three committee, the whole meetings on the budget where we have that information with us.

603
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,141
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be kind of halfway through our budget meeting cycle.

604
01:21:48,272 --> 01:21:53,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the very least, I know a lot of negotiating with the budget happens towards the end of that calendar cycle, if that makes sense.

605
01:21:57,514 --> 01:21:57,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

606
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:05,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you want to just do a roll call on the motion?

607
01:22:06,596 --> 01:22:06,956
Sure.

608
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:10,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

609
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:11,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

610
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:13,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazaro?

611
01:22:13,698 --> 01:22:13,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

612
01:22:15,772 --> 01:22:17,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

613
01:22:17,693 --> 01:22:18,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Seng?

614
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:18,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

615
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:19,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lemmon?

616
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:20,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

617
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:22,316
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the affirmative.

618
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:26,098
[SPEAKER_08]: One absent, the motion passes.

619
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:28,899
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

620
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:35,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm not seeing, I don't think anybody is here from the public.

621
01:22:35,683 --> 01:22:41,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other points of discussion we want on this, we have on this particular item, or do you think we're good to go?

622
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:47,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm happy for my end.

623
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:51,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if people have other ideas of, you know, engaging residents.

624
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this one is a big project, but yeah.

625
01:22:54,504 --> 01:22:55,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

626
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:57,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other motions on the floor?

627
01:22:58,606 --> 01:22:59,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

628
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:03,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor, or sorry, Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

629
01:23:18,288 --> 01:23:18,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kelly.

630
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:19,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

631
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:20,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazaro.

632
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:21,312
Yes.

633
01:23:23,414 --> 01:23:24,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

634
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:25,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang.

635
01:23:25,577 --> 01:23:25,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

636
01:23:26,157 --> 01:23:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lemmon.

637
01:23:26,858 --> 01:23:27,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

638
01:23:27,619 --> 01:23:29,802
[SPEAKER_08]: For an affirmative, one absent.

639
01:23:29,822 --> 01:23:30,523
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting is adjourned.
