1
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.

2
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Medford families.

3
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:41,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of families still logging on, so I'm gonna give us maybe one or two more minutes just to give a few more members of the community a few minutes to jump on to this afternoon's presentation.

4
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:53,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everyone is enjoying this beautiful spring-like weather, and hopefully very soon we won't have to worry about any more snow.

5
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:31,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, so I'm, whoops.

6
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:33,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.

7
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,485
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent.

8
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the proud superintendent of the Medford Public Schools.

9
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:47,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And this afternoon, I am here with my colleague, Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli.

10
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.

11
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

12
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for coming.

13
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:56,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for joining our informational session this afternoon.

14
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:07,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect that this presentation may take us about 20 minutes to go through the slide deck that we have.

15
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we go through the slide deck, we will be willing to answer any questions that you may have.

16
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:25,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And if by chance you have a question that we're not able to answer right away, we will take your information and get that in response to you as quickly as possible.

17
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to see that we have a great number, a growing number, and a great number of families that have jumped on this call.

18
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love to interact with everyone.

19
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So those of you who are on, whether it's your phone, I'm going to just ask if you can raise your hand.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

28
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:41,621
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are representing, oh, we still have families signing up for the McGlynn, so I'll wait a second.

29
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:48,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I know your children are the experts on Zoom, but I'll give you a second to figure it out.

30
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, McGlynn Elementary School.

[SPEAKER_01]: And I see some of our wonderful little Mustangs right next to you.

43
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, our wonderful fifth graders.

44
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:46,253
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be sixth graders next year, going to middle school.

45
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:52,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big, big transition, but it's going to be a wonderful, wonderful experience for you.

46
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

47
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:03,306
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those, I see you, Bill and Rosarda and Carl, and it looks like Sweeting.

48
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you.

49
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lower your hands.

50
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:23,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for indulging me and maybe later at another point in time, I'll give you an opportunity to use the reaction bar and you can react with a thumbs up or react with a happy or laughing or.

51
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,323
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully something wonderful that said.

52
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:32,907
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here today to discuss the Middle School Lottery for the Medford Public Schools.

53
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:48,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take you through a slide deck, an informational slide deck with data kind of telling you where the Middle School Lottery started, the beginning, and then where we are right now.

54
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So just give me a moment.

55
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share my screen with you.

56
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I also saw that we had some administrators on the line.

57
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:02,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanna thank those administrators for jumping on.

58
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

59
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Ms.

60
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:21,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Demos online and I'm not sure some people don't have their names showing, but thank you for jumping on and I'll keep my eye out to recognize any other administrators who may join the call.

61
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:23,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.

62
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:34,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So just give me a moment to share my screen and hopefully everyone can see it.

63
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:39,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to begin the slide deck.

64
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,692
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name of the slide deck is Correcting the Imbalance.

65
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2019,

66
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,689
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time that the lottery was actually done.

67
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:01,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm gonna share with you is the history of why Medford Public Schools has a lottery.

68
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:11,872
[SPEAKER_01]: This, what you're looking at right now is a demographic data for the McGlynn Middle School in 2019.

69
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:17,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I just move to the next slide,

70
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:26,887
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the data for the racial breakdown of data for the Andrews Middle School.

71
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:36,850
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the racial breakdown that there was a noticeable disparity between the two schools,

72
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:46,085
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, at that point in time, were able to show you the socioeconomic status breakdown.

73
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was the McGlynn School.

74
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next slide was the Andrew School.

75
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was data.

76
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:02,675
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a problem of practice that was presented to me when I came to Medford.

77
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:11,208
[SPEAKER_01]: with how would you propose finding a way to better balance the two schools?

78
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:29,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were significant discrepancies between the two schools that you could see that there were differences, not only in racial breakdown, but also in the socioeconomic status of the students that were attending the schools.

79
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:38,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was an ask of how could we make the two communities become better balanced?

80
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:53,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we knew that we wouldn't be able to have both schools be exactly the same, but how could we bring about greater balance between the two schools?

81
00:08:55,347 --> 00:09:10,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of that problem of practice, that challenge that we were facing, the middle school lottery was birthed with the intention of balancing, better balancing the two schools.

82
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:17,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both middle schools, which you know, they're both essentially located on the same campus.

83
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:23,255
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look out the window and you see one building, you look out the other window and you see the other building.

84
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:30,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were a lot of questions about why was there such a discrepancy?

85
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:40,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's do a lottery and see if we did a lottery, would the data change?

86
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:48,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next two slides that I'm gonna share with you are this year's current data.

87
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:53,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the birth of the lottery, it did change.

88
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:11,611
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 2022-2023 data for the McGlynn Middle School.

89
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:16,836
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what the data looks like this year.

90
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:26,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data for the Andrews is the following.

91
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:38,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, although we were not able to again get them to be exactly the same.

92
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:44,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the needle definitely moved significantly.

93
00:10:45,991 --> 00:11:09,129
[SPEAKER_01]: From the previous slides, if I just go back and show you the original two slides, when you looked at the breakdown of the schools, this being the McGlynn in 2019, where it was 46.1% of the student population were white students.

94
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And the following slide

95
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:20,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me one second, the following slide showing the Andrews where it was 73.6% in 2019, and if we advance once again to.

96
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:45,206
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn right now it's 56% of our population is is comprised of white students and all the other races are also identified and 61% of our students at the Andrews are.

97
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:55,271
[SPEAKER_01]: of Caucasian descent and all of the other subcategories have also shifted.

98
00:11:55,751 --> 00:12:08,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is definitely greater balance between Native American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, African-American, and then multi-race.

99
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:14,699
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can see that the schools, again, although not perfectly balanced,

100
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:28,810
[SPEAKER_01]: but better balanced in the McGlynn, 13% African-American, 10% Asian, 15%, 15.6% Latino, Hispanic, and 0.2% Native American.

101
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:41,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just to share with you again, kind of what was behind the lottery taking place for the Medford Public Schools.

102
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does the lottery look like?

103
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:48,235
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a summary.

104
00:12:49,456 --> 00:13:03,127
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of students at all of our fifth grades at every elementary school will be assigned to one school, the Andrews, and 50% will be assigned to the McGlynn.

105
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, to the best of our ability.

106
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are a few caveats that I wanna explain to parents.

107
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:33,571
[SPEAKER_01]: If a student has a program level, a specific educational need, whether they're an English learner or if they were to be a student with disabilities, they would be placed in the school that offers that particular program.

108
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:39,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the lottery, we have something with sibling preference.

109
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:50,391
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a child that's currently at the school and will be at the school at the same time as a parent, you have the option to select sibling preference.

110
00:13:51,792 --> 00:14:05,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for parents that have twins or children that just wanna be separated, you also have the option to opt out.

111
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:27,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have one student at one school, and you're like, I don't wanna activate sibling preference, I want it to be an authentic lottery experience, then if that is the case, your child will go into the lottery, and as they go into the lottery, you take your chances, and it's a 50-50 chance.

112
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Please note that for sibling preference,

113
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:37,273
[SPEAKER_01]: the sibling does need to be either in sixth grade or seventh grade.

114
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:42,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would essentially have two children in attendance at the same time.

115
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:49,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one other tiny note that we had for our English learner population.

116
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:58,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow buffer seats, and I'll explain that a little more as we go forward.

117
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:07,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is an example of a sample school.

118
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:19,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is an example of a sample school because the rules essentially apply.

119
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:27,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, you'll hear me say middle school A, middle school B, but it's essentially two schools.

120
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:36,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are 103 students in a fifth grade class, in a fifth grade at one of the elementary schools.

121
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We add an additional three buffer seats for our English learner population.

122
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may be saying, why do you need to add buffer seats?

123
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our English learner population,

124
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:59,039
[SPEAKER_01]: they enroll within the district on a rolling basis.

125
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:07,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as if all students are able to start on the first day of school in August.

126
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:15,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students may transfer to Medford in November, others may come in January.

127
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:20,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of it being a moving number,

128
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:29,705
[SPEAKER_01]: we added three buffer seats in for each school for a total of 12 seats for the district.

129
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:37,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say to you now that we've done the lottery multiple times, we have exceeded those 12 seats.

130
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:42,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sample school has 106 seats total.

131
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:51,603
[SPEAKER_01]: In this model, the lottery is taking place, 20 students are classified as English learners.

132
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:59,310
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will go to middle school A because middle school A offers the English learner program.

133
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:08,299
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one student that has a middle school A sibling preference.

134
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:15,827
[SPEAKER_01]: There are seven students that have a middle school B sibling preference.

135
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:27,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Two students have a program requirement to go to middle school A special education program.

136
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: One student has a program requirement to attend middle school B.

137
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:47,159
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 students have an IEP that will need to have their own

138
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,429
[SPEAKER_00]: separate lottery, their own draw.

139
00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:02,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that group of 12 students, we do a separate lottery because we try to balance the caseloads between the two schools.

140
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:13,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So in essence, those 12 students would be in a lottery and six would be assigned to middle school A and six would be assigned to middle school B.

141
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:27,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we do all of those deductions from the 106 students, there are 60 students that enter the general lottery.

142
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:37,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So those 60 students do not have a sibling preference or their parents opted out, and they do not have a special program requirement.

143
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:43,557
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've just explained to you in words, I'm gonna show it to you in this table.

144
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, the table's coming.

145
00:18:54,764 --> 00:19:04,710
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of students from each elementary school will be assigned to one of the two middle schools.

146
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I explained to you based on the 106 students, we divided that

147
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:32,708
[SPEAKER_01]: to be 53 students attending school A and 53 students attending middle school B. And the breakout shows you the specific requirements.

148
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:40,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for middle school A, 29 students were already accounted for.

149
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So of the 29 students, the remaining 21 students

150
00:19:47,435 --> 00:20:01,919
[SPEAKER_01]: plus the three buffer seats would give us a total of 53 students per middle school A. And for middle school B, the breakdown is similar.

151
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would be 39 students drawn from the lottery.

152
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:17,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the breakdown in a table.

153
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:23,676
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that are visual learners, I know that I said a lot of words, but this is what it looks like.

154
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:36,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Total 106 students and how those 106 students got divided based on their programmatic needs or requirements.

155
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:42,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And the highlighted yellow bar shows you

156
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:53,152
[SPEAKER_01]: how many students entered the general lottery after the required categories were addressed.

157
00:20:55,835 --> 00:21:09,706
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 students would be assigned to middle school A, 39 students were assigned to middle school B. And this is the process that will take place

158
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:17,660
[SPEAKER_01]: When we actually do the lottery, and it will take place for every school.

159
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:25,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a an imaginary school, but I want you to see what the processes that will take place.

160
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:29,251
[SPEAKER_01]: So on April 12, when we do the lottery.

161
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:34,148
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a random lottery, a number generator, and there are a lot of other specifics.

162
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have Dr. Riccadeli talk about those specifics to you, but I wanna just continue to take you through the slide deck.

163
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:50,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, again, if you have questions, we're gonna take questions at the end, but I hope I'm being clear.

164
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned earlier about our English learner students.

165
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:03,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a growing EL population across the entire district.

166
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,132
[SPEAKER_01]: We have newcomers.

167
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:19,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we reserve 12 seats at the McGlynn Middle School because the McGlynn Middle School houses our EL program.

168
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:29,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want parents to understand that that's the building where all the English learner educators are assigned.

169
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:34,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And that particular program is housed at the McGlynn Middle School Complex.

170
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:49,066
[SPEAKER_01]: So the three buffer seats that are added, in the end, it's 12 seats that are coded as a buffer for the bodies that will be coming over the course of the entire school year.

171
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a timeline of events.

172
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:58,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the Zoom call right now.

173
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:06,833
[SPEAKER_01]: This Friday, March 24th, there's going to be a special letter going out to you.

174
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the sibling opt-in, opt-out form.

175
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:15,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna have Dr. Riccardelli just talk about that for you.

176
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:18,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm in the same room as the superintendent.

177
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:20,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you can see me.

178
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:28,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, this Friday in the evening, I believe it is set for eight o'clock, the letter is gonna go out.

179
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:37,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we have been doing in preparation for the lottery for the past couple of months is going through, identifying those students who have siblings.

180
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:45,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, any student who is in grade six or seven this year at either the Andrews or the McGlynn,

181
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:56,384
[SPEAKER_03]: We've identified those students, we have identified students who are on an IEP, we've identified students who are in special programs, we've reached out to principals.

182
00:23:56,764 --> 00:24:01,729
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that has been going on behind the scenes before any of this has occurred tonight.

183
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:16,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if you have been identified as someone that can assert their, their right for a sibling preference, you will be granted, you'll be given a letter will be sent to you from MS lottery.

184
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:27,372
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not, you're not going to receive that email so I don't want everyone to think they'll be receiving an email, only if you've been identified as having a sibling.

185
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:42,342
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have children who are in the school system who you believe you should have received the letter, you can reach out to us and we certainly will follow up.

186
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:47,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe at this point, you probably have received a letter from the superintendent.

187
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:50,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was scheduled to go out right around five or 5.05 today.

188
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:52,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Dr. Cushing was pushing that out.

189
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does have all of the information.

190
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:55,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the dates.

191
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,526
[SPEAKER_03]: for all of the events.

192
00:24:58,926 --> 00:25:04,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, Wednesday, the 22nd, we're here in the Zoom session.

193
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday, the 24th, we have the sibling letters going out.

194
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:14,390
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like the sibling letters back, so it's an opt-in or an opt-out.

195
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:23,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to receive a response from each family who receives one, so the student can bring it to their school and hand it in to the teacher, and we will collect them.

196
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:29,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We want those letters back by the 31st of March, so there's a one week turnaround on that.

197
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:36,214
[SPEAKER_03]: On Thursday, April 6 each grade five student is going to receive a lottery number in a letter.

198
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:42,123
[SPEAKER_03]: to the parent or caregiver, and the students are going to carry this letter home.

199
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:47,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be in their backpack, it'll come home, it'll include their lottery number.

200
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:53,736
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also give those lottery numbers to the principal of each school, just so they have them.

201
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:58,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a record, so if you lose the letter, we have a record of all of the numbers.

202
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:03,986
[SPEAKER_03]: The lottery draw is on Wednesday, April 12th at 3pm.

203
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,234
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that at three o'clock in the afternoon.

204
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:08,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's relatively quick.

205
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: You are welcome to join us to see the lottery.

206
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the past, people have been expecting us to pull up numbers.

207
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:20,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't.

208
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done with an automatic random number generator.

209
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:27,052
[SPEAKER_03]: StatTrak is the program.

210
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:32,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our data specialist, Kim Miles, working with us.

211
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:39,140
[SPEAKER_03]: It's televised, and she goes in, she types in, and the numbers are generated.

212
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:49,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Those numbers will be posted to our website by the evening on that day, usually within an hour, as soon as we can get them up onto our website.

213
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:55,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the official letters are going to go out with the assignments.

214
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:58,741
[SPEAKER_03]: The middle was middle school assignments are going to go out on Monday, April 24.

215
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:04,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why there is that that distance between April 12, which is the lottery.

216
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:08,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And April 24 is that April vacation is in the middle.

217
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:14,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have several staff members here who will not be here during that entire time.

218
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:24,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, you'll be able to, with your number, you'll be able to tell which middle school your child is assigned to on the evening of the 12th.

219
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:33,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the exciting part is in early May when the students get to visit their new middle school.

220
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tuesday, May 2nd is the McGlynn Middle School open house at 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock PM.

221
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:46,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And the staff and Mr. Tucci, the principal, are very excited to meet the students on that evening.

222
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on Thursday, May 4th, the staff and principal at the Andrews will be very excited to meet the incoming Andrews students.

223
00:27:55,294 --> 00:28:01,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of this information is the letter that you probably have received in the past maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

224
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check your email at the conclusion of this.

225
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:11,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a layout of what the process is.

226
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be transparent with this because we understand that there are

227
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:23,541
[SPEAKER_03]: know, people are concerned about, you know, friendships, they, you know, they're hoping for a certain school, perhaps.

228
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:31,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be straightforward and transparent with everyone that this is a very clear, clean process.

229
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:34,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is why we televise it.

230
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we are explaining what the process is to you.

231
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:45,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I turn it over to the superintendent, one question that comes up every year, and I've got to think there are at least one or two sets of twins in this group.

232
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:54,203
[SPEAKER_03]: People usually ask if there are twins, how do they get to assert sibling preference or how does that work?

233
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Each student will receive their own lottery number.

234
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:02,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say one student is assigned to the Andrews and one student is assigned to the McGlynn.

235
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:08,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Either one can assert their sibling preference and get transferred over to the other school.

236
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:11,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they can stay at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

237
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:15,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's possible they both would have the lottery draw at the same middle school.

238
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is just a question that comes up every year.

239
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:22,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just anticipating that question.

240
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, I'm going to turn it back over to the superintendent and if you have any further questions.

241
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:39,833
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I'm going to go back to our screen share just to finish up the slide deck, and then we will take any questions that you may have.

242
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:46,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dr. Riccadeli just went through the entire timeline of events.

243
00:29:47,446 --> 00:30:02,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, Dr. Riccadeli, Bernadette Riccadeli, and Kim Miles, that's K-M-Y-L-E-S at medford.k12.ma.us, our data manager, they both will

244
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:18,658
[SPEAKER_01]: be overseeing all of the background work related to the lottery so if there are challenges, you can use this email Ms middle school lottery at Medford k 12.ma.us and.

245
00:30:24,178 --> 00:30:26,559
[SPEAKER_01]: they will be able to help you very quickly.

246
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:37,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Dr. Riccadeli already shared, the principals of each school will also have the official lottery numbers assigned to your child.

247
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:47,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be another way to keep track of that special number that you're gonna be assigned prior to the lottery.

248
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:49,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.

249
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:52,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we discussed it.

250
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:59,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I also will be putting this in my updates moving, continuing to put it in the updates moving forward.

251
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:05,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday, April 12th, the lottery Zoom is at three o'clock.

252
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:08,355
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually very, very quick.

253
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:17,357
[SPEAKER_01]: We play Jeopardy music and we try to have it be an enjoyable process, but it's something that is generated fairly quickly and

254
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:24,845
[SPEAKER_01]: we probably are able to complete the lottery within, I would say like 20 minutes.

255
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:37,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't see the lottery, you're not able to catch it live, it will be available and the numbers will be uploaded as soon as it's done onto our website.

256
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:41,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Zoom link is there.

257
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the,

258
00:31:48,917 --> 00:32:05,303
[SPEAKER_01]: April 24th is the date where you will receive your official, Monday, April 24th, right after April vacation, you'll receive your official notification of which school you're assigned to.

259
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:15,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the following week, both middle school communities are ready to warmly welcome you again, Tuesday at the McGlynn.

260
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,831
[SPEAKER_01]: and Thursday at the Andrews.

261
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:21,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are dates.

262
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:32,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I end with the purpose of the lottery was an attempt to balance the scales, balance the two schools to the best of our ability.

263
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:38,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's not a perfect system and you can never get it to be exactly

264
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:42,748
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 50 because we're dealing with some numbers that are fluctuating.

265
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:48,998
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what the lottery has been doing for the Medford public schools.

266
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:52,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a question, we have a question.

267
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:52,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

268
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stop the share.

269
00:32:55,066 --> 00:33:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to read a question that someone sent to me directly, but I think it's a really good question.

270
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:14,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So one person on the call asks, do students on IEPs who don't have a specific need that requires them to go to a specific school and go through the lottery have their drop posted at the same time as everyone else has posted?

271
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:16,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

272
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,559
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't separate.

273
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,960
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't say these are the students on the IEP, their numbers.

274
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:28,504
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get the numbers for the students from the Brooks.

275
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:30,024
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the numbers.

276
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:32,186
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the students who are going to the Andrews.

277
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,107
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the students that are going to the McGlynn.

278
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:38,409
[SPEAKER_03]: No one will know that there were two lotteries.

279
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: If we didn't tell you, you wouldn't know that there were two lotteries, but we do want to be transparent with that.

280
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:46,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So the answer to the question is no one will know.

281
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:47,915
[SPEAKER_03]: The numbers will be together.

282
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:52,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really respect student confidentiality.

283
00:33:53,479 --> 00:34:08,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, with the spirit of transparency, we want you to know that there is a separate draw to balance those numbers between the two schools for some of the assignments, but everything just gets added.

284
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:14,415
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lists are put together, you're not going to see any names.

285
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:22,066
[SPEAKER_01]: the number that you are assigned for your family, that's your personal number.

286
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:31,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do not have to say my number is, you know, X, Y, Z, that's a letter, but my number is one, two, three.

287
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your personal number.

288
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:41,183
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we wanted you to know when they go home, they're gonna go home by backpack on Thursday, April 6th.

289
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, again, if there's a challenge, the principal,

290
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,996
[SPEAKER_01]: has the principal will have a master list.

291
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:54,542
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also email middle school lottery, mslotteryatmedford.k12.ma.us.

292
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:58,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Riccadeli and Ms.

293
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:07,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim Miles, they also will be supporting any of logistical questions that you may have regarding the lottery process.

294
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:10,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an excellent question.

295
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for asking that.

296
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:17,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking at another question, and it has to do with new students to the district.

297
00:35:18,498 --> 00:35:26,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we've done over the past couple of years since we've been doing the lottery is they're not included in the lottery because they're not currently enrolled in the metropolitan schools.

298
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:39,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So at a certain point, probably, I think it's been done in July, those students have been assigned to a school, or as soon as they, let's say they enroll in June,

299
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:54,250
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end of the school year, probably within three weeks or so, one of the assistant superintendents would assign them to a school that would be communicated with the Parent Information Center, and they would contact the family.

300
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not included in the lottery.

301
00:35:57,912 --> 00:36:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another question about students on a 504.

302
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:02,093
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they assigned?

303
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:16,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the background work that we've been doing has been around communicating with our elementary schools, with the administration, with our support team in each one of the schools.

304
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And when there is a specific need about a program, then the students are assigned to the school that is most appropriate based on that program.

305
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:33,620
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be situations that it's not a program, but there are other things that need to be considered.

306
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do do that.

307
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:44,686
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are further questions, you certainly can reach out to me through that MS Lottery email, and we can have a conversation about that.

308
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:50,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone wants me to clarify the info about the twins.

309
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:56,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, if each of the twins, or if there were triplets,

310
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: would get their own individual number.

311
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:13,306
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are assigned to different schools and the decision is made, the parent wants them at the same school, the parent can contact either Kim Miles or myself and we can assert sibling preference.

312
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that case, it's just a matter of communicating with us and we will honor that sibling preference.

313
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would get to choose.

314
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Provided they get two schools.

315
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, provided you get two schools.

316
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If both are assigned to McGlynn, you can't choose the Andrews and vice versa.

317
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:37,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're assigned to the two different schools, then yes, you would insert that sibling preference.

318
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that answered that.

319
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:46,347
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, I am happy to talk to you individually.

320
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:49,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any more questions.

321
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:54,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else?

322
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:55,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else?

323
00:37:58,298 --> 00:37:59,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?

324
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:00,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Delphine, yes.

325
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:04,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I typed in the chat, but I don't know if you can actually see it.

326
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a question about twins, but my twins are coming from a different school.

327
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:20,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're already enrolled at the Medford Public Schools, but they are, I guess, they're not gonna be part of the lottery or how will that work?

328
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so you registered them but they're not enrolled.

329
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what we have done in the past is, unless they are enrolled they don't participate in the lottery, they will be, they will be assigned sometime sometime in the summer will be after the close of school will be after June.

330
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:55,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because we would like to go to an open house, I think they were very nervous to transfer, so it would be great to know before the summer, if possible, or should we just go to be able to attend both open houses because you since you're not enrolled in.

331
00:38:56,187 --> 00:39:00,590
[SPEAKER_01]: the Medford public schools, we would not be able to say what the assignment is.

332
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So the open houses, we hold them on two different days.

333
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:24,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tuesday, May 2nd, and or Thursday, May 4th, each school will be offering the open house, but the original lottery takes place for all students that are currently in the system.

334
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And what if I've already been to the registration office?

335
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean they're still not in the system?

336
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:36,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're currently attending another school.

337
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:45,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they're attending a different school, you've begun the registration process.

338
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:49,257
[SPEAKER_01]: But registration is officially complete when the students

339
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:59,302
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the prerequisites, what needs to be there, all of that documentation would be there.

340
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:00,003
Okay.

341
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:00,563
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

342
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:00,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

343
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:01,865
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

344
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:15,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see another question and this, this is about if the sibling is currently at the McGlynn elementary would the middle school or go to the McGlynn or just be part of the lottery.

345
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so this is something that came up a couple of years ago and we decided that yes, if that.

346
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:28,147
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be considered the sibling relationship.

347
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:33,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you wanted to assert the sibling preference and just go to McGlynn, that would be fine.

348
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So those individuals have been identified, and those individuals who have a younger sibling in the lower grades at the McGlynn can opt to do that.

349
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:50,145
[SPEAKER_03]: You will get a letter if you've been identified as that.

350
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And some, the answer is yes, and some families actually,

351
00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:07,435
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, opt to say, I would like to go through the lottery experience and, you know, take my chance 50-50 to see what school my child will be assigned to.

352
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So that also has happened.

353
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:19,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I see another question about the differences in the differences in the school.

354
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll talk a little bit about the general education experience.

355
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:31,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So both schools mirror each other when it comes to the general curriculum, the core curriculum.

356
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:40,091
[SPEAKER_03]: English, math, science, social studies, art, music, computers, world language.

357
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:44,513
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all of the same, same curriculum.

358
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously there are different teachers, but it's the same curriculum.

359
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,455
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle school, those subjects are organized by department.

360
00:41:53,215 --> 00:42:00,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have common department directors that hold meetings, that hold those teachers accountable to those

361
00:42:01,212 --> 00:42:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: those common standards and the common curriculum.

362
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot in common with what is taught.

363
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:21,623
[SPEAKER_03]: The physical structure of the school is, well, obviously a little bit different because the McGlynn is a pre-k to eight school, whereas the Andrews is a grade six through eight school.

364
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: With regard to the special programs.

365
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:35,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask the superintendent with regard to strutting eat well I know the EL program is housed at the McGlynn middle school, but with regard to the special ed programs.

366
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,074
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different there are there are different specialized programs the Andrews.

367
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:48,216
[SPEAKER_01]: has one specialized program and the McGlynn has a different program.

368
00:42:48,296 --> 00:43:05,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, depending on the needs of the students and those students, if their IEP requires them to be placed in one of the specialized programs, then we are obligated to place them in that appropriate placement.

369
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:08,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So the schools do have,

370
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:23,759
[SPEAKER_01]: They both service students with special needs, with disabilities, and they both, the McGlynn is the only school that does service our students that are English learners.

371
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the, I think the one key difference that the English learner program

372
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,452
[SPEAKER_01]: is not at both of the middle schools.

373
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:48,059
[SPEAKER_01]: There are special licensed teachers and they work together as a team in helping our students move through the English language development levels.

374
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:51,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is how they do work.

375
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:55,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers that question.

376
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:03,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone asked, I think maybe one person had asked for my email, my contact information.

377
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:04,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it in there for everybody.

378
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, there's that MS Lottery, or if you wanna reach out to me directly, my email is there.

379
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:17,489
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so someone is asking about how do they know if their child's IEP needs are dictating their placement?

380
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there more specific info on which IEP services are specific to which schools?

381
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about a student who is on an IEP and receives support in a class, it's general support.

382
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:34,578
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we do the lottery.

383
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:43,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So where that second or sub lottery within the larger lottery is done, because we have the same programs at both schools.

384
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:50,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when you get into those more specialized special education programs that are specific

385
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: that's when they are assigned to an individual school.

386
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:02,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's my best answer on that.

387
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:15,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And if additional guidance is needed in the area of special education, we can definitely have you speak with the ETLs in your respective buildings.

388
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:15,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ms.

389
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:18,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Joan Bowen is our director of student services.

390
00:45:19,614 --> 00:45:24,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to make sure that we do respect student confidentiality.

391
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:31,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the lottery was created, we wanted it to be as equitable as possible.

392
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:41,642
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we are required to make sure that we are providing the required services for students in the right programs.

393
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:44,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the schools do

394
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:48,444
[SPEAKER_01]: house different programs, slightly different programs.

395
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:59,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there are specific IEP type questions, we definitely can make sure we have special educators involved in that part of the conversation.

396
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:09,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know you were going to have such wonderful questions.

397
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a wonderful, inquisitive bunch.

398
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:16,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine what your rising sixth graders are going to be like.

399
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:22,202
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to just say thank you for jumping on the call this evening.

400
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:25,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for all of the questions.

401
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, Sarah, you've raised your hand.

402
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:29,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah, we'll take your question.

403
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:37,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, working on unmuting on my phone.

404
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:41,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I had put it in the chat, but maybe I missed where the questions were supposed to go.

405
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:55,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be spoken to just a little bit what the opportunities are for students from the two different schools to see each other if there's any programming or time during the day where that happens, and if not, or even also

406
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard that there was also subgrouping within the schools.

407
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:11,088
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a group A and a group B at each school, that maybe that only was during the pandemic, but that the groups were sort of further subdivided into groups within the schools.

408
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that still the case?

409
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:25,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, is there, what are the opportunities for students to socialize sort of at the middle school level with students that are either in the other school or in another group within their school?

410
00:47:26,785 --> 00:47:46,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first piece that I would definitely wanna just share is that if we're anticipating about 300 or so rising fifth graders, it could be a little over 300, that number is split in half.

411
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:52,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about class size, you're not going to be able to have

412
00:47:54,741 --> 00:48:00,583
[SPEAKER_01]: a class, one class of 150 students, you know, taking grade six math.

413
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:02,744
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the, you know, the college level.

414
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:18,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you get to that number of 150, it has to be broken down into smaller classrooms, homerooms, if I can use the term homeroom, since you just left, like groups of 25 as they move,

415
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:26,308
[SPEAKER_01]: to math and history and ELA and world language.

416
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:39,211
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're hearing A and B or the different groupings, it's just taking the large number of 150 and putting them into respective classrooms.

417
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the classes have to rotate.

418
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:50,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is one of the big differences between elementary and leaving elementary school level and entering secondary.

419
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So from six through 12.

420
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:58,159
[SPEAKER_01]: The students will be rotating and the teachers that they will have will be content.

421
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:06,842
[SPEAKER_01]: area content experts in a specific domain, whether it's science or ELA, humanities, math, etc.

422
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:18,087
[SPEAKER_01]: So the students will be divided into homerooms because, you know, it's just impossible to have the entire cohort travel as one.

423
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a

424
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,042
[SPEAKER_01]: a subdivision in terms of something bad.

425
00:49:25,202 --> 00:49:30,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just breaking them up into manageable numbers so that they can rotate.

426
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:34,140
[SPEAKER_01]: through the different content, the different classes.

427
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:56,132
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of opportunities for the middle school students to actually engage and see one another, those would be primarily afterschool opportunities because we have, both schools have a significant amount of club offerings and we're a part of the GBL, the Greater Boston League of,

428
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:01,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So sports are also available at the middle school level.

429
00:50:02,314 --> 00:50:12,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the respective open houses, they will talk to you about all of the programs and afterschool offerings that are available for the students.

430
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:18,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So both schools offer afterschool programming and there is a late bus.

431
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have from arts, you have sports, you have,

432
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:28,653
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, chess, I believe there's a chess club, there may be like acting or drama.

433
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:36,521
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of, there's a diverse array of offerings for students to participate.

434
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:46,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were assigned to the McGlynn School, but your friends or someone in your class was assigned to the Andrews,

435
00:50:46,795 --> 00:51:03,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And the after school program that was a greater interest to you was offered at the Andrews, then during those days you would be able to go to the Andrews so they, you're allowed to cross register for just the purposes of saying there are those opportunities.

436
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:11,526
[SPEAKER_01]: where the students can see each other in many of the extracurricular events and activities.

437
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:24,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, because of how transportation goes, if students were taking the school bus transportation, then they would be on the same buses in the morning and in the afternoon.

438
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,494
[SPEAKER_01]: because the buses drop off at both schools.

439
00:51:29,114 --> 00:51:31,454
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're on the same transportation.

440
00:51:31,474 --> 00:51:44,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could see each other at the start of the day, see each other in extracurricular afterschool programming activities, and then be together when they're leaving or be together playing sports.

441
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:50,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are definite opportunities for the students to be together.

442
00:51:51,923 --> 00:52:01,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, could I just follow up on one thing you said just to make sure I understood it right you said that students are sort of assigned to we'll call it a homeroom.

443
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:10,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean that they stay with the same you know classroom size group of kids through all of the subjects or like for each subject that just gets reshuffled.

444
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:14,443
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer, this is Bernadette speaking.

445
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:17,184
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is no.

446
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:22,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a, you know, it's not a tracked group of students.

447
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:27,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, I wanna, you know, talk a little bit more about what the superintendent said about the teams.

448
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're broken up into teams.

449
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an A team, there's a B team in grade six.

450
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The team A, so the students that are assigned to team A do have the same science teacher, math teacher, history teacher,

451
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:42,052
[SPEAKER_03]: an English teacher.

452
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:47,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And then language is a little bit different because we have three operands for language.

453
00:52:48,337 --> 00:52:52,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But those students are not necessarily in all of the same classes together.

454
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that answers your question.

455
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:03,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have the same four teachers, but they may not be in the same English class with the same students.

456
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:05,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a rotation.

457
00:53:06,004 --> 00:53:16,028
[SPEAKER_03]: A question that came up just related to this is, if one child was assigned to team A, will the sibling be assigned to team A?

458
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,572
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not necessarily.

459
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:22,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it could happen, but it's not an automatic.

460
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:30,659
[SPEAKER_03]: We do support students moving between the teams.

461
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,861
[SPEAKER_03]: We think that that is a healthy thing.

462
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:36,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It should not be anything that is stagnant.

463
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:40,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer to that question is no.

464
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?

465
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to say thank you.

466
00:53:57,707 --> 00:53:59,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for jumping on the call this evening.

467
00:54:00,548 --> 00:54:02,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the wonderful questions that you've asked.

468
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:08,811
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are more questions, please email mslottery.org.

469
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:26,104
[SPEAKER_01]: at medford.k12.ma.us and your questions about programmatic offerings and all of the other specifics of the schools, once you get assigned, which is on

470
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:31,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday, April 24, you'll know which open house you'll be attending.

471
00:54:32,512 --> 00:54:36,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, those are not open houses, which orientation you'll be attending.

472
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:41,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And those dates are Tuesday, May 2, from 6 p.m.

473
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:42,237
[SPEAKER_01]: to 8 p.m.

474
00:54:42,918 --> 00:54:47,060
[SPEAKER_01]: at the McGlynn, and Thursday, May 4, from 6 p.m.

475
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,960
[SPEAKER_01]: to 8 p.m.

476
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:49,021
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Andrews.

477
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:56,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to everyone again on the call and have a good evening.
