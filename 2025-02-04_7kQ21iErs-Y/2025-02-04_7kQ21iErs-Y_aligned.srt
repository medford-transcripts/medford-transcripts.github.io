1
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,348
Test one, two.

2
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:33,810
This is the Public Health and Community Safety Committee, February 4th, 7pm, 730, 727.

3
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,032
Thank you for being here.

4
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:47,599
Today we are going to discuss, offered by Councilor Singh and Councilor Collins, the resolution to draft an ordinance to secure the rights to gender affirming care.

5
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,760
We will also be discussing

6
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:53,583
um, reproductive health care in this ordinance.

7
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:57,484
Um, I have a couple of updates.

8
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:03,486
We, uh, attempted to run this by our legal representation before today, but they did.

9
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:08,888
They let us know they wouldn't have had time to review the document before this meeting.

10
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:12,630
They said by the end of this week, they can get a full review back to us.

11
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,671
So what they did send me was, um,

12
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:24,474
A little, what it was, was a press release from the Healey-Driscoll administration that included this quote.

13
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:30,276
It says, in Massachusetts, gender-affirming health care is a legally and constitutionally protected right.

14
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:39,280
The Healey-Driscoll administration is committed to ensuring the protection of that right, both for Massachusetts residents and those who travel to the Commonwealth for care.

15
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:51,670
Chapter 127 of the Acts of 2022, an act expanding protections for reproductive and gender affirming care, codifying these measures, ensuring the Commonwealth's ability to protect patients from out-of-state legal action.

16
00:05:53,062 --> 00:06:03,306
It also gave gender-affirming care providers the ability to enroll in the Commonwealth's Address Confidentiality Program, ACP, to ensure privacy and safety for their families.

17
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:14,571
This was a press release from 2023 that had many quotes from different leadership at the state level affirming the state's commitment to gender-affirming care.

18
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,220
gender-affirming care, reproductive health care, safety in Massachusetts.

19
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:26,742
That being said, we still felt it was valuable and important to bring this forward.

20
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:37,126
During this presidential administration, we're not sure of anything.

21
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:37,787
We're not sure

22
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:47,534
how things could go and shoring up what our residents are asking us to shore up is valuable, we think.

23
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:57,543
We've been hearing from some citizen advocacy groups and we're going to follow through with

24
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:01,808
those measures and this ordinance was already in the pipeline.

25
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,169
We've been talking about it for a little while.

26
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:09,892
So we have a draft that you all received and hopefully you had a chance to look it over.

27
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:26,582
It covers, you know, some language that was borrowed from other municipalities that sort of talks about, you know, these sorts of healthcare providers will be protected in Medford and not, you know,

28
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,067
prosecuted or, um.

29
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,989
That sort of like that sort of language.

30
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:41,375
So if anybody if sorry, but I've been speaking so much because this is really counselor saying this project, so I will let you take it away.

31
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,016
Thank you.

32
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:43,696
Wait one second.

33
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,038
I'm sorry.

34
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,399
I forgot how to use the mix.

35
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:48,659
No worries.

36
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,521
One second.

37
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:50,841
One second.

38
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,320
I touch it and then I touch what?

39
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,261
Touch it.

40
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,921
Then you push mic live.

41
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,381
There we go.

42
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:06,022
Thank you, Chair Lazaro.

43
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:10,343
I think you put it very well, why we're doing this.

44
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:15,104
You know, we're hearing from residents that they're worried about what's happening nationally.

45
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:24,826
And they've been worried since the Dobbs decision years ago, that really put reproductive health care at stake.

46
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:45,939
You know, I think residents know that Massachusetts is a state where we do believe very strongly and affirmatively in women's rights in rights of, you know, our youth to get the care that they need in the rights of doctors to make the best recommendations that they can for their patients.

47
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,673
You know, with that being said, we also don't want Medford to be the site of conflict, right?

48
00:08:53,693 --> 00:09:12,446
We don't want Medford to be where hospitals, you know, that provide this type of care are, you know, having to give up their doctors or having to give up their patients to police that's not from Massachusetts, you know, and putting their patients and their employees at risk.

49
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:26,250
And there have been a number of measures that the Healey administration has taken to protect and safeguard these rights, but that's not enough when we know that there's so much uncertainty about what could happen.

50
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:30,592
Just in the last few weeks, I think it's been really striking.

51
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:53,477
to see how the federal government is using its levers and its influence to make states, to make individuals, to make different levels of government and different branches of government succumb to its own will and to succumb to their view of how government should be run or not run.

52
00:09:56,598 --> 00:10:01,063
it's really important that we do all we can to safeguard those liberties that we have.

53
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:06,929
It should be noted that a lot of what's happening nationally is actually illegal.

54
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,552
It goes against statutes that Congress has passed.

55
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,694
It goes against separation of powers.

56
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:14,676
But, you know,

57
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:39,657
that I think underscores how important it is for us to be taking every step and to make be responding to our residents who are reaching out and who are worried about what, you know, decisions nationally what the bills being introduced in the House and Senate, which proposed the banning criminalized abortion care, which proposed to, you know, restrict and ban on gender affirming care.

58
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,357
what that means for residents in Medford.

59
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:46,958
And this is what we can do as a city council to protect our residents.

60
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:55,961
I think it underscores the, you know, the point that I've been making over the last few years that oftentimes what is national is local.

61
00:10:56,481 --> 00:11:00,682
And that happens at so many levels, but those anxieties carry down as well.

62
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,503
And I think it's our job to respond to them.

63
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:19,050
With that being said, really quickly talking about what chair Lazaro and I have done over the last few years, or last few weeks, it does cross into 2024, so I guess two years, two calendar years.

64
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:32,040
But what we've done is we've taken the discussions at the last public health committee meeting, we've basically cleaned up the draft text that we had at that meeting to become

65
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:44,338
more readable, more organized, to get rid of potential redundancies, to get rid of things that we might not need.

66
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:53,702
We also made sure that the language was all accurate when it came to Medford, that it best represented what we see in our city right now.

67
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,383
We made sure to add some language where it made sense.

68
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:13,931
And we chose to expand parts of it, although this is very much still content-wise tied or, you know, very much overlapping with what has already been passed by other municipalities in Massachusetts.

69
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:31,369
I think the other thing to note is that at that community discussion, we talked about potentially expanding the language to include prescription drugs at pharmacies.

70
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:42,856
That's something that a lot of Massachusetts municipalities are doing, although in doing more research about that, I think the model language that I found didn't completely capture, I think,

71
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,554
a realistic situation for Medford.

72
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:54,639
I think there was a lot of talk about DOH rules and Board of Health rules and a lot of talk about funding and us appropriating funds.

73
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,301
I know that's a whole separate discussion.

74
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:06,328
And with our city charter, the mayor is the one with the power to suggest where funds

75
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:13,314
go or and how they're spent and to make that decision pending about affirmative vote of the City Council.

76
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:18,179
So with that being said, I chose not to put that in the draft before us today.

77
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,665
However, I did ask Chair Al-Azhar to ask the Board of Health

78
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:31,189
about ways we could include those ideas in a way that better reflected what we have here in Medford.

79
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:43,417
So whether that would make sense, it would make sense for us to put some version of that language in this ordinance or in an ordinance or for them to just explore that as department policy.

80
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,101
So that's basically the status of the draft that we have in front of us.

81
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:51,162
Thank you.

82
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:53,918
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

83
00:13:54,419 --> 00:14:00,571
So I did share this draft with the Director of

84
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,931
the health department and the chief of police.

85
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:11,976
I didn't hear back, but that doesn't mean that they don't have, you know, an interest or stake in this.

86
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:17,961
It just means they probably have other pressing matters going on, which I understand.

87
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:25,146
So it may just be a matter of, you know, following up again, we do still have to get affirmative

88
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,708
response from our legal representation.

89
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:32,370
So it's going to we're not going to be able to necessarily pass this out of committee tonight.

90
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:46,157
So it's also possible that we could move forward with this, and then come back to it if we wanted to add something about prescription medication at a later time with an amendment like we did with

91
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:49,519
that we're not trying to do the work of another.

92
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,342
Municipality another state or the federal government or anybody else's policies or

93
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,633
those goals for another group.

94
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:24,996
It's not our role, it's not our responsibility, and it's not something that we wanna do.

95
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:31,780
Are there any other comments from other members of the council about the draft that you saw or thoughts or motions?

96
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,062
Vice President Collins.

97
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,114
Thank you.

98
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:45,399
I just want to extend my gratitude to counselor saying for taking leadership on this project I've reviewed it.

99
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,542
It's even more thorough than it was last time we reviewed it in committee.

100
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:54,988
I'm just I'm really glad that the city council is taking it upon itself to make sure that we are.

101
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,572
making these protections just as airtight and as clear for our population as we possibly could.

102
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:19,797
It's unfortunate that we're having to workshop this ordinance in a moment when federal actors are taking a regressive, frankly, ahistorical, oppressive

103
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:26,800
politicizing approach to matters of reproductive health and gender expression.

104
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:39,616
That baffles me on lots of levels, but what's important is that people in Medford, people who visit Medford, people who receive medical care in Medford, or people who give medical care at Medford

105
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:58,594
should have every protection to get what they need and do what they do and receive care and provide care, and I think it's very important that the city council affirm that reproductive health care and all its forms and gender affirming health care and all of their forms are the farthest leg from legal, they are utterly banal.

106
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:22,735
very pleased to see that this ordinance is so thorough and describing all of the forms of health care, to which people are entitled, and making it really clear that all city agents across all departments shall not deploy their resources or their time and service of agendas from other states or other jurisdictions that might want to waste time and energy.

107
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,096
politicizing healthcare.

108
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,017
So thank you so much.

109
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:26,557
I've reviewed this.

110
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:27,537
I think it's very thorough.

111
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:32,100
I'm happy to wait to pass it out of committee until we have a legal review.

112
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,765
I don't know that it's necessary if we do want to pass this along to the committee of the whole and just make further adjustments or tweaks there if it's necessary.

113
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:44,927
I think that that would also be fine, but I'll leave that to the discretion of the ordinance sponsor.

114
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,228
I think this is in a really good place.

115
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:46,948
Thank you.

116
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,674
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

117
00:17:54,695 --> 00:17:55,696
Councilor Sang.

118
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:58,760
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

119
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:11,845
for your impactful words about what's happening in this country, but also your kind words about this work that I've been doing alongside chair Lazaro, who should definitely receive a lot of credit too.

120
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:26,995
When it comes to the last question you asked about whether we should, you know, we pass out a committee tonight and then make, you know, small adjustments if needed on the floor versus keeping a committee.

121
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,037
I'm happy to do either.

122
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:29,437
I think it

123
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,378
make sense to keep it in committee.

124
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,560
I think it's something we could act pretty fast on once we get some guidance from AP law.

125
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:39,162
Thank you.

126
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,283
I also think it would be fine.

127
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:47,346
I mean, to keep it in committee, we've been scheduling these pretty swiftly.

128
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:52,649
We could even meet on Zoom if we needed to just move it along.

129
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:56,771
I think either is, I mean, it's up to you all.

130
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:57,712
I can't make questions.

131
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,358
So yeah, is there a motion who's ready to go?

132
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,543
Councilor Callahan, sorry, I'm still working on the mics.

133
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:18,374
I don't have a motion exactly but I would, I think it's probably easiest to just keep it in this committee.

134
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:22,198
I don't think there's current urgency because of the state that we live in.

135
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:29,985
So I would, I would say we just keep it in this committee and then we take it up next month when we've got the legal review and go from there.

136
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,514
Okay, thank you.

137
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:46,981
Councilor Callahan to, in the form of a motion, motion to keep the Councilor, motion by Councilor Callahan to keep the paper and committee pending legal review.

138
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,142
Okay, great.

139
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:50,824
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

140
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:52,785
All those in favor?

141
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,227
Okay, great, lovely.

142
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,069
Oh, do we have a,

143
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:05,455
Sorry, is there, would anybody like to speak on the topic from the public?

144
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:10,620
I see Ellen on Zoom.

145
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,365
Can you state your name and address for the record, please?

146
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:18,868
I'm going to ask you to unmute.

147
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,337
OK, thank you.

148
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:28,540
I just want to express my appreciation to the council, to this committee for being proactive on this issue.

149
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,402
I'm very pleased and proud of you, as usual.

150
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:33,062
Thank you.

151
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:41,005
Ellen, can you just give us your name and address for the record?

152
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:41,966
I apologize.

153
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:50,169
So sorry, Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street, Medford.

154
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:53,974

155
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:06,003
Sorry, Jen, on Zoom, please name and address for the record.

156
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:09,305
Hello, Jen Sullivan, 35 Washington Street.

157
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,567
I wanted to echo the same sentiment.

158
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:18,592
Everyone in Medford people power feels very strongly about this and supporting people that need this.

159
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,473
So again, just appreciate the work.

160
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:21,314
Thank you.

161
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,280
Thank you.

162
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,881
Is there any other public participation?

163
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:30,503
Thank you.

164
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,663
Sorry, I took the vote too fast.

165
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,524
I am out of practice running meetings.

166
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:45,290
Appreciate you all being here and we will take this up hopefully just one more time and hopefully the legal review will come back swiftly.

167
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,912
And we appreciate your time and attention.

168
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,113
And Councilor Callahan's hand is raised.

169
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:57,845
As long as we have finished and everyone has spoken, I would move that we adjourn.

170
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:01,407
Okay, motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang.

171
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:02,587
All those in favor?

172
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:02,667
Aye.

173
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:03,988
All opposed?

174
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,048
The motion passes.

175
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:05,988
Meeting is adjourned.

176
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:07,809
