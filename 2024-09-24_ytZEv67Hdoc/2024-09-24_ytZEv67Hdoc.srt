00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:14,807

[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to go.

12
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:53,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

13
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:56,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks everybody for your patience.

14
00:00:57,152 --> 00:01:04,880
[SPEAKER_08]: The action discussion items for this committee meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innis Associates team.

15
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:14,890
[SPEAKER_08]: At our last committee meeting, which was either two or three weeks ago, I forget, we had a really great mapping workshop that Innis Associates prepared.

16
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:24,094
[SPEAKER_08]: We looked at many different zoning maps displaying different zoning characteristics of Medford together.

17
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:28,075
[SPEAKER_08]: We split them out along tables in the city council chambers.

18
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:28,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We could all take a look.

19
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Many people made notes, asked questions.

20
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:38,400
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a forum for kind of more informal dialogue and lodging notes and asking questions of NS associates.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand that tonight we'll kind of have a short debrief.

22
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,862
[SPEAKER_08]: of some of the key takeaways from that forum.

23
00:01:45,902 --> 00:02:04,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, there were so many, so I'm hoping that we can just quickly touch on the highlights that will most directly inform the more short-term work ahead of this committee now, which is dealing with discussing and reviewing proposed updates to Mystic Avenue Corridor and the Salem Street Corridor.

24
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we're also going to hear an update on the

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:24,529
[SPEAKER_08]: ADUs law that was recently updated at the state level, and perhaps here's some updates on the condo conversion ordinance as well on these topics are all linked because of their relevance to both district and global housing strategies throughout the city.

26
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I recognize we are starting a little bit

27
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: behind schedule which is entirely my fault I apologize.

28
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:41,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Still since this meeting has a seven o'clock start I'm going to ask that we all make best efforts to wrap this up by 830 because City Hall staff has had a long day, and non City Hall staff has had a long day too.

29
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:43,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

30
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pass it off to Director Hunt and Planner Evans if you'd like to say anything and then we can just let NS Associates take it away.

31
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

32
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia Hunt from the Planning Department.

33
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with Danielle Evans.

34
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we really have any opening remarks.

35
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Staff from Innis Associates are on the call on the Zoom, and I think they're expecting to present.

36
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:12,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

37
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:13,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

38
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:14,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Paola and Jimmy, thank you for being here.

39
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:18,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

40
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.

41
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:26,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you for inviting us.

42
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost every week.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Paula Ramos-Martinez.

45
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Enos Associates, senior urban planner.

46
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:39,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here with Jimmy Rocha.

47
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,247
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our GIS specialist.

48
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:48,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one that has prepared for the last workshop all the amazing maps.

49
00:03:50,828 --> 00:04:01,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will share the presentation over here.

50
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see my screen?

51
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

52
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for this.

53
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:36,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the agenda what I have planned for today is I will, because there is a lot of things, so what we're going to do is a very fast report from the last planning committee meeting.

54
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:44,212
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the workshop so I'm going to go through the report but

55
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:45,672
[SPEAKER_01]: quite fast.

56
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:59,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We send it today to the councillors so if there is anything that they want to suggest or add to the conversation please it's more than welcome to do so.

57
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:04,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to go through the zoning recommendations for the corridors.

58
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:12,024
[SPEAKER_01]: We are examining Mystic Avenue and Salem Street and then a bit of the next steps that we have

59
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:22,531
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will talk about the future land use for the corridors, squares and neighbourhood centres, how we are planning in doing so.

60
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:30,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the timeline next, so you will see a bit of that just in a few seconds.

61
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:43,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are still working on some of the studies we have, the condo conversion, housing definitions, and that will be like co-live and co-housing, the way that people

62
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:48,110
[SPEAKER_01]: are living together and obviously that matters to zoning.

63
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:52,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will go into incentive zoning and green and cool score.

64
00:05:53,354 --> 00:06:02,200
[SPEAKER_01]: All these studies are going to be for the next meeting because otherwise it's really impossible to go through everything at this moment.

65
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,224
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will show some precedents and go through it

66
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,169
[SPEAKER_01]: quite deeply.

67
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the moment, we are going to do the report and the zoning recommendations.

68
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:24,039
[SPEAKER_01]: For the timeline, what I would like to do is to have certain days for an

69
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:34,209
[SPEAKER_01]: for the more study areas focus and then having between the more wide strategies.

70
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, last time we did the workshop, it was July 24th.

71
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:42,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're doing the Corridors Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.

72
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:47,300
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next one, we want to do the condo conversion, housing definitions and incentive zoning.

73
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: September 25th, we want to, what we are going to do today for the corridors, we want to do it for the squares.

74
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,853
[SPEAKER_01]: October 9, we will give the ADUs brief and affordable housing.

75
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,096
[SPEAKER_01]: October 23, the neighbourhood centres.

76
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:07,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, some citywide strategies.

77
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:20,204
[SPEAKER_01]: and in November 27th, the corridors that are left or bigger areas that we will also study that are in the comp plan.

78
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:37,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of having one meeting for more focused areas and one meeting for the bigger citywide so we don't lose the bigger picture and we can go in and out, swimming in and swimming out.

79
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:39,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

80
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:48,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the report from the last meeting in 24th of July, we had this type of very big maps.

81
00:07:48,630 --> 00:08:02,193
[SPEAKER_01]: We had for Medford, we had for Salem Street and Mystic Avenue, and we had all the councillors and also city staff to go through them and give their opinions, their concerns, what was worrying them.

82
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:09,074
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had the most that were commented were mainly on the residential clusters.

83
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:25,570
[SPEAKER_01]: and then on the zoning, asking for a mix of use to app zone to make ADUs by right, multi-tenant and how the transit as well will be affecting.

84
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:30,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So mainly focusing on the densification

85
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:47,202
[SPEAKER_01]: but keeping the character, also a lot of concerns of the permeability of the surface, climate resiliency strategies, and so on and so forth.

86
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:58,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, if I can show one second the report

87
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:09,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So in here, you see that we have all of the plans that we showed and with all of the comments.

88
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the different typologies and all the comments in one document.

89
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,565
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is to send it to the counselors.

90
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:25,448
[SPEAKER_01]: We send it today and we want you to review it.

91
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:31,091
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see something that should be there that you are not seeing, please let us know.

92
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:40,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to hear back from you and add any other concern that you might not know about.

93
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is for the report.

94
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to start with the corridors because it is quite a lot of

95
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:53,784
[SPEAKER_01]: things to talk about.

96
00:09:53,964 --> 00:10:01,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there are not any questions about the report or if there are not any comments, I would love to continue.

97
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,472
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know.

98
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:09,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

99
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:15,323
[SPEAKER_01]: So

100
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:22,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So the corridors, we have been studying Mystic Avenue and Salem Street.

101
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,972
[SPEAKER_01]: We will start with the Mystic Avenue.

102
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:31,418
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to talk a bit about the boundaries, then the connections with the immediate areas.

103
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:49,623
[SPEAKER_01]: and the opportunities that we might have, the land use, and with the land use we're going to see some sections to help us see a bit the height and how that is being addressed or how that relates to the street.

104
00:10:51,124 --> 00:11:07,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you see in here is Mystic Avenue, we have the yellowish background is the boundary that we have confirmed at the moment, and the black areas that you see the ones in Main Street.

105
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:15,000
[SPEAKER_01]: that is all black were proposed in the workshop.

106
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it is a very great idea to add these ones, these two blocks.

107
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:25,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we suggest to also have it in.

108
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:36,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have these two areas that we suggest that are included, but that we need more information

109
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:47,591
[SPEAKER_01]: We need also to contact the residents, we need to have a bit more of reach out to see if this is possible or not.

110
00:11:48,672 --> 00:12:01,879
[SPEAKER_01]: To us it's interesting because we have Willis Avenue that is the parallel to Main Street, connects also Main Street with Mystic Avenue, and it is interesting to

111
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:18,251
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to have at the end of the street that corner already telling you that there is some commercial and that we can have this more inner street that is already having the commercial atmosphere that will take you to Mystic Avenue.

112
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:28,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought these two blocks will be interesting to add and as well as here a bit more in the south because of how it is surrounded.

113
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all around these big lots

114
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,323
[SPEAKER_01]: and big buildings.

115
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:36,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these residential are a bit in the middle.

116
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:48,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how we do to make a better transition, we are studying also to make them be part of the Mystic Avenue boundary.

117
00:12:52,173 --> 00:13:02,415
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm presenting here is just as an idea some connections that can give us a lot of opportunities in these areas.

118
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:15,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two main connections and that is the one on the north at the other side of Mystic Avenue we have the downtown and so we can have this kind of continuation of the downtown into Main Street.

119
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:33,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you see these kind of stars is only to referring that there we could have a landmark, we could have a use that has a lot of active ground floor, so that we see that connection and that we give continuation to the downtown.

120
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:44,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And then further on the south, we have the connection that will be like a green bigger connection with the park.

121
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:49,057
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side of Mystic, there's also a connection with Wellington, there is a bike path.

122
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:54,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a lot of potential to bring this into Mystic Avenue.

123
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:58,264
[SPEAKER_01]: We have already a green area that can be more

124
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:11,389
[SPEAKER_01]: urbanized, at the moment it's very green, more like infrastructure green, but that it can be used and so these two areas could be interesting to having a lot of active ground floor.

125
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:25,335
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't mean that it has to be now, this is something that we are studying towards the future and where we see good possibilities and opportunities.

126
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:38,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And after this, if you want to, I think that I will talk about all Domestic Avenue, and then we can talk about it City Councilor and City staff.

127
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:47,290
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to, there is something that you really need to talk to, to speak out, that's also fine by me.

128
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to interrupt, feel free to interrupt.

129
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are going into the land use.

130
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:05,542
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to be a bit more detailed, but at the moment we are dividing these into four areas.

131
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,645
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really three, we have the blue areas,

132
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:21,299
[SPEAKER_01]: the center area, the east of Mystic Avenue and the west of Mystic Avenue are very different.

133
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:28,121
[SPEAKER_01]: The urban fabric, it's very fragmented on the west.

134
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:37,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see also the depth of these lots are very different from the east of Mystic.

135
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:39,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this subtle

136
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:45,520
[SPEAKER_01]: different of colours because it will reflect in the zoning.

137
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:52,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So this part of the blue area, how we see it, is that extension of the downtown.

138
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has all the historical divisions, all the historical street divisions.

139
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:12,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think it can be very interesting, also very smaller lots that we can have here, a high density, but very kind of small to meet a scale.

140
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:30,370
[SPEAKER_01]: here we don't want any gas station or auto-oriented, this should be very much, very walkable, very accessible and just as a continuation of downtown.

141
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:40,475
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have some, the police building and we have the fire trucks, those are, the fire station, those are

142
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:47,091
[SPEAKER_01]: civic buildings, so they are not going to have to answer to the zoning.

143
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,764
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, it's also interesting to have them in this area.

144
00:16:54,393 --> 00:17:03,957
[SPEAKER_01]: The inner streets should have a totally different ambience than the Mystic Avenue and those we will study further.

145
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:08,739
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment we have studied more the Mystic Avenue portion.

146
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:18,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will see how these transitions are made and if this could be more, not totally pedestrian, but more of a shared space.

147
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:24,163
[SPEAKER_01]: and more intimate kind of feeling.

148
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:34,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we go into the violet, so we see very different environments from the east to the west.

149
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:45,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mixed use, the second, that will be a bit of the continuation of the bluish, we will have it on the west of Mystic Avenue.

150
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more fragmented, it's a smaller scale of steel,

151
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And the uses are very similar.

152
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:59,337
[SPEAKER_01]: We have commercial, mixed-use building, and multi-family or multi-unit building.

153
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:10,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see the stories, we will see it better, the heights in the next slides with the sections.

154
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:17,081
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly we're thinking six stories for the blue, six stories for the Mystic Avenue.

155
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:24,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other side of Mystic Avenue, because we do have all the infrastructure, we can really go higher.

156
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have very deep lots.

157
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,827
[SPEAKER_01]: the scale here changes.

158
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:38,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not talking anymore about a smaller scale, but we're going to emit a bigger commercial scale.

159
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:57,487
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking on having a plinth with four stories and then a higher area, not a tower, because it doesn't go into a tower, but a higher element that goes into eight stories, so in total around 12.

160
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,639
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see if that is something feasible.

161
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just laying the base so we can discuss on top.

162
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:16,589
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have in all these, the blue and all the violets, we have a very active brown floor.

163
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:17,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are asking from 75

164
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:29,626
[SPEAKER_01]: to 100% of the ground floor in Mystic Avenue that is a very active ground floor.

165
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:35,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we go into the lower area, the pink one,

166
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:41,216
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking on having less active ground floor, so it can be from 25 to 50.

167
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:43,176
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we need to study still.

168
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,997
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking about bigger scale.

169
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:52,058
[SPEAKER_01]: We think about around eight stories high.

170
00:19:53,998 --> 00:20:04,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the uses to be, here we can have some auto-oriented, we can have the gas station, we can have life science, and we can have some light industry.

171
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:14,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start with the sections so that we can see them a bit better.

172
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we have at the moment.

173
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:25,426
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of commercial that is or one to two stories high, very kind of

174
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:34,020
[SPEAKER_01]: pod, a lot of auto-oriented areas, very difficult to walk.

175
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,241
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see the walkway, this is the orange strip.

176
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We have even the electric poles in it.

177
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:42,924
[SPEAKER_01]: There is almost no space.

178
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:44,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we need to do

179
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:52,271
[SPEAKER_01]: the lines that you see in red dash, those are the boundaries, the lot boundaries.

180
00:20:52,932 --> 00:21:06,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, what we need to do, if I start saying that I'm not going to have any setback, any front setback, and I start to put all the stories on top, it's going to feel very cramped.

181
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:09,987
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that I need is to have a space to walk.

182
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we will never have

183
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:15,450
[SPEAKER_01]: an active area in this place, in the street.

184
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we do is to give a curb setback.

185
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:28,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that from the line of the curb, we establish a minimum of setback, in this case is 18 feet.

186
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:28,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go

187
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So we established, let's say, a new building line.

188
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:42,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you see in this black arrows, what that means.

189
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:50,849
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it in both sides so that we can really have a better space for walking.

190
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,370
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we have 10 foot for walking.

191
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:06,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other eight are for green strip where we can have also the pole, electric poles, lighting, where we can have some seating, so a bit of a multifunctional strip area.

192
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:11,386
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helps if we have a continuous green with the

193
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,473
[SPEAKER_01]: stormwater collection.

194
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:25,900
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see here is buildings on the front and then we can have some parking, obviously we need parking, but that will be always on the back.

195
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:36,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be closed, it can be open, that is not so important, but what we really want is that all the active ground floor is in the front.

196
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:44,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So about the heights in here, we are in the blue area, by the way.

197
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's only about the bluish area.

198
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:47,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are here.

199
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have six stories high.

200
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,943
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some setbacks, some stepbacks, and we could have it from the fourth floor or from the fifth.

201
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:04,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It can even be a bit playful, so it's not always the same.

202
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:08,366
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bit of a skyline, a bit of movement, so that we don't have

203
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:10,167
[SPEAKER_01]: a canyon kind of feeling.

204
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:27,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have some step backs that can go from the fourth floor in the west of the Mystic Avenue and only one step back from the east so that we have a difference from one side to the other and we break a bit the symmetry.

205
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:43,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And the uses that we will have in this area is mixed use, is commercial, is multi-unit, multi-dwelling.

206
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:51,249
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it's multi-dwelling and it's only residential use, then the amenity is to be in the ground floor to make it a bit more active.

207
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:57,013
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go to the next one, this is the center part.

208
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We have here is the east side and this is the west side.

209
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lower part will go on the west.

210
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:19,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to also explore a bit the more fragmented areas that are really in the middle where they have adjacent lots which are residential two and a half or three and so that has to be really

211
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:26,055
[SPEAKER_01]: that it has to transition well, of course.

212
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the east

213
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:39,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bit of a plinth so that we break and we don't have so high buildings flush into the street.

214
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We can even have a bigger curb setback.

215
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:47,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having the same curb setback in all the street, all the 18.

216
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:53,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can have a bigger in this area because they are taller.

217
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:09,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we want is a plinth of at least four and then to have a roof deck and these roof decks should be or public or if it's for residential where they can to be semi-public.

218
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:13,337
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the amenities and they can hang out in here.

219
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:20,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big step back, so at least is 25-30 step back.

220
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:35,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to have as well in the back, this is more of infrastructural green, so it can help us with the stormwater, but it can also help if we have a bigger kind of more lush green, more intensive.

221
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:46,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also help to clean the view from the highway that is passing next to it.

222
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:58,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the higher one, this is the bigger and the denser areas, commercial mixed-use, residential, multifamily as well.

223
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:09,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we go into the last part, these are the lower where we still have some auto-oriented uses.

224
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:16,283
[SPEAKER_01]: We will try to have the auto-oriented uses on the back of the lots, so more where the

225
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,784
[SPEAKER_01]: where the 93 is running.

226
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:35,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have more inside the lot, the auto-oriented and more the buildings that are or big commercial or office or life science that are on the front.

227
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:40,985
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, the street profile changes.

228
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,408
[SPEAKER_01]: This belongs to mass DOT.

229
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:46,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the profile is a bit different.

230
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't need the curb setback because it's already wide enough.

231
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:57,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we give is from the boundary lot, we give some setbacks.

232
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be a range from 10 to 20.

233
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:13,742
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is not active, this is not commercial, that I need to be next to it so that it will be interesting to have some more green in front and the building

234
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:33,806
[SPEAKER_01]: not so far away, so no parking at all, but not so far away that we are losing the contact and we lose the facades, but not so close that interrupts a bit the walkability.

235
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:39,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So, until here, I have all the

236
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:50,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystic Avenue, and after will come Salem, but I think it's better if we can maybe, I can hear your suggestions, or what do you think about it?

237
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:58,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Paola, I really appreciate that thorough overview of what you've been preparing.

238
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:06,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that you've incorporated some of the comments that were most recently raised at our mapping workshop just a few weeks ago.

239
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple comments myself, but I'll go to President Beers first.

240
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair Collins.

241
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:15,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is great.

242
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the north end of the corridor.

243
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:40,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's restoring the traditional pre-highway kind of arrangement of a walkable neighborhood that used to be a mostly residential commercial extension of Medford Square on the other side of the river, when it's kind of, you know, in the auto age was taken up by repair shops and various things that, you know,

244
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:43,503
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't necessarily what we want to prioritize.

245
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:45,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really interested to see that.

246
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:50,728
[SPEAKER_04]: My only really question, I guess I have two questions.

247
00:28:50,968 --> 00:29:03,517
[SPEAKER_04]: One with the curb setbacks is the idea that the private owners would be accepting of the curb setbacks because they would be able to build higher.

248
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that essentially the idea there?

249
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think it is,

250
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:14,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounded like you're talking about maybe 10 feet of going back 10 feet into the private lots and that sounds you know, I mean, I can just think.

251
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,057
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a private owner would say, I don't want to do that.

252
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:23,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do, I guess I just wonder what like the application of that looks like.

253
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:34,745
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have some lots that want to move to redevelop and they do the curb setback and then you have another lot with a non-conforming structure that's right up on the lot line, like how is that going to work?

254
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my first question.

255
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have a second comment.

256
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:41,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

257
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:53,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So answering your first question, yes, basically, the space that we have right now, if we want to make this really commercial area, there is not a space at all.

258
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:58,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are two options, because we cannot invent a space, right?

259
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:03,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So or we take lanes out, or we have to make a setback.

260
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:16,980
[SPEAKER_01]: and yes, to have the new setback into the lots.

261
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is the boundary lot and we are taking around 10 feet of their property.

262
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, instead of building one or two, you can build six.

263
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:37,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the revenue that they get, it's quite good.

264
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:43,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in zoning, we have all the time setbacks from setback that they also cannot build.

265
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:57,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to make it more walkable, to be able to make it more active, to bring a lot more people in, to make it more economically feasible.

266
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:03,442
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to go in so we can really go higher.

267
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:10,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot make it with a... There is some shadow in here, 45 degrees.

268
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:17,113
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's supposed to represent, the shadow that these buildings are going to project.

269
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:22,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we go into the line, we can barely go really high.

270
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And I totally get the use case of it.

271
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:26,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

272
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:41,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm saying in practice, have we seen where this has been implemented in other places that when development happens, the property owners seem to say this makes a lot of sense and we want to go back from the curb that much.

273
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:49,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, do we see where, you know, different lots get developed at different times that there's kind of a,

274
00:31:50,123 --> 00:32:05,401
[SPEAKER_04]: disjointedness at least for some amount of time until the buildings reflect the updated zoning where you have some of the corridor doesn't have that curb setback.

275
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering in your studies what you've seen with that.

276
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:12,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, we also don't have any continuity in Mystic Avenue.

277
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:17,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really each one of them build whatever they like.

278
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:21,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of parking placed in the front.

279
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly what you will find.

280
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:26,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the buildings right in the line.

281
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:29,784
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very little, very few that will have this.

282
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,384
[SPEAKER_01]: This is taking time.

283
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:36,207
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a vision that will take many years to be implemented.

284
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:48,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really little by little and trying to all the new developments that occur are going to be following the new curve line.

285
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:54,233
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens in, I've seen it in many areas, many cities.

286
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know specific to Massachusetts.

287
00:32:57,115 --> 00:33:07,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that study and bring it to you later on in the whenever we present the draft, we can give more thought to that.

288
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:13,507
[SPEAKER_01]: But mainly the options that we have to, we need

289
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:18,017
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is that we don't have a continuous facade line.

290
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:21,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every building is in a different position.

291
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:28,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Every building is totally or very setback, a lot of parking in the front.

292
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:32,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't have nothing that defines the space.

293
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to make, to start making that definition in here happening, we need to mark some kind of lines, some kind of, they're called sometimes red lines, where the buildings are going to take place.

294
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:59,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as I said, or we take lanes, or we have to, we need a curve setback.

295
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:01,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

296
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

297
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:05,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I don't think you need to go deep diving into it.

298
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just kind of wondering what you'd seen in practice and it sounds like.

299
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of set these standards, and over time, the development pattern happens along those lines.

300
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes sense to me.

301
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:25,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that southeast of Hancock Street, it's worth looking at, potentially.

302
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the street's just too wide.

303
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystic Ave, it shouldn't be as wide as it is.

304
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,461
[SPEAKER_04]: 95% of the time it's empty and it's just dangerous to cross.

305
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of one thing I was thinking is And I don't know where MassDOT would land on this either I think that's a really tough piece of the puzzle since they control the street southeast of Hancock, but You know, you could go in a little bit.

306
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:53,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there my other comment is that I do think the

307
00:34:55,745 --> 00:35:01,610
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial zone, the red zone on the northeast side, the east side of Mystic Ave.

308
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:06,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it makes sense to treat that.

309
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:11,458
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the red kind of south of Mystic Valley Parkway.

310
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:22,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in a lot of senses the Hicks Avenue element of this is kind of baked in and that's going to end up being commercial and have auto-dedicated uses, etc.

311
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:32,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the east side could be treated more like we're treating the east side north of the Harvard and Route 16 Mystic Valley Parkway intersection.

312
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:44,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, obviously, there was the life science proposal that was withdrawn by combined properties, and then the 40B that was withdrawn by combined properties.

313
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:48,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been having a lot of ideas and withdrawing a lot of ideas.

314
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:59,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder if we could at least, I wonder if there's a way to say you could do either or and that mix and match wouldn't necessarily

315
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: make that part of it not cohesive.

316
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think limiting all of those lots to the commercial only versus at least giving the opportunity for something like having the mixed use extend all the way down on the east side between Mystic Ave and the highway.

317
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:25,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a thought that I have, but I'm, you know, I'd be interested to hear what other people think about that and what the planning department thinks about that as well.

318
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:29,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so in this area, what we have

319
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:31,483
[SPEAKER_01]: just to answer that one.

320
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:47,793
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of highway nodes entrance and from the parkway coming in the north of the pink red area.

321
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also the connection to the 93 at the end.

322
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,098
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot of traffic.

323
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:57,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of these

324
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:03,479
[SPEAKER_01]: auto-oriented users would like to move.

325
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe in this kind of spacing, they will have the opportunity to move further south of Mystic Avenue.

326
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:22,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first idea that we had, because the connection to the highway and to other main streets

327
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,203
[SPEAKER_01]: are really there.

328
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:34,051
[SPEAKER_01]: This part of the street, it is super bright, but this is more, as you said, this is mass DOT.

329
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:39,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I see that there is a lot of influence of coming from the highway and going out.

330
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:42,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how much we can reduce the traffic here.

331
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:52,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are very different street profiles from this one, which is not very wide.

332
00:37:53,005 --> 00:38:00,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here to take spots from these areas, it is a bit difficult because it's already tight.

333
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,911
[SPEAKER_01]: This is already wider.

334
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:07,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at this last area, it really, really widens.

335
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:08,275
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like 100 feet.

336
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:16,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree that we could maybe look at something different.

337
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,403
[SPEAKER_01]: We will love to hear your feedback from that, of course.

338
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:26,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just saying that here it is very white, the street profile.

339
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a different character.

340
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,774
[SPEAKER_01]: The lots are very, very different.

341
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:33,055
[SPEAKER_01]: very big.

342
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:38,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they are not so fragmented that is connected to the neighborhood.

343
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually completely disconnected.

344
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:50,823
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some land and some topography and some green around it so that it doesn't even let the connection happening.

345
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:55,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, that was the reason why we thought if there is some people moving

346
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:01,089
[SPEAKER_01]: some auto-oriented moving from the other areas we can have here.

347
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It made the most sense to keep that kind of use in the southern part.

348
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:20,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We will try to push it more into the interior areas, but we can have some mixed use in these typologies, right, in the more

349
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:25,559
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to the street, that we could have some mixing.

350
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will study that.

351
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:29,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's helpful.

352
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, I guess mostly I'm thinking of the area bounded by the highway, and then northwest of Fulbright Street, northeast of Mystic, kind of, if I could, I mean, if maybe if you go to the map, it's that area.

353
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,421
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of right, yeah, exactly.

354
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:59,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe there's a way, given the purple that we have on the west side, to kind of try to make that a more cohesive link.

355
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:06,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely see most of what you're saying on the west side of the street, on the Hicks Avenue side, I completely agree.

356
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,745
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of is what it is at this point.

357
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can have a later on phase, but at the moment I would say,

358
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:27,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whenever we have so many traffic going on in the area, it gets more tough to make it walkable and more vibrant.

359
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:27,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

360
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:30,157
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

361
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

362
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:30,838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

363
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:36,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you President Barris and just to follow up on that point, I definitely would be interested to see.

364
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:47,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is, as I mentioned, I'm really excited by this map I think this is a really important step forward in our, you know, kind of months of talks gearing up to this so thank you so much for this I think this is an excellent draft.

365
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:53,256
[SPEAKER_08]: As we do consider to continue to iterate on this, you know, since I know, kind of a part of this.

366
00:40:54,437 --> 00:41:02,707
[SPEAKER_08]: project that looms large for all of these sections is the transition between mixed-use 1, mixed-use 2, mixed-use 3, etc.

367
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:08,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be curious to see if we can play around with a bit of a more transitional

368
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:16,332
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, perhaps mixed use three or two in that section that President Bears was just bringing up.

369
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:25,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of the reason for saying that is just to not want it to feel like a acute difference from one edge of that, you know, highway off-ramp to the other.

370
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:33,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate the focus on walkability on Mystic Ave.

371
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that transit is another big piece of that.

372
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:43,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I know from experience, you know, I think all of us do it is difficult to be a pedestrian.

373
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It is difficult to be a pedestrian on Mystic Ave, it's especially difficult to cross, but there are a lot of people who do utilize it because they need to take the bus up and down and they live in the dense housing area.

374
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,321
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just south of there.

375
00:41:55,821 --> 00:42:05,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of thinking about that and thinking about the pedestrians that will be on the street, kind of if there's a way to implement some of that flexibility and mixed use into the commercial zone.

376
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:11,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would look better, and I think I could see some developers taking us up on that.

377
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:24,047
[SPEAKER_08]: One last question for me while we're on the topic of the setbacks, just to make sure I'm very clear on what we're talking about in mixed use 1, 2, and 3 with the setbacks.

378
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:26,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it that those are

379
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:38,047
[SPEAKER_08]: a condition or an incentive for increased height, or are the setbacks that you've prescribed a matter of course, and then the bonus heights come from meeting other criteria?

380
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:45,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are these setbacks just baked in no matter how high the building is, or does it come in at certain levels of flooring?

381
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.

382
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:49,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that

383
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,065
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, the curb setback, it is what it is.

384
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to be just a bonus.

385
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:06,983
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be just a baseline.

386
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:10,504
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot have bonus because of this curb setback.

387
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:20,828
[SPEAKER_01]: We do could have more bonus and that's something that I would love to talk about in the next meeting because

388
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:38,505
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to go higher, to be honest, I don't see why you couldn't in the, for example, in this area, or maybe if we transition with some more mixed use as well in the in the southern of the north part of the red pink one.

389
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:50,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if we go higher, or if they want to go higher, there are lots that are 400 feet deep, especially in these parts.

390
00:43:52,355 --> 00:44:00,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you could even have a higher one facing more the highway, and then having lower in here.

391
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:04,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that could come with the bonus.

392
00:44:05,157 --> 00:44:21,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over there, we could have some, and that is where the amenities, the public space, terrace, and other things that we will outline for the next meeting could come into place.

393
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:24,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that this is the maximum height that they can go.

394
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,031
[SPEAKER_01]: as of right, let's say.

395
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:38,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they want to go higher, then we could have to, we would have to look into those bonus and there should be a bigger setback so they can have a plaza in front.

396
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:43,382
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things that they could do.

397
00:44:43,502 --> 00:44:50,644
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the incentive zone would be great, for example, in this area, something like this corridor.

398
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:52,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in Salem, we will see it.

399
00:44:53,845 --> 00:44:58,746
[SPEAKER_01]: But this curb setback, to me, is the minimum that it should be there.

400
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:05,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we go higher, then we could have bigger setbacks.

401
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:07,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

402
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:08,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that makes sense, too.

403
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:09,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to be clear on that.

404
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:13,767
[SPEAKER_08]: what the mechanism was for that, but I think that makes a lot of sense.

405
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:30,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is, you know, from one perspective, it is exciting to think about, you know, if this were to be implemented, how the experience of walking or biking or even driving down Mystic Ave might be different in 20 years with more actual space to enjoy.

406
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:32,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

407
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:34,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I see a hand up.

408
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our custom to take public participation at the end of committee meetings, but I know that we're going to be shifting gears pretty soon to the Salem Street Corridor.

409
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a comment?

410
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to.

411
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:55,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any further comments from councilors, from city staff, before we move on to the next item in Ines's presentation?

412
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:57,464
[SPEAKER_08]: President Beers.

413
00:45:58,753 --> 00:46:15,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one question, and it might be for PDS and for NS Associates, but given this, when do we expect that we could see the maps and the written ordinance language for adoption for, I guess, for both of these?

414
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:16,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could ask that at the end.

415
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:23,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will start preparing the journal.

416
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:28,766
[SPEAKER_01]: because we do have some other things.

417
00:46:31,229 --> 00:46:31,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not sure.

418
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:39,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot give you that answer at the moment, but I will give you that answer maybe in the next meeting.

419
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:46,905
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that it's not only about the users and the table of users and the store and the heights.

420
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:55,388
[SPEAKER_01]: We also should do development standards, design guidelines, so that when it comes to the draft, it's really all tied in.

421
00:46:56,648 --> 00:47:04,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone wants to start developing, that will follow all these rules.

422
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is still some work to do.

423
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:22,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if it's if Alicia Hunt has anything to add to it, if they need it as soon as possible.

424
00:47:23,395 --> 00:47:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Pamela.

425
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:24,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Director.

426
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:26,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

427
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:34,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually going to mention that I thought that the way this is set, some of this language would be different from this type of zoning that we have.

428
00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:40,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We are aware, Planner Evans used to work in Watertown where they had zoning

429
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:53,384
[SPEAKER_06]: that had this idea of this is the line where buildings will come to, and that it allowed, you couldn't build further back or further forward, which is different from a setback, right?

430
00:47:53,424 --> 00:47:56,826
[SPEAKER_06]: A setback is this is, you can't build any closer to the,

431
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:59,274
[SPEAKER_06]: the boundary line than this.

432
00:48:00,734 --> 00:48:12,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would also come with standards talking about green space and public sidewalk that would be the front of, and where could parking could be and couldn't be, where would loading zones be able to be?

433
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a large commercial building is going to need access for parking.

434
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to need loading stuff.

435
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:22,985
[SPEAKER_06]: like that, so there'll need to be design standards that go with it.

436
00:48:24,146 --> 00:48:37,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think that it would be helpful if we could see draft language and sort of framework language for that sooner rather than later, because I think we'll need to get in the weeds on that as well.

437
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:45,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm saying is that this is not just height X, setback Y. This is more complicated than that.

438
00:48:46,821 --> 00:48:48,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I could relate it in this associates,

439
00:48:49,763 --> 00:49:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: that if they have starts at suggested language or even a bulleted list of the type of things they would want to see in that, I think that would be helpful for all of us to be looking at and understanding as they develop the details of it.

440
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:08,784
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have some of this kind of language in the new MBTA zoning.

441
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:20,192
[SPEAKER_06]: and we should take a look at that language, because some of that, what I was just talking about, where can your loading zone and your driveway access be, is actually in that MBTA zoning.

442
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:26,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we will want to look at drafts, which is different from saying, when will we have language we can vote on?

443
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:32,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to need to see at least one or two iterations before it's votable language.

444
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:34,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

445
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,943
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think that stands to reason, and I would agree.

446
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:53,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to get the ball rolling on that sooner, you know, inclusive of if it's, it sounds like even rough drafts would be very useful to see in the rough stage that we can get a start on all of the accessories that have to be considered at the same time.

447
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:58,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would endorse that request from the planning department.

448
00:50:00,877 --> 00:50:02,097
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bairst, do you have a follow up?

449
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:03,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

450
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:04,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

451
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:14,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Paula, is there more on this section of the presentation or should we proceed to the Salem Street Corridor?

452
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:16,199
[SPEAKER_01]: We can proceed.

453
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

454
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:17,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

455
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:24,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I'm going to interrupt you and myself really quickly in the event that this is a public comment on Mystic Gap Corridor specifically.

456
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I will recognize you Gaston.

457
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

458
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:29,595
[SPEAKER_08]: You have 3 minutes.

459
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:40,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, I really appreciate the opportunity.

460
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:45,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any drawings related to biking infrastructure in these sketches.

461
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:58,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering whether there has been any thought given to biking infrastructure at this stage, and if not, whether there will be considered in the future.

462
00:50:58,276 --> 00:50:58,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

463
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:07,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment there is a bike lane shared with a bus lane.

464
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:17,823
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't looked into the layout of the street, so not at the moment.

465
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:24,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that also for the zoning it's not in our scope.

466
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:39,174
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not correct please director Alicia you can correct me but this is more of the transit and at the moment what we have we actually ask to the

467
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:48,824
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer department, the plans for Mystic Avenue, and we haven't got them yet.

468
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:52,448
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Salem Street, but not this one.

469
00:51:55,174 --> 00:52:00,338
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I know that there is also some kind of design.

470
00:52:00,638 --> 00:52:04,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's going to be new, if it's going to be adopted soon or not.

471
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:10,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it, so I don't know if the layout that is there now is going to change or not.

472
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:16,030
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, what we have is a shared lane with the bus.

473
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:23,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had any comment on anything about the biking lanes.

474
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:26,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for that.

475
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,251
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can answer.

476
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:33,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Paola, and I think it's, um, I definitely appreciate the question.

477
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:48,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping that, um, I'm not sure if the appropriate mechanism would be in some design standards phase or potentially as we're getting into other criteria for height, et cetera, bonuses, if we can look to some of the

478
00:52:50,990 --> 00:53:10,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm trying to think of what the right terms for this is ways we can write into our zoning and perhaps this is a site plan review issue ways to kind of incentivize large developments including bike infrastructure or at least kind of like a bike accessory infrastructure on those developments as condition for greater height or just as a

479
00:53:11,596 --> 00:53:14,037
[SPEAKER_08]: from a piece of what we try to incentivize in our development.

480
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:37,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the complicating factor is that Mystic Gap itself is, as we discussed largely, DOT operated, so there's not a lot that we can do in terms of the actual streetscape, but whatever we can do to incentivize making those privately held lots more hospitable for cyclists, I would like for us to look at.

481
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:42,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, absolutely that for sure.

482
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:53,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the parts of the amenities for the bonus for the incentive zoning, some kind of parking for bikes.

483
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:59,399
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the zoning, I cannot intervene in the layout of the street.

484
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,000
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was trying to say.

485
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:05,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, pal.

486
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:06,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

487
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,537
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, let's move along to Salem Street Corridor.

488
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:19,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Salem, we have done the proposed boundaries.

489
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:23,315
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't as defined as in Mystic Avenue.

490
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:26,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are really new proposals.

491
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:37,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, and this is, it depends a bit on the land use that it had, that is currently in those lots.

492
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:38,629
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some

493
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,822
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed boundary, and this is the immediate boundary of the Salem Street.

494
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it takes two lots, sometimes it takes three in depth.

495
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what it was there, the sizes of the lots, and how its impact with the surroundings.

496
00:54:58,948 --> 00:55:06,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have what we call the transitional boundary, and this is to make a better connection between the existent and the

497
00:55:08,312 --> 00:55:11,216
[SPEAKER_01]: the boundary of Salem Street.

498
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:18,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, we did some connections and opportunities.

499
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly, we wanted to

500
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:32,651
[SPEAKER_01]: make very clear the bigger connections with the main active areas of the neighborhood.

501
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:41,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have these two parks that we want to connect to Salem.

502
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:49,096
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this corridor, the Spring Street, that connects Salem with Washington.

503
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:50,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also quite

504
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:56,350
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the widest in this area.

505
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,374
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the parks, connections for people.

506
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:07,824
[SPEAKER_01]: These mainly are not driving connections, these are pedestrians and it can be even bike connection, but not for driving.

507
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:20,791
[SPEAKER_01]: caring so much for driving, but as how can we attract people from the area to walk into Salem Street, to bring them into this place.

508
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:26,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this has nothing to do with the reality of what would come here.

509
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:28,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just pointing as before,

510
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:34,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Some areas could be very interesting as points of attention.

511
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:44,666
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because we have the connection with the parks, but also because of the lots and the things that are happening in the surrounding areas.

512
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: In this corner, we have the school, the park connection, Washington and Felsway West.

513
00:56:52,526 --> 00:57:03,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this corner, we have the Spring Street, the Morrison Park, and the connection towards the big lot area.

514
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:21,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take it as some kind of placemaking on these spots so that we can create commercial nodes, so we can create some public space, so we can create some community making.

515
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:31,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you see now the connection, the school, and these are the commercial nodes, let's say.

516
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:38,029
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the most intensive areas that we are going to have along Salem Street.

517
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we have where the Target is now and all around it.

518
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:47,958
[SPEAKER_01]: We have where Park Street connects with Salem and the school.

519
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:56,049
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that these are the ones that could really attract more people and so we give it as more public and more intensive.

520
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a mixed Salem.

521
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:09,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like Mystic Avenue because of the scale and because of many things, but also because of the really different mix that we have.

522
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:16,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we have commercial that is unified and is continuous, like in this corner.

523
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:21,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have some commercial and then residential and then commercial again.

524
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:24,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have lots that are entirely residential.

525
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did want to maintain that mix because we think that it gives the identity to the street.

526
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:36,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lots that were entirely residential, we keep as they are.

527
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:43,424
[SPEAKER_01]: They are multi-dwelling, but we keep it as only residential.

528
00:58:44,444 --> 00:58:46,605
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see the bluish, those are all the

529
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,952
[SPEAKER_01]: all the yellow.

530
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:54,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we see the bluish, it's more mixed.

531
00:58:54,655 --> 00:59:01,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have mixed buildings, we have residential, we have commercial, we have a mix of all of them.

532
00:59:02,098 --> 00:59:06,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the red, we have the big intensity.

533
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:11,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have more commercial, we have mixed use.

534
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:15,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, in here, we're going to have the highest

535
00:59:17,526 --> 00:59:23,671
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings, then we go a bit down, we go a bit down and we go back again to the highest.

536
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:33,418
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a nice connection because on the west we have the roundabout and then we have the connection towards Medford Square, so there we can also densify.

537
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:43,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be kind of nodes of densification and then a bit lower going to residential and coming back again.

538
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:51,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have now is very similar to before.

539
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a very wide area.

540
00:59:55,772 --> 00:59:58,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's divided sometimes with trees.

541
00:59:59,074 --> 01:00:00,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Trees barely have space.

542
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:05,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the area is very narrow.

543
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So we come back with the same story again.

544
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:09,118
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a space.

545
01:00:09,598 --> 01:00:14,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we mark this kind of curve setback to have a new building line.

546
01:00:17,112 --> 01:00:24,954
[SPEAKER_01]: This area is when we have the mix of, in one area, the mixed use, and in the other one, we have residential.

547
01:00:25,714 --> 01:00:38,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when we have residential, we want them to have also a frontage, a front garden, and a bit of a setback to give more intimacy.

548
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:42,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens when all the use of the building is residential.

549
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:56,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as you can see on the left, these are multi-dwelling units, and so we allowed, when we are in Salem Street and facing Salem Street, they can be four stories high.

550
01:00:57,372 --> 01:01:03,039
[SPEAKER_01]: When start to face in the secondary streets, then they go to three stories high.

551
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we have the mixed use, the blue one, we go to six.

552
01:01:12,058 --> 01:01:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we have to, in the fourth, we need this step back so it doesn't feel too high on the street.

553
01:01:23,103 --> 01:01:28,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Parking, again, it's going to be on the back, and those things, as Alicia said, needs to be studied.

554
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:44,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever they can access the parking from a secondary street, we will encourage that to happen, but if it's not possible, then we will encourage to only have one curb cut, and so that we don't have continuous entrance to parkings.

555
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:51,461
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the incentive bonus can be to share the parking, several lots,

556
01:01:52,297 --> 01:01:57,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have many entrances, but we only have one or two in one block.

557
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:01,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things that we will look into later.

558
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:09,382
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is important now is that we want the front of the buildings towards the street and the parking on the back.

559
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:14,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have

560
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:21,485
[SPEAKER_01]: mix use, mix use, one in front, when they front each other.

561
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:29,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the commercial, well, it's mixed use too, it's just more intensive.

562
01:02:30,108 --> 01:02:34,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in here, what we have is a bigger setback than before.

563
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:35,009
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, we have 15.

564
01:02:35,149 --> 01:02:37,090
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, we go back to the 18.

565
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have

566
01:02:40,251 --> 01:03:02,021
[SPEAKER_01]: six stories, and I left these two in order to have that incentive bonus that you could have plus two, but with a setback, and you need to give something back to the community, in this case, mainly Salem Street, or something very near in the area that affects immediately to the area.

567
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:14,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we talk about, this is something that we created for Pittsfield, there was a mixed use streets.

568
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:21,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also, whenever there was commercial or mixed use, so an active ground floor,

569
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:38,211
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted to be a bit more setbacked than the line that they were given, they could have a setback, but they had to make that frontage public.

570
01:03:40,872 --> 01:04:03,221
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this different from 13 to 20 feet back, but they had to give it as a terrace or as a picnic, as bike parking, as climate resilience or rain gardens, public seating on the shade, public seating like terrace kind.

571
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:27,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that we created for Pittsfield and so we wanted that if the commercial or the active ground force, so in this case it's for mixed use and for the commercial one and the intensive one, whenever they want, if they wanted to set back, that that frontage had to be an active frontage.

572
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:42,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously no parking in the front and it had to be some element or climate resilience or to create some more active street ground floor.

573
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also did the same for the setback.

574
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:56,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a setback from 10 to 30, we wanted to also have a more active rooftop.

575
01:04:57,781 --> 01:05:04,046
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm showing it as things that we could also add to the Salem Street as well.

576
01:05:05,788 --> 01:05:10,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that could form, be part of the zoning incentives.

577
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:17,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to do more heights, then you have to give this elements kind of idea.

578
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is it for Salem Street.

579
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:41,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

580
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:42,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there more you're going to add just there?

581
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall I open up to comment from councilors?

582
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:51,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to go.

583
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:52,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for that overview.

584
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:57,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting to consider these two corridors in parallel.

585
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go first to President Bears.

586
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:02,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

587
01:06:03,684 --> 01:06:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: My only thought, I really think that the

588
01:06:09,906 --> 01:06:20,400
[SPEAKER_04]: big lots on the northeast side of the corridor don't have to be that big scale commercial.

589
01:06:21,702 --> 01:06:27,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I could really see reintegrating and reconnecting that neighborhood and making it more walkable.

590
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:39,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you could have a lot of the uses, you know, you could have a Target and a gym and a liquor store under an apartment building.

591
01:06:39,107 --> 01:06:46,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And just have a more, you know, right now it's just a giant parking lot, so I could really see that being

592
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:54,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can maintain the parking with podium parking if you really wanted to as well, or maintain some portion of it.

593
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the time, most of it is empty.

594
01:06:58,186 --> 01:06:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just my one thought here.

595
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I really think this is a thoughtful approach.

596
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:18,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the kind of step backs into the neighborhoods make sense with small multi-dwelling, you know, it's a three-story height with the increased height really just fronting Salem Street.

597
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:21,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that that's just my one thought.

598
01:07:23,112 --> 01:07:28,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we try to encourage something kind of wholesale, really changing the dynamic of

599
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:37,496
[SPEAKER_04]: that section of the area, because right now it's basically just an asphalt desert most of the time.

600
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:39,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sorry.

601
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:43,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that up, because I totally forgot to mention.

602
01:07:45,143 --> 01:07:53,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so we would love that the MBTA garage will move out of here for obvious reasons.

603
01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:59,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this area, we wanted more bigger scale.

604
01:07:59,486 --> 01:08:02,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want the target and we want this, but

605
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to have the buildings into the front, parking on the interior, and to make it a lot more livable and connected.

606
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:17,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally spaced out this area.

607
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:25,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make more in-depth what this could look like, and we could

608
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:28,979
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see it later on the on the drafts.

609
01:08:30,701 --> 01:08:31,802
[SPEAKER_01]: But totally agree with you.

610
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:33,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

611
01:08:34,565 --> 01:08:34,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

612
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

613
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this is less a zoning thing and more of a just getting all parties on the same page thing.

614
01:08:40,152 --> 01:08:45,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder if I know that he wants to move out of there if we could.

615
01:08:46,616 --> 01:08:56,024
[SPEAKER_04]: There could really be, I think, benefits of being a transit hub in that area too, especially with the high-speed or high-frequency bus route from Malden Centre.

616
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a thought.

617
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:06,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, also the other side to the neighbourhood is really, really sad at the moment.

618
01:09:08,154 --> 01:09:14,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So to activate also all these corners will be great for this part of the neighbourhood.

619
01:09:20,538 --> 01:09:21,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Pamela.

620
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:30,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think, I think in general and I, this is comes from personal preference and also I think from what we're heard from the community and various forums over the years.

621
01:09:32,866 --> 01:09:38,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that broadly our instinct to try and consolidate commercial especially light industrial

622
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,871
[SPEAKER_08]: uses is super intuitive, makes a lot of sense.

623
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:47,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think that where I see the most enthusiasm is for that mixed use.

624
01:09:48,693 --> 01:09:59,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And so even in, you know, kind of what we're considering our commercial nodes, you know, like we mentioned along the stick, the stick out for order, I'd be really excited to see, you know, that flexibility for mixed use.

625
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:01,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So that

626
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:08,204
[SPEAKER_08]: existing commercial uses can continue to have on there, continue to cluster with other uses, that makes sense.

627
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:18,431
[SPEAKER_08]: But that we are kind of leaving a, having our zoning leave a very warm welcome open, a very open door towards that mixed use.

628
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:21,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And for these nodes being

629
01:10:25,728 --> 01:10:30,295
[SPEAKER_08]: functional commercial hubs without being so obviously commercial that other uses can't picture themselves there.

630
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's my hope that some of those kind of

631
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:42,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Unappealingly resolutely industrial areas I'm in care thinking about the bus depot which I think nobody is really happy about.

632
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something that we don't have control over right now.

633
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:59,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hopeful that through zoning the adjacent areas we can hopefully entice the partners that we don't have jurisdiction over to kind of conform with how the neighborhood is changing around that depot and other

634
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:08,196
[SPEAKER_08]: another outdated uses like it that we'd like to see go somewhere else or be converted into something more useful and more modern.

635
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:15,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for putting this presentation together.

636
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:21,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a very hopeful step forward for our city.

637
01:11:22,933 --> 01:11:31,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with Councilor Bears and Councilor Collins that, you know, mixed use development is what I hear from residents.

638
01:11:32,336 --> 01:11:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: that they want to see in our city.

639
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:42,686
[SPEAKER_03]: That lot in particular that we've been talking about on the corner of Bellsway West and Salem, I think that has a lot of potential for mixed use.

640
01:11:43,106 --> 01:11:49,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the vision that Councilor Baird has laid out is something that is very enticing to me, at least individually, and I know

641
01:11:50,493 --> 01:12:06,881
[SPEAKER_03]: the voters, the residents I've talked to would be interested in something like that, particularly since if we can bring in more residential units on main streets, I think a lot of residents will be much more swaged about densification, which we really need, and the need to build more housing.

642
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:25,352
[SPEAKER_03]: but balancing that with their concerns of traffic, I think, with the high-frequency bus route right there, stopping right at that corner, and with the links to Route 28, I-93 right there, I think that is quite a prime location to bring in housing.

643
01:12:26,261 --> 01:12:50,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think my other note is just that, um, when it comes setbacks and setbacks, um, I just, you know, I think the flip side of the equation, I, I think I would concur with what's being what's been said by the flip side of the equation is just that might, um, reduce the space that we have for housing units, um, which we desperately need more of.

644
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:52,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a balance there, and I think

645
01:12:52,854 --> 01:13:04,410
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when we're planning it out, we just want to be, I would suggest that we be very careful with, you know, asking ourselves to be more intentional with putting in setbacks and setbacks.

646
01:13:05,211 --> 01:13:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Pittsfield's plans look very interesting to me.

647
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:15,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we should make sure that we're not just putting it in there just because it's common practice.

648
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:22,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we want to make sure that we have to ask ourselves, does this actually make our neighborhood more walkable?

649
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:27,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does it actually increase the feeling of vastness?

650
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:31,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's something for us to consider going forward.

651
01:13:31,302 --> 01:13:34,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do, in general, find these plans very interesting.

652
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:37,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that, Councilor Tseng.

653
01:13:37,964 --> 01:13:38,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Director Hunt?

654
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

655
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a couple of things we want to add.

656
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:47,141
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time that we're seeing most of this for Salem Street.

657
01:13:48,621 --> 01:13:55,322
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I'll just note as sort of food for thought is that there really isn't room on Salem Street for things like bike lanes and all.

658
01:13:55,743 --> 01:14:09,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So if one was to think about capturing more horizontal space for the public through requirements or incentives, you'd have to do it through requirements, because you either have to do it the whole way or not.

659
01:14:10,543 --> 01:14:14,609
[SPEAKER_06]: could you actually get a cycle track on one side, because there are setbacks.

660
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:22,559
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, I think I would ask Innis Associates if they could actually take a closer look at these.

661
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,263
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern here is that these parcels are too small.

662
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:30,488
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they're too small to have the setbacks and still have viable buildings.

663
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:36,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not certain about that, but they're much smaller than on Mystic Ave.

664
01:14:36,993 --> 01:14:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we need to look at that and say, is this wish zoning that could never happen because you're not going to have a buildable project, or is it brilliant?

665
01:14:49,404 --> 01:14:52,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not certain, but I think we need to look a little closer.

666
01:14:53,345 --> 01:15:00,507
[SPEAKER_06]: and in particular in the commercial node area, the light red, I think we should think about whether six stories is too tall.

667
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:10,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just looking on Google Maps with it 3D, and really the tallest that we have anywhere up and down really is three stories.

668
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:22,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And how that looks and works, and even at the end near Target where there are apartment buildings, they appear to be three, three and a half stories, except for one that's kind of further down.

669
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,033
[SPEAKER_06]: that's taller than that.

670
01:15:25,474 --> 01:15:28,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And they feel like a solid size.

671
01:15:29,056 --> 01:15:31,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we should be considering that.

672
01:15:31,898 --> 01:15:34,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not actually sure what the zoning allows here.

673
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an apartment district.

674
01:15:36,261 --> 01:15:39,584
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the big things, it's three stories.

675
01:15:39,624 --> 01:15:41,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So three stories is actually the maximum.

676
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:46,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering if we should be thinking about four at this location and not six.

677
01:15:49,465 --> 01:15:53,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not saying like, oh, I'm not coming in firm, saying like, this is definitely what we should do.

678
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I think we should think about this one a little bit more in some of those big picture details.

679
01:15:59,507 --> 01:16:03,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if Danielle had something to add to that, or if I just spoke for both of us.

680
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:09,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

681
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:17,971
[SPEAKER_05]: As Director Hunt was saying, a three stories is allowed by right in the AP one, the apartment one zone.

682
01:16:18,727 --> 01:16:21,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it goes up to six.

683
01:16:22,748 --> 01:16:22,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

684
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:26,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it could support more than three stories.

685
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:32,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I think for two ups on it slightly to allow for parking underneath.

686
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:36,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Um so you can still get those housing units above.

687
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:37,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

688
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to add a point to what comes of

689
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:56,786
[SPEAKER_05]: have zoning that would allow or incentivize wrapping those parking lots, putting some uses towards the front.

690
01:16:57,086 --> 01:17:00,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of these uses are long established.

691
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:02,108
[SPEAKER_05]: They might not be going anywhere.

692
01:17:02,188 --> 01:17:03,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll be building up a little bit.

693
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:19,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we had some buildings towards the front, done in a way that doesn't hide those uses in the back, so they don't get upset with their visibility.

694
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:27,225
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been something we've been working on with some of our existing plazas over in the Wellington area.

695
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking like Felsway and the Wegmans.

696
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:47,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Plazas where when the new buildings want to come in, they're coming closer towards the street to have more of a presence on the street and having the parking behind that's already existing.

697
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a way to kind of

698
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: move past this kind of suburban development pattern of plazas, strip malls set far back with the parking in front?

699
01:18:02,299 --> 01:18:04,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Danielle.

700
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think this is an important discussion to have.

701
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think in general, on the issue of how much height can a particular corridor or block support, typically the way I enter into that kind of question is like,

702
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:24,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all agree on the basic premise of, we need more housing units.

703
01:18:24,362 --> 01:18:27,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to do that in a way that's appropriate and sensitive and thoughtful.

704
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:36,693
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it comes to considering cases that are right now notably higher than average, the question is, what are we getting out of it?

705
01:18:37,194 --> 01:18:40,557
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the value to the community beyond just the units themselves?

706
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:45,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And that makes me curious to contemplate, what feels like a new,

707
01:18:47,301 --> 01:19:04,742
[SPEAKER_08]: what feels like an appropriate new normal that we can say we feel like this is a slam dunk, we're always comfortable with this, and then for those cases above that, whether that normal is four or five, if not six, maybe it's six, what do we want to get in return if we are going to contemplate letting a developer build above that?

708
01:19:05,663 --> 01:19:06,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that there's a lot that

709
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably a lot that we have in common that we find intriguing, whether it's parking underneath or some of those public space uses towards the front.

710
01:19:17,126 --> 01:19:17,686
[SPEAKER_08]: President Beers?

711
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:19,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

712
01:19:19,607 --> 01:19:27,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is important to note, A, there's kind of two things that are at play here for me.

713
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:36,153
[SPEAKER_04]: One, once you're over two and a half, there's significantly less visual benefit of the difference between four and six.

714
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:38,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we just need to factor that in.

715
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:39,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's anecdotal.

716
01:19:39,798 --> 01:19:42,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's like a gut feeling that people are gonna feel.

717
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:48,905
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you actually look at the statistical analyses of like how people experience the world, it's not that different.

718
01:19:49,525 --> 01:20:03,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the, and there's plenty of examples across this region of that, where you have fours and fives and sixes intermingled and it doesn't feel like when you're standing next to the six, it's so much bigger than when you're standing next to the four.

719
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the step backs are,

720
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:09,221
[SPEAKER_04]: less worrying than the setbacks.

721
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:10,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the setbacks are just really tough.

722
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all the setbacks and everything we've seen from all the studies that we've done are that the setbacks and the dimensional requirements in this community don't make sense with all the lot sizes in this community, and they really, really, really, really restrict

723
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:23,430
[SPEAKER_04]: what people can build.

724
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:27,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the step backs could make sense.

725
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:37,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we also have to factor in density bonuses here, where maybe it's 3 over 1, and then there's density bonuses for specific community benefits.

726
01:20:38,718 --> 01:20:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe those additional floors aren't full floors, but they're stepped back.

727
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:49,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those would be the ways I'd want to approach it, rather than just saying, this is a four-story corridor, and there's no opportunities here to do something else other than that.

728
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:57,072
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is again the building code at least from my understanding having had some conversations with.

729
01:20:58,968 --> 01:21:09,732
[SPEAKER_04]: both people on the municipal side of these conversations and the developer sides of these conversations is when you have to move from wood-based construction to steel-based construction, it significantly increases your costs.

730
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has to generally happen after three stories, although we had some conversations about you can do podium bases and then build with three stories of wood on top of it, although I'm not sure what the new building code says about that.

731
01:21:23,157 --> 01:21:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if Scott, I'm talking out of turn, no change.

732
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

733
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:39,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think that to the point made about the setbacks, making this zoning in theory rather than zoning in practice, I also think that the height limits.

734
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:50,575
[SPEAKER_04]: If we limit it at four and they say, well, we're never going to build four, we're just going to build three anyway because we're going to build wood, then there's no point in zoning for four and we're not going to get what we want.

735
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:54,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think those are the kinds of conversations that we should think about.

736
01:21:57,341 --> 01:21:58,202
[SPEAKER_04]: as we move through this.

737
01:21:58,262 --> 01:22:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think the setbacks from the street are just really tough with the lot sizes.

738
01:22:07,408 --> 01:22:08,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I clarify something?

739
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:14,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think that what we are recommending is not like, oh, here's your sidewalk.

740
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:18,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Now your building starts 15 feet back from that.

741
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:23,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we were talking about, particularly through the Mystic Ave, and I think the idea is to apply it here,

742
01:22:23,917 --> 01:22:39,898
[SPEAKER_06]: is that we would actually say your building is gonna start 15 feet back from the curb line, but you're gonna have a green strip, and then the sidewalk is actually gonna be on your private property, and then it's gonna be three feet to your building, right?

743
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:44,380
[SPEAKER_06]: the sidewalk would actually go quite close to the building.

744
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,403
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to find more space so that you could have an eight foot wide sidewalk instead of a three foot wide sidewalk.

745
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:58,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And that there are ways to put that into the zoning so that it's not like, oh, you get to do whatever you want, but how do we do that?

746
01:22:59,329 --> 01:23:10,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may end up that one has to look into the details of liability and easements so that if it's public sidewalk that you don't have, like who then maintains that, right?

747
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:12,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it still city sidewalk?

748
01:23:12,609 --> 01:23:14,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you then transfer it over?

749
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:26,654
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, it's how can we use this to capture more public space for the public and not like, oh, six or 10 feet of green pine bushes.

750
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:28,475
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need more of those.

751
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:34,897
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more space for us to walk and bicycle and park our bikes and maybe have some sidewalk dining.

752
01:23:35,481 --> 01:23:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I think we can do that with zoning code, but we have to do that carefully and intentionally, because just a setback says you can do whatever you want with that space.

753
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:52,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be in favor of that, of just push your building back, that's different.

754
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:57,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I just wonder, at Mystic Ave it makes a little more sense to me.

755
01:23:58,414 --> 01:24:00,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I just think you're gonna have

756
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:07,284
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, even if we're talking a 30 year time horizon, you're going to have properties that just don't want that.

757
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:10,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, Oh, we have this great public space.

758
01:24:10,905 --> 01:24:14,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's a three foot sidewalk and then a great public space on the three foot sidewalk.

759
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:20,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, especially with these lot sizes, the number of lots and the varying uses, like, I don't know.

760
01:24:20,808 --> 01:24:25,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't feel in my mind, I can't see the cohesion in the same way.

761
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And

762
01:24:29,096 --> 01:24:39,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clear to me that on Mystic Ave, like once Paula mentioned, oh, everything has 20 feet of parking in front of it anyway on Mystic Ave, it's like, okay, so it's already open, private, you know, we could better utilize that space.

763
01:24:39,858 --> 01:24:48,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Here there's stuff that's up to the, you know, there's a lot of structures that are built up to the lot line in front of a three or four foot sidewalk.

764
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:56,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And if those aren't gonna move, then you're not gonna, so that's just where my brain is on it around the,

765
01:24:58,908 --> 01:25:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my point is that even if we set the curve line in principle back because we want this cohesive vision, it might end up functioning like a setback anyway because you're not going to have the coherence all the way down the corridor.

766
01:25:14,345 --> 01:25:16,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fear.

767
01:25:18,476 --> 01:25:18,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

768
01:25:18,836 --> 01:25:31,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I actually that's part of why I want them to do a little bit deeper dive into this because I also think if you set it back an extra five or six feet, do you have enough depth to have a viable building there on Mystic Ave?

769
01:25:31,702 --> 01:25:33,483
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really quite.

770
01:25:33,903 --> 01:25:48,472
[SPEAKER_06]: The potential for whole blocks to turn over at once, even though those are smaller parcels, there are developers who are interested in assembling a block of parcels on Mystic Ave to do a larger project, and I can say that quite definitively.

771
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the interest of arguing with myself, I really do feel like this is something worthy of mulling over.

772
01:25:54,884 --> 01:26:04,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sort of poking around at taller buildings and 2800 Maple Park Ave, I believe is five stories over one of parking.

773
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:11,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right, I actually, I bike by that almost every day back and forth to work and it doesn't feel too tall at all.

774
01:26:12,414 --> 01:26:14,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go, I'm arguing with myself.

775
01:26:14,855 --> 01:26:16,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And the setbacks aren't that big either.

776
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:18,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but they do have, it's all bushes.

777
01:26:19,437 --> 01:26:23,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, that's not public realm space in front of that building.

778
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

779
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to, sorry, we're just going back and forth now.

780
01:26:28,323 --> 01:26:37,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I just worry that, I agree in my mind, I'd like Salem Street's too narrow, like there's not enough public space to do everything we wanna do in the public way.

781
01:26:38,249 --> 01:26:43,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think maybe people 100 years ago made that decision and we're stuck with it.

782
01:26:44,393 --> 01:26:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

783
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my concern there.

784
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:52,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think the step backs are great.

785
01:26:53,125 --> 01:27:00,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wonder if this strategy can work here with trying to essentially expand the public way in some way.

786
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:03,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I appreciate this discussion.

787
01:27:03,494 --> 01:27:15,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that more so than Mystic Ave, Salem Street Corridor is a scenario where we kind of have to

788
01:27:17,574 --> 01:27:26,464
[SPEAKER_08]: have a bit more of a confronting conversation around what we'd really like to see here, what is the zoning we could write that could bring that about, what is likely to happen.

789
01:27:29,753 --> 01:27:38,538
[SPEAKER_08]: and make our best studies and guesses at what developers are going to take us up on and what's likely to result from the zoning that we do propose and pass.

790
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:49,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm happy that we're having this conversation because I would like us to take a really serious look at what could setbacks do for us?

791
01:27:50,385 --> 01:27:54,127
[SPEAKER_08]: What is our best guess of what could arise in 5, 10, 20 years from that?

792
01:27:55,288 --> 01:27:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a meaningful community value that we can expect to get from that in the long term?

793
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:15,358
[SPEAKER_08]: If it seems like the geography of the corridor that we just can't change unless there's a mass eminent domain campaign, which obviously it's just a joke, I don't mean that, then what is the next best

794
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:21,961
[SPEAKER_08]: um, strategy for maximizing community value on this corridor.

795
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see more usable public space on this corridor.

796
01:28:26,444 --> 01:28:33,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone, um, I'm glad that we have Innis to help us take a, you know, a really sober look at what's our best chance of achieving that.

797
01:28:33,748 --> 01:28:42,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if it's really hard to do that through the geography, then, you know, we'll continue along our other goals for maximizing, um, residential usage of this corridor.

798
01:28:42,773 --> 01:28:44,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, um,

799
01:28:45,942 --> 01:28:59,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited about the step backs being a component of making the height feel friendly and welcoming and hospitable along this corridor, because we know this is such a dense area of the city already and, and yet it's not enough for all the people that want to live there.

800
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:02,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that could be a really great tool in our toolbox.

801
01:29:04,558 --> 01:29:06,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a quick time check.

802
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:06,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It is almost 8.40.

803
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:17,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Paola, I want to pass the mic back to you before we go to public participation and just ask what else you'd like for us to hear to round out the presentation before we close out the meeting.

804
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:22,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So just very quickly, I appreciate everything that has been said.

805
01:29:22,932 --> 01:29:26,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand the worries behind it.

806
01:29:28,115 --> 01:29:38,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to have a bit of the difference also in height to be seen from the lower to a bit higher and then

807
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:49,987
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes it very instinctive when you have different heights and different typologies of buildings.

808
01:29:50,828 --> 01:30:05,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very easy to orient yourself in the city and so where the connections are and so in this way of having a bit of this high different that could help and that's why these notes were pushed a bit higher than the mix use.

809
01:30:08,019 --> 01:30:13,162
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely will study the depth of the, if it's feasible.

810
01:30:14,983 --> 01:30:18,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So the boundary, the lot boundary is the red line.

811
01:30:18,505 --> 01:30:23,808
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are asking them to set back is from the red boundary to the building.

812
01:30:24,228 --> 01:30:35,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really a lot, because this is even, believe it or not, the walkway here are bigger than Mystic Avenue, but it is a small still.

813
01:30:35,814 --> 01:30:58,531
[SPEAKER_01]: what we can do is to the ground floor of the corridor, how many of those buildings right up to the boundary, and so how many weird corners we would have, and do these setbacks on the ground floor so we can have a better idea of how that public ground floor will look like.

814
01:30:59,471 --> 01:31:02,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an interesting exercise to do.

815
01:31:05,035 --> 01:31:07,696
[SPEAKER_01]: as well to see if these are feasible or not.

816
01:31:08,456 --> 01:31:14,298
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I don't think that this amount of setback is going to affect.

817
01:31:14,799 --> 01:31:18,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more about how are we going to make it into zoning.

818
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:29,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We are using the curb setback in Brockton, so I could explore a bit more how is that working in there.

819
01:31:30,004 --> 01:31:31,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So to see a bit of precedence,

820
01:31:33,485 --> 01:31:37,492
[SPEAKER_01]: if in any other cities this is happening and how it's happening.

821
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:44,122
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, but thank you very much for all the comments.

822
01:31:46,045 --> 01:31:46,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Paola.

823
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,083
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciate that.

824
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:57,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And so just to quickly recap, unless there's any further comments by councillors, what we can expect for our next committee meeting on September the 11th.

825
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:13,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love it if we can, you know, return to these topics just briefly to touch on kind of an update to the timeline when we can expect to see just even a beginning or very rough draft, something that planning department can start to chew on.

826
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:16,230
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can get a timing update

827
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,571
[SPEAKER_08]: at that time, that'd be great.

828
01:32:17,611 --> 01:32:22,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if we can get drafts before then, even if they're again, even if they're super scrappy, it sounds like even that would be useful.

829
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:27,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So please do feel free to send those over to myself and planning department.

830
01:32:28,646 --> 01:32:31,409
[SPEAKER_08]: If any initial bullet points become available before that date.

831
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:41,401
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll also be going over and please correct me if I'm missing anything the condo conversion ordinance housing definitions incentive zoning.

832
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:46,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any other updates to the corridors plan that we can expect at September 11.

833
01:32:52,677 --> 01:33:02,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I really wanted to focus on these three topics, um, because it's already, uh, a lot of things to, to discuss.

834
01:33:03,606 --> 01:33:09,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see if there is any update that we have that we can give it, uh, in September 11.

835
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:12,213
[SPEAKER_01]: That is possible.

836
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:13,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

837
01:33:13,334 --> 01:33:13,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

838
01:33:13,614 --> 01:33:16,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And that sounds like, uh, more than enough for one meeting.

839
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:16,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

840
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:21,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to public participation.

841
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:23,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Just name and address for the record again.

842
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:24,251
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

843
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:26,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stingley Road.

844
01:33:26,672 --> 01:33:29,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

845
01:33:29,093 --> 01:33:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to, it's really interesting, the discussion about trade-offs.

846
01:33:34,335 --> 01:33:48,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And regarding setbacks, I agree with Councilor Chen, but at the same time, if we're going to have an active neighbourhood, which I support, then the neighbourhood has to be inviting to people to actually get outside.

847
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:51,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, playing the neighborhood outside.

848
01:33:51,763 --> 01:33:55,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see if they're available.

849
01:33:56,786 --> 01:34:07,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Some studies regarding neighborhoods where setbacks have been implemented, like the ones that you mentioned in Pittsville versus neighborhoods that don't have them on the sidewalks are much narrower.

850
01:34:07,637 --> 01:34:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think I'm thinking about myself, and I would appreciate to have the setbacks.

851
01:34:12,242 --> 01:34:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree that we have to build density.

852
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:20,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that, I would actually prefer to have more stories on buildings.

853
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:22,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the ones that have been shown, they look great.

854
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one last thing is that I don't really see, you know, why we should have open parking spaces, like the huge lots like that one, the one that is the dark red one around network when we could actually build them up.

855
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

856
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:41,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think

857
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:47,904
[SPEAKER_02]: When increased densities, we should seriously decrease their footprint, but then make them multiple stories.

858
01:34:49,665 --> 01:34:55,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, having open parking lots here in Metford, I personally consider them such a waste.

859
01:34:56,670 --> 01:35:01,833
[SPEAKER_02]: We could go either down or up and just like stack them on the different floors.

860
01:35:02,294 --> 01:35:05,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would really focus on that.

861
01:35:06,056 --> 01:35:10,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, having different floors and the setbacks, I think we should analyze it again.

862
01:35:11,077 --> 01:35:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a really nice opportunity for open spaces and for the community to actually hang out.

863
01:35:15,858 --> 01:35:21,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are some studies where this has been researched, it would be great to see.

864
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:21,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

865
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Gaston.

866
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:25,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate that.

867
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:26,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I think we're all.

868
01:35:27,694 --> 01:35:33,878
[SPEAKER_08]: very interested to see more data on the setbacks to inform where we go with this.

869
01:35:34,118 --> 01:35:35,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for your comments.

870
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:40,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any further comments or questions from councillors this evening?

871
01:35:43,065 --> 01:35:50,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none on Zoom, would Paolo or city staff have any closing comments to make before we adjourn?

872
01:35:53,332 --> 01:35:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

873
01:35:55,512 --> 01:36:01,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I'll just let you know that I'm out of the country on September 11th, but Danielle will be here.

874
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:02,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

875
01:36:02,897 --> 01:36:03,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the advance notice.

876
01:36:04,799 --> 01:36:08,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you so much to both of you for being here, for your insight throughout this project.

877
01:36:08,281 --> 01:36:18,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Paola, Jimmy, and Attorney Silverstein for being on the line with us, as always, and providing expert guidance on these very exciting proposals.

878
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Onward.

879
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:22,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion?

880
01:36:22,072 --> 01:36:23,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

881
01:36:25,598 --> 01:36:29,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng, seconded by, oh, nevermind.

882
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second it.

883
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Councilor Leming to adjourn, seconded by President Bears.

884
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:39,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.

885
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,740
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bareson?

886
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:54,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

887
01:36:55,241 --> 01:36:55,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Calderon?

888
01:36:57,722 --> 01:36:58,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems she dropped off.

889
01:36:59,803 --> 01:37:01,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Levitt?

890
01:37:02,004 --> 01:37:02,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

891
01:37:02,304 --> 01:37:04,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

892
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And Vice President Palacios?

893
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:07,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

894
01:37:09,627 --> 01:37:10,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all, meeting is adjourned.
