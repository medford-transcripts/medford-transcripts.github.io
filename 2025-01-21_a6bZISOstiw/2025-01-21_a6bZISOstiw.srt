1
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:02,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Test 1-2, test 1-2.

2
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: actually just right out of my garage right there.

3
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:45,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Did the kids let in?

4
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:46,969
[SPEAKER_07]: It was him.

5
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,909
[SPEAKER_07]: You knew him?

6
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

7
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:07,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

8
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ready to go?

9
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:30,991
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

10
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Public Works and Facilities Committee of January 21st, 2025, taking place at 7 p.m.

11
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: in the City Council Chambers.

12
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we will cover two items.

13
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:52,323
[SPEAKER_02]: One is paper number 24-492, Resolution to Receive an Update on Roads, and the other one is 24-493, Resolution to Establish a Volunteer Tree Planting Program.

14
00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:56,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go on, Mr. Clerk, would you call the roll?

15
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:58,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

16
00:01:58,629 --> 00:01:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.

17
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming?

18
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:00,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

19
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:01,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

20
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,017
I see him in here.

21
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Chair Callahan.

22
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:11,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

23
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:17,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we might as well move on to our first paper.

24
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:28,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the resolution to receive an update on the roads, whereas it has been more than six months since the city council was last updated on our roads, and whereas during the election of November 5.

25
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The voters of Medford considered a budget override provision in Question 7 providing funds for, among other purposes, quote, fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works, $500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, unquote.

26
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,015
[SPEAKER_02]: and that ballot question was successful.

27
00:02:48,536 --> 00:03:03,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite engineer Owen Wartella and DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting that is today to talk about the state of the roads and the plan moving forward, given the outcome of the election.

28
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much to Commissioner McGibbon and Engineer Wartella for being here.

29
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to go ahead and pass the floor to you.

30
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can give us an update on the roads, especially given the new budget, that would be great.

31
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,488
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

32
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

33
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:24,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilors, good evening.

34
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Commissioner McGivern.

35
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:36,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So I primarily deal with the operations of the DPW, and Owen is obviously lead in engineering and capital projects.

36
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:38,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Capital projects always are engineering projects.

37
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will give you an update on the 500K first.

38
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,181
[SPEAKER_04]: As you may recall,

39
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The 500K has a breakdown that includes three new staff members that is posted right now.

40
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:58,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna go through an internal process, but eventually we'll have three new people in the highway division.

41
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: These positions include a mason working foreman, two maintenance craftsmen and laborers.

42
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:13,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually there's one other, there's a transfer coming from cemetery too, but basically those two maintenance craftsmen and working foreman

43
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:21,361
[SPEAKER_04]: will be added to the highway division, which will enable us to generate more crews more often.

44
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:25,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So that increases the efficiency and the production of the department.

45
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So the expected increase in efficiency is about 20%.

46
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:36,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're increasing the size of the highway division by approximately 20%.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: What this allows us to do is to increase things like large patching and preventative maintenance activities.

48
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: If you recall, this was a strategy that I've had for a while.

49
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:51,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've also purchased equipment.

50
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:56,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have newer equipment and we have more people.

51
00:04:56,745 --> 00:05:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that said, the budget breakdown includes things like parts and supplies for that equipment, gasoline, repair supplies, concrete, for example, or asphalt.

52
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also included an amount for capital expenditures because

53
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:16,307
[SPEAKER_04]: When you add more people, you are going to need more trucks as time goes on.

54
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is the breakdown of the 500K.

55
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can go into numbers if you guys want to talk numbers.

56
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's basically the things that we get for it.

57
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I was saying that we will be able to do more preventative maintenance activities.

58
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:39,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, basically, our preventative maintenance is doing potholes, spot repairs, also on sidewalks.

59
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:40,693
[SPEAKER_04]: We do spot repairs on sidewalks.

60
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That type of work is so large in the city that we also do contracts for that work.

61
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So that just tells me that our DBW is not right-sized.

62
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:58,122
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have to hire contractors to repair sidewalk panels, boy, that's a really inefficient way to spend a public dollar.

63
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So that type of spot repair work should be happening in-house, and that frees up that capital dollar to be spent on larger capital projects, which Owen will talk about.

64
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:23,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so we kind of went twice, we will get more cost effective work done in house for spot repairs and box out patching and other preventative maintenance activities on our pavements or sidewalks and our asphalt.

65
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:35,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll also be able to shift resources away from engineering to open those resources up to managing capital projects and actually spending the money on capital projects.

66
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:39,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say capital projects, what I mean by that in the engineering world is

67
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,571
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, miles of water pipe, miles of roadway, many, many blocks of sidewalk.

68
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:53,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So production work where we get a good bang for our buck when we're paying a contractor out there, and we can't do that type of work in-house.

69
00:06:54,314 --> 00:07:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the biggest thing that's happened in the last six months on our, let's improve our pavement strategy.

70
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what else.

71
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned the new equipment, compliments and equipment.

72
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a, you know, an outline, I think, and I can answer any questions on that.

73
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:20,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know if you wanted to have questions now, or if we wanted to move on to Owen to talk about capital projects and where that's headed.

74
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if there are any questions from the city council members.

75
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm not sure.

76
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you help me with this?

77
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,274
[SPEAKER_02]: on the left.

78
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to click the green one and nothing's happening.

79
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

80
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minor questions.

81
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: First, what do you think the timeline is going to be for hiring the three workers?

82
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:12,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how long do you think it'll be before we can see them working on potholes around the city?

83
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:18,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And two, can you give us a ballpark estimate of how much

84
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:30,528
[SPEAKER_05]: the city was spending on contracts per year to hire out outside crews to do spot repairs?

85
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:32,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, good questions.

86
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:42,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So the process for how long it will take to get new bodies into the DPW, it's hard to say, but we have already started the internal process.

87
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So we post those three jobs and then folks have the opportunity to sign for them that are in the labor union.

88
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they do, then we will interview them.

89
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:54,041
[SPEAKER_04]: That could take a few weeks, three to four weeks.

90
00:08:54,862 --> 00:09:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once that process is complete, we may or may not need to backfill that position that the person is promoted from.

91
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we promote someone, then we have to backfill that.

92
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That happens all the way until we get to the bottom of the totem pole, so to speak.

93
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:12,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably shouldn't say that.

94
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:21,292
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottom of the labor force, and then we would then get two entry-level, three entry-level folks into the highway division that way.

95
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:25,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That could take three or four months to fully complete that whole cycle.

96
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:35,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It may take a little bit longer, depending on how many folks move internal for the job, on the internal transfers I have.

97
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I know that's not a great answer, but it's the best answer I have for you.

98
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:41,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we'll do it as fast as we can.

99
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:50,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but right now, um, what, what this laws is to do is to plan for it and, uh, to, uh, you know, make it happen as fast as, as we can.

100
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:54,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Oh, sorry.

101
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:57,281
[SPEAKER_04]: The second question, how much money per year contract?

102
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think

103
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:12,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We average about probably like 500 to a million dollars in sidewalk contract funds every, every year, approximately, I think there's a loan taken out for about 500,000 almost every year.

104
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also did a $250,000 worth of stomping sidewalk repairs this last season, I think we've done that twice in a row now.

105
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't contract out potholes, but we do contract out crack sealing.

106
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also contracted out large patching.

107
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And Owen might have numbers on those for you.

108
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:38,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So Cassidy's was our contractor for Sidewalk.

109
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:40,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a three-year contract.

110
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:41,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It just ended.

111
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:46,657
[SPEAKER_06]: As Commissioner McIvern said, it was around $500,000 a year.

112
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:55,784
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to start a new contract with around $650,000 from CDBG funds.

113
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have that covered for this year.

114
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:07,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have $2.4 million in unallocated or uncommitted Chapter 90 funds.

115
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:09,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So we plan to use that.

116
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:13,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We have six or seven roadways that we'd like to target this year.

117
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:21,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the numbers that I guess you were asking about.

118
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:27,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can go into the state of our roads if you'd like, unless you wanna stop for more questions.

119
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't actually have one other question before we go to you.

120
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just add on to that just a little bit.

121
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:39,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because, not that it's misleading or anything, but we could spend as much money as we wanted to in spot repairs.

122
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want you to walk away thinking that we're

123
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:48,903
[SPEAKER_04]: taking $500,000 away from contract work and putting it into the DPW operations, we're not.

124
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:50,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do both.

125
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do another sidewalk contract loan, but we're going to focus on more production work.

126
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, a block or two of sidewalks, as opposed to spot repairs of sidewalks.

127
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: In previous years, we've done, you know, a hundred or so spot repairs or, you know, 70 or so spot repairs for, you know,

128
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:21,426
[SPEAKER_04]: a large chunk of money where we should have been able to do like many blocks worth because the most expensive part of paying a contractor to do spot repairs is moving them around the city.

129
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just, it's not a good use of money at all.

130
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have them stay in one spot and do as much sidewalk as possible in that one spot.

131
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And my point really is being is we're not moving, we're not taking 500 away from capital and putting it into operations.

132
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:44,987
[SPEAKER_04]: We're basically saying that this type of work should be done in-house, which will open up more funds to do more production style work in engineering.

133
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that makes sense.

134
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

135
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:58,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Kiley.

136
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:05,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically answered the question I was going to ask which, but just to kind of clarify and drive the point home.

137
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:09,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much we're using the capital funding much more efficiently

138
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:14,265
[SPEAKER_03]: this way than we are when we're doing spot repairs with contractors.

139
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

140
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:19,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is both for sidewalks and for street repair.

141
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:28,619
[SPEAKER_03]: The crew is going to be doing spot repairs where we previously were hiring contractors to do spot repairs like patching and crack sealing and spot panels of sidewalk.

142
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,806
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have crack sealing skills machines quite yet, but in the future that is something we can try to do.

143
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also easy to hire that up.

144
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:52,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But really with asphalt, it comes down to spending more time boxing out and square patching, removing large sections of pavements that have potholed over and over again over the years and repairing that section of pavement.

145
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:57,866
[SPEAKER_04]: To do that spread out over the city and pay a contractor to do it, you run into the same problem.

146
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:02,789
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not paying a contractor to move from one spot to another as opposed to doing the actual work.

147
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the type of stuff we want to have in-house.

148
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a small paver now, we have an asphalt grinder now,

149
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,194
[SPEAKER_04]: and now we're gonna have a 20% increase in personnel.

150
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:18,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these things, we're hoping to get into some production value, some production work ourselves.

151
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:22,537
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, I would love it, and we'll be like this next year, hopefully.

152
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:30,040
[SPEAKER_04]: We send out a crew to break open sidewalks, and then we send out another crew to prep the holes, and then another crew goes out and does the concrete.

153
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Those all take different amounts of time, so you can stay with crews.

154
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a more efficient use of people.

155
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do that right now, we just don't have enough people to do that.

156
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:40,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So we send the same crew back to do that work.

157
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:49,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just to give you an idea of some of the efficiencies that we're talking about when we talk about the difference between sidewalk concrete work and asphalt work.

158
00:14:50,570 --> 00:15:02,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so essentially on both of these fronts we're talking about moving from triaging emergency spot repairs with outside contractors to being able to do all of that work in-house plus maybe even a little bit of

159
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:07,927
[SPEAKER_03]: production worker, you know, maybe some people might call it, you know.

160
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: a new project.

161
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We treat it like production work, so it's still spot repairs, but you can send a crew out to break out 12 of them all over the city.

162
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:23,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next day, send out a crew to spend two days forming them up.

163
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So you treat it more like production work, but you're not getting the benefit of all of it's in one location.

164
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:33,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you were to do two blocks of sidewalk, three blocks of sidewalk, for example.

165
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:44,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the equivalent on asphalt might be, well, we're sending pothole crews out, you know, three or four times a week, and we keep potholing the same places over and over again.

166
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:52,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we still need to pothole and we still need to be doing that, but wouldn't it be great if we could spin up a box of pool at the same time.

167
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: that is removing those large areas of re-potholed, re-potholed, re-potholed, and giving them a nice flat clean patch.

168
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:06,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to do that in-house instead of paying a contractor to do it.

169
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:07,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

170
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just on the front of the money going towards our roads and sidewalks, and you know, correct me if I'm getting my six-month-old back of the napkin calculations wrong, but

171
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:34,555
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about needing to move into the $5.5 to $6.5 million a year range of spending, and we were somewhere in the $3.5 to $4 million range.

172
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:45,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gets us another $500,000 closer to that $5.5 to $6.5 million range, essentially, because we're going to still be doing.

173
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And does the efficiency impact that at all as well?

174
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:58,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're using the money more efficiently, does it give us an even further added benefit than just adding 500,000 towards that annual repair budget?

175
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,723
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

176
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really at 3.5 to 9, I think, still, right?

177
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:05,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

178
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

179
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:14,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So 3.5, if we were to spend $3.5 million within, I guess, spread over all of our bands of pavement and done in the right priority,

180
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:19,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We would need to spend three and a half million dollars to maintain our current condition.

181
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:26,095
[SPEAKER_04]: If we spend nine, then we're going to have a nice steep rise of improvement of our condition.

182
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So that five million dollars is kind of like that sweet spot.

183
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great if we could target and hit five.

184
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,712
[SPEAKER_04]: That's across all bands.

185
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:40,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bands are everything from pothole day-to-day maintenance to rebuild that road and everything in between.

186
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:44,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So the weighting of that band changes year to year.

187
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:47,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, we did a ton of preventative maintenance work.

188
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we do $3.5 million worth?

189
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:53,141
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's hard to measure the value of that work over a long period of time.

190
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:58,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that we needed to do it right away because the sooner you do it, the better, the longer the road will last.

191
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But can we quantify that?

192
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:01,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, that's a tough question.

193
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can watch it and we can see what happens.

194
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:10,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, some of the work Owen was just talking about is a middle band, mills and overlays.

195
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next sort of round that we have to target here.

196
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:21,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is just grinding off the surface layer of the road and putting a new surface layer down and doing the ramps.

197
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:26,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in the middle band, and we're going to try to spend $2 million plus on that this year.

198
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:36,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's going to give us a lot less square footage than if we were to, say, spend that same $2 plus million on large patches, for example.

199
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: or if we were to spend that money on anything really that involves contract moving around more than we'd like to.

200
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:47,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

201
00:18:50,649 --> 00:19:01,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess just to follow up, you know, when we talk about that $2 million, when we talk about that money in general, we're talking about the money that we're actually spending on

202
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:09,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not necessarily talking about the money we're spending on the staff, per se, or I guess just Yeah, okay.

203
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:17,721
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, it's the full spectrum of the band so everything from preventative maintenance to day to day maintenance to

204
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, regular care and resurfacing, like mills and overlays, to that road is gone and we need to completely rebuild it.

205
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not worth spending money on an overlay.

206
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:31,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're talking about like the capital costs of like the materials for the project?

207
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:32,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything, soup to nuts.

208
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:38,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we say three and a half million dollars, we're talking about soup to nuts, everything, the soft costs, the hard costs.

209
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor, materials.

210
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

211
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Even does that even include like police details and stuff like that?

212
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it doesn't get that granular.

213
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it certainly would.

214
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

215
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:51,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

216
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:57,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is driven by us, depending on if we're going to do, hey, we're going to do crack sealing all year this year.

217
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:03,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not going to, we could crack seal every road that needs to get crack sealed out there and not spend all that money.

218
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:04,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

219
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet if we go to rebuild one road, it's going to cost all of that money.

220
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

221
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's across all bands, I understand that it's complicated to determine you know how much does one person's time equivalent spend if they're doing a million overlay versus a completely redoing the base of the road versus doing crack ceiling I get that it's a hard calculation but it's helpful for me to try to understand right you talked about.

222
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:54,482
[SPEAKER_03]: um combining cdbg and chapter 90 funds to go towards it sounds like a few seven streets of mills and mill and overlay is that yeah that's all we have targeted at the moment right there will be more right right right and that community development block grant money is set aside for sidewalks within the eligible areas right we're also going for you know other funding sources that aren't

223
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:09,366
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that it's from the state or from feds, you know, those types of pools where we can effectively, you know, use that money in targeted areas.

224
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:21,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the question I'm asking, and again, I understand the answer is probably just going to be it's complicated, is can I add up the highway department budget plus the CDBG money we're using this year plus the Chapter 90 money we're using this year plus

225
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: some other grant money we're using this year and say, well, that all adds up to four and a half million.

226
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.

227
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,071
[SPEAKER_03]: We're above the three and a half million.

228
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're getting there.

229
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:37,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when the, and you know, you might be able to contribute to this.

230
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:52,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when the engineers are figuring out what those numbers are, they're looking at how much does it cost on the market to bid out the work per foot of roadway or quarter mile or whatever they're using for unit.

231
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very zoomed out.

232
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very back of the envelope planning.

233
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:06,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, this year, you should do this amount of road rebuilding, this amount of crack sealing, this amount of patching.

234
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:12,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you were to do all of that, it should roughly add up to roughly $5 million.

235
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So my point is, it's way more zoomed out than we were getting into.

236
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:17,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just really a rough guide.

237
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:19,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're onto something.

238
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,741
[SPEAKER_04]: But would it tell us that we're on the right track?

239
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily how much money we're spending is going to tell us if we're on the right track.

240
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's every single year, I think every two years, I forget what our cadence was.

241
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Every two years, we're going to update the payment condition index.

242
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That will tell us how well we're doing.

243
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:42,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we go up a point or two, then we can say, well, how much did we spend above that point or two?

244
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:43,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did we do?

245
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And then look back on it and say, well, how are we going to

246
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: plan for the future, now that we actually have data and information that is telling us how our asphalt assets are either degrading or improving.

247
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling that it will be a couple of years before we actually start to see improvements.

248
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we stay the course and we're spending that amount of money and we're doing our evaluations, we're going to know how healthy we are

249
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,418
[SPEAKER_04]: more and more after each year goes by.

250
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:23,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We already had one round of that and we're not doing so hot, but

251
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also not doing terrible either.

252
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't been improving.

253
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a little bit worse, but only a little bit worse.

254
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we have done is we've slowed the backlog.

255
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So backlog's not going crazy.

256
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:40,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We did preventive maintenance to kind of like slow that down.

257
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And our backlog for pavement right now is around 70 million.

258
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:45,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from last year's numbers.

259
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:49,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Our sidewalk backlog is around 30 million.

260
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:58,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our index, whatever the sidewalk conditioning index for the city has gone up.

261
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:03,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're spending enough to kind of move it into the right direction.

262
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:06,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got really creative this year.

263
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:17,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually really excited to see what actually how the index changes in the next year or two, because I think we're getting a lot more bang for the buck in the pavement side.

264
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to show.

265
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Either it's going to show in our backlog stagnating and kind of plateauing, which is what I need to do, or the index going up.

266
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:29,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully we do both.

267
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:32,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of our sweet spot.

268
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

269
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:38,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that kind of, you know, the trend-based stuff and the reassessment, I appreciate that that's the direction we're moving in.

270
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're in the kind of the early days of that.

271
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think for me, or it would be helpful for me to understand

272
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:50,209
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe after the next iteration of it, or maybe it'll take two, I don't know.

273
00:24:50,229 --> 00:25:12,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's just gonna be different because of how resources are allocated, but like, what dollar amount of money that we put into preventative maintenance at the lower end of the scale, or into mill and overlay, or into where we just had to completely redo a street, like how much of an increase in the PCI and the SCI did that get us for that money?

274
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then we can take that and say, okay, if we put,

275
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say, let's call it three bands.

276
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's really about five, but like, let's call it three.

277
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:28,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if we put a million into band one and 2 million into band two and 2 million into band three, we think we'll move up five points in the next two years.

278
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can start to understand, I think that financial scope of things a little bit better.

279
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:37,936
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what I would, you know, like us to move towards.

280
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause then- Five points is a big- A lot.

281
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:42,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.

282
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those numbers,

283
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,058
[SPEAKER_06]: the dollar amounts will be way higher.

284
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:48,919
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be closer to the 9, 10, 12.

285
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,040
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to know the same information that you want to know and that you just eloquently described.

286
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know that too.

287
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:58,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking forward to it.

288
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't been able to do the balanced approach yet because we kind of have to put up the fires.

289
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still going to do that, preventative maintenance fires.

290
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:09,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, once we kind of feel locked in on that, we have

291
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:16,511
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, roads to rebuild and we have, um, lots of surface treatments to be doing and that's what we're going to work on and focus on.

292
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:26,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that should give, as Owen was saying, it should give a, uh, an increase in our condition index, just because of the nature of the work itself, mills and overlays.

293
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It provides a fresh new surface that then gets evaluated.

294
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:30,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So, right.

295
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:31,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.

296
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:36,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally, you know, wasn't trying to throw out unrealistic numbers for you guys to try to meet.

297
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just totally, you know, we ran.

298
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,755
[SPEAKER_04]: we want them too and we'll get them.

299
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:46,259
[SPEAKER_04]: If we keep doing the work that we're doing year over year, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

300
00:26:46,660 --> 00:27:01,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think at some point also being able to know how much invested in each band, like what does that reduce the backlog by, and I get that that's a little bit of kind of a, right now we're just trying to feel that out.

301
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've also implemented a lot of like

302
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:21,595
[SPEAKER_06]: the way we track like permits, trenching in the city, when somebody goes into the roadway, we are now way more organized so that we can, we know who's going in there, how they're restoring it and kind of forcing them to make sure that they go back and restore it correctly.

303
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:28,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have potholes, we don't have a trench breaking up a road after like three years.

304
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:31,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot more oversight

305
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:35,753
[SPEAKER_06]: the, you know, the city standpoint on that.

306
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're kind of like holding the utility people to what they are required to do.

307
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:41,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

308
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:43,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.

309
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:52,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know last time, or maybe two times ago, we had this conversation, you were talking about how a piece of that dollar amount is the utilities and the work that they do.

310
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:56,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously you can't quite know how much they're spending.

311
00:27:56,788 --> 00:28:06,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or take that into account, but the more the more that we think about this, though, it's kind of it's they cancel each other out because they're the ones also cutting into our roads that.

312
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: to cause the damage.

313
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're really doing is trying to minimize that damage.

314
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:26,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really comes with, as on some of the improvements we've been making, like Owen was saying in the permitting, a lot of that is moving into online, being able to track much better online instead of paper permitting, and knowing who is cutting into the road.

315
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:34,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also been improving standards in what our licensed contractors should be doing out there when it comes to restoring the road.

316
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:42,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really simple things like saw cutting and tacking and sealing your cuts so rainwater doesn't get in in a year.

317
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:49,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but to monitor and track that happening hundreds of times a week.

318
00:28:51,486 --> 00:29:02,908
[SPEAKER_04]: can be difficult and improving that will not contribute to our condition index, it will contribute or growing, it will contribute to it degrading less quickly.

319
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:03,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

320
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just evening out the damage that they're doing.

321
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're- They're making it worse.

322
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,470
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making it worse.

323
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:08,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

324
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit worse.

325
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit worse because we're trying to minimize how much worse they make it.

326
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:12,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

327
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

328
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:13,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

329
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:19,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's totally worth the a hundred million we're sending to the British owners, right?

330
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:21,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally worth it.

331
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that.

332
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:26,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

333
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:32,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to put in one last comment just because I think

334
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of this, we do this for the public.

335
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this not just for us to understand because we're obviously involved in budget considerations, but we do this for people who are listening to be able to really understand what is happening with our roads.

336
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:53,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to put this in a little bit of context that when we did our first roads assessment in, am I correct that it was 2019?

337
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:53,131
2021.

338
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,392
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021 was the first one?

339
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:56,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

340
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:56,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

341
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we did the first roads assessment in 2021,

342
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:12,275
[SPEAKER_02]: At by that time, we are roads already were quite degraded in that 49% of our roads were in the, you know,

343
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: category four and five of the five, one being the best and five being the worst.

344
00:30:19,395 --> 00:30:41,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found ourselves, you guys are in a situation where you're trying to dig us out of a hole that has come from the past and from the fact that maybe they didn't have the information because there was no roads assessment, maybe utilities were not being kept track of and so they,

345
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: No one was preventing the degrading that they were doing.

346
00:30:45,866 --> 00:31:03,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And for who knows what other reason, not enough funding or whatever else, that we found ourselves at the first roads assessment in 2021 with roads that are quite degraded, and now trying to dig ourselves out when just to stay at the same level would cost $5 million a year.

347
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that's relatively accurate?

348
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Three and a half is the- Three and a half is staying level.

349
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:10,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

350
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:14,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Five would be just able to begin improvement.

351
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:15,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

352
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

353
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:16,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

354
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for people to understand sort of the context of where we are in terms of this roads update.

355
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:24,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wonderful.

356
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else?

357
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:25,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

358
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to Councilor Lazzaro.

359
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:31,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

360
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you both being here and telling us about this stuff.

361
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_00]: It can feel frustrating and dark, and I agree with Chair Callahan that actually this is helpful for the community.

362
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:56,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of our conversations publicly or when people start talking about it online, it's like the streets are so bad, the sidewalks are so bad.

363
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We're battling nature, we're battling backlog, we're battling all of this stuff.

364
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:01,782
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.

365
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:05,404
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth does not want us to have streets on it.

366
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are insisting on doing that.

367
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:15,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we are always going to be, you know, fighting this battle but it's it's necessary and it's important so that we can

368
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:24,449
[SPEAKER_00]: travel to and fro, and that people with mobility issues are always being prioritized and all of that stuff, and we're trying all the time, we're trying.

369
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:39,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just see the work that you're doing, and as difficult and insurmountable as it seems, it's good, important work, and we have to keep doing it, and we have to pay for it as a community.

370
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:45,158
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to keep showing up and trying, and paying for it.

371
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,439
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

372
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.

373
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:51,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just want to see if you have any last things.

374
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:54,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we do have another agenda item that I'm hoping to get to.

375
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you'd want to add about roads?

376
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be patient.

377
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take a while.

378
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:03,309
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a long road and we're starting to climb out of that hole.

379
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So patience, patience, patience.

380
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots, hundreds, hundreds.

381
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Starts with a single step.

382
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:10,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

383
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:10,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

384
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:18,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can, I would love to move on to 24-493, which is the resolution to establish a volunteer tree planting program.

385
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Medford loses an estimated 500 or more trees each year and plants less than 250 trees each year.

386
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas the cost of planting city trees is primarily in the labor to plant the trees rather than the cost of the sapling.

387
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:59,960
[SPEAKER_02]: and whereas Medford only has one full-time staff member dedicated to our trees, the tree warden, and whereas Medford currently contracts out for tree planting, which is more expensive than planting with an in-house crew, and whereas trees are a vital part of fighting climate change, help cool buildings and streets in summer, and add to the beauty of our city, and whereas Medford has many residents who want to volunteer to plant city trees, therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting, that is today,

388
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,082
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin discussing the possibility of allowing Medford residents to volunteer to help plant city trees.

389
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a project near and dear to my heart that I talked about a lot as I was campaigning a year ago last summer.

390
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:20,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to just open the conversation.

391
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:26,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate Commissioner McIvern that you are open to discussing this possibility.

392
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other cities in Massachusetts that do allow residents to help volunteer to help plant city trees.

393
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:45,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to hear your thoughts about whether this is a project that we could start looking into here in Medford.

394
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of residents who are actually excited to help.

395
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can give us a little bit of sort of your opening thoughts.

396
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:53,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

397
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:54,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

398
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:57,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So the biggest challenge that I would have with that program

399
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: is a volunteer coordinator, someone to coordinate the work, to document the work, to coordinate and interact with the tree warden for that work.

400
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:10,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are a lot of people in the city that would be interested in doing this.

401
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:20,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can imagine having just even a half a dozen folks doing this, the sort of the level of coordination that would be needed

402
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:23,464
[SPEAKER_04]: to make that happen in an effective manner.

403
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:25,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would just be my concern.

404
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:27,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a part-time type position.

405
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:29,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it, even if it is.

406
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:34,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really the biggest challenge that I would have.

407
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:37,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic idea.

408
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:43,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, I think there's plenty of folks in this community who would want to take part.

409
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:45,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

410
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:49,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a few, I have a few questions.

411
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:53,468
[SPEAKER_02]: What season is the best for tree planting?

412
00:35:53,488 --> 00:35:56,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not an expert in trees.

413
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have an answer for you, but I do know that we plant in the fall quite a lot.

414
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also plant in the spring.

415
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,778
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's the fall and the spring.

416
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:15,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get an answer for you.

417
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

418
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:24,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple other questions.

419
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: How comfortable would you feel with a volunteer, volunteer coordinator, or do we need to wait for a budget item to come and put a halftime person in the budget before you would feel comfortable with a position like this?

420
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct, yeah.

421
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:47,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I don't think if we were to do it right now, it would be very effective.

422
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:53,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we would get a lot of frustrations, a lot of issues with the tree warden.

423
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:57,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't want to necessarily deal with that.

424
00:36:57,855 --> 00:37:02,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the fringes familiar with coordinating volunteers.

425
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been involved in different organizations over the years.

426
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:09,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not as easy as it seems.

427
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:15,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go ahead and go to councilors for any questions or comments.

428
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro.

429
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:23,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have two thoughts.

430
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:34,291
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is I just got an email from the planning department about Trees Medford and their program.

431
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So Trees Medford is a nonprofit.

432
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:44,993
[SPEAKER_00]: their program offering free trees to specific neighborhoods that are like hotter neighborhoods or neighborhoods in Medford in particular.

433
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:51,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they operate as a nonprofit and have their own infrastructure for tree planting.

434
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.

435
00:37:52,178 --> 00:38:03,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super familiar with them, but it would probably be worth having conversations with existing organizations.

436
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you already have.

437
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:21,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to presume, but yes, but the other thing I wanted to say is that because of work that I've done with the Malden warming center which is an almost entirely volunteer organization, and is a nonprofit on its own.

438
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:34,749
[SPEAKER_00]: We I'm the president of the board of directors this year, but the last two years I was the assistant director and the our work is volunteer based.

439
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:40,092
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a volunteer coordinator and all of our staff are volunteers.

440
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gets paid for those

441
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:46,115
[SPEAKER_00]: for the work that they do, but everybody has to have a quarry, everybody has to have training.

442
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:52,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The volunteer coordinator does put in a lot of time, but everybody kind of goes into it knowing what they're getting into.

443
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,761
[SPEAKER_00]: The time that they put in is extensive.

444
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody puts in a lot of time.

445
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:05,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of part of the mission of the organization that it's like, what if we could do it all volunteer-based?

446
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:11,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much everybody in the beginning, the executive director, when he started it, said, what if we did a volunteer-based?

447
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:13,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody said, you won't be able to do it volunteer-based.

448
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:16,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, what if I just did it anyway?

449
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of how it started.

450
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:21,708
[SPEAKER_00]: The model is really unusual.

451
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:28,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's uncommon, but it's possible.

452
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does take a lot of people doing a lot of work

453
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:35,629
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of time for no money.

454
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:46,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the more common thing, especially when you're doing it with a municipality as part of a department, would be to hire somebody to bring people in, especially if people in neighborhoods wanted to do things for their own neighborhood.

455
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:53,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a more traditional pathway to put something into the budget for somebody to do the coordinating.

456
00:39:53,378 --> 00:39:59,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frankly, the work that our volunteer coordinator does, and she's been doing it for a number of years, she has another full-time job.

457
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how she does this.

458
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:06,404
[SPEAKER_00]: She is like on the phone with people in the middle of the night, because we're open every night, all night long for four months.

459
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:09,765
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like always coordinating somebody to be there.

460
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:10,846
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.

461
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just,

462
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:22,403
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an outlier example, but it does take a lot of coordinating.

463
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:23,524
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a smaller scale.

464
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:26,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'm saying is it can be done.

465
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:28,726
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a lot of forethought.

466
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:36,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's great, and I think we should do it anyway.

467
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:39,830
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of my comment.

468
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:42,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

469
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:46,749
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other questions, if you've thought a little bit about it.

470
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from a volunteer coordinator, do you see any kind of structure?

471
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:55,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how would this fit in with the tree warden or with anything else in the DPW?

472
00:40:55,938 --> 00:41:00,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what would you imagine to be like a structurally, how would it work?

473
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:02,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

474
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: the volunteer coordinator would probably need to report in some fashion to the tree warden to get pre-planting assignments.

475
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:20,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that I'm thinking of here too is, you probably need more trees to plant.

476
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:24,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd probably want more money to plant those trees, another consideration.

477
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:31,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think depending on how many volunteers they get, I suppose,

478
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have to receive direction from tree warden and then report back once it's complete.

479
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know the locations have been filled, the tree locations.

480
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:47,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about as much thought as I put into it.

481
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:48,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

482
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:59,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other, I can think of a bunch of next steps that I will, by the way, I have talked to Chief Medford about it.

483
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think I have some other next steps for me personally that I want to do.

484
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see other next steps?

485
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:10,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm thinking like a pilot, like we get something in the budget and then

486
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:25,745
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out like a place where we could do a pilot project where we can do one or two tree plantings in a particular neighborhood and you know work through the warden and the volunteer coordinator and really have a first project to happen.

487
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:30,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious if you see sort of other sort of next steps that we would do in this process.

488
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:32,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it depends on which way we go.

489
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:34,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilor Lazzaro brought up a pretty good point.

490
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:38,464
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the capacity within the community already?

491
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:39,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Trees Medford.

492
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:44,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what their capacity is, but are there other organizations that have some capacity here?

493
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:53,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And could it be more of a permitting process to the DPW as opposed to an operational thing of the DPW?

494
00:42:54,197 --> 00:43:08,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and what I mean by that really, uh, is if some outside organization, some nonprofit NGO approached the city and said, we have 500 trees that we want to plant and here are the locations, then I'm just reviewing and approving at that point.

495
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:18,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think there's, there's some opportunity there depending on the capacity of already existing in, you know, maybe

496
00:43:19,608 --> 00:43:23,732
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, future organizations here in Medford based that are, you know, citizen based.

497
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not off the table either.

498
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:42,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so, but if you wanted to do it more of an in-house approach and have like a volunteer coordinator, I think next steps, um, is probably getting it on the mayor's radar to see if the mayor would be interested in adding something like that to her budget.

499
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:45,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

500
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:48,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions either from councillors?

501
00:43:48,508 --> 00:43:49,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from councillors first.

502
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:55,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from the public?

503
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:02,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I see one and I don't have.

504
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:09,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda Bowe, we have asked you to unmute.

505
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:14,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

506
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:15,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

507
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:22,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to let you know that there is currently a Mr. grit address for the record.

508
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:23,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

509
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:24,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

510
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:31,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Amanda Bowen 57 Madison Street, I just, I just wanted to let you know that this is very, very opportune because

511
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:42,461
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Myra, Mystic River Watershed Association got a grant over multiple cities to have citizen tree planting happen.

512
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:48,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody named Karina Ramos from Myra has been in touch with Aggie just recently.

513
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:58,384
[SPEAKER_01]: about this, they have money for something like 40 trees, but the whole point is for it to be a citizen planting process.

514
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:06,046
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's money for trees, there's probably some staffing conceivably available from them to help with it.

515
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:12,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be a perfect test project and the money I believe needs to be spent this year.

516
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so exciting.

517
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:18,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

518
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you bringing that to our attention.

519
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make that happen.

520
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else?

521
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:30,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

522
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,815
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, I believe we are at the end of this discussion.

523
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:49,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I so again, super appreciate that you're open to the idea, really looking forward to moving this forward either through the administration with a part time volunteer coordinator or with a nonprofit, but potentially working with

524
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:55,515
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the Mr. Graber Water Association or some other nonprofit, and of course with Trees Medford.

525
00:45:55,795 --> 00:46:00,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Trees Medford, for the work that you have done in previous years on this project.

526
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:05,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that being said, is there a motion on the floor?

527
00:46:10,265 --> 00:46:10,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

528
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:14,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

529
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: with a motion to adjourn from Councilor Lazzaro.

530
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:21,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

531
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:29,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

532
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:33,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?

533
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do we need to call the roll?

534
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to call the roll.

535
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:37,822
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

536
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:38,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

537
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:39,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And all opposed?

538
00:46:39,903 --> 00:46:43,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three in favor, one opposed.

539
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:44,986
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

540
00:46:45,027 --> 00:46:45,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

541
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:47,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to see you guys having so much fun.

542
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:48,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I watched.
