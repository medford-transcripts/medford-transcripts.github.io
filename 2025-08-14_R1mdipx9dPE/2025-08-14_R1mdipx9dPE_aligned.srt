So six present, one absent for now.

27
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:25,045
We are going to rise and salute the flag, please.

28
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:36,253
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

29
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:58,632
We have executive session upon a motion to enter into executive session pursuant to MGL 30A, section 21A, executive session of the Medford School Committee to conduct a strategy session on the basis that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining positions of the Medford School Committee.

I think that was Member Reinfeld.

37
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:33,334
Roll call, please.

38
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:34,935
Member Brantley.

39
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:38,704
Yes.

40
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:39,665
Thank you.

41
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:40,246
Member Graham?

00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:41,988

00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:42,589
Yes.

44
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,071
Member Olopade is still absent.

45
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:46,953
Member Rheinfeld?

46
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:47,514
Yes.

47
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:49,696
Member Rissell-Guest?

48
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,537
Mayor Lundberg?

49
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:51,578
Yes.

50
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,801
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

51
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:56,944
We're going to join the breakout room, go into executive session.

52
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:57,365
Thank you.

53
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:26,724
Hi everyone, we're back, we're recording.

54
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:32,107
Okay, so we've just returned from executive session.

55
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,827
We have two items left on our agenda.

56
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:42,251
The first is a motion to approve our paraprofessionals contract.

57
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:48,534
And we just took this vote in executive session and we'll take it again here.

58
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:50,635
So is there a motion to approve

59
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:54,065
ratification of the paraprofessionals contract.

60
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,467
Motion to approve ratification of the paraprofessionals.

61
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:58,008
Motion approved by member Reinfeld.

62
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:00,409
Seconded by member Locate.

63
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,530
Anybody?

64
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:04,892
Member Russo, can you call the roll?

65
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,338
Member Russo, you're on mute in case you didn't know that.

66
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,228
I'm on mute and I don't have my camera on, I have no idea.

67
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,194
I think it's when I left the room, it must do that by default.

68
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:26,424
Anyways, we don't have anybody who wants to speak, I see.

69
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:30,530
Member Brantley.

70
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:42,979
Before you call the roll, just in case anybody catches this recording later, I just wanted to thank the members of the paraprofessional union for a really collaborative conversation.

71
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,963
This contract, there's actually two contracts, a one-year deal and a three-year deal.

72
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:54,969
And it includes the extension of the school day, which we've been talking so much about.

73
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:56,210
And so with this contract,

74
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:01,993
The paraprofessionals will be ready and with us as we step off in the new year, which we're really excited about.

75
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:15,160
We are trying to fix some of the problems of practice that we see with our paraprofessionals around when they're being asked to cover for different obligations during the school day that are outside of their job.

76
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,881
And the thing that.

77
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:27,012
Where I'm truly the most excited about is the creation of some like some flexible time from our paraprofessionals to help us do the things that don't.

78
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:34,313
Get done so consistently in the district today and, um, you know, I think we all heard from members of the community.

79
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:50,338
A couple of months back about the need for bus monitors, so this contract will allow us some flexibility to deploy paraprofessionals among other kinds of duties after school events after school.

80
00:49:51,238 --> 00:50:01,865
you know, parent nights, those kinds of things, but also to be able to support our students on the bus while they're in transit when we have like hot spots or flashpoints in the year.

81
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:08,690
Not all bus rides are created equal and we want to make sure that they're all like safe and welcoming spaces for students.

82
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:13,473
So I'm really excited about all of that in addition to, you know,

83
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:25,204
increases that reflect this committee's work to make sure that our staff all are paid a wage that is livable.

84
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:31,329
We've made huge strides there over the last six years, and this contract continues to do that.

85
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,891
So thank you to the committee.

86
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,573
Thank you to the paraprofessionals union.

87
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:36,294
I'm really excited about this.

88
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:46,483
And I think the people who are the most excited about this are the payroll office, because they will be able to process this without having to do retroactive pay before the year starts.

89
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,905
So everyone wins.

90
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:51,227
So thank you to everyone.

91
00:50:51,588 --> 00:50:53,269
And member Russo, can you call the roll?

92
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:54,410
Certainly.

93
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:55,531
Member Brantley?

94
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:57,153
Yes.

95
00:50:58,194 --> 00:50:58,854
Member Graham?

96
00:50:59,415 --> 00:50:59,655
Yes.

97
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:00,976
Member Antapa?

98
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:01,637
Yes.

99
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:02,563
Yes.

100
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:02,764
Yes.

101
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:03,064
Yes.

102
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:03,825
Yes.

103
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:04,706
Yes.

104
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:04,946
Yes.

105
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:05,206
Yes.

106
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:05,687
Yes.

107
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:08,650
Members say yes, and Maryland occurrence absent.

108
00:51:10,552 --> 00:51:12,594
Six in the affirmative one absence.

109
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:18,481
The motion is approved and the contract is ratified, so we will let the

110
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,618
We have one more agenda item this evening.

111
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:35,499
Dr. Galussi, I'm going to turn it over to you for agenda item number five, after school site coordinator positions.

112
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:37,200
Take it away.

113
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,160
Thank you.

114
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,741
I'm going to try here to first just share my screen.

115
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:47,962
I know that you all received, I shared this with you.

116
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,102
Can you see my screen right now?

117
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:52,643
Not yet.

118
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:53,423
Okay.

119
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:55,658
Hold on one second, please.

120
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:21,178
Okay, so we have been, as this body knows, we have been really looking at trying to increase our capacity here for our after school programs.

121
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:28,623
To date, we have removed 53 students from the wait list since last school year.

122
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:39,348
So, we also, just as a reminder for people that are maybe just joining this meeting now, we are engaging in a consultation with BASIC.

123
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:49,513
We are going to one of the very first school committee meetings, present what that might look like, and ask for a vote for that to engage in that consultancy.

124
00:52:50,174 --> 00:52:57,798
So, we don't want to be doing too much to our staffing ahead of being able to have that gathered data.

125
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:10,681
But as we're bringing on a new track, which is an early pickup time at 4 p.m., that new track has allowed us to be continuing to clear space off of the wait list.

126
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:15,322
Because when families elect for a 4 p.m.

127
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:19,844
pickup time, in some cases it has opened up a 6 p.m.

128
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:21,304
slot that we can then fill.

129
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:25,325
In order to keep forward momentum going,

130
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:30,942
without going too far ahead as we're engaging in a consultancy.

131
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:45,374
We are here to ask for the possibility of adding, which would be, well, increasing two site coordinator positions from the part-time that they are now to full-time.

132
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:55,380
So really what the request is is just what it would look like in the budget, which I will talk about, which is a revolving account.

133
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,862
it would just double what we're doing now.

134
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:03,828
So what the positions would consist of, there's four site coordinators, one for each building.

135
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:13,758
This would be for two site coordinators only that would partner with all four schools to just help out with some of the logistics.

136
00:54:15,037 --> 00:54:23,419
Their year would be, there's a breakdown here, so you could see it would be 220 days, which consists of the 180 days of school.

137
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,181
We're hoping to add some school vacation programming to this.

138
00:54:30,641 --> 00:54:35,963
Time for the before and the end of school summer programming, as well as professional development.

139
00:54:36,123 --> 00:54:37,803
They would be working eight-hour days.

140
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,821
$36.93 an hour.

141
00:54:45,782 --> 00:55:09,210
Some of the roles that it would be, another happy piece is that our partnership with City Year is expanding a bit and they also are getting into the afterschool game and we are getting five City Year employees that are separate from our core members that will be working in our McGlynn and our Missituck schools.

142
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:18,760
And so those additional, so we are getting 15 core members between the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and the McGlynn Elementary.

143
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:23,205
Those core members also work in the afterschool at the end of the day.

144
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:29,532
In addition to those core members, we are also getting five additional staff members for afterschool care.

145
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:33,835
coverage at the Missituck and the McGlynn.

146
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:54,166
So to kind of just help with a lot of these logistics in trying to increase capacity, working with our partner city here, and just assisting with some of the operational day-to-day pieces, it would be helpful to be able to elevate two of those positions right now to full-time.

147
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,379
which is in keeping with the model that BASIC does use.

148
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,425
So at the end of the day,

149
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:07,410
I'll just kind of highlight here.

150
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,792
Right now, site coordinators are currently budgeted to earn $41,277.90.

151
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:14,955
And if these two positions are created, there'd be an additional cost to the budget of $47,504.

152
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:32,595
So as I previously mentioned, the afterschool is a revolving account.

153
00:56:34,176 --> 00:56:37,018
The budget can handle this increase.

154
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:41,641
And so we are here to ask if that would be a possibility.

155
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:44,743
And I'm happy to answer any questions.

156
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:50,467
Member Reinfeldt?

157
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:55,810
Does this change benefits eligibility for anyone?

158
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:56,731
What does this do?

159
00:56:57,993 --> 00:56:58,213
No.

160
00:56:58,233 --> 00:56:58,894
Okay.

161
00:57:00,235 --> 00:57:02,757
I'm sure I have more questions, but I will.

162
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:05,280
Member Tapa.

163
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,441
Thank you.

164
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:20,113
Are these positions, the two site coordinators that are being brought to this role, are they already inhabited roles and are these folks getting promotions or are these positions that need to be reposted and reapplied?

165
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,859
That's a great question.

166
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:24,860
We're not looking to create a new position.

167
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:31,501
So right now, we have four site coordinators that work the duration of the school year, and they work part time.

168
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:42,184
And so what this would do would be creating two of those positions, ideally one at one of the title one buildings and one at one of the non title one buildings.

169
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:47,585
And that would just mean that they are now working full time instead of part time.

170
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:48,165
Cool.

171
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:54,123
And then, so are these jobs going to be posted and then those four folks are going to apply?

172
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:54,563
Correct.

173
00:57:54,663 --> 00:58:04,632
Or is it going to be that they're posted, but then the job is posted to the public with preference to the four folks that are already employed?

174
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:10,797
Ideally, it would be an internal posting where out of the four.

175
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:11,498
Okay.

176
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:12,298
Okay.

177
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:13,099
Thank you.

178
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:18,754
Any other questions from the committee?

179
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:27,976
Is there a, oh, Member Reinfeldt?

180
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:30,617
Yeah, just a little bit of clarification.

181
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:33,738
It's a little bit on the side here on the city year.

182
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:37,279
So previously, you said we're getting more city year people.

183
00:58:39,372 --> 00:58:42,154
Are those more people being paid for?

184
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:49,378
As I recall, we were splitting the city year, we were paying for city year partly out of afterschool, but not entirely.

185
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:51,459
Correct, that's still the same.

186
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,543
So, but these new folks that are coming in is exclusively on the afterschool or are we?

187
00:58:58,224 --> 00:59:04,207
No, so, no, correct, no, it is not exclusively on the afterschool, it's still the same split.

188
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:08,370
Okay, so our city year line item did go up.

189
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:16,253
No, we maintained the same price as we did last year.

190
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,294
But for more people.

191
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:21,316
Yes, they have more people that they are.

192
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:31,301
So I believe, don't quote me, but I believe that we had about 11 core members last year, and now we're going to have 15 core members.

193
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:32,741
Okay.

194
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:33,602
For the same price.

195
00:59:34,402 --> 00:59:35,403
For the same price.

196
00:59:35,423 --> 00:59:37,464
Oh, I wish everything worked that way.

197
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,431
But they're still being paid a reason.

198
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:51,498
This was one of our concerns a year ago was that yes, compensation was they're able to live or near Medford or Boston.

199
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:54,280
Yes, we did not go up in price.

200
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,802
It's the same exact cost as it was last year.

201
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,384
But I would say that.

202
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:13,020
I think that is a benefit to Medford Public Schools because we are getting it at a slightly discounted rate than what maybe other districts are typically charged for city year.

203
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:15,001
Great.

204
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:19,822
And then are we confident we will be able to offer vacation week programming for this?

205
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:26,223
Because I see those days in there and not that we don't have plenty of work that people can do for eight days, but

206
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:29,992
It is a goal of ours.

207
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:34,775
So I think what we probably would not start with the December break.

208
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:37,317
I think that's the one where we have a lot.

209
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:40,099
Yeah, there's a lot of families that have

210
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,591
vacation times and things coming up.

211
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:47,714
I think our goal would be to target the February and April break.

212
01:00:47,754 --> 01:00:49,795
That's how I was reading the eight days.

213
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:51,156
Yes, yes.

214
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,278
But I just wanna make sure that that's.

215
01:00:53,898 --> 01:01:00,122
And I'm very sorry, there's an excessive amount of emergency vehicles that are reporting to the high school right now.

216
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:04,145
I'm a little distracted and I might.

217
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:05,426
Do you know why?

218
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:06,647
No, I don't.

219
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:09,689
I'm hoping it's not the woods again.

220
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:12,129
Yeah.

221
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:15,956
I apologize.

222
01:01:16,697 --> 01:01:17,519
You can go check that.

223
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:19,202
Do you want us to do a motion?

224
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,204
Are there questions?

225
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:27,499
Well, see, I had a question, but now I'm worried that the superintendent may have to attend to that.

226
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:29,019
So my question can be asked.

227
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:30,299
It's just- No, no, that's okay.

228
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,260
That's okay, I can multitask right now.

229
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,000
Okay, so it's just a quick question just so I have it in my brain.

230
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:50,163
So for the two new positions being incorporated for the site coordinator responsibilities and the budget, the additional $47,500, have we kind of considered a little bit about how that'll be sustained in future budgets if the external funding changes at all?

231
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,803
I know that obviously you listed a little bit earlier

232
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:55,252
last year's annual calendar listed 200,000 in.

233
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,375
like in net.

234
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:00,116
So have you just kind of thought about that a little bit?

235
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:00,636
I'm sure we have.

236
01:02:00,656 --> 01:02:02,676
I just want to have a- That's a great question.

237
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:04,677
So I'm going to answer that in twofold.

238
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:08,398
One would be, we also are bringing in more revenue.

239
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,518
I mean, we've taken 53 people off of the wait list.

240
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:16,059
So we've also increased how much money is coming into that revolving account.

241
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:26,742
And then I would say that I have been, I did have a conversation with Andrew Mumford of Basic just to gauge, not that I'm jumping ahead, but just to gauge

242
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:51,949
you know in his estimation what is a prioritized position to be full-time and his top two are the site coordinator position and then the curriculum developer like the teacher that's really working on the enrichment activities for students and I really don't want to jump ahead we're just engaging in this consultation with him but just to try to keep

243
01:02:52,709 --> 01:03:01,534
pace for what we really do believe our Metro families deserve in continuing to increase the capacity and making sure we have the programming and the coverage.

244
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:11,138
Having additional time for people to just work on staffing and hiring and some of those logistics is real and would be helpful.

245
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:13,079
Thank you.

246
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:13,880
Yeah.

247
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,102
And does this take things off of our director's plate?

248
01:03:20,914 --> 01:03:22,996
It provides assistance for sure.

249
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:38,830
It gives her an additional layer of partnership when it comes to just the basic supply needs of the schools, the ordering, the hiring, the maintaining of staff and keeping communications with City Year.

250
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:42,973
Thank you.

251
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:44,214
No, thank you.

252
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:46,456
Is there a motion to approve?

253
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:48,538
Motion to approve.

254
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:53,418
Motion approved by Member Olopade, seconded by Member Brandley.

255
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:55,640

256
01:03:59,223 --> 01:04:00,824

And Mayor Lungo-Kernis-Epstein?

01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:17,484
Six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

270
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:19,704
Is there a motion to adjourn?

271
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:20,424
Motion to adjourn.

I can.

276
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:33,427
Yes.

Yes.

280
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:37,889
Yes.

281
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:39,489
Member Olopade?

282
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:41,549
Yes.

283
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,270
