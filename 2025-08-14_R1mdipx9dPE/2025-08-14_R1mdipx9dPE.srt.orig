[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

53
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:26,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone, we're back, we're recording.

54
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:32,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we've just returned from executive session.

55
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two items left on our agenda.

56
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is a motion to approve our paraprofessionals contract.

57
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:48,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just took this vote in executive session and we'll take it again here.

58
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:50,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a motion to approve

59
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:54,065
[SPEAKER_06]: ratification of the paraprofessionals contract.

60
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve ratification of the paraprofessionals.

61
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:58,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion approved by member Reinfeld.

62
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:00,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by member Locate.

63
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?

64
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:04,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo, can you call the roll?

65
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo, you're on mute in case you didn't know that.

66
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on mute and I don't have my camera on, I have no idea.

67
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's when I left the room, it must do that by default.

68
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:26,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, we don't have anybody who wants to speak, I see.

69
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:30,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Brantley.

70
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:42,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you call the roll, just in case anybody catches this recording later, I just wanted to thank the members of the paraprofessional union for a really collaborative conversation.

71
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: This contract, there's actually two contracts, a one-year deal and a three-year deal.

72
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:54,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And it includes the extension of the school day, which we've been talking so much about.

73
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:56,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with this contract,

74
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:01,993
[SPEAKER_06]: The paraprofessionals will be ready and with us as we step off in the new year, which we're really excited about.

75
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:15,160
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to fix some of the problems of practice that we see with our paraprofessionals around when they're being asked to cover for different obligations during the school day that are outside of their job.

76
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that.

77
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:27,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Where I'm truly the most excited about is the creation of some like some flexible time from our paraprofessionals to help us do the things that don't.

78
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:34,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Get done so consistently in the district today and, um, you know, I think we all heard from members of the community.

79
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:50,338
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of months back about the need for bus monitors, so this contract will allow us some flexibility to deploy paraprofessionals among other kinds of duties after school events after school.

80
00:49:51,238 --> 00:50:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, parent nights, those kinds of things, but also to be able to support our students on the bus while they're in transit when we have like hot spots or flashpoints in the year.

81
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:08,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all bus rides are created equal and we want to make sure that they're all like safe and welcoming spaces for students.

82
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited about all of that in addition to, you know,

83
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:25,204
[SPEAKER_06]: increases that reflect this committee's work to make sure that our staff all are paid a wage that is livable.

84
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:31,329
[SPEAKER_06]: We've made huge strides there over the last six years, and this contract continues to do that.

85
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to the committee.

86
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the paraprofessionals union.

87
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:36,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited about this.

88
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:46,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the people who are the most excited about this are the payroll office, because they will be able to process this without having to do retroactive pay before the year starts.

89
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone wins.

90
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:51,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to everyone.

91
00:50:51,588 --> 00:50:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And member Russo, can you call the roll?

92
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:54,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

93
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:55,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Brantley?

94
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:57,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

95
00:50:58,194 --> 00:50:58,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

96
00:50:59,415 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

97
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:00,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Antapa?

98
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:01,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

99
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

100
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

101
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:03,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

102
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:03,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

103
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:04,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

104
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

105
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:05,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

106
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:05,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

107
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:08,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Members say yes, and Maryland occurrence absent.

108
00:51:10,552 --> 00:51:12,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative one absence.

109
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:18,481
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is approved and the contract is ratified, so we will let the

110
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one more agenda item this evening.

111
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:35,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Galussi, I'm going to turn it over to you for agenda item number five, after school site coordinator positions.

112
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:37,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it away.

113
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

114
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try here to first just share my screen.

115
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:47,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you all received, I shared this with you.

116
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see my screen right now?

117
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:52,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

118
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:53,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

119
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:55,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on one second, please.

120
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:21,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have been, as this body knows, we have been really looking at trying to increase our capacity here for our after school programs.

121
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:28,623
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, we have removed 53 students from the wait list since last school year.

122
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:39,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we also, just as a reminder for people that are maybe just joining this meeting now, we are engaging in a consultation with BASIC.

123
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:49,513
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to one of the very first school committee meetings, present what that might look like, and ask for a vote for that to engage in that consultancy.

124
00:52:50,174 --> 00:52:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we don't want to be doing too much to our staffing ahead of being able to have that gathered data.

125
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:10,681
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we're bringing on a new track, which is an early pickup time at 4 p.m., that new track has allowed us to be continuing to clear space off of the wait list.

126
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when families elect for a 4 p.m.

127
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:19,844
[SPEAKER_02]: pickup time, in some cases it has opened up a 6 p.m.

128
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: slot that we can then fill.

129
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:25,325
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to keep forward momentum going,

130
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:30,942
[SPEAKER_02]: without going too far ahead as we're engaging in a consultancy.

131
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:45,374
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here to ask for the possibility of adding, which would be, well, increasing two site coordinator positions from the part-time that they are now to full-time.

132
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:55,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what the request is is just what it would look like in the budget, which I will talk about, which is a revolving account.

133
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,862
[SPEAKER_02]: it would just double what we're doing now.

134
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:03,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the positions would consist of, there's four site coordinators, one for each building.

135
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be for two site coordinators only that would partner with all four schools to just help out with some of the logistics.

136
00:54:15,037 --> 00:54:23,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Their year would be, there's a breakdown here, so you could see it would be 220 days, which consists of the 180 days of school.

137
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to add some school vacation programming to this.

138
00:54:30,641 --> 00:54:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for the before and the end of school summer programming, as well as professional development.

139
00:54:36,123 --> 00:54:37,803
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be working eight-hour days.

140
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,821
[SPEAKER_02]: $36.93 an hour.

141
00:54:45,782 --> 00:55:09,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the roles that it would be, another happy piece is that our partnership with City Year is expanding a bit and they also are getting into the afterschool game and we are getting five City Year employees that are separate from our core members that will be working in our McGlynn and our Missituck schools.

142
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:18,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those additional, so we are getting 15 core members between the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and the McGlynn Elementary.

143
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:23,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Those core members also work in the afterschool at the end of the day.

144
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to those core members, we are also getting five additional staff members for afterschool care.

145
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:33,835
[SPEAKER_02]: coverage at the Missituck and the McGlynn.

146
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:54,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of just help with a lot of these logistics in trying to increase capacity, working with our partner city here, and just assisting with some of the operational day-to-day pieces, it would be helpful to be able to elevate two of those positions right now to full-time.

147
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in keeping with the model that BASIC does use.

148
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day,

149
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:07,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just kind of highlight here.

150
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, site coordinators are currently budgeted to earn $41,277.90.

151
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:14,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And if these two positions are created, there'd be an additional cost to the budget of $47,504.

152
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:32,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I previously mentioned, the afterschool is a revolving account.

153
00:56:34,176 --> 00:56:37,018
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget can handle this increase.

154
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:41,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are here to ask if that would be a possibility.

155
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:44,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.

156
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:50,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt?

157
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:55,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this change benefits eligibility for anyone?

158
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:56,731
[SPEAKER_05]: What does this do?

159
00:56:57,993 --> 00:56:58,213
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

160
00:56:58,233 --> 00:56:58,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

161
00:57:00,235 --> 00:57:02,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I have more questions, but I will.

162
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:05,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Tapa.

163
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

164
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:20,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Are these positions, the two site coordinators that are being brought to this role, are they already inhabited roles and are these folks getting promotions or are these positions that need to be reposted and reapplied?

165
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.

166
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:24,860
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking to create a new position.

167
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:31,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, we have four site coordinators that work the duration of the school year, and they work part time.

168
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:42,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what this would do would be creating two of those positions, ideally one at one of the title one buildings and one at one of the non title one buildings.

169
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:47,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would just mean that they are now working full time instead of part time.

170
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:48,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

171
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:54,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, so are these jobs going to be posted and then those four folks are going to apply?

172
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

173
00:57:54,663 --> 00:58:04,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it going to be that they're posted, but then the job is posted to the public with preference to the four folks that are already employed?

174
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:10,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, it would be an internal posting where out of the four.

175
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:11,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

176
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:12,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

177
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:13,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

178
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the committee?

179
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:27,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a, oh, Member Reinfeldt?

180
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:30,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a little bit of clarification.

181
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:33,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit on the side here on the city year.

182
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:37,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So previously, you said we're getting more city year people.

183
00:58:39,372 --> 00:58:42,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those more people being paid for?

184
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:49,378
[SPEAKER_05]: As I recall, we were splitting the city year, we were paying for city year partly out of afterschool, but not entirely.

185
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:51,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, that's still the same.

186
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but these new folks that are coming in is exclusively on the afterschool or are we?

187
00:58:58,224 --> 00:59:04,207
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so, no, correct, no, it is not exclusively on the afterschool, it's still the same split.

188
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so our city year line item did go up.

189
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:16,253
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we maintained the same price as we did last year.

190
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But for more people.

191
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they have more people that they are.

192
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe, don't quote me, but I believe that we had about 11 core members last year, and now we're going to have 15 core members.

193
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:32,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

194
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:33,602
[SPEAKER_02]: For the same price.

195
00:59:34,402 --> 00:59:35,403
[SPEAKER_02]: For the same price.

196
00:59:35,423 --> 00:59:37,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I wish everything worked that way.

197
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're still being paid a reason.

198
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:51,498
[SPEAKER_05]: This was one of our concerns a year ago was that yes, compensation was they're able to live or near Medford or Boston.

199
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:54,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did not go up in price.

200
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same exact cost as it was last year.

201
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say that.

202
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:13,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is a benefit to Medford Public Schools because we are getting it at a slightly discounted rate than what maybe other districts are typically charged for city year.

203
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:15,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

204
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And then are we confident we will be able to offer vacation week programming for this?

205
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:26,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I see those days in there and not that we don't have plenty of work that people can do for eight days, but

206
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:29,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a goal of ours.

207
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:34,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what we probably would not start with the December break.

208
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the one where we have a lot.

209
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of families that have

210
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,591
[SPEAKER_02]: vacation times and things coming up.

211
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:47,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our goal would be to target the February and April break.

212
01:00:47,754 --> 01:00:49,795
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I was reading the eight days.

213
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:51,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

214
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanna make sure that that's.

215
01:00:53,898 --> 01:01:00,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very sorry, there's an excessive amount of emergency vehicles that are reporting to the high school right now.

216
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:04,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little distracted and I might.

217
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:05,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why?

218
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:06,647
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

219
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:09,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping it's not the woods again.

220
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:12,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

221
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

222
01:01:16,697 --> 01:01:17,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go check that.

223
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:19,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want us to do a motion?

224
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there questions?

225
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:27,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, see, I had a question, but now I'm worried that the superintendent may have to attend to that.

226
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:29,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question can be asked.

227
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:30,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just- No, no, that's okay.

228
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I can multitask right now.

229
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it's just a quick question just so I have it in my brain.

230
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:50,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the two new positions being incorporated for the site coordinator responsibilities and the budget, the additional $47,500, have we kind of considered a little bit about how that'll be sustained in future budgets if the external funding changes at all?

231
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that obviously you listed a little bit earlier

232
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:55,252
[SPEAKER_07]: last year's annual calendar listed 200,000 in.

233
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,375
[SPEAKER_07]: like in net.

234
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:00,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So have you just kind of thought about that a little bit?

235
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:00,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we have.

236
01:02:00,656 --> 01:02:02,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to have a- That's a great question.

237
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to answer that in twofold.

238
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: One would be, we also are bringing in more revenue.

239
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've taken 53 people off of the wait list.

240
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:16,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've also increased how much money is coming into that revolving account.

241
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:26,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would say that I have been, I did have a conversation with Andrew Mumford of Basic just to gauge, not that I'm jumping ahead, but just to gauge

242
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:51,949
[SPEAKER_02]: you know in his estimation what is a prioritized position to be full-time and his top two are the site coordinator position and then the curriculum developer like the teacher that's really working on the enrichment activities for students and I really don't want to jump ahead we're just engaging in this consultation with him but just to try to keep

243
01:02:52,709 --> 01:03:01,534
[SPEAKER_02]: pace for what we really do believe our Metro families deserve in continuing to increase the capacity and making sure we have the programming and the coverage.

244
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:11,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Having additional time for people to just work on staffing and hiring and some of those logistics is real and would be helpful.

245
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:13,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

246
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

247
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And does this take things off of our director's plate?

248
01:03:20,914 --> 01:03:22,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides assistance for sure.

249
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:38,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives her an additional layer of partnership when it comes to just the basic supply needs of the schools, the ordering, the hiring, the maintaining of staff and keeping communications with City Year.

250
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:42,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

251
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:44,214
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.

252
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:46,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to approve?

253
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:48,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

254
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion approved by Member Olopade, seconded by Member Brandley.

255
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:55,640

256
01:03:59,223 --> 01:04:00,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it turns out I am unmuted.

01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:12,274

268
01:04:12,354 --> 01:04:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mayor Lungo-Kernis-Epstein?

[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

270
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:19,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

271
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:20,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

277
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:34,728

278
01:04:35,548 --> 01:04:35,788
