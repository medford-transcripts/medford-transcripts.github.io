00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:29,655
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

19
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:37,833
to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,654
Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules.

21
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:42,654
17335.

22
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:47,615
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council,

23
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:17,703
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $250,000 for providing a cash match for the school department capital skills grant.

24
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:21,464
The balance in certified free cash prior to this vote is $8,604,329.

25
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:22,224
Superintendent Roy Belson,

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,141
will be on hand to answer any questions that we may have.

27
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:34,963
Mr. Bellison.

28
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:39,405
Mr. President, members of the council, good evening.

29
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:46,148
I'm here tonight with Dr. Heidi Riccio, the principal director of the Medford Vocational Technical School.

30
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:53,771
And she's going to go into some detail for you with regard to this particular capital skills program.

31
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,583
The money was awarded by the governor recently.

32
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,605
Contract was just signed the end of March.

33
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:13,314
And there is going to be approximately $1.3 million of altogether between the state grant and in-kind contributions from various vendors and others of their money.

34
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:22,480
But we need a $250,000 capital match to advance our culinary arts and hospitality program and our advanced manufacturing program.

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:33,253
If you go up the technical school now, you'll see that the old print shop is now being deconstructed and being made into a first class hospitality and restaurant center.

36
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:46,777
And you're also going to see the advance of the advanced manufacturing activity going on with robotics and engineering going on, things that were never really considered likely in a vocational technical school years ago.

37
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,998
Dr. Riccio has done a terrific job putting all this together.

38
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:59,221
We're very pleased that the governor saw his way to give us a half million dollars, and I'm going to let her go into details.

39
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:09,467
You have some materials that we've given you previously, but also tonight she's added some supplementals that she can discuss with you so that you have an idea of what we're investing in.

40
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,148
We think this is a terrific project.

41
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:16,270
It's going to advance our activities technically.

42
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,053
It's also going to help us partner with some very significant area individuals and corporations.

43
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:25,267
And we think it's one of the best things we've ever done.

44
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,448
So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Riccio.

45
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:28,468
Thank you, Mr. Belson.

46
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,330
Thank you, Mr. Belson, city council.

47
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,532
I have given you two packets of information.

48
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:42,894
The first is the part of the app booth were submitted as part of the application.

49
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:44,535
The first is the budget.

50
00:03:46,265 --> 00:04:08,189
And what we looked at with this capital skills grant that came out through the governor's office, I'm sure you have all been well aware of what vocational education is in Massachusetts, particularly since the Governor Baker has come in and has allotted over $35 million in the next three to five years for specific vocational technical expansion.

51
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,530
In Medford, over the last three years, we have increased our programs from 11,

52
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:16,658
to 20.

53
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:28,908
We have also eliminated pretty much the out-of-district tuition that we are paying out of Medford and two out-of-district placements as a result of these new programs.

54
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:38,216
Culinary arts and hospitality is the third largest industry in the world, second only to the healthcare operations and government agencies.

55
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:54,046
We also have Winn-Everett or Winn-Boston Harbor coming in that will employ up to 4,000 hospitality workers, not including the addition of a Marriott corporate hotel chain here, which is a boutique hotel that opened just last year.

56
00:04:54,766 --> 00:05:01,768
Another hotel and conference center that is opening up in Medford, including the hotel that already exists.

57
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:12,932
lots of different area restaurants, but in addition to that, being so closely situated to Boston, which is the largest convention center in the state of Massachusetts.

58
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:23,896
Because of this, we see a significant need to increase our opportunities for our students and make sure that they're prepared for the future workforce, not just the existing workforce.

59
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:29,618
The current space was built in the mid-1990s out of a first-floor cafeteria.

60
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:33,280
The space was divided up and sectioned off.

61
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,321
There is no window space available.

62
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,643
There is no easy access to the general public.

63
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,984
There is outdated equipment.

64
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:48,607
The tile is not appropriate for the kitchen of today, as well as the dining room.

65
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:53,470
The new space was written as a direct result of what those needs are.

66
00:05:54,507 --> 00:06:01,714
The space was selected as Graphic Communications because it sits on an outside area or quadrant of the vocational high school.

67
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:11,224
This means that there'll be easy access from the outside public coming into the vocational school to dine and have their meetings at our school.

68
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:17,430
There'll be no access to the rest of the building because the entrance will be directly from the outside.

69
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:23,323
As a result, we have applied for the $500,000.

70
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,504
Last year, we did not get awarded it.

71
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:29,906
We felt that it was important to go back to the governor and seek why.

72
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:36,928
One of the reasons is that we did not have enough or strong enough partnership or in-kind donations.

73
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:43,350
So as a result, we spent the last 10 months investigating who we can partner with.

74
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,492
The partners are situated in that two-page document that you have.

75
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,246
We are also looking at advanced manufacturing.

76
00:06:52,486 --> 00:07:03,712
And I believe February of last year, it was the city council that actually recommended, which I did receive a letter from Councilman Marks, to investigate advanced manufacturing.

77
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:13,617
As a result, we felt that there was a need to increase our opportunities for our robotics and engineering students and increase advanced manufacturing opportunities.

78
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:22,863
Therefore, there's approximately $89,000 of this grant application that was strictly and solely for advanced manufacturing equipment.

79
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:36,954
If you see on the second page, and it has all of our partnerships, I can certainly explain the partnerships between InKind and CashValue, if you would like.

80
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:41,770
In kind with Bunker Community College is the dual enrollment potential.

81
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:52,916
So we took the average cost of what a three credit course is, multiplied it by the number of students that potentially could take these dual enrollment courses, and that's how we were able to figure that out.

82
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:56,297
That's a little bit different than articulated credit.

83
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,581
Articulated credit is credit that students receive at the vocational high school just by being part of that program.

84
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,162
For example,

85
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:13,024
Culinary Arts and Hospitality has a state-articulated agreement with every community college in the state of Massachusetts.

86
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:23,973
Therefore, as a result of taking their high school program at the vocational school, they have an option provided they meet the criteria of a B or better to earn college credit.

87
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:28,850
That is the same in the engineering program as well as the robotics program.

88
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:37,733
So that articulated credit is a cost savings to the number of students that have the potential to earn college credit just by coming to the vocational high school.

89
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:52,019
When Boston Harbor, which I did include each of these in-kind and cash donations in the second packet has a letter of support as well as what those donations or in-kind services are.

90
00:08:53,942 --> 00:09:02,289
Wynn Boston Harbor, over the next five years, has committed to $525,000 worth of in-kind donations.

91
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,594
What that means is that Wynn Boston Harbor, because it is considered a luxury resort property,

92
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:20,222
They change out their equipment and services in linen every three years in order to make sure that they're providing exceptional service to their guests.

93
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:25,645
We will become a direct benefactor of any of the outdated equipment.

94
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:33,190
It's not outdated by anybody else's standards but when, as a result of the type of program and offerings that they have.

95
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:39,844
We will also have monthly guest lecture series programs for our students.

96
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:50,807
What that means is the executive chefs, sous chefs from the Wynn Boston Harbor will guest lecture to the high school students at the vocational high school.

97
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:59,649
In addition to that, they have guaranteed internships and cooperative education services or opportunities for our students.

98
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,470
The Labor's Local 22.

99
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:18,281
has donated the materials that it will cost in order to build the ADA compliant ramp that will be the main entrance area of our vocational school, which is at a cost savings to the district of $50,000.

100
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:27,167
Microsoft Corporation, we have three software engineers, two of which work for Microsoft Corporation.

101
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:40,916
When companies like Microsoft donate their time or their services to a school district, they can award financial equivalent to the hours of what they donate to a particular school district.

102
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:55,843
Those software engineers have awarded Medford Vocational Technical High School their equal salary pay for each hour that they donate to Medford Vocational School, which is five days per week, five hours per week.

103
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,202
iRobot donated a robot that the students are able to work with.

104
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,165
And Medford Public Schools, this is the in-kind of $75,000.

105
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:27,297
We believe that our students in the construction fields, meaning carpentry, construction and craft laborers, electrical, HVAC and refrigeration, and metal fabrication, should receive authentic learning experiences alongside the tradesmen that we will be hiring in order to complete this work.

106
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:35,998
As a result, we specifically put in our quotes that they have to be willing to work alongside our students.

107
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,879
We believe that our students will receive authentic work.

108
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:50,421
If you have been following us on Facebook or in the blog that Lisa Evangelista has, there are several pictures of our kids directly involved in this project.

109
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:54,962
So we value that at a cost savings to the district or to the city of $75,000.

110
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:13,482
We are also, through Bunker Hill Community College, we have engaged in a partnership through the Northeast Advanced Manufacturing Consortium, in which $48,000 is being given to the district in order to run this program and to pay for certain costs and materials.

111
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:26,828
The second packet that you have is labor statistics that validates the reason why we selected culinary arts and hospitality as well as the advanced manufacturing fields.

112
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:31,229
This can all be found on the Massachusetts Labor Statistics website.

113
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,512
The letters of support as well as the plan in moving forward and the equipment that we had submitted for approval.

114
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:56,354
We also have a letter from state representatives, as well as the mayor of Everett and the mayor of Medford, forging a partnership between the two schools for offering vocational courses or programs to students from Medford and Everett.

115
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,941
So at this time, if you have questions for me or- You should.

116
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:08,862
Councilor Scott Pelli.

117
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:11,750
Thank you, Mr. President.

118
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:32,420
So, a few years back, as a member of the school committee and myself and Mr. Falco, I don't think we ever dreamed that the vision that the reality that we are in today and the vision that you've led us with, Dr. Riccio, is amazing.

119
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,822
The thought process in my mind back then was trying to boost

120
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,463
the programs that we had in place, the automotive, the electrical, the other wonderful programs.

121
00:13:45,843 --> 00:14:07,512
But what you've done here now, the leadership programs, the partnerships with different businesses, communities, and unions, the collaborations with all the stakeholders, the alumni involvement, the thousands of dollars that we're saving, keeping our kids in our community, and the money that we were losing

122
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:08,815
at that time.

123
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:18,802
The sense of pride that I feel for what you're trying to do and what you are accomplishing is immense.

124
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,283
And you can feel it throughout the community.

125
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:31,831
Again, I had two more phone calls today from parents asking me, how can I get in touch with the vocational school where kids were not in vocational education.

126
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:37,455
They were in private schools and wanted to come back to Medford and wanting to

127
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:40,309
participate in the vocational experience.

128
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:58,324
So as this program, as this request comes in front of us, I just see it as a continued commitment that I made back then to try to focus on helping the vocational school be the jewel that it's supposed to be.

129
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,828
And with your leadership and the superintendent's leadership, I think we've done that.

130
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,731
I think this is just an amazing program.

131
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:14,415
I see the benefits in the community that I work in, not to knock them, but they have one wonderful program.

132
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:20,278
And they boast on that one wonderful program, and that program is the culinary arts program.

133
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:36,068
And what that program does for that community's senior citizens and residents, that they can just walk across the street and take the senior bus to the vocational school and purchase and have a

134
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:56,937
four course meal that normally they can't afford and to come into that culinary art setting and celebrate that and knowing that this is now going to be a reality in Medford and seeing the construction that's being done there and the access that the community will have there is second to none.

135
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:01,981
And as I told the director this week that

136
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:09,710
the only one piece of jewelry that they had on us is now going to go back, and we're now taking over everything.

137
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:32,242
And so again, when you're talking about money well spent, I think this community, and with your efforts, and the way you've spelt it out for us, only shows and reinforces how, not just financially, but prideful enthusiasm that we're getting back tenfold.

138
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,842
from our investment.

139
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,103
So I thank you.

140
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:35,903
I commend you.

141
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,865
And, um, and I don't care what anybody says.

142
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:42,528
Uh, no one has thanked me for bringing you to, to, to Medfit.

143
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,729
I think it was me personally.

144
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,972
I drove all the way to your home and brought you here.

145
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:50,714
So, um, that really didn't happen, but I appreciate it.

146
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:51,415
Thank you very much.

147
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,195
Thank you.

148
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:53,076
Councilor Scott.

149
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:53,917
Councilor Falco.

150
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:55,218
Thank you, Mr. President.

151
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:58,380
And I want to thank, uh, Mr. Bellson and Dr. Riccio for being here tonight.

152
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:03,064
I am very, very excited to hear this news with regard to the grant.

153
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,686
You know, Councilor Scott Pelley hit it on the head.

154
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:19,332
When we were on the school committee, we used to, you know, we had the folk and, you know, and I was always of the mentality of, you know, we've had vocational education in this city for over 80 years.

155
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:21,773
And we, you know, we should embrace it.

156
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,174
And we should, you know, give it the funding that it needs.

157
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,595
And if we give it the right amount of funding,

158
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,068
It's going to happen.

159
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,409
And I think we did that.

160
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:32,289
But one of the key components was hiring you.

161
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,010
And I mean that when I say that, because I tell people this.

162
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:46,993
When we were on the school committee, we hired almost every single principal in the district, because principals were coming and going.

163
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:54,414
And I thought that, honestly, I look today at everyone that we hired, and I think you were one of our best hires.

164
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,395
And I mean that, because since you've come in,

165
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:01,030
You know, you've really built the program.

166
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:08,435
You know, when you say you've gone from 11 to 20 programs, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any other school district that has done that.

167
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:25,546
When we talk about, you know, out-of-district tuition, the reduction, almost the elimination of out-of-district tuition, kids going to Minuteman, I mean, when we used to have budget time, we used to look at that number, and it was just mind-boggling.

168
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:28,124
I think it was up at around a half a million dollars at one point.

169
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:29,064
One million.

170
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:29,485
More than that.

171
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,665
OK, yeah, one million.

172
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,105
I'm sorry.

173
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,126
So $1 million.

174
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,747
And we've reduced that.

175
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:37,828
So that's a significant reduction.

176
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,790
And those dollars are coming back, and they're in our school district.

177
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,653
And I mean, the partnerships that you've built, the vision that you had, it's just been amazing.

178
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:50,574
And you haven't even been in the district that long.

179
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,115
So you've had quite an impact.

180
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,316
And you know, everybody you talk to,

181
00:18:54,883 --> 00:19:01,446
Um, you know, vocational, you know, technical, uh, technical, um, school.

182
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:04,668
I mean, really vocational education is the rage right now.

183
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:08,409
I mean, every, a lot of kids want to go to the book, go to method technical school.

184
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,553
And, uh, you know, the way I look at it is it's the best of both worlds because you can learn a trade and you can go to college if you want.

185
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:16,593
Yeah.

186
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,274
And I think those are valuable tools.

187
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:22,436
And, um, to come here with this news tonight, um, I mean,

188
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:31,067
To see that all the partnerships that you've formed and the in-kind donations that are coming in, it's just remarkable.

189
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,947
This is something that I support 100%.

190
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:43,649
And I think that the other thing you're trying to do is you're trying to build the alumni network, which I think is huge.

191
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,210
And I'm going to plug.

192
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,130
Yeah, absolutely.

193
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,010
You have an event coming up.

194
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:49,887
I do.

195
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:54,550
Well, not I, because it's the Alumni Association, but Musical Bingo.

196
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:02,575
So it's $25, April 13th, 7 to 11, at the Irish American Club.

197
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:06,918
And the prizes are pretty phenomenal, actually.

198
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:12,482
We have the Sheridan Boston, and I don't know if you know the hotel industry, but April

199
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:19,383
in Boston on a Saturday night is extremely difficult to even get a hotel room, let alone get one for free.

200
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:29,166
So we were able to get the Red Sox Saturday, I think it's April 27th, with an overnight to the Sheridan Hotel as one of the prizes.

201
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:36,289
We have probably about four or five different sets of Red Sox tickets and hotel reservations.

202
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:39,610
We have been nothing but generous and we've had

203
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,231
a tremendous amount of graduates that have donated.

204
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:55,994
We have, I know you're going to kill me because you have your Red Sox hat on, but whoever the Cy Young award winner was last year, we have, Cy?

205
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,675
I said it right, Cy?

206
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:00,252
Oh, okay.

207
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:01,834
So, whatever.

208
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:02,674
I know that.

209
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:06,737
But anyway, we have his baseball, okay?

210
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:17,065
So, we have a lot of fabulous prizes that are out there, but the biggest thing with the Alumni Association is that we didn't have a formalized association.

211
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,227
And we know in Medford

212
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:26,225
Because we have had vocational education long before any regional vocational school district since 1932.

213
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,507
So we're coming up to our 90th.

214
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,050
And as a result, we need to recognize that alumni.

215
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,632
Because often the alumni go, well, how can I help?

216
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:40,927
Well, this is one of the ways to help, is to join the Alumni Association.

217
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:44,969
All funds will be given to students alone.

218
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:56,015
So scholarship funds to defray the cost of tools, because as you know, if you are in auto tech, you do not get a job unless you already have your set of tools.

219
00:21:56,836 --> 00:22:03,540
So we want to be able to provide each graduate with a set of entry level tools for whatever program they're in.

220
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:08,522
And that's what the Alumni Association is really raising funds for.

221
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,502
It's not for all of us to have a party.

222
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:18,484
It's to directly benefit the students of the vocational school as they enter their field of study or college, whichever they prefer.

223
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:31,547
So before Heidi goes on a little bit, tonight she came down, she left school, left 200 members of the advisory committees, all 20, 10 per advisory committee up there, working on

224
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,423
doing additional contributions and the like.

225
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,504
How many people are up there now?

226
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:36,664
200 plus?

227
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:37,304
There are about 220.

228
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:37,724
Yeah.

229
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:38,925
It's incredible up there.

230
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:43,707
They're working up there, developing all kinds of ways to assist the school moving forward.

231
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:45,168
It's incredible.

232
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:47,589
It's absolutely incredible.

233
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,131
Hardest part is I had to trust everyone to do the job, right?

234
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:53,112
And so clearly, I trust them.

235
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,252
I can leave.

236
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,733
Because they're good.

237
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,014
No, we have a- No, meaning leave tonight.

238
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,235
We have a bracelet on us.

239
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:10,450
If I may, I just wanted to just finish up, I guess, by saying, you know, I really admire the fact that, you know, you never gave up on the grant.

240
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,073
And when we turned down, I think it was last year, and you went back and said, why?

241
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:20,756
I mean, that tells, you know, everyone here a lot about you and about, you know, how you work.

242
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:25,539
And it's like, I like how you have that, you know, never give up, you know, optimism.

243
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,859
And, you know, we need to push ahead.

244
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:27,840
We need to try harder.

245
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,381
We need to see what we can do.

246
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,562
If we don't get it this year, let's see if we can get it next year.

247
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,211
And I think that's important.

248
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:38,133
And I support this 100% and I move approval.

249
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,035
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

250
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,135
Councilor Longo-Carrillo.

251
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,036
Thank you, President Caravaglio.

252
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:45,757
Thank you for the presentation.

253
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:51,080
My first question was going to be the design, but it looks like we all got it in our packet.

254
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,861
I'm sure all the other councilors have seen it.

255
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:55,022
We got this in the packet tonight.

256
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,382
It looks very nice.

257
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,223
Both drawings are in the packet.

258
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,785
One question I have, maybe you could just elaborate.

259
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:01,585
I know it was discussed.

260
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:14,336
a couple weeks ago, Mr. Superintendent, but maybe you can elaborate with regards to, it was just said a million dollars was being spent on out-of-district, which I believe was Minuteman, but maybe you can just go over those figures.

261
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,137
For people out there that are saying, why the $250,000?

262
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,278
Do we have, you know?

263
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:30,745
So what you have is you have a situation in which if a school district does not have a particular vocational program, a student from our community could opt to go to a regional vocational school which has the program.

264
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,733
Now, the program that has absorbed most of our youngsters who have gone out of the district is Minuteman.

265
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:40,516
And there's some to Essex Aggie and places like that for agricultural programs.

266
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,017
But Minuteman has been the main thing.

267
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,280
And there was as many as 50 youngsters out there a few years ago.

268
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:53,744
And given their tuition rates and the like, with special ed assessments on top of it, we're pushing $1 million a year.

269
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:57,707
Next year, we'll have, what, eight people out?

270
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,649
We have eight people out, and the year after, there'll be zero.

271
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:08,733
There were no applications that came in from Minuteman this year because we have programs that can't touch our young people because we have the programs in-house.

272
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:24,242
In addition to that, with the expansion of what we're doing and working with Everett and some other communities that need a vocational program, we're actually going to be bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on tuition.

273
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:28,725
So the turnaround in a short period of time could be close to $2 million.

274
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:35,722
And that goes back to reinvesting in a school, because when you talk about technical education, you have to reinvest all the time.

275
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:41,726
And you can't just simply say, well, the equipment is there, and it's going to be there for the next 50 years.

276
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:42,607
It's not like bricks.

277
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:44,889
It's got to be the state of the art.

278
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:49,312
And we've got to be able to reinvest on a regular basis.

279
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:51,454
And that's going to give us that capacity.

280
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:57,839
It's going to give us that capacity to hire people who have a great deal of experience, rather than people who are starting out in careers.

281
00:25:58,579 --> 00:25:59,380
And that's going to change.

282
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:03,149
the entire way we look at the future.

283
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:06,109
So I think that sort of, I hope that answers your question.

284
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,230
If you need more, I can tell you more.

285
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,230
Just the AP.

286
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,130
So 1 million, we spent a couple of years ago.

287
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,611
I remember that during budget time.

288
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:19,453
And then what will the eight, just bringing that number of 40 or 50 students out to eight, what was, what's the cost difference there?

289
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:29,555
Well, the cost difference at eight students, probably a couple hundred thousand dollars, the most 150, you know, thousand dollars down from that in a year from now, that'll be gone altogether.

290
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:36,929
The other thing that's probably very significant is that Minuteman is looking to rebuild its facility.

291
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,872
They want to build a 628-pupil facility.

292
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,494
They don't have 628 pupils to put in it.

293
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,798
So as a result, the cost of that is going to be absorbed by the remaining towns.

294
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,940
There were 16 communities that were in the Minuteman district.

295
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:58,507
There are now nine, as seven communities opted to leave because they didn't want to be part of the capital plans.

296
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,873
that Minuteman was going to assess.

297
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:10,296
We're going to guess that some community is going to pay $40,000, $50,000 per pupil to go to Minuteman, because there's going to be a capital charge to go there.

298
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:13,418
And we think it's not a very workable kind of thing.

299
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,818
I think the state's going to have to intervene.

300
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:17,359
But in the short term, we're out of that.

301
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,340
We're gone.

302
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,783
Because they were going to get the ability to assess a capital fee on top of the tuition fee, which could have been $10,000 on top of the tuition, which would have gone up to over $20,000.

303
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,489
$35,000 per kid.

304
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:31,990
Unrealistic.

305
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,311
We got ahead of the curve.

306
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,151
We saw it coming.

307
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:37,592
That's why we were pushing back on the Minuteman issues a few years ago.

308
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:42,593
And we're also saving transportation, because we won't be sending youngsters there.

309
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:45,314
That's another $65,000 to $75,000 a year in transportation.

310
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:48,315
So a lot of positives in that.

311
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:55,076
And then, of course, the evening school programs that Dr. Riccio has started, bringing people in from the community to learn trades and other things like that.

312
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:56,877
That's going to be another major thing.

313
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:02,584
for not only revenue, but also to give our people a chance to gain the skills they need.

314
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:15,830
You know, one of the discussions about jobs and creating jobs is giving people skill training, because you can't necessarily protect an industry which is no longer viable in this country by just simply saying, let's hope it comes back.

315
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:20,012
You have to give people skill training so they can move on to the next industry.

316
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:26,515
And another thing that she's done, which I think is particularly significant, she's clustered and created programs so that you're cross-trained.

317
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:30,904
So if you're an HVAC in some of these other areas, you're learning multiple skills.

318
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:35,226
So if one industry goes south, you've got capacity to move to other industries.

319
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,027
And that's exciting.

320
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:47,392
Not only is hospitality, you know, the restaurant, but it's the back of the house, it's the front of the house, it's all the maintenance of the house that goes with it.

321
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:56,837
So it's a major, major industry that produces all kinds of jobs and allows people to move across the lines as they cross trains.

322
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,340
Thank you.

323
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:10,584
So on that, just in 2018-19 is when we expect zero teenagers to go outside a district, and that's when we'll be able to opt out before the capital assessment.

324
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:10,985
Right.

325
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:11,465
OK.

326
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:13,506
Great.

327
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:26,110
And then with regards to a time frame, if you do get, obviously, this money, and I believe you said it was 1.3 in total, what's the time frame for the build out and grand opening?

328
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,251
You want to tell them?

329
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,071
get ready, put your roller skates on.

330
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:30,552
Okay.

331
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:38,316
So part of the grant application is that the equipment is installed by June 30th, which is the fiscal year.

332
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:40,437
Yep.

333
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:50,403
So we recognize that there may be some incidental work that is going to have to be done over the summer months, but the grand opening will be in September.

334
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:05,162
I do want to echo the sentiments of my two former school committee colleagues with regards to increasing 11 programs to 20 and all the work you've done.

335
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:10,504
I see it in the newspaper and on Facebook, and it's really encouraging and exciting to see.

336
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,785
And it's the opportunities for our students that they didn't have before.

337
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:15,525
So I want to thank you myself.

338
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:22,807
And I look, you know, this is going to be amazing for especially those who want to be in the hospitality or robotics fields.

339
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,767
And I think that's wonderful.

340
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:26,726
Thank you, Councilman O'Farrell.

341
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:27,687
Councilor Nice.

342
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,527
Mr. President, thank you very much.

343
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:31,108
And Mr. Belson and Ms.

344
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:32,988
Riccio, thank you very much for being here this evening.

345
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,589
I just want to thank you for the job that you both have done on this.

346
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:39,570
It's been a long work in progress, and you've done a great job.

347
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,332
And I really think you're doing a great job in moving vocational education in Medford forward and in the right direction.

348
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:51,574
You've broken down walls, the walls between the high school and the vocational school, and you've built the bridge over to Everett now.

349
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:56,180
We built the bridge over to the casino, bridge to local 22, bridge to iRobot.

350
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,663
You're really doing a great job, and I think that this proposal's not only well thought out, but it's data driven.

351
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:11,761
And I think it'll both fill a void that we have here in the community, but it will also prepare our future leaders for the ability to be successful in our region's economy.

352
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,883
So thank you very much for the work that you do.

353
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:17,426
This is something that I'll support wholeheartedly, and I have no problem supporting it this evening.

354
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,228
I think it's a great job.

355
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:24,811
The amount of information that you've provided us this evening is terrific.

356
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:29,115
It answers any question that I could even come up with if I wanted to.

357
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,776
But this is something I believe in.

358
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,937
I think you've done an excellent job.

359
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:38,850
You know, when I was in high school, Medford High and the vocational school were operating in two distinct worlds.

360
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,792
And since the time that you've been on, Ms.

361
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,334
Riccio, we've seen a lot of changes in the culture up at Medford High School.

362
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:45,875
And I think it's for the better.

363
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,537
I think you're doing an excellent job.

364
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:56,343
And, you know, I'd love to see the look on Mr. Kelly's face and Mr. Rendazzo's face and Mr. Mahoney's face come June when this opens up.

365
00:31:56,904 --> 00:32:00,126
I know that the vocational director when I was in school is no longer with us.

366
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:02,108
He was a great person, Larry Volpe.

367
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:05,914
And I can tell you right now, he'd be very proud of the progress that the vocational schools made.

368
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,255
So thank you very much for your work.

369
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,417
And I'm certainly comfortable supporting this this evening.

370
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:11,318
Thank you, Counselor.

371
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:12,839
Vice President Marks.

372
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

373
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,263
And I want to thank the superintendent of schools, Mr. Belson.

374
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:22,465
This is twice in two weeks that you've been before us.

375
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:23,166
We're on a roll.

376
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:24,887
We'll see you next week, right?

377
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:30,111
And I want to thank Dr. Riccio for coming tonight.

378
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:32,052
You know,

379
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:50,930
For many years in this community, and I could speak from previous experience as a graduate of the vocational school, vocational education in this community was always the stepchild, and never got the recognition for a lot of years.

380
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,731
And when I say recognition, meaning funding-wise.

381
00:32:55,471 --> 00:33:00,853
There was always a lack of funding in the vocational school, and I think that's why we saw for a period of time

382
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:08,709
a mass exodus from our vocational school to Lexington Minuteman and other surrounding schools.

383
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:17,712
Because yes, indeed, we had shops, but as you just mentioned, they weren't equipped with the latest and greatest of technology or equipment.

384
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:23,594
And it got a reputation that, well, we have a vocational school, but it's not up to par.

385
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:30,457
And I can't tell you how proud I am to see what's going on in that particular school, how proud I am when I

386
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:37,372
open the local paper, and see our students being recognized for winning awards, statewide awards.

387
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,255
It's just a very proud feeling.

388
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:53,206
And with all honesty, as was mentioned by some of my colleagues, Dr. Riccio, you've really infused some life back into that vocational school.

389
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:58,170
And I'm glad to see that you mentioned advanced manufacturing.

390
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:04,013
That was something I put and was supported by this council back probably a year ago, I think.

391
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:07,213
It was in February of last year.

392
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:09,514
Right.

393
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:16,695
And those are actually the jobs that we're seeing out in the market now.

394
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:23,396
There are jobs that are paying 60, 70, 80 grand, which is not a bad starting salary.

395
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:27,217
And I'm glad to see that we're moving in that direction also.

396
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:35,380
As Councilor Knight mentioned, when I was at the vocational school, there was a clear, it was like the Berlin Wall.

397
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,082
You never passed a certain corridor.

398
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,462
And it was vice versa.

399
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,523
The high school kids never passed that.

400
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:46,405
And now we have a cooperative learning with vocational and high school kids.

401
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:50,107
It's just a great initiative.

402
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,853
that kids from the high school may want to explore and say, you know what?

403
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,495
Because I'll be honest with you, when I was in high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

404
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:02,798
And I thought a vocational education was where I wanted to go.

405
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:07,140
And I ended up going back to college and didn't work in the trade.

406
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:11,383
But I think it's an option that not everyone goes to a four-year college.

407
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:18,948
And it's an option that we can brag about as a community, saying we offer the latest and greatest, not just a vocational education,

408
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:23,417
the latest and greatest in technology and equipment in our schools.

409
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:35,024
And we're actually partnershipping now with the city of Everett, which will, I think, be a great partnership to infuse more money into the vocational school.

410
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:38,126
And I'm very pleased to hear about that.

411
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:47,471
I do have to put in a plug because I hear it over and over again from parents that, how come we don't have a plumbing shop at the vocational school?

412
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:53,392
And let me tell you, a plumber is like having a doctorate degree.

413
00:35:53,852 --> 00:36:00,016
They make their own hours, they show up at your house whenever they want, and they make very good money.

414
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:09,263
And I think it's a trade that really that I think if we did open a plumbing shop, that you'd see full enrollment immediately.

415
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:16,668
And not only full enrollment, but when kids graduate, they're going to graduate with a trade behind them that they can write their own meal ticket.

416
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:43,071
And not to say your other shops don't, but the plumbing field, to me, is something that I'm sure there's probably an expensive startup cost, but I think it would be worth its weight in gold to attract more kids to the vocational school, to an industry that, in my opinion, you know, I urge kids to go into electrical, plumbing.

417
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:45,012
They make an honest living.

418
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,273
They make a good living.

419
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:53,727
to support their families and there's plenty of work out there for a good plumber, a good electrician across the board.

420
00:36:54,647 --> 00:37:10,320
The one question I would ask you is that you mentioned about 100 students from Everett coming over and knowing the size of our program, I know we added another nine programs to our already existing programs.

421
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:15,885
At what point will we be compromising our own vocational school with

422
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:17,387
Medford students.

423
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:23,170
Do we have a number in sight that would say, you know what, we're not gonna exceed a certain number.

424
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:28,253
Will Medford students get preference over Everett students if a shop is filling up?

425
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,714
Maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on that.

426
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:31,655
Absolutely.

427
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:43,981
We selected the 100 as the magic number as far as what, with our current capacity, could we handle without taking away from our Medford students.

428
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,962
So 100 was the capacity.

429
00:37:47,003 --> 00:38:05,990
Right now, we are at 365 students that are taking advantage of vocational education, including high school students, and I think you all kind of went to school back in the day, and there are a lot more students enrolled just at the public high school, whether it's the high school or the vocational school.

430
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,551
The square footage of the space, which is 536,000 square feet of the complex,

431
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:18,829
originally housed a lot more students from an enrollment perspective.

432
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:27,172
So we do have the capacity to grow, but looking at the current numbers without really looking at where the need is, we capped it at 100.

433
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:42,397
We are also looking at doing a memorandum of understanding biannually so that we can make sure that it fits within the context of what we vision Medford Vocational High School to be.

434
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:46,508
So 100 is that cap at this time.

435
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:46,908
OK.

436
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:54,672
And this has always been another issue, community outreach with the vocational students.

437
00:38:55,492 --> 00:39:09,478
And for a number of years, it was stated that, well, we can't have, we can do community stuff if you bring something to the vocational school, but we can't have our students go out into the general population and work on projects because of liability issues.

438
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:17,481
And I'm not sure if that's something that you've looked into, but I believe our school would be a huge asset.

439
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:26,565
And I always mention it, actually, when we talk about different projects going on in the city, saying, wouldn't it be nice to introduce a vocational school?

440
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:36,649
Maybe someone in the metal fabrication would benefit from a learning standpoint and also from a community involvement standpoint.

441
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,145
Has there been any movement to having more community outreach with our vocational students?

442
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:43,566
Absolutely.

443
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:51,453
Ironically, it's the plumbing board at the State Division of Professional Licensure that makes it very difficult for students to go out and work.

444
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:58,480
But the other boards have been very flexible in that space, knowing that they are training the future workforce.

445
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,288
Vocational education is really founded on authentic learning opportunities, which is not necessarily in the classroom.

446
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:11,294
So we look at the community as an extension of the classroom.

447
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:18,743
In vocational education, I'm not sure what it was in Medford prior to, but across the Commonwealth, those community-type

448
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:22,008
projects are extremely important.

449
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:27,476
We also, though, have to consider what is the curriculum of that particular program.

450
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:34,646
For example, we no longer have what you would all call cabinet making.

451
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:38,816
It's not something that we are teaching at this time.

452
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:46,722
So if somebody would like us to build cabinets for a house, that is not something that we would do.

453
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:55,828
If you look at our standards or our frameworks, so that's really the critical piece is that it has to fit within the curriculum of what that program is seeking.

454
00:40:56,703 --> 00:41:01,505
However, just last spring, we did do with the community garden, build a shed.

455
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:12,008
So it's a grade 10 project because grade 10 would be a shed building project because it has the same concepts for framing as what a residential house would be.

456
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,569
We're looking at this restaurant.

457
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:18,391
Our students are using metal studs as well as fire rated studs.

458
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:22,412
They're working with the building inspectors within the city of Medford.

459
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:25,821
the ADA compliance officer, Diane McLeod.

460
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:34,487
This is as true of a real project as you're going to get, but what it will do is it will jumpstart us, because you're right.

461
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:42,593
When I first got here, we didn't necessarily go out into the community, and I didn't understand why, because most other vocational schools actually build a house.

462
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:55,466
in the community, whether it's with Habitat for Humanity or another organization, or they have their own non-profit foundation that buys the land and then the vocational school builds the house.

463
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,670
Our goal is to be able to do that long term.

464
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,774
But we can't do that with 12 students in the carpentry program.

465
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:07,676
So we need to be able to build the capacity to be able to do those larger projects.

466
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:14,778
In addition to that, there are homes, if you know, through EPA for lead paint.

467
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:28,553
Students cannot work on structures that have been built prior to 1970 without having a certification, a LED certified, EPA certified instructor in themselves.

468
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,534
So we don't want to jeopardize students.

469
00:42:31,914 --> 00:42:35,416
If somebody calls us and said, oh, can you do something in this home?

470
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,496
Or we wouldn't do home, actually.

471
00:42:37,937 --> 00:42:38,837
It can't be a house.

472
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,858
It can't be a personal residence.

473
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:50,100
But even if they wanted us to do something here, we would need to make sure that there's no lead paint in that area because you have to have a specialty for it.

474
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:54,782
But yes, we are definitely into doing community service projects.

475
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:59,703
We're also working with the Medford Little League and helping them with their concession stands.

476
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:05,205
And so we're hoping to build one this year and then one the following year.

477
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:08,846
You may want to tell them about the cooperative ed statistics.

478
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:11,625
Oh yes, that's kind of exciting.

479
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:29,640
One thing that when I first got here is cooperative education is a work training program where students in their senior year of a vocational school can go out and work in the field alongside as an apprentice.

480
00:43:31,247 --> 00:43:34,530
However, by law, they can really go out in their junior year.

481
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:39,735
So our goal was to not wait until their senior year.

482
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:42,218
If the student is ready, they should be able to go out

483
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:48,308
third term of their junior year and seek employment in that particular content area.

484
00:43:49,049 --> 00:44:04,643
And as a result of the hard work of our cooperative education coordinator, Lisa Berube, who came to us two years ago, she is, or Medford, is the fifth largest co-op placement by percentage in the state.

485
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:07,465
And that's pretty incredible.

486
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:15,451
But I will say it's really the support of the school committee and Superintendent Belson because we didn't have that position before.

487
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:21,956
So before I got here, we had a teacher that was expected to teach full time.

488
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:25,098
and go out and seek these placements.

489
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:31,642
And you cannot do two jobs simultaneously and still expect a different outcome.

490
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:37,426
So by hiring this person, she is out hitting the pavement each day.

491
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:43,690
And the jobs that these kids are getting are real jobs that are growing.

492
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,292
So some of them are making $18 to $20 an hour as 16-year-old students.

493
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:57,933
I mentioned the laborers, Lou Mandarini's shop has been incredible, training the youngsters in Hopkinton and developing things and guaranteeing jobs for them.

494
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:05,116
As you know, the construction industry is booming right now, and they're being guaranteed some incredible opportunities right now.

495
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:15,881
A couple of quick points on going outside, just to augment what Dr. Riccio said, is that we have to pay attention to Davis-Bacon Law, can't compete.

496
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:20,410
with certain kinds of activities out there, because that's, it violates certain laws.

497
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:29,194
We also have to be careful, because remember, a high school student can be 14, 15 years old, so certain power equipment that they use has to be regulated.

498
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:32,235
There's all kinds of child labor laws and things like that that we have to pay attention to.

499
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:38,658
So anytime we cooperate with someone or look for a job project, we have to all take all that in consideration.

500
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:44,701
And anyone who wants to work with us has to get CORI checked and all kinds of other kinds of

501
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:55,095
investigations to make sure that we're not sending somebody into a place where there's problems, whether they're alcohol, drugs, or, you know, safety issues and so on and so forth.

502
00:45:55,115 --> 00:46:00,979
So there's a lot of little things that you've got to pay attention to, but Heidi's on top of it and she's, she's been terrific.

503
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,243
And Lisa has been terrific as has a whole group of them.

504
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,485
They've really got a spirit of esprit de corps over there that's,

505
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:13,709
Just, Heidi, one more question regarding the enrollment.

506
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:16,694
What has the enrollment been in the last three years?

507
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:34,764
It's difficult because I will say by increasing the opportunities for high school students, if you were to look at the Department of Ed website, it doesn't necessarily give a true reflection of the student population that we have.

508
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:41,810
So if you were to look at the Department of Ed website, it looks like 265 vocational technical high school students.

509
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:45,533
However, we're also serving an additional 130 high school students.

510
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:51,080
that are taking advantage of career and technical education.

511
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:57,370
We also have to look at enrollment from incoming ninth graders on the district level.

512
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:17,869
For example, last year, not this year's grade nine students, but the year before, so our grade 10 students right now, there were 100 incoming, more incoming grade nine students two years ago than there was this year.

513
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:24,168
So the numbers fluctuate, so that's why I think it's important to kind of look at the percentage.

514
00:47:24,228 --> 00:47:25,689
What is the percentage of the kids?

515
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:37,152
So on average, incoming vocational high school students over the last two years have been 32% of the student population of incoming ninth graders.

516
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:46,234
It should also be noted too that next year, every ninth grader at the high school will explore shops at the vocational school.

517
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,438
So we've set it up as one of their options.

518
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:51,078
They will go through with that as an elective.

519
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,739
It will take some time to see a shop in a rotation.

520
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,959
We're working out the schedule right now.

521
00:47:56,979 --> 00:48:02,381
I'm not sure how many days or how many weeks you're going to put them in, but that's going to be part of their electives.

522
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:10,943
They have a chance to see that and see it from, for example, when they take something like biotech or environmental science, it just crosses over.

523
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:12,703
It just crosses over.

524
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,884
There are kids who are going to go from the vocational tech

525
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:20,255
MIT because of their ability to put it together.

526
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:22,556
That's great.

527
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:28,678
Again, I am so pleased with the new offerings and the advancement that we've made in the vocational school.

528
00:48:29,378 --> 00:48:36,561
And it's under your leadership, Dr. Ruccio, and the superintendent of schools who has come around over the last several years.

529
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:40,583
Let me tell you, he's really come around.

530
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:44,524
And you know, Mr. Superintendent, it was back in 1983

531
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:54,000
I was at the sheet metal fabrication vocational school, method vocational school.

532
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,861
And I made my first project.

533
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:56,862
It was a mailbox.

534
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:58,683
And I remember taking it home.

535
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:03,646
I put it up on the wall in front of my mother's house, where my mother still lives.

536
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:08,208
And if you go by there today, that mailbox, it's 34 years old.

537
00:49:08,889 --> 00:49:11,110
It's still hanging on the side of her house.

538
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,031
After 34 years.

539
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:16,353
So it shows you the craftsmanship,

540
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:19,201
in technology that came out of that school.

541
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:21,102
So I'm going to tell you one quick story.

542
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,682
I went to the Roberts Junior High School.

543
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:24,443
Never a quick story.

544
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:25,663
Well, what can you do?

545
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:27,483
I went to Roberts Junior High School.

546
00:49:27,523 --> 00:49:29,004
I'm going to read from a phone book next.

547
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:32,284
And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.

548
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:33,764
And I remember the name Ken Peck.

549
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:35,405
But he was well before you.

550
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:36,025
You're all too young.

551
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:39,686
And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.

552
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:45,767
And the goal was to make a game with a spinner on it, you know, a block of wood with different things on it.

553
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:48,379
And I invented the first mini game.

554
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:57,643
I could never get the block of wood to be square so the block could get smaller and smaller and smaller until the spinning just went beyond the wood.

555
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:58,423
There was no wood left.

556
00:49:58,503 --> 00:49:59,243
It'd take off, right?

557
00:49:59,283 --> 00:49:59,744
Take it off.

558
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:04,005
Al Johnson, who became the vocational director years ago, remember Al?

559
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:05,846
Al became the vocational director.

560
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:10,648
Kicked me out of sheet metal at the Roberts one year because he said, you'll ruin everything here.

561
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,290
And I never got beyond the lazy brown

562
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:19,905
Dog jumped all the way, the red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog and put me.

563
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:22,025
So that wasn't my skill.

564
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:24,706
Thank you.

565
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:26,886
Thank you, Councilman Batson.

566
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:39,089
And Mr. Belson, on my behalf, I'm coming up my 45th year graduating from that high school with a second graduating class, and who would have thought we'd see now what you have there.

567
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:43,430
And I thank you for your guidance, and Dr. Richfield for your vision,

568
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:49,276
Again, I go up there now, and I'm amazed at some of the things I see.

569
00:50:49,776 --> 00:50:54,580
And you're providing real-world jobs for these kids to learn for when they graduate.

570
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:54,960
Thank you.

571
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:01,985
Just one last comment, Mr. President, which is simply this, is that a couple weeks ago, I was here, and you voted to submit the SOI.

572
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,646
That plays into this, too.

573
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:07,149
There's going to be some incredible things moving out in the next little while.

574
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:07,810
You're part of it.

575
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,091
You've been part of it.

576
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:10,732
The whole science labs.

577
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,703
fields, other things that were done, all contributed.

578
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:30,136
In the next period of time, you're going to see something that you probably couldn't have envisioned because of people like Dr. Riccio and others who are investing themselves, bringing real talent to the place, and with real vision, and with real, let's say,

579
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:35,143
aggressive and assertive ways to get funding to augment what we get from the city.

580
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:38,405
So thank you for your support because you've been there supporting it.

581
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:42,767
We have to come to you for city money and we appreciate what you do to support us as well.

582
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:43,008
Thank you.

583
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:43,348
Thank you.

584
00:51:46,209 --> 00:51:47,510
We have, we have a, someone don't like to speak.

585
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,532
Name and address of the record, please.

586
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,934
Andrew Castaneda, Cushman street, Method, Massachusetts.

587
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:56,575
Great to hear.

588
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:01,089
vocational training for our local students in Medford.

589
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:07,874
As a matter of fact, it seems it's way overdue.

590
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:18,922
From what I understand, a lot of corporations that are here, the Raytheons and GEs, they cannot find enough qualified students, especially coming out of high school.

591
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:25,847
So I was kind of surprised to hear that the Minuteman bill was

592
00:52:26,502 --> 00:52:30,966
I believe the awards were up to a million dollars on one annual basis.

593
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:43,516
And I understand and I've heard for many years if it's true that some other communities send their students here, such as Everett and others maybe.

594
00:52:44,517 --> 00:52:48,440
And I was just curious if it's $20,000 or $30,000 to send our children to Minuteman,

595
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:55,677
times 20-something, whatever, became a million dollars.

596
00:52:55,717 --> 00:53:04,704
I was just wondering, if you put it on a scale, how much did we acquire by renting out vocational and teachers to other students?

597
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:10,569
How much per year and what that total was compared to up to the million dollars?

598
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,653
One other addendum, if I could recollect.

599
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:19,276
Yes, I recollect.

600
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:20,657
Thank you for your patience.

601
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:20,957
Thank you.

602
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:24,570
On the motion by- May I just finish one- I'm sorry.

603
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,150
Mr. President.

604
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:50,481
I would hope it would be automatic that in the future, even the present, that the Meffitt High School vocational school would be on a first term, first basis to satisfy all of our local students that live here.

605
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:57,885
before we start renting it out and charging and making monies from other students.

606
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:18,451
So to the chair, I'd like to know, on a scale of a million dollars, minute man versus how much we charged and how much per student we charge, and also if there'd be a guarantee that to make sure that our students would have first preference over any aliens that might come in from other cities.

607
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:19,251
Thank you.

608
00:54:19,812 --> 00:54:21,312
Mr. Belson, would you like to address that?

609
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:31,644
Minuteman, this year's rate was something like $17,500 plus $4,500 for special education.

610
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:35,945
That rate will go up and the capital fee gets added.

611
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:39,167
We project it's going to be at $30,000 in another couple of years.

612
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:45,009
We're using a rate that is around $12,000 plus $4,500 or $4,000 for

613
00:54:52,237 --> 00:54:55,859
special needs, plus an administrative fee of about $1,500.

614
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:01,141
So we're probably in the $15,000, $16,000 variety altogether.

615
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:05,403
So it's definitely a good deal for our neighbors.

616
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:07,984
At the same token, it provides us with substantial revenue.

617
00:55:08,844 --> 00:55:10,645
You understand the term marginal utility.

618
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:13,106
When you've got so much space, it's already paid for.

619
00:55:13,786 --> 00:55:15,307
Everything else is extra.

620
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,848
So, you know, we're not costing ourselves money by adding staff.

621
00:55:19,308 --> 00:55:21,009
We're just filling in where we could.

622
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,262
get value with existing operations.

623
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:28,626
Thank you.

624
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:42,236
Well, for a particular... Well, it depends on how many youngsters we have there, but, you know, with... Well, we have a hundred students, okay, in the building.

625
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:49,122
When that actually is realized, we'll be seeing a hundred times, maybe a million and a half to two million.

626
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:51,864
Hasn't started yet.

627
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:52,244
No.

628
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:55,806
I thought vocational students were already coming here from.

629
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:59,609
They are, but there's, they are, but there's, I believe that's true.

630
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,071
They are, but there's about 30 of those right now.

631
00:56:02,991 --> 00:56:03,552
There's a lot.

632
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:06,093
And will the Medford residents and students have first preference?

633
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:06,634
Absolutely.

634
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:08,695
Absolutely.

635
00:56:08,775 --> 00:56:09,196
Yes.

636
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:09,996
Thank you.

637
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:16,080
On the motion by council Scott Pelly, seconded by councilor Falco.

638
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,502
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

639
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,236
Councilor DelaRusso?

640
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:22,516
Yes.

641
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:23,957
Councilor Falco?

642
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:24,097
Yes.

643
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:25,458
Councilor Night?

644
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:25,778
Yes.

645
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:27,340
Councilor Longo Kern?

646
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,440
Yes.

647
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,881
Vice President Marks?

648
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:29,161
Yes.

649
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:30,262
Councilor Scott Pelli?

650
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:30,502
Yes.

651
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:31,823
President Cameo?

652
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:32,384
Yes.

653
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:35,626
Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

654
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:36,967
Motion passes.

655
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:40,210
Congratulations and keep up the good work that you're doing up there.

656
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,250
We thank you very much.

657
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:45,194
Motion by Councilor Longo Kern to revert back to regular business.

658
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:56,479
17, three, two, nine, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the city administration update the council on traffic improvements and pedestrian safety initiatives.

659
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,061
Well, I'll let you do that after I come back to that.

660
00:57:02,822 --> 00:57:12,527
Be it resolved that the city administration update the council on traffic improvements and pedestrian safety initiatives at Wellington Circle, Mystic Avenue, and the Fellsway.

661
00:57:13,107 --> 00:57:13,948
Vice President Mox.

662
00:57:15,408 --> 00:57:16,449
Thank you, Mr. President.

663
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:35,539
I put this on the agenda tonight as a follow-up to discussions that have been held by this Memphis City Council over the last several years, and also recent discussions about road safety audits that took place that were audited by the Mass.

664
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:37,561
Department of Transportation.

665
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:43,724
Some of it is regarding the need to update Wellington Circle

666
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:57,235
which we all know has been long overdue for many years, and some of it is because of the new Wynn Casino that will be coming to fruition within the next roughly year and a half.

667
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:12,979
I offer this, Mr. President, to get some answers on behalf of not just Meffitt residents that have to deal with the daily traffic at Wellington Circle, but because Wellington Circle is really the intersection

668
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:18,395
to Everett, Malden, Somerville, Revere.

669
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:25,199
It impacts many, many commuters, not just residents of this community.

670
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:37,386
It was back in 2014 that the state legislature approved $26 million, Mr. President, for transportation funding within this community.

671
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:42,949
And as part of that $26 million, the state legislature, in their wisdom,

672
00:58:43,800 --> 00:59:08,432
along with Mayor McGlynn, earmarked $15 million to look at a grade separation at Wellington Circle, which is an underpass that would go from 16 and 28 right through Wellington Circle and bypass a lot of the surface traffic that we're having now.

673
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:31,056
Not too happy to say that I'm not aware of one penny that has been put forward to help mitigate some of the concerns that we have regarding traffic congestion at Wellington Circle and the need for traffic and safety improvements at Wellington Circle.

674
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:38,959
Wynn Management, I'm sorry, Wynn Casino, when they submitted their application to the city of Meffitt,

675
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:53,879
mentioned that they were going to spend $1 million on traffic improvements in Method, including traffic signals, upgrades, and timing optimization at Wellington Circle, and a study for long-term improvements.

676
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,567
And I got a copy of the road safety audit, which was submitted by AECOM.

677
01:00:07,223 --> 01:00:10,205
which is at 250 Apollo Drive, Chelmsford, Mass.

678
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:17,069
And they conducted the road safety audit on behalf of MassDOT.

679
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:22,173
And the report was issued to the city of Method in March 10, 2016.

680
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:27,996
And if the council would just indulge me, it was a 40-page report.

681
01:00:28,797 --> 01:00:34,901
I don't want to read it all, but I would like to just go through some of the highlights that were recommended for Wellington Circle.

682
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,396
and improvements to Wellington Circle.

683
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:52,228
The background on this says the Federal Highway Administration defines road safety audit as the formal safety examination of an existing or future road or intersection by an independent multidisciplinary team.

684
01:00:52,869 --> 01:01:02,817
The purpose of the RSA is to identify potential safety issues and possible opportunities for safety improvements considering all roadway users.

685
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:15,026
The RSA evaluates the Wellington Circle intersection along Mystic Valley Parkway, Revere Beach Parkway, Felsway, Middlesex Ave, and Mystic Valley Parkway.

686
01:01:15,847 --> 01:01:29,211
Under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, a safety audit was scheduled for this intersection as part of the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency approval process for the proposed Winn Everett project.

687
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:33,092
It then goes on to say the project data

688
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:38,991
The road safety audit was completed for Wellington Circle on Tuesday, February 2nd, 2016.

689
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:47,355
The RSA for Route 16, Mystic Valley Parkway, was conducted on the same day with the same audit team members.

690
01:01:47,935 --> 01:01:53,257
The agenda for the RSA meeting held at Wynn Design and Development offices near Wellington Circle.

691
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,938
Method is provided within this report.

692
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,881
And the report goes on, Mr. President, to list the, if you would,

693
01:02:03,188 --> 01:02:08,412
call it, the top potential safety enhancement issues at Wellington Circle.

694
01:02:09,113 --> 01:02:11,275
And there probably is about 20 of them on here.

695
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:19,201
And they're rated, Mr. President, according to the safety payoff.

696
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:23,684
Is it a high payoff for the commuters and pedestrians?

697
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:26,427
Is it a medium payoff or a low payoff?

698
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:27,988
Also, the time frame.

699
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:35,072
Is it short-term, long-term, mid-term, and then the cost, high-cost, low-cost, and mid-cost?

700
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:39,773
And who's responsible, the responsible agency for seeing this take place?

701
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:43,254
I just would like to go through a few of these, Mr. President.

702
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:54,757
And the reason why I bring this up is if anyone goes by Wellington and up on 93, you'll see the steel construction going up for the Wynn Resort.

703
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:57,278
And it's on the fast track.

704
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:09,939
And I'm concerned that some of the promises that were made originally for mitigation and to our community are not being followed through.

705
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:19,981
And if they are, I'm not receiving any information on what's taking place to help mitigate some of the traffic concerns we have in Wellington.

706
01:03:21,621 --> 01:03:25,702
So traffic signal equipment installed countdown pedestrian signals.

707
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,241
That currently does not exist, believe it or not, in an intersection that size.

708
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:33,382
There's no countdown signals.

709
01:03:34,402 --> 01:03:35,623
Traffic signal equipment.

710
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:39,183
Review signal heads and replace balls with arrows.

711
01:03:39,824 --> 01:03:41,044
Traffic signal equipment.

712
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:45,285
Repair pedestrian signals from Route 28 southbound facing west.

713
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:47,246
Traffic signal equipment.

714
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:52,127
Many signals difficult to see, especially due to glare.

715
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:55,528
Install signal backplates with reflective border

716
01:03:56,068 --> 01:03:57,910
and add visors as needed.

717
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,071
Traffic signal equipment.

718
01:04:00,592 --> 01:04:04,175
Clearance time has appeared to be short for some intersection movements.

719
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:08,198
Evaluate lengthening the yellow and all red clearance intervals.

720
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,180
ADA accessibility.

721
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,823
Upgrade all pedestrian crossings to meet ADA standards.

722
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:20,248
One of the largest rotaries in this Commonwealth is not ADA compliant.

723
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,872
Not sure how that happens, Mr. President,

724
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:27,804
but it's not ADA compliant.

725
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:36,891
Signage, install lane overhead, lane utilization signage on all intersections, approaches to make lanes used clear to motorists.

726
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,574
You know, I actually live near Wellington Circle.

727
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:43,076
You know how many times I see someone come in the opposite way?

728
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:48,801
You know how busy that is, coming the exact opposite way through Wellington Circle.

729
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:52,544
It happens quite frequently, actually, because of the poor signage.

730
01:04:54,818 --> 01:05:23,830
Pedestrian and bicycle combination evaluate the feasibility for pedestrian crosswalk at Middlesex have where no crosswalk exist Pedestrian bicycle combination examine the feasibility of providing separate bicycle lanes along route 16 eastbound and westbound through the circle lane configuration evaluate removing Through lane on route 28 southbound approach to the intersection and add lane markings where feasible to avoid lane confusion

731
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,521
intersection geometry.

732
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:32,202
Analyze a long-term scenario where the Middlesex Ave signal is moved further north.

733
01:05:32,622 --> 01:05:36,063
Evaluate the impact on safety and operations on all modes.

734
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:43,625
I only bring up those few, Mr. President, because they seem like vital, important issues that need to be addressed.

735
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:48,887
And, you know, we've received a lot of promises from our state delegation.

736
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:53,048
I've talked to Representative Donato, who was instrumental, actually,

737
01:05:53,595 --> 01:06:01,437
in making sure that the state legislature did put in the $26 million back in 2014.

738
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,377
So I know he's been working hard.

739
01:06:03,757 --> 01:06:14,119
I know Mayor McGlynn asked for what they refer to as a bypass, which would be a lane separation to go underground.

740
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,280
And Mayor McGlynn asked, I believe it was Wynn Casino, for $100 million to do the project.

741
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:29,286
And I'm not sure where those negotiations went, but I think Wynn would probably be more than happy to pitch in.

742
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:38,193
But they see this as an issue that has existed well before the casino ever decided to come to Everett in this particular area.

743
01:06:38,613 --> 01:06:51,503
It really is a major infrastructure need for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, not just for the city of Meffitt, where that's such a crucial, crucial bypass to many other communities.

744
01:06:52,018 --> 01:07:06,004
So the question I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, I have a couple of them is, is there a commitment by Wynn to ensure the changes to increase intersection capacity will actually be implemented prior to the project opening?

745
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:11,206
So they made a commitment of a million dollars and other improvements.

746
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:16,348
Are we gonna see this commitment prior to their opening of Wynn Casino?

747
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:21,730
Question two, Wynn plans to have most of the casino employees park offsite.

748
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:40,922
and I've actually mentioned this in several articles that I read online, Wellington Circle is one of the major areas, I'm sorry, not Wellington Circle, the T Station, Wellington T Station is one of the major areas where they want to park employee cars at the Wellington T Station.

749
01:07:41,482 --> 01:07:46,204
Now if they have, you know, 2,000 employees, they're probably not all on at work at once,

750
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:53,081
You can imagine the impact to commuters that use a Wellington station and park their cars there.

751
01:07:53,441 --> 01:08:00,324
So that would be a devastating impact to the local commuters if that were to take place, Mr. President.

752
01:08:00,824 --> 01:08:07,107
Also, so I'd like to know what wind plans are for employee parking off-site.

753
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:13,210
And has the city of Medford requested wind to fund a long-term study for the circle?

754
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,871
So in addition to the road safety audit,

755
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:20,762
which was requested by MassDOT, and they complied.

756
01:08:21,343 --> 01:08:30,750
Has the city of Meffitt, on behalf of our residents and our infrastructure, requested a long-term study for the circle itself, Mr. President?

757
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:37,935
So those are the three questions that I'd ask for approval with this paper, and hopefully we'll get a response back.

758
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:43,919
And if need be, maybe we need to meet with DOT to push this issue, Mr. President.

759
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,640
Like I said,

760
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:48,978
It is a method issue, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is a state issue.

761
01:08:49,439 --> 01:09:02,747
I've been on the council a number of years now, and we've been talking about this each and every year for the past 15 years, about what are we going to do with the horrendous traffic queue up at Wellington Circle.

762
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:09,632
You know, there are times I come from Boston that I don't hit any traffic coming or going to Boston, but you know where I hit it?

763
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:16,893
Three minutes from my door at Wellington Circle, I'm stuck in 15 minutes of traffic in the city of Medford.

764
01:09:17,473 --> 01:09:29,656
And many of these concerns can be addressed with basic, basic needs, as I mentioned, regarding lane configuration, regarding traffic signal equipment, regarding signage.

765
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:32,437
You know, we don't have to recreate the wheel here.

766
01:09:32,924 --> 01:09:42,550
This could be done with, you know, just some minor improvements to that circle, which haven't taken place in a lot of years.

767
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,092
So I'd ask for approval, Mr. President.

768
01:09:45,112 --> 01:09:46,032
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

769
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:47,633
Council Member O'Brien.

770
01:09:47,714 --> 01:09:49,034
Thank you, President Carviello.

771
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:53,357
I just want to second the resolve and thank Council Member Max for bringing this up.

772
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:57,120
I actually work in the area, and I cross the street.

773
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,321
I drive it all the time, and I cross the street.

774
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:01,943
Today I went to Qdoba for some lunch.

775
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,295
Sometimes I have to run.

776
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:10,057
So if you see a woman in heels running across Wellington Circle, it's probably me in the middle of the day.

777
01:10:12,558 --> 01:10:17,900
The lights are not too bad, but it is still very scary because it's such a huge intersection.

778
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,941
And you're right that we've talked about traffic and pedestrian safety in this intersection many times.

779
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:30,544
I remember years ago bringing up pedestrian safety and making it more safe with regards to the lights and the signage.

780
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:34,511
And directing patterns, obviously that has to do a lot with the traffic.

781
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:37,432
I remember right into the state it really didn't go anywhere.

782
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:47,457
But it would be extremely important to get it done, especially where we are going to increase the traffic with the wind development and increase the amount of cars on the road and parked at the T station.

783
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:50,118
That's only going to congest station landing.

784
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:57,642
If wind wants to park at the T, that's only going to more so congest Wellington Circle and station landing with regards to parking and traffic.

785
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:12,792
So I really hope that the administration is on top of this and can keep the council updated on what initiatives we can take or how we can move forward to make traffic smoother and pedestrian safety more safe.

786
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:17,153
And I think those recommendations in that 40-page report hit the nail on the head.

787
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:26,435
They're small changes that can be made one at a time over the next several months to a year and make things definitely a heck of a lot better than they are now.

788
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:27,635
So I second the resolve.

789
01:11:28,157 --> 01:11:34,583
I hope that we do get a report back from the administration on this and we move forward on making that intersection safer.

790
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:37,485
Councilor De La Rosa.

791
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:42,630
Mr. President, I wish to lend my words of support and encouragement on this endeavor.

792
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,171
Thank you, Mr. De La Rosa.

793
01:11:44,692 --> 01:11:48,095
On the motion by Councilor Naye, it is seconded by Councilor Langel-O'Karn.

794
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:49,876
Name and address for the record, please.

795
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,518
Thank you, Honorable Caviello Presidents.

796
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,341
Andrew Kast and Eddie Cushing Street in Medford, Mass.,

797
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:05,086
And I want to thank Councilor Marks and Brianna and other Councilors for bringing up this situation at the Wellington Circle.

798
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:23,877
In my opinion, it's well over 20 years overdue that the state itself, I would think, should have at least put some bridges or tunnels, water permitting, et cetera, as they did on McGrath Highway and other sections towards Somerville.

799
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:27,075
Unfortunately, it has not been done.

800
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:35,979
And meanwhile, since 20 years ago or 30 years ago, they closed the Meadowland Drive and the Wellington Trenton Drive.

801
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:39,561
We have multiple apartment buildings left and right.

802
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:43,403
And we have Wegmans about to open.

803
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:45,764
We have Station Landon.

804
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:50,126
Then we have Assembly Road is probably only 5% developed, mind you.

805
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:52,067
I'm just guesstimating.

806
01:12:52,905 --> 01:13:00,407
And I think the casino's supposed to draw 17,000 cars per whatever, which sounds like a big number.

807
01:13:01,867 --> 01:13:11,350
So it's unfair, especially to these two counselors who do business or live in that neighborhood also.

808
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,191
And it affects my wife going to Market Basket in Chelsea.

809
01:13:18,212 --> 01:13:22,193
In the name of Medford traffic safety, however,

810
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:28,492
I saw Mr. Gav in this resolution, and I wanted to bring up something.

811
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:44,545
And in the name of Meffitt Public's traffic safety, again, I want to notify 02155 of two dangerous traffic locations.

812
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:52,251
Number one is at Route 38, which is Mystic Avenue, the old highway to Boston.

813
01:13:53,609 --> 01:13:57,110
heading north from Harvard Street towards Medford Square.

814
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:03,631
There's five lanes on that highway going towards Atlas Liquors.

815
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:08,071
And there's no parking on either side of that state road.

816
01:14:08,992 --> 01:14:23,034
And then the five lanes reduces to only two lanes directly across the street of 141 Mystic Avenue, which has a sign on that building saying,

817
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:25,433
David's auto repair.

818
01:14:26,674 --> 01:14:30,216
For lack of better words, it's a real goat's F of a situation.

819
01:14:30,236 --> 01:14:39,080
There's been many accidents there, and I've seen cars turn over, and I've seen people get into wheelchairs and not walk again.

820
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:48,945
So, all of a sudden, when you hit Atlas, there's an ambiguous sign.

821
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,947
Left lane's supposed to take a left onto Hancock Street.

822
01:14:52,627 --> 01:14:59,191
And the other lane, there's an arrow where it says only, but good luck if you can try to configure what that means.

823
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:13,418
And then there's also a sign where it says crosswalk, and it has a big, beautiful yellow sign, brand new, and it shows a crosswalk with two people, caricatures crossing.

824
01:15:14,019 --> 01:15:20,202
However, wouldn't you know, there's three vehicles parked on the right-hand side at David's Auto Repair.

825
01:15:23,182 --> 01:15:49,173
a dangerous, dangerous situation, especially when vehicles sometimes are doing well over 40, maybe 50 or 60 miles per hour, and a lot of them are outsiders, they don't know about that left onto Hancock Street, and it reduces, I repeat, from five lanes to two lanes, and all of a sudden there's three cars parked on the right, and they're SUVs, and you can't see over them, especially if you're a pedestrian wanting to cross

826
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:52,054
the old civilization to cross the street to 141.

827
01:15:52,694 --> 01:15:53,475
It's very dangerous.

828
01:15:53,915 --> 01:15:56,017
That's not the only one, in my opinion.

829
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:58,919
I hope we get resolution.

830
01:15:58,939 --> 01:16:05,744
I brought this up at the police station, at their meetings, and a couple of officers said they would look into it.

831
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:12,050
I'm not sure if it's already been ratified.

832
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,970
I'm not sure.

833
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:17,534
But the last time I was out last week, I did see the three vehicles still there.

834
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:24,833
Whether they're legally parked or illegally parked, I don't know, but common sense says you're looking for another bad accident.

835
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:32,156
The second one is also a dangerous intersection, and it's my neck of the woods in East Ford.

836
01:16:33,697 --> 01:16:47,223
At Park Street, as you're coming down Park Street onto Riverside Avenue, you cannot see over that left house on the end, which is number one Park Street.

837
01:16:47,787 --> 01:16:52,310
It has a corner wooden fence, which causes an obstructed view.

838
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:55,092
Again, there's been many, many accidents there.

839
01:16:55,533 --> 01:17:00,516
Some police officers have told me, good luck, because it'd be nice to get rid of that fence.

840
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:13,805
And I'm not saying to do it in eminent domain, but maybe you could ask the resident if they'd be willing to allow me to cut the top half of that fence down at my cost.

841
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:15,247
I'd be happy to do so.

842
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,268
Two dangerous situations.

843
01:17:17,642 --> 01:17:25,466
And the third one I've already covered before, and that was the Roosevelt Circle.

844
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:27,287
Was it Roosevelt?

845
01:17:28,128 --> 01:17:30,129
Yeah, Wellington I talked about.

846
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:32,570
That's the bridge that should have been there 20 years ago.

847
01:17:33,071 --> 01:17:33,991
Roosevelt Circle.

848
01:17:34,391 --> 01:17:40,255
As you're coming from Memphis Square, going on to Exit 33, it may be.

849
01:17:40,575 --> 01:17:46,118
But you're going towards that first rotary before you get to the Rice Pond turnoff, so to speak.

850
01:17:47,173 --> 01:17:52,057
But anyway, around that rotary, there's a lot of overgrown trees, it seems, that are wild.

851
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,939
But I think in the last year or so, they've been cutting them down.

852
01:17:55,299 --> 01:18:01,804
Another dangerous location, because they're really flying around that rotary, and a lot of accidents happen at that rotary also.

853
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,846
So I don't want to give you more than three today.

854
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:06,027
Thank you for listening.

855
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:07,948
Move the question, Mr. President.

856
01:18:07,968 --> 01:18:08,469
Thank you, Mr. President.

857
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,249
Thank you, Mr. Kessling.

858
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:12,612
On the motion by Councilor Max, seconded by Councilor Longo Kearns.

859
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:13,152
Mr. President, just a second.

860
01:18:15,843 --> 01:18:17,284
Councilor Monk, Vice President Monk.

861
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:43,854
Just if I could, because I think, you know, we have a number of state roads in this community, and I think it's unacceptable when we have to tell residents that may live on Elm Street or, you know, Mystic Ave or Riverside, I'm not, sorry, not Riverside Ave, Middlesex Ave, the Felsway, that because it's a state road,

862
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:46,763
There's nothing we can do to improve pedestrian safety.

863
01:18:47,383 --> 01:18:51,666
There's nothing we can do to the traffic signals because they're located on a state road.

864
01:18:52,307 --> 01:18:54,288
We can't touch your tree or your sidewalk.

865
01:18:54,889 --> 01:19:00,733
And I think it's unacceptable to tell a taxpayer in this community that we can't do these things or our hands are tied.

866
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:13,903
And I think we have to do a better job with communicating with the state, whether it's DCR or Department of Transportation, to, on behalf of residents, to get issues resolved, Mr. President.

867
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,431
I just want to make that known.

868
01:19:16,112 --> 01:19:16,452
Thank you.

869
01:19:16,492 --> 01:19:16,752
Thank you.

870
01:19:16,772 --> 01:19:17,273
Vice president.

871
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:20,756
On the motion by council mark, seconded by council logo, Karen.

872
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,438
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

873
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,261
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

874
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,003
Councilor Falco.

875
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:28,343
Yes.

876
01:19:28,623 --> 01:19:29,184
Councilor Nye.

877
01:19:29,304 --> 01:19:29,584
Yes.

878
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:30,645
Councilor Leclerc.

879
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:30,805
Yes.

880
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:32,027
Vice president Marks.

881
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:33,108
Yes.

882
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:34,409
Councilor Scott Kelly.

883
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:34,809
Yes.

884
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,030
President Caviello.

885
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:36,611
Yes.

886
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:38,813
Seven in the affirmative.

887
01:19:39,563 --> 01:19:41,644
None of the negative motion passes.

888
01:19:42,344 --> 01:20:02,854
17, 3, 3, 1 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, whereas the draft capital improvement plan has been changed significantly, be it resolved that the administration forward the Memphis City Council a copy of the new capital improvement plan or draft a new capital improvement plan within the next 30 days.

889
01:20:03,394 --> 01:20:04,435
Councilor Langel-Kern.

890
01:20:05,204 --> 01:20:06,624
Thank you, President Carviello.

891
01:20:06,725 --> 01:20:08,345
I'll be short but sweet.

892
01:20:08,565 --> 01:20:11,106
This is with regards to the capital improvement plan.

893
01:20:11,146 --> 01:20:16,348
It was a draft that we were given months ago, and it has been significantly changed.

894
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:29,793
So this council has spoke about it within the last month or so with regards to receiving a copy, hoping to receive a copy of the new capital improvement plan, or even just a new draft that we can review.

895
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:33,654
And I think that's something that's going to be extremely important before June, before we

896
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:37,828
start discussing the budget on the beginning of June.

897
01:20:39,629 --> 01:20:47,172
I noticed tonight in the papers that we had in our packet, there's another equipment request that's going to be going to the mayor for over $100,000.

898
01:20:47,413 --> 01:21:00,178
So there has to have been, between this and I'm sure many other equipment needs and other things that are going to need to go into a capital improvement plan, I'm sure it has changed

899
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:04,064
not only with regards to the police department, but in other ways.

900
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:12,187
So it would be nice to get a new updated plan or a new draft plan so we have something to go off of and we know which direction we're moving forward.

901
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:24,753
When we have that expenditure for the new police station, that's associated with about $20 to $22 million, which we weren't expecting until a few more years from now.

902
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:27,414
Now things are going to have to shift around.

903
01:21:27,474 --> 01:21:28,915
And I would like to know where the

904
01:21:29,355 --> 01:21:40,601
where the administration sees the city moving forward with regards to the capital plan and what is next down the line and how we're going to fit the fire station in and where does the library fall.

905
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:51,428
I just want to see what the administration has in mind and that we can have it in front of us and be able to ask questions, especially when we do come down to budget talks, which is a month and a half from now.

906
01:21:52,048 --> 01:21:52,368
Thank you.

907
01:21:53,389 --> 01:21:54,810
Roll call, please.

908
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,112
On the motion approved by Councillor Knight,

909
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,841
Roll call has been requested.

910
01:22:05,203 --> 01:22:05,963
Councilor DelaRusso?

911
01:22:05,983 --> 01:22:06,263
DelaRusso.

912
01:22:08,605 --> 01:22:09,365
Councilor Falco?

913
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:09,725
Yes.

914
01:22:10,566 --> 01:22:11,086
Councilor Night?

915
01:22:11,286 --> 01:22:11,666
Yes.

916
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:12,967
Councilor Hunter-Kern?

917
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:13,367
Yes.

918
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:14,748
Vice President Mox?

919
01:22:14,928 --> 01:22:15,268
Yes.

920
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:18,069
Councilor Scarpelli?

921
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:18,530
Yes.

922
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,710
Vice President Cabrillo?

923
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:20,050
Yes.

924
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:23,052
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

925
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,913
The motion is adopted.

926
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:26,434
Paper 17-336.

927
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:30,477
offered by President Caviello.

928
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:45,685
Be resolved that the Memphis City Council contact National Grid Gas to immediately repair sidewalk in front of 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway to the corner of Winthrop Street for public safety concerns.

929
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:48,026
Council President.

930
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:49,026
Thank you, Mr. President.

931
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:56,270
Mr. President, I think about three weeks ago there was a gas leak at 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway.

932
01:22:57,246 --> 01:22:59,268
And it lasted, I think, for about a day.

933
01:22:59,848 --> 01:23:09,176
And since then, there has been no repair of that sidewalk that goes from 2500 Muskegon Valley Parkway all the way down to the lights at Winter Street.

934
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:20,685
And if you go by there, there's no plates and there's nothing, and there's a couple of sinkholes there that are very dangerous, and that is on the path where people walk their children to school at St.

935
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:21,105
Joseph's.

936
01:23:22,106 --> 01:23:24,488
And like I said, I have not seen anybody from the gas company there.

937
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:27,365
I put in a call, I got no response.

938
01:23:27,885 --> 01:23:30,988
And again, I think it's something that the administration needs to do immediately.

939
01:23:31,008 --> 01:23:36,753
Again, because those sinkholes are getting bigger as the rain keeps coming over these next few days.

940
01:23:37,373 --> 01:23:41,336
If they're not going to fix the sidewalk immediately, at least put some plates there.

941
01:23:41,837 --> 01:23:49,883
So the parents, when they walk their children to school, a lot of the seniors, I see a lot of the seniors walk by, they're walking to Memphis Square, don't get hurt.

942
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:59,851
On the motion by council president Caviello, uh, seconded by council Longo current all in favor.

943
01:24:00,472 --> 01:24:00,592
Aye.

944
01:24:01,372 --> 01:24:02,012
The ayes have it.

945
01:24:02,212 --> 01:24:03,273
The motion is adopted.

946
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:13,236
If I could, uh, just from the chair, uh, we all received in our packet, uh, from, uh, correspondence from, uh, the city of method conservation commission.

947
01:24:13,756 --> 01:24:20,239
They're having a notice of public hearing, uh, in room 201 on April 5th, beginning at 6 30 PM.

948
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:48,790
Uh, the hearing is regarding the notice of intent, uh, electrical transmission project says end style electric company doing business as ever source energy has filed a notice of intent regarding the installation of a new underground electrical transmission line at multiple locations within existing paved roadways along Winthrop street, salt street and mystic Ave and beneath the mystic river, a portion of the proposed activity.

949
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:59,862
is located within bordering land subject to flooding associated with the Mystic River, the 100-foot buffer zone to Inland Bank, and a 200-foot riverfront area.

950
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:18,392
The reason why I bring this up is this is the issue that Eversource came before the council roughly, I think it was eight months to a year ago, and they're gonna be digging a trench roughly, I think it's two and a half miles through our city, starting at the Winchester Line on Winthrop Street,

951
01:25:18,892 --> 01:25:22,374
uh, going down salt street and then mystic Ave.

952
01:25:23,175 --> 01:25:27,658
And, uh, they're going to be digging, I think a three or four foot trench along the road.

953
01:25:27,678 --> 01:25:31,640
There's going to be interruption to people using, uh, their driveways.

954
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:35,883
And, um, it's a very important project.

955
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:39,005
And I think one that residents should be aware of.

956
01:25:39,025 --> 01:25:45,710
Um, I would ask, and I'm not sure today is the, what the fourth, uh, this meeting is tomorrow, April 5th.

957
01:25:46,750 --> 01:26:06,244
Maybe if the council sees fit, that a reverse 9-1-1 go out to area residents, alerting them of this very important meeting, which is gonna be a major disruption on Winthrop Salt Street and Mystic Ave, not only for area residents, but also people commuting through that particular area.

958
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:09,907
Motion made by Councilor Longo-Kurt, thank you.

959
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:15,595
Councilor Falco.

960
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:21,498
If I, if I may, um, uh, I, I would second the motion to, uh, the reverse 911.

961
01:26:21,558 --> 01:26:23,178
I think that's a very important issue.

962
01:26:23,238 --> 01:26:31,402
I just wanted to make, while you're on the topic of meetings for tomorrow night, uh, I just wanted to also mention that tomorrow night is a, uh, community police meeting.

963
01:26:31,422 --> 01:26:33,883
This one is at the West Meffitt community center.

964
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:35,483
It starts at 7pm.

965
01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:40,886
Everyone's invited, uh, no matter what part of the city you're from, but just wanted to, uh, let everyone know.

966
01:26:40,906 --> 01:26:42,486
So this tomorrow night's a busy night.

967
01:26:43,107 --> 01:26:43,447
Thank you.

968
01:26:43,487 --> 01:26:43,807
Council.

969
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:44,147
Thank you.

970
01:26:44,709 --> 01:27:02,856
So I seconded by Councilor Lungo that reverse 911 go out informing residents of the Conservation Commission meeting held tomorrow at 6.30 in room 201 here at City Hall regarding the Eversource underground electrical project that'll be taking place.

971
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:04,377
Councilor Knight.

972
01:27:04,897 --> 01:27:09,419
Mr. President, while we're making announcements, I just would like the opportunity to

973
01:27:11,547 --> 01:27:16,130
respond to the council relative to a resolution that was put on a couple of weeks ago regarding the street sweeping schedule.

974
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:27,757
Um, it's been brought to my attention through, uh, the mayor's liaison to the city council that, um, the street sweeping will begin on Monday the 10th and we'll continue through the 28th.

975
01:27:28,177 --> 01:27:31,539
It will happen from 8am to 6pm on a zone by zone basis.

976
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,621
Um, the DPW is established 14 zones.

977
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:40,705
It's also been brought to my attention that the Metro police department will be enforcing parking restrictions and cars will be towed.

978
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:46,606
Parking will be allowed on designated major arteries, however, and there will be no street sweeping on Patriot's Day, Mr. President.

979
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:54,828
If you go to the city's website, under important links, you'll be able to find out what zone your home would be classified under.

980
01:27:55,308 --> 01:28:10,851
And if you don't have Internet access, you're encouraged to call 781-396-5500, and they will be able to tell you what zone you live in and tell you when your street sweeping is going to occur so that you do not face the wrath of the Medford police enforcing the parking restrictions during the spring sweep.

981
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:13,337
Thank you, Councilor.

982
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:19,341
Offered by 17-333, offered by Councilor Lungo Kern.

983
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:31,428
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council announce the Medford High School Drama Club's production of Pippin, which will be held on Thursday, April 6th at 7.30, Friday, April 7th at 7.30, and next Saturday, April 8th at 2.30 and 7.30.

984
01:28:31,468 --> 01:28:32,609
Councilor Lungo Kern.

985
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:40,008
Briefly, thank you, Vice President Marks.

986
01:28:40,508 --> 01:28:54,960
It's brought to my attention that the high school students will be performing Pippin this weekend, and I think it's obviously a great addition to Medford and the activities that are going on this weekend.

987
01:28:55,921 --> 01:29:04,528
The middle school at the McGlynn School had Annie last spring, which was amazing, and I believe they did another performance

988
01:29:05,477 --> 01:29:08,119
About a month ago, which I heard was was great as well.

989
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:12,041
So I think that Annie was a sold-out show.

990
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:19,266
So if you do want tickets definitely Make sure you get those It's gonna be a great performance and I'm looking forward to it.

991
01:29:19,306 --> 01:29:32,935
So I want to announce it to the pop to the public Pippin I think it's like a pippy long stockings type of I don't sing so I'm not gonna sing one but Thank you

992
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:47,885
Sarah Grant is the director, and she does the middle school and the high school, and she does an amazing job with the students, and they work all year long on the set, and obviously practicing the performance, and I wish them the best of luck.

993
01:29:48,245 --> 01:29:51,326
Thank you, Counselor Longo-Kern.

994
01:29:51,546 --> 01:30:03,829
17.332, offered by Counselor Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the administration appoint a Civic Advisory Committee to oversee development projects for review of potential developments consisting of four units or more

995
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:13,720
and or a civic advisory committee per project made up of residents that live in each potentially develop developable area.

996
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:14,801
Councilor Lungo-Curran.

997
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:15,461
Thank you.

998
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:16,783
I'm president Carviello.

999
01:30:16,803 --> 01:30:22,868
I think this goes hand in hand with what the city council's subcommittee and council as a whole is trying to do.

1000
01:30:22,888 --> 01:30:27,312
Um, and we've spoke about it before updating our zoning ordinances, which,

1001
01:30:28,346 --> 01:30:35,651
After research that I did a few months ago, it seems like it's going to take years, not just months or weeks.

1002
01:30:35,711 --> 01:30:36,612
It's going to take years.

1003
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:40,755
And it's time that we as a community and neighborhoods don't have.

1004
01:30:41,556 --> 01:30:43,397
So I did some more research.

1005
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:47,240
And I always am drawn to Somerville because they do have a lot of development.

1006
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,402
And the people seem to be really, really involved.

1007
01:30:51,023 --> 01:30:58,008
And our people are starting, our residents, Medford residents, especially when a development's coming to different neighborhoods,

1008
01:30:59,227 --> 01:31:01,329
are starting to want to get involved.

1009
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:04,712
They want to be part of how the city moves forward.

1010
01:31:04,852 --> 01:31:11,137
And Somerville has a number of different committees, a couple that I have researched in the last couple weeks.

1011
01:31:11,457 --> 01:31:19,163
I know there's a Union Square Community Advisory Committee, CAC, and they oversee the planning process.

1012
01:31:19,283 --> 01:31:22,946
And it's something that helps the aldermen in Somerville.

1013
01:31:23,006 --> 01:31:24,467
I was able to view a meeting

1014
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:29,708
helps them decide where to go and what to do and what to fight for.

1015
01:31:31,148 --> 01:31:33,530
It's a way for the aldermen to know the concerns.

1016
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:38,993
It's a way to help the Zoning Board of Appeals in Somerville do what they have to do.

1017
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,134
These committees help.

1018
01:31:42,474 --> 01:31:43,615
They lead workshops.

1019
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:44,936
They run surveys.

1020
01:31:45,356 --> 01:31:47,857
They do mapping exercises.

1021
01:31:47,957 --> 01:31:52,800
When I was reading about it, it almost reminded me of what the Medford Community Coalition does when you have

1022
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:56,497
How do you see Medford workshops that they've had in the past?

1023
01:31:56,998 --> 01:32:02,922
And these committees in Somerville do this with regards to zoning, development, a number of different things.

1024
01:32:02,942 --> 01:32:05,624
There was even a, George may be able to comment on it.

1025
01:32:05,644 --> 01:32:16,692
I don't know if you, there was research that I did and it was with regards to how to bring in food establishments that are beneficial to the community and the environment.

1026
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:21,176
And they're light years above what we're doing here in Medford.

1027
01:32:21,196 --> 01:32:22,957
And I think this is a great tool

1028
01:32:23,553 --> 01:32:40,999
that would help advance positivity and smart, not smart, it would, in Somerville, grassroots effort, and it encapsules community values and meaningful decision making that I believe is needed in Medford.

1029
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:48,922
I know it was brought to my attention when I did my research, and then we also had a Medford resident who brought it up at the podium.

1030
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:51,443
I'm not sure if she wants me to recognize her name,

1031
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:56,123
a Medford resident did mention a community group that does this.

1032
01:32:56,903 --> 01:33:21,170
So I think we need to see who's interested and figure out if we need one committee to help or if it's a section by section type of thing, whether that be like a Wellington Civic Advisory Committee and North Medford, South Medford, West Medford, just so people can get involved and we can have community meetings that are gonna definitely move the city forward the way

1033
01:33:21,657 --> 01:33:34,163
community wants, the way the neighbors and neighborhoods want development to go, and I think it's an extremely important component to the City Council revamping our zoning ordinances.

1034
01:33:34,443 --> 01:33:42,067
We could spend days, weeks, months, years doing it, but we want the community involved, and there are people, residents, smart people

1035
01:33:42,433 --> 01:34:00,380
that want to be involved and that really have opinions and want to move forward and branch out and see where everybody else wants to see this city, how we want to see it developed, and what we want to see more of and less of, and just do it in a fashion that is obviously better than we're doing now.

1036
01:34:01,321 --> 01:34:08,864
Because how it's worked in the last several years is just, it's created uproars, it's created litigation that is unnecessary.

1037
01:34:09,892 --> 01:34:11,513
we need to figure out another way.

1038
01:34:11,553 --> 01:34:15,655
And I think this is definitely one component that will help in that a great deal.

1039
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:35,264
Another committee that I had looked into or did a little research onto is they have Union Square is going through a lot of development and they have the Somerville Community Corporation and a Union Square committee that is helping the city of Somerville just with that section.

1040
01:34:35,324 --> 01:34:36,825
So that's why I wanted to kind of leave

1041
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:43,650
My resolve open-ended, whether it be discussion with the council or if the administration sees fit to review it on their own.

1042
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:49,751
You can go have a number of different committees within the city or you could just have one that oversees projects.

1043
01:34:50,152 --> 01:35:00,674
There's four more units coming in that we have a committee that looks at the plans, goes over the plans, brings people together with community meetings.

1044
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:05,876
I remember coming in City Hall probably a couple months ago

1045
01:35:06,862 --> 01:35:14,507
And it took me three different stops in three different offices to get plans for a development that was taking place on Salem Street.

1046
01:35:15,047 --> 01:35:19,790
And those plans, they were there, I was able to view them eventually, but they weren't accessible.

1047
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,432
The city of Somerville has their plans online.

1048
01:35:22,872 --> 01:35:30,036
So there's just a number of different things that Medford's kind of behind the eight ball on, and for transparency purposes, is needed in Medford.

1049
01:35:30,456 --> 01:35:34,459
And I hope my council colleagues support this, and I hope the administration

1050
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:42,980
takes an active look and implements some sort of civic advisory committee, whether that be one or many, to help move the city forward.

1051
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:44,821
Thank you, Councillor Longo-Kearns.

1052
01:35:45,502 --> 01:35:49,945
On the motion by Councillor Longo-Kearns, name and address of the record, please.

1053
01:35:50,865 --> 01:35:53,166
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1054
01:35:53,766 --> 01:35:55,746
I'm a future candidate for the City Council.

1055
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:59,927
My involvement in the city came to the public because of development.

1056
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:09,870
I had seen the for sale sign on Salem Street at the Break Pro and I started coming into City Hall to see what was happening and accidentally stumbled upon the Locust Street plan.

1057
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:17,171
I think a lot of citizens would just really be happy if we knew about these things before they were in the final stage.

1058
01:36:17,832 --> 01:36:18,932
The Locust Street project,

1059
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:21,474
I went to the zoning board meeting.

1060
01:36:21,514 --> 01:36:32,569
That was pretty much when we saw how this project was going to take place from a supermarket to a 490 unit apartment building, which is now in litigation because they didn't seek community input.

1061
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:35,694
The community had no idea that this project was coming to being until

1062
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:43,130
Citizens started posting on Facebook and alerting people and encouraging them to come to City Hall and Yahoo groups.

1063
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:47,652
If this committee was able to even just let people know that this is coming.

1064
01:36:48,192 --> 01:36:55,275
I live on Park Street and have lived there for more than a decade and I didn't know that condo development was coming up.

1065
01:36:55,715 --> 01:37:00,058
at 179 Park Street until it had already started to be built.

1066
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:01,359
I had never heard of it.

1067
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:11,127
A lot of people that live on my street had no idea that there was even a Salem Street project being discussed because we're not within that 300 feet, even though that will impact us.

1068
01:37:11,547 --> 01:37:20,814
The parents at the school that is the Roberts Elementary School that is kitty corner to this project didn't know about it until it started to be posted on Facebook.

1069
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:24,897
If nothing else, if we can get people to know what is happening,

1070
01:37:25,253 --> 01:37:36,160
so that we can understand what the downfalls will be, what the benefits will be, the cost analysis, the impact on the schools, the impact on traffic, on parking.

1071
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,383
These things are all important to us as Medford residents, and we need to know.

1072
01:37:40,463 --> 01:37:51,572
Just today on Facebook, there's a property that's being listed as a 1,900 unit house, a 1,900 square foot house with three bedrooms and two baths.

1073
01:37:52,052 --> 01:37:53,493
It's for sale for $1 million.

1074
01:37:53,794 --> 01:37:59,098
And the listing says, the home and garage are in average to good condition, need updating and rehab work.

1075
01:37:59,418 --> 01:38:01,480
However, this property is all about the land.

1076
01:38:02,828 --> 01:38:09,412
The potential to build, Sella does not guarantee this, although any potential buyer should perform due diligence on the potential of this lot.

1077
01:38:09,973 --> 01:38:20,160
So we're encouraging developers to come and look at this property that's in a single family zoned area and they're telling them that you can probably build several units here.

1078
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:29,266
The community needs to be aware of this and we need to be watchful because nobody wants to find out when the ground is being broken on their street because they're outside

1079
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:42,449
that 300-foot area, that there's now going to be five families living 10 houses away that may have 10 to 12 more cars that will be on the street because we're giving parking variances.

1080
01:38:42,889 --> 01:38:47,850
So this is something that's very important to the community as a whole, and I hope that you'll follow up on this.

1081
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:48,730
Thank you.

1082
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:49,270
Thank you.

1083
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:56,952
On the motion by Councilor Longo and seconded by Councilor Falco, roll call vote has been requested.

1084
01:38:57,012 --> 01:38:57,532
Mr. Clerk?

1085
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,000
Vice President Marks.

1086
01:39:01,641 --> 01:39:02,602
Thank you, Mr. President.

1087
01:39:02,902 --> 01:39:04,482
I think this is a good resolve.

1088
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:16,628
Any way we can outreach to the community and make sure that residents have ample notice, whether they want to support or go against a project, I think is a step in the right direction.

1089
01:39:17,488 --> 01:39:20,809
I still think that we can write this within our zoning ordinance.

1090
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:28,753
So, as was mentioned by Cheryl, about the 300-foot buffer that we have to notify residents, we, as a council,

1091
01:39:29,127 --> 01:39:35,833
can require 500 feet, 1,000 feet through our zoning ordinance, Mr. President.

1092
01:39:36,273 --> 01:39:45,220
And we can also, through our zoning ordinance, I believe, set up community advisory committees that require projects to go through particular committees.

1093
01:39:45,561 --> 01:39:53,547
I think it's a very good idea if you want to have committees set up in each neighborhood or one central committee that would cover the entire city.

1094
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:57,751
But this is definitely a worthy resolve

1095
01:39:58,172 --> 01:39:59,412
And I support it wholeheartedly.

1096
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:00,953
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1097
01:40:01,273 --> 01:40:02,693
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1098
01:40:04,114 --> 01:40:05,194
Councilor DelaRusso?

1099
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:09,456
No.

1100
01:40:10,936 --> 01:40:11,736
Councilor Falco?

1101
01:40:11,816 --> 01:40:12,037
Yes.

1102
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:13,577
Councilor Nye?

1103
01:40:13,677 --> 01:40:13,857
No.

1104
01:40:14,837 --> 01:40:15,678
Councilor Long and Kern?

1105
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:15,858
Yes.

1106
01:40:16,658 --> 01:40:17,378
Vice President Marks?

1107
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:18,399
Yes.

1108
01:40:18,999 --> 01:40:19,819
Councilor Starpelli?

1109
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:20,139
Yes.

1110
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:21,740
President Cavielli?

1111
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,220
Yes.

1112
01:40:24,598 --> 01:40:26,660
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1113
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:30,302
Motion passes.

1114
01:40:31,143 --> 01:40:50,178
17334, offered by Council Member Kern, be it resolved that Brittany Lanzilli be congratulated on her UU Women's National University team's bronze medal win at the 2017 Winter World University Games in Alamie, Kaskanigan.

1115
01:40:52,624 --> 01:40:57,667
Kaskanikin, Kastanistan, Kazakhstan on February 8.

1116
01:40:58,448 --> 01:40:59,588
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1117
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:03,251
Thank you, President Carviello.

1118
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:06,072
I know that's a tough word.

1119
01:41:07,433 --> 01:41:09,054
I wanted to put this forward.

1120
01:41:09,094 --> 01:41:20,982
It seems like every few months we're congratulating Brittany Lanzilli or somebody from the Lanzilli family, but I don't think it cannot be done because of the accomplishments that she's achieved.

1121
01:41:22,063 --> 01:41:22,923
at her young age.

1122
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:33,067
She was one of the original families that helped start a women's girls hockey team at the high school and ever since her career has just taken off.

1123
01:41:33,868 --> 01:41:48,293
So we're so proud to have her here in Medford and we want to congratulate her on all her accomplishments and she's led the way for female athletes in general but young female hockey players that she's their role model and

1124
01:41:48,944 --> 01:41:57,468
Um, it's just, it's just wonderful to see her at the, in the front page of the sports section of the Medford transcript and read about her on a, I mean monthly basis.

1125
01:41:57,608 --> 01:42:02,751
So I just want to congratulate her and her family and just wonderful work.

1126
01:42:03,571 --> 01:42:04,352
Councilor Scott Pelley.

1127
01:42:04,892 --> 01:42:09,294
I, uh, thank, uh, Councilor, uh, Brianna Longo-Curran for bringing this forward.

1128
01:42:09,834 --> 01:42:13,596
Brittany's, uh, been a superstar and, uh, she should be celebrated.

1129
01:42:13,676 --> 01:42:16,678
So I, uh, appreciate this, um,

1130
01:42:17,822 --> 01:42:24,864
this resolution, but I wanted to mention that I believe her father, Kenny, is now an ambassador in Kazakhstan.

1131
01:42:25,844 --> 01:42:32,226
He's made such an impact in that country, I believe they want him to come back, and he's just an amazing person.

1132
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:33,926
So, congratulations.

1133
01:42:34,687 --> 01:42:35,167
Thank you.

1134
01:42:35,187 --> 01:42:35,687
Thank you, Counselor.

1135
01:42:36,227 --> 01:42:36,807
Counselor Knight.

1136
01:42:37,788 --> 01:42:39,848
Mr. President, I second the motion for approval.

1137
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:42,529
I wanted to congratulate the Lanzilli family as well.

1138
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:59,739
that we've had Brittany up here a number of times now, from her days playing in Medford High, where she was a top goal scorer, to her All-Scholastic selection two years in a row, now to her placement on the World National Team, and now coming back home with her bronze medal.

1139
01:42:59,759 --> 01:43:03,261
So, Mr. President, it's great to have someone in this community that so many people can look up to.

1140
01:43:03,821 --> 01:43:06,022
She comes from a great family, and I wish her the best of luck.

1141
01:43:06,502 --> 01:43:12,785
And I want to thank her for representing Medford, Mass., and the United States of America with dignity and pride overseas, Mr. President.

1142
01:43:13,736 --> 01:43:14,456
Thank you, Counselor.

1143
01:43:14,476 --> 01:43:19,178
Maybe we can invite her up here with her bronze medal for a citation in the near future.

1144
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:22,158
Counselor Knight.

1145
01:43:23,059 --> 01:43:26,960
She is a student first, and she's out there at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, so.

1146
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:36,142
Okay, well, when she's back sometime on a break, if we can invite her up here, it would be nice, with the bronze medal, it would be nice for everybody to see.

1147
01:43:37,423 --> 01:43:38,463
And her dad, too.

1148
01:43:38,483 --> 01:43:38,763
And her dad.

1149
01:43:38,783 --> 01:43:41,104
He lands the other families a good family.

1150
01:43:42,284 --> 01:43:42,584
Thank you.

1151
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:54,148
17339, offered by President Caraviello, being resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of Arthur Ford on his recent passing.

1152
01:43:54,168 --> 01:43:58,811
Mr. Ford was an Army veteran who served his country in World War II.

1153
01:43:59,591 --> 01:44:02,753
His presence in our community will be missed.

1154
01:44:04,034 --> 01:44:06,456
If we could rise for a moment of silence for Mr. Ford.

1155
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:23,568
Motion for suspension by Councilor Knight.

1156
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:39,894
Offered by Councilor DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of longtime DPW worker, Philip Genta, who passed away recently.

1157
01:44:41,674 --> 01:44:42,234
Councilor Knight.

1158
01:44:43,395 --> 01:44:45,736
This is actually Councilor DelaRusso's resolution.

1159
01:44:46,136 --> 01:44:46,956
Oh, sorry.

1160
01:44:47,476 --> 01:44:48,236
Councilor DelaRusso.

1161
01:44:48,717 --> 01:44:49,757
Thank you, Mr. President.

1162
01:44:50,736 --> 01:44:55,677
Phil Jones worked for the city in the DPW for a good 30 years.

1163
01:44:56,418 --> 01:45:11,782
He's a Korean War veteran, a devoted husband and father, a great guy who had a good time in life, was devoted to his sons, his family, his grandchildren, a good husband, and a decent man.

1164
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:13,342
We lost a good man.

1165
01:45:14,563 --> 01:45:16,023
Thank you, Mr. Councilor DelaRusso.

1166
01:45:16,063 --> 01:45:16,803
Councilor Scapelli.

1167
01:45:17,203 --> 01:45:19,164
Thank you for, Councilor DelaRusso, bringing this

1168
01:45:19,829 --> 01:45:20,610
Resolution forward.

1169
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:21,991
Mr. Junta was a great man.

1170
01:45:22,011 --> 01:45:24,733
I know his sons well, and he'll be missed.

1171
01:45:25,233 --> 01:45:25,493
Thank you.

1172
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:42,246
If we could please rise for a moment of silence.

1173
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:46,629
If we can, I just want to just mention this weekend,

1174
01:45:48,118 --> 01:46:02,111
The Crystal Campbell scholarship presentation for the marathon team celebration for Crystal Campbell's scholarships will be given out this Saturday, April 8th from noon to 2.

1175
01:46:02,972 --> 01:46:10,840
If people would like to join us for a luncheon inside the Meffitt Senior Center, followed by a gathering at the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden,

1176
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,441
We're located at 101 Riverside Avenue here in Medford.

1177
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:25,449
So if everybody, my fellow councilors and the viewing public, if they, it's a great cause with the marathon, the anniversary of our marathon coming up.

1178
01:46:27,203 --> 01:46:40,832
such a tragic event, and this event celebrates when something really terrible happens, how great people rally around a cause and present scholarships in the name of Crystal Campbell.

1179
01:46:40,872 --> 01:46:42,533
So I think it's very important.

1180
01:46:43,214 --> 01:46:47,617
And if anyone would like to join me, I'll be there.

1181
01:46:47,697 --> 01:46:48,537
So thank you very much.

1182
01:46:48,698 --> 01:46:49,058
Thank you.

1183
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:50,739
Counselor Knight.

1184
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:57,995
Mr. President, yes, in our packets this week, we also had a response from the mayor relative to a resolution that was put forward on the 21st.

1185
01:46:58,936 --> 01:47:06,041
The resolution, the council asked if the mayor could update us relative to the appointments for the Community Preservation Commission.

1186
01:47:06,702 --> 01:47:13,187
And the response that we received in our packet this week was that we should see the names coming across our desk within the next two weeks, Mr. President.

1187
01:47:13,227 --> 01:47:14,428
So it's something I'm looking forward to.

1188
01:47:14,988 --> 01:47:16,889
And I thank the administration for their prompt response.

1189
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:18,631
Thank you, Councilman.

1190
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:28,392
Records, the records of the March 21st meeting were passed to Vice President Mox.

1191
01:47:28,572 --> 01:47:31,814
Vice President Mox, were you able to rectify the mistake?
