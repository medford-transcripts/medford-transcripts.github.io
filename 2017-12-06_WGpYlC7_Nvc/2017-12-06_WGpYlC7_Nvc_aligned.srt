Present.

Present.

13
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:23,006
Council Member Harris.

Present.

15
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:25,768
Please rise and assume the flag.

16
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:26,729
Aye.

17
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,230
Aye.

18
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:37,373
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,659
Sorry, spin the rules so we can hear.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,321
Take something off of the unfinished business.

21
00:00:59,322 --> 00:00:59,702
That would be 17-734.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,231
just want to go on record as recusing myself from the conversation.

23
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:22,372
My parents live on South Street and I spoke to state ethics today and I'm going to recuse myself.

24
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,853
Thank you, Mr. President.

25
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:40,417
After extensive meetings with our friends from Eversource and a thorough review on many concerns and issues, they've been very responsive with

26
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:59,294
aside from all of the official approvals through the city engineer and all that need to be apprised of this daunting task of a huge project that will take us through a few different cities.

27
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:24,007
If we can have, I think that we've gone over every issue to nauseam and I appreciate everybody's effort and Eversource's responses to all of our concerns and issues and I move to accept and place it on file.

28
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,350
Move approval, excuse me.

29
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,411
On the motion by Councilor Scapelli.

30
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,167
seconded by Councilor Knight.

31
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,068
All those in favor?

32
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,029
Councilor DelaRusso.

33
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:49,373
Mr. President, we've had, as Councilor Scott Pelli mentioned, quite extensive meetings, and we've gotten a lot of answers.

34
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:59,738
We've gotten a lot of response and thoughtful responses to the questions that we've asked on behalf of the citizens regarding this program.

35
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:13,292
Uh, we've also, uh, uh, I think, uh, the representatives of, um, Eversource and the, um, uh, their, uh, uh, contractor who's going to, uh,

36
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:29,330
execute the project, have listened seriously and intently to the concerns of the council regarding the citizens and what they want regarding traffic, regarding safety.

37
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:40,714
And we also dealt in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource

38
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:48,598
and the city administration and various department heads who have expertise in these matters.

39
00:03:49,459 --> 00:04:06,809
And although we were able to make some inroads and renegotiate some of the aspects of the Yalta conference, Mr. President, I'm satisfied as one counselor to have heard everything satisfactorily that concerns me.

40
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,134
approve of this project of the grant.

41
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:13,497
Thank you.

42
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:14,779
Vice President Mox.

43
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,090
Thank you Mr. President and I agree with my colleagues this has been a thorough and

44
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,733
really in-depth process.

45
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:38,258
We've heard about this project for at least the past two and a half years now regarding this underground transmission line and that Eversource was going to be doing this particular work in the community.

46
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,680
This council had a public hearing back

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,267
I think now it's over a year ago where we opened it up to the general public to ask some preliminary questions regarding the process.

48
00:04:51,067 --> 00:05:02,657
As I stated from the beginning and as I still state, this project in my opinion may benefit the overall grid and may benefit communities going out north

49
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:15,260
but it has little to no benefit to the residents of this community other than 100% disruption on our streets, traffic, and everything else associated with this project.

50
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:30,523
With that being said, Mr. President, I have to say over the last several weeks in meeting with Eversource and the Committee of the Whole meetings and asking the important questions that we did get many of our questions answered at the meeting.

51
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:52,792
Part of the meeting tonight was to discuss some of the concerns we had from the last meeting and We did get I think some of the crucial issues in my opinion which as councilor Scott Pelley brought up regarding notification of the neighbors and I feel very comfortable that There is going to be you know an exhaustive

52
00:05:54,213 --> 00:06:09,106
a notification by Eversource to reach out to the neighborhood, not only door-to-door, but also to have a public meeting, which I think will address many of the issues or concerns residents may have along this particular route.

53
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:13,770
And not just residents on the route, Mr. President, this impacts entire neighborhoods.

54
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,914
and not just people on Winthrop Street or Mystic Ave or South Street, but entire neighborhoods.

55
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:42,708
Also tonight, we requested that the city's new leak detection program, which was implemented back, I believe, roughly a year ago, that when this construction work that takes place on our roads is gonna be in the proximity of our water mains, over and above our water mains, that we as a community have to monitor and make sure that

56
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:59,725
if there is disruption to our 100-year-old water pipes or sewer pipes that we are safeguarded as a community to make sure that Eversource will pick up the tab when it comes to lead or cast iron pipes

57
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,786
that may be disturbed during this process.

58
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:15,350
And I think we've come to an agreement with Eversource and the city engineer will sit down and do case by case analysis on what they believe is warranted for repair.

59
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,791
So I think that was a very positive outcome that took place.

60
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:22,832
Also, Mr. President,

61
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:27,576
and this has been an issue near and dear to me, raised crosswalks in the community.

62
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:40,829
Back some years ago, Mayor McGlynn at the time implemented a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks and some four years later we've only implemented one on Winthrop Street.

63
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,992
But this particular proposal

64
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:59,737
calls for not only the restoration of Winthrop Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Salt Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, but also Mr. President calls for the implementation of raised crosswalks.

65
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:15,428
at Meffitt High School on Winthrop Street, Winthrop Street at the crosswalk between Memorial Park and Meffitt Community Gardens, which we all know is a very tough place to cross, and South Street at the entrance of the pedestrian pathway to Route 16.

66
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:27,998
So I am pleased to see that Eversource has included that in the MOU that is signed with the city, and I'm also very pleased to hear that

67
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:33,569
We're not going to take a minimal standard as the city solicitor, which I don't know if he's here.

68
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,153
I think he may have gone home.

69
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:39,674
And I don't blame him, he's put a lot of work in this project.

70
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:58,448
But we're not going to follow just a minimal standard on erecting these raised crosswalks, but we're going to put something that's tastefully done, that aesthetically is pleasing, and something that adheres to state and federal statutes when it comes to transportation and public safety.

71
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,832
So that is a very positive outcome also, Mr. President.

72
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:10,838
I, as one member of the council, would like to see in future agreements.

73
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:21,885
We heard from Eversource that even though they're coming to the council for a grant of location, that they already have a memorandum of understanding with the city.

74
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:29,111
So they already sat down with the administration and negotiated everything they'd like to see take place with this project.

75
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,733
However, they left out one key factor.

76
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:35,825
that this project needs approval from the city council.

77
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:40,888
And as we all know, the city council has its own opinion, its own ideas.

78
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,611
And we also communicate with residents and department heads and so forth.

79
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:55,518
And I would say for future projects, it would be helpful that the city council, if any permits are required from us, we be a part of the process.

80
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:00,339
in particular when it comes to a memorandum of understanding.

81
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:10,823
The city of Boston, which I mentioned tonight, and I won't go into it, but I will bring it up at a future council meeting, has a great process for granting of locations.

82
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,964
It's not done by the city council.

83
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,346
It's done by a public improvement commission.

84
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:29,138
And that commission is comprised of a number of members that sit on the transportation department, property management, inspectional services, water and sewer commission, and the engineering department.

85
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,403
And that body gets together and holds public meetings.

86
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:42,433
And they discuss with whoever the utility is what some of their plans are and what they'd like to see for mitigation.

87
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:49,341
And the approval process is a lengthy process which also involves a checklist.

88
00:10:50,562 --> 00:11:03,553
And I don't know if Cassandra, the city engineer is here tonight, but I don't know if our process has a thorough checklist on the process to which takes place in the community.

89
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,975
We may or may have not, I don't know.

90
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:24,538
I can tell you for future reference, Mr. President, it may be worthwhile to look at city ordinances and maybe at some point have the city council removed from the process and create a commissioner board that has all the parties together

91
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,585
and collaboration that can deal with the utility companies.

92
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,267
And it's one stop shop.

93
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:40,480
And as Ebersource mentioned, when they deal with Boston, when they get approval from the PIC, which is Public Improvement Commission,

94
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:47,484
that when they leave there, they're done more or less with the permitting and all the process which takes place.

95
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,005
And that's not the case here in the city of Medford.

96
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:58,150
They've met with the administration, they've met with the council, and now they're going to have to go for street openings and other permits and so forth.

97
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:08,075
And I think it would only be advantageous for this community and also beneficial to the residents of this community to have one body that looks at it with

98
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,040
people that their expertise is in this particular field.

99
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:16,386
And I am going to offer that as a future resolution.

100
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:23,577
But tonight, Mr. President, I do support this and I look forward to the continued commitment that ever

101
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:47,404
put out there to work with the city to provide a clerk of the works that will be the direct communicator with residents in Eversource or residents in Bond Construction so that residents aren't going to feel the frustration when they need to get a hold of someone at 830 at night and unable to get anyone at Eversource, but they will have a contact that they can reach out.

102
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:50,105
We heard from the city engineer that there will be

103
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:58,690
a working group within the City of contact names and numbers that residents can speak with and that will alleviate a lot of concern.

104
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:05,795
Also City Solicitor Rumley mentioned tonight and I thought it was an important subject that

105
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:28,967
anyone along this particular route that needs access in and out of their property, someone that might be confined to their home or someone that may need dialysis or other health concerns that Eversource and the city work together to locate where these people are and to communicate directly with the people on the need for access when this construction is taking place.

106
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,849
So I want to thank all the parties involved.

107
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:37,933
in particular the city engineer and the city solicitor for their dedication on this project, Mr. President.

108
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,094
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

109
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:45,918
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

Yes.

120
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:57,289

President Caviello.

123
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,956
Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, and one abstention.

124
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,739
Is that correct?

125
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:06,600
Motion passes.

126
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,341

While we're on the suspension, yes Mr. President.

Councilor Scott Bealli.

129

Can we pull up paper 17-590, it's the Method Association LLC, Middle Glen Mall, special permit extension hours, 30 day review for December 5th, if we can?

130
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,750
Yes we can.

131
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,892
Disregard the special permit for Wegmans,

132
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:42,098
I had contacted John Beluso and he has said that there is no complaints or problems over there that have been reported to him.

133
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:55,242
I also spoke to the president of the Condo Association for 3920, Mrs. Valley Parkway, and they have said they had no concerns that have been reported to them.

134
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:00,799
Do you want to make a motion to?

135
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,980
Yeah, if I can make the motion that we now.

136
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,261
60 day will be the next one.

137

Aye.

141
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:13,626
Motion passes.

142
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,526
While we're under suspension.

143
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,448
While we're under suspension, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

144
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:19,829
Thank you, President Carviello.

145
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:25,452
If we could allow a couple minutes, a resident would like to speak with regards to the.

146
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,633
We have a resident that would like to speak.

147
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:28,731
Good evening.

148
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,132
Name and address of the record, please.

149
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,213
Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford.

150
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:44,898
I was before the council last week, and you people passed a resolution regarding the extension of the comment deadline for the Green Line project.

151
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,101
And the resolution passed, but yet there's been no reverse 9-1-1 call.

152
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,161
That was the resolution.

153
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,903
So I'm here to question why, what happened.

154
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,466
If I may, Council President.

155
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:02,787
Council Member Green.

156
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:03,248
Thank you.

157
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,269
Thank you for coming again.

158
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:17,819
We did pass a resolution requesting that the reverse 911 call go out, and I think that definitely should have been done before today, but we still have one week left.

159
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,982
Comments are open and are due no later than 5 p.m.

160
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:26,225
on Tuesday, December 12th, so there's one more week to comment on the

161
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,326
further extension of the Green Line.

162
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:42,476
I sent an email out to the Mayor today to ask if the Mayor's office today to see if we could get a reverse 9-1-1 call to notify the residents, the entire city, especially those that live in the hillside in South Medford.

163
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:45,838
I'm publicly asking that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out.

164
00:16:48,520 --> 00:17:07,648
notification hasn't been great on this project and I think that's essential that we let the public know whether they're for or against or have concerns they have a right to be heard and a right to know what's going on and when deadlines are and when they're extended and when meetings are and this is just one component so I hope that we can get that reverse 911 call out tomorrow.

165
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:26,438
If there's an objection from the city hall here, I'd like to know what it is, why they didn't want to send this out because, you know, I mean, the same reason that people weren't notified about the meeting to begin with still stands because the same population didn't know that the deadline was extended.

166
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,498
So it's the same principle.

167
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:34,699
And they agreed to do the reverse 9-1-1 to tell people that the meeting was scheduled for Thanksgiving week.

168
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,280
So I really can't see why they don't want to continue this way.

169
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,021
Going forward, I hope MassDOT does a better job of communicating with people.

170
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:52,783
I think Councilor De La Ruza last week passed an amendment to the resolution to say that he would like the MassDOT to notify people by mail.

171
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:56,706
So, we'll see what happens in the next round.

172
00:17:59,028 --> 00:17:59,929
Councilor Dela Russo.

173
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:13,062
Just briefly, on that note, as you remember early on in the process, 13 years ago, that was one of the major concerns that I think people

174
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:31,530
who administer projects like this sometimes become, because they live in a world of email communication, sometimes lose track of the fact that not everybody lives on that planet, and that we're dealing with a bigger solar system, and so various modes of communication have to be employed.

175
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:36,915
And that's why we sent that letter out to the department.

176
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,454
Right, I appreciate that.

177
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:48,243
Not only that, but 13 years have passed, new people have moved into the neighborhood that didn't even know about this project, that couldn't even get on any kind of a list because they didn't know about it.

178
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:48,803
Exactly.

179
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:55,369
So I appreciate your requesting the reverse 911 again, and we'll hope for the best, I guess.

180
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:56,309
Thank you.

181
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:56,870
Thank you very much.

182
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,651
Thank you for your hard work.

183
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,074
While we're on suspension?

184
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:09,454
While we're in the suspension, some citizens on Winchester Street would like to address the council regarding a matter that we all received notice on.

185
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:15,217
Mr. President.

186
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,838
Good evening.

187
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,199
Name and address of the record, please.

188
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,040
My name is Fran Abola.

189
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,361
I live at 9 Alfred Street.

190
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:26,743
First of all, I'd like to thank everybody here for giving me an opportunity to listen.

191
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,281
hear what's going on.

192
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,166
I've been living at this address my whole life.

193
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,151
I'm right next to Nardone Electric.

194
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,473
I still own the property.

195
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:44,398
When he came here in 1995, I never had a problem with anything that I had a problem with.

196
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:45,959
I could call Steve.

197
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:46,980
I still have his number.

198
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,862
I'd say, hey, Steve, this is what's going on.

199
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:51,224
And everything always seemed to be resolved.

200
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:56,248
His business expanded, and he left the premises.

201
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,168
He moved to Woburn.

202
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,670
And that's when all the trouble started.

203
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,972
A company by the name of J.F.

204
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:06,776
White, which is probably one of the top ten contractors, I would say, in Boston.

205
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:16,203
They come in in this area and they totally disrupted the neighborhood with noise, banging,

206
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,469
loud, I've been woken up, I have all the records here.

207
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,870
I mean, I just started filming.

208
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,712
This is what happened since 2015, 16, when I moved in.

209
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:32,597
I didn't film any of this, because I was trying to resolve this all with Steve, who was pretty cooperative, trying to help me.

210
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,279
But it just seems we weren't getting anywhere, we weren't getting anywhere.

211
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,162
But I have started taking documentation with my phone, which is, my house is literally

212
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:45,807
My bedroom was from here to where that gentleman is, Mr. Lepore, of where all the pipes are being stored.

213
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:52,193
They get slammed down, they have a fork truck that's made to pick up four tons, okay?

214
00:20:52,553 --> 00:21:01,540
They slam the pipes down, 6.30 in the morning, I've been woken up about 20 times, I have all the dates here, every video can back up everything I'm talking about here.

215
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:08,767
And I'm talking about four o'clock in the morning, one o'clock in the morning, and it just totally disrupts the neighborhood.

216
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,130
I've tried to have them stopped.

217
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:24,850
I went down to the building inspector, found out, oh, there's, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of John Bufuso, and he said, oh, you know, there's nothing we can do, you know, I go, we're not doing electrics, not operating the property anymore.

218
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,331
He goes, well, that carries on to the new tenant.

219
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:40,078
Well, you know, looking at everything, and then I asked to go back to get a proposal in 1995 when the ordinance was changed exclusively for Nargon Electric, that they were allowed to operate there.

220
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:49,543
This building was used for storage, car storage for Knox Brothers Dodge, and before that, back in the 1900s, it was used to store Army Jeeps that used to come off the trains.

221
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:51,764
So this building was always storage.

222
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:52,565
It's not like, you know,

223
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:55,248
You moved in the neighborhood, you knew what you were living next to.

224
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,870
It was always quiet, you know?

225
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,393
It was just cars being parked.

226
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:00,095
It wasn't anything business-disruptive.

227
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:04,801
Now it's gotten to a point where I work, you know, a demanding job.

228
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:05,903
I work a lot of hours.

229
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:07,945
I'm not even home that much, you know?

230
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,508
I work double shifts sometimes.

231
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:27,480
I get woken up at 1.30, 2.30, 4 o'clock in the morning, 6.30 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, pipes banging, and the pipes literally have destroyed my kitchen floor, blew the tiles right up, because they bring this pipe down that's 30 feet long, about 26 inches wide, and slam it down, and boom, bang.

232
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,743
And it sounds like, you know, and the grinding, I have an audio clip for you.

233
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:33,364
think you want to hear it.

234
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:37,908
It would be a great soundtrack for Guantanamo Bay, because it's torturous to listen to.

235
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,250
And you've got to hear this at 6.30 in the morning.

236
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:48,217
And then another thing, too, I just want to, is the other day they have a flatbed truck

237
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:54,259
I mean, they're supposed to be, you know, whatever's going on, you should at least have the safety involved in whatever you do, okay?

238
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:06,663
Winchester Street, they come down with a flatbed truck, they block the whole street, and then they come out with a fork truck and block the whole street and block the two neighbors behind there on Winchester Street.

239
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,403
They can't even get out of their own driveway.

240
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,204
Not even calling a cop to come down on a detail.

241
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,434
And all we want is we want peace, and we just want it to stop.

242
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:20,458
We haven't got one, no one knows when they're getting out of there.

243
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:23,060
We don't know when the lease is, no one knows anything.

244
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,323
We try to speak to this, you know, the building commission, he says we're in violation, they're in violation.

245
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,786
Well, they're in violation from the day they moved in.

246
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:33,048
They're not Nardone Electric, they're J.F.

247
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,129
White.

248
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:35,650
Well, they're trying to find another place.

249
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,692
Find another place, what about the neighbors?

250
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:41,154
It seems like they're more concerned on getting a place for J.F.

251
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:41,435
White.

252
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,797
And it's totally disrupted the neighborhood.

253
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:53,663
Dumpsters full of stuff, seven in the morning, throwing stuff, and all the trash isn't even from the job that they're working at at that building.

254
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:58,906
This trash comes in on a flatbed truck from Kendall's, because I work at MIT every day.

255
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:03,969
This trash comes from the work they're doing on the bridge from Kendall, fills up the truck with trash.

256
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:07,972
They used to come in at one o'clock in the morning, waking me up, slamming the door, that stopped.

257
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:11,414
Now they come in at seven o'clock in the morning with the truck full of trash,

258
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:16,257
First thing they do, boom, start emptying out, boom, start throwing everything in the dumpster.

259
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:26,083
The grinding, the doors are wide open, this guy's outside grinding next to stuff, they're settling tanks, flammable products, they just do whatever they want, there's no control.

260
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:30,766
And I just, you know, I'm kind of upset about it, because I've been putting up this for three years.

261
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,267
And I just want your guys' help.

262
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:35,429
If you can help, just let me know, when does this end?

263
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,230
Who's gonna enforce this?

264
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,631
Who's doing this?

265
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,172
These people are doing whatever they want.

266
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,254
When are they gonna get out?

267
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:46,318
I can't even find out when the lease is or when they're supposed to get out.

268
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:55,327
I just came here tonight just to address the attention to everybody here and just ask for some help and put us in the right direction on where we go with this.

269
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:57,950
for the whole neighborhood.

270
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,691
It's really gone totally out of control.

271
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:07,475
And if you go by there and see the pipe, how big it is, it's insane.

272
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:14,020
I get all this video and stuff, I don't want to play it for you, but if you want to hear one grind, I'll let you hear it.

273
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,704
This is at 6.30 in the morning.

274
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:22,565
I have to decline that call, sorry about that.

275
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:28,941
This is next door to my house.

276
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:30,364
All day.

277
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:36,277
This is next door to my house.

278
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,329
What they do is they grind it.

279
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:44,770
What they're doing is they're prepping the pipes for the big dig over there, whatever they're doing, I'm sorry, the Kendall Bridge.

280
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:52,632
And what they're doing is they're prepping all the big pipes, putting all the elbows on, the offsets, the heat exchangers, whatever they're putting on.

281
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:56,273
And then they grind it, they weld it, they're welding outside.

282
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,594
I get video of sparks flying all over the place.

283
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:04,695
And then they come in, it's 6.30 in the morning with a big flatbed truck, and this thing backs up.

284
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,895
That's all it does is beep, beep, beep.

285
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,056
And then they load the flatbed on and they take it out.

286
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:12,479
You know, there's guys urinating outside next to the dumpster.

287
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,560
I mean, I didn't have a can with me every time.

288
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:15,521
But you know what?

289
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,204
I wish I had one with me, but I'm not home all the time.

290
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,265
So I don't know even what goes on during the day.

291
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,708
She works from her house and she deals with the day stuff.

292
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,469
But I'm not even home that much.

293
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,573
in the morning and I'm out early and then I come home late at night.

294
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:31,674
I live across the street.

295
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:35,997
My name is Mark and I currently live at 8 Alfred Street and I work a couple days a week from home.

296
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:48,548
I work for Philips Healthcare, an international company, so I take a lot of early morning international phone calls and conference calls throughout the day and basically from spring to fall I can't have my windows open during the day because I can't be heard on my conference calls.

297
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,070
Thank you.

298
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:52,711
Councilor Dayton.

299
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,914
Mr. President, I think that this is a matter that's appropriate for further review from our building commissioner.

300
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:08,642
It's my understanding that in our packet here, there is a letter from Mr. Moki to the property owner indicating that the current use is an improper use.

301
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,884
It's not in compliance with the Zoning Board decision.

302
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:16,648
And it's also my understanding that there was a process to relocate this tenant, Mr. President.

303
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:20,311
But if we look further in the packet, we'll also see that that process has fallen through.

304
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:26,277
So I think it would be incumbent upon us to figure out where we are in the process from our building commissioner to see what's going on.

305
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:28,539
Ultimately, we've had situations like this in the past.

306
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:38,269
If you recall several years back when they were doing the Winthrop Street drainage project, they were using Apostolon Mystic Ave as a layover yacht, which abutted Sylvia Road, which is a residential street.

307
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,932
And many of the same complaints and same concerns came up.

308
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:45,816
you know, working with the building commissioner and the administration, we were able to get them out of there in short order.

309
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:51,361
And I think that this is a project, a similar situation, and I think that you have everybody on the same page.

310
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:56,806
I don't think that anybody in the administration wants these people here disrupting the quality of life, and I'm certainly sure that nobody behind this rail does.

311
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:03,192
So with that being said, I think that the proper steps, Mr. President, would be to refer this to the building commissioner for a response to see what's going on.

312
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:08,120
Ultimately, I think this is something that may have to go through the city solicitor's office at some point in time.

313
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:15,512
But as of right now, it's up to the code enforcement officer to issue the appropriate fines for noncompliance with the Zoning Act and then go from there.

314
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:16,994
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

315
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:18,575
Councilor Del Rosso.

316
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:19,936
Thank you, Mr. President.

317
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:30,746
I've spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the Building Commissioner, Mr. Moki.

318
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,049
Clearly, upon all the research you've done, Fran,

319
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:47,954
that the activity that's going on is beyond the scope allowed in the initial variance given to the property owner some 20 plus years ago.

320
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:50,654
The property owner's not in there.

321
00:28:51,034 --> 00:29:00,596
He leased the property out to a company that's clearly operating way beyond the scope of the restrictions placed on the use of that property.

322
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,197
They are in the process from what the

323
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:12,378
Building Commissioner has told me they are in the process of finding a new location.

324
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,801
However, he doesn't have an answer on when that's going to be.

325
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,203
And that's what has him concerned the most.

326
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:26,668
Because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away.

327
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:28,429
I just want peace.

328
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:29,129
That's all.

329
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,390
I can't.

330
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:32,651
And the whole thing is, is we just

331
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,155
We just want an answer.

332
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:35,815
That's the whole thing.

333
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,577
It's like everything's left up in the air.

334
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:38,198
I don't know.

335
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,579
I don't know.

336
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,241
Here's what it is at this point.

337
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:46,105
First of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F.

338
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:46,326
White.

339
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:52,265
You rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston.

340
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,607
They do enormous projects.

341
00:29:56,308 --> 00:30:02,312
And you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people.

342
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,093
And they're not treating you well.

343
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:07,395
And that's sad.

344
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:15,141
Mr. Moki has examined this and cited

345
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,005
the property owner for a zoning violation.

346
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,767
So a citation has been issued, all right?

347
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:30,851
He goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there.

348
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:34,192
Hopefully this will be resolved before then.

349
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:42,476
He personally met with the manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company.

350
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,753
He explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation.

351
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:52,056
So they themselves have been put on notice.

352
00:30:53,497 --> 00:31:02,965
He's assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks.

353
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:04,565
to survey the property.

354
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,526
He wanted you to be aware of that.

355
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:10,627
And then this is going to have to follow its course.

356
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:22,071
I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.

357
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,891
Because he doesn't want them.

358
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:25,652
That reflects poorly.

359
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,733
Because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.

360
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:36,018
He's a great guy and I think what actually happened is I think he didn't realize that when they came in and took the space that this was all going to be going on.

361
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:38,100
I think he was probably misled himself.

362
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,480
Right.

363
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,422
He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.

364
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,423
Like it's kind of been.

365
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:45,825
And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.

366
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,987
The trucks left for the day on their projects.

367
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:49,568
No.

368
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:53,152
So that's where I've been updated on this.

369
00:31:53,993 --> 00:32:04,624
As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector.

370
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,847
But that's where he has us today.

371
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:07,667
Okay.

372
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:08,188
All right.

373
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:11,530
Well, I'm glad everybody gave me a chance to speak.

374
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,332
But this is important, too.

375
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:25,739
This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as counselors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's

376
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:30,411
I know you, friend.

377
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:32,393
I mean, you're not a complainer.

378
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,936
I just want to sleep peacefully.

379
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,557
I don't sleep much as it is, you know.

380
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:37,098
Exactly.

381
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:38,900
You work morning, noon, and night.

382
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,621
Well, thank you all.

383
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:41,522
Thank you very much.

384
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:43,845
Vice President Mox.

385
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:46,067
Thank you, Mr. President.

386
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:59,594
I think we're beyond the point of just talking, giving lip service, and no matter how many violations are handed out, that's not going to help Fran's problem.

387
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,634
That's not going to help the neighbors' problems.

388
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:09,437
At this particular point, it was clear when I read that document that although they're saying they have plans to relocate,

389
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:14,962
But when you don't give a time frame, to me, that's just lip service.

390
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:18,245
So I don't have too much confidence.

391
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,727
I don't know how long their lease is, as you mentioned.

392
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:23,830
They could have a 10-year lease, 5-year lease, who knows.

393
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:26,012
But I think at this point,

394
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:28,314
And I've been on the council for a number of years.

395
00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:34,019
I think this calls for a cease and desist order, which could be handed out by the building commissioner.

396
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,061
And I think we're at that point.

397
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:37,482
I shouldn't say I think.

398
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,043
I know we're at that point.

399
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,726
And I think the

400
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,248
Building Commissioner has to line up all his ducks before he does that.

401
00:33:46,708 --> 00:34:02,115
But I think we're at that point right now that I would ask the council to take a vote to have the Building Commissioner look into a cease, an immediate cease and desist order based on the fact that they're working prior to 7 a.m.

402
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:05,716
in the morning, which is a violation of zoning ordinances.

403
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:12,659
They're also doing work in that particular location that is not of proper use.

404
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,762
which I think the building commissioner already cited them based on that.

405
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:28,292
And to me, that's enough information to have in hand to go and provide a cease and desist order, which would have them close operations immediately until it goes to court.

406
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:34,537
And I'm sure any business, especially if they're doing work, like you're mentioning, are not going to want to close their operation.

407
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:39,061
So it really brings them back to the table once this action is taken.

408
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:40,962
So I would ask that in the form of

409
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:52,348
a motion, Mr. President, that we direct the building commissioner to issue a cease and desist order immediately on this particular property.

410
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,791
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

411
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,032
Is that a point of information?

412
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:04,469
I don't care.

413
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,391
Thank you, President Carvalho.

414
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:08,113
I agree with Councillor Marx.

415
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:22,305
I think from those, just listening to that one clip, that would drive me absolutely crazy, never mind while I'm sleeping, during the day while I'm trying to work, and I think we need to get a little tougher as a city on this establishment.

416
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:26,227
cease and desist seems to me like it's probably the way to go.

417
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:48,618
I'd also ask that we request an opinion from the city solicitor, depending on how long it takes to actually cease and desist the operation, with regards to if the permit was given to Nardone Electric and only to them, how is JF White operating at the site?

418
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:51,619
I think that was an important piece of information that maybe

419
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,173
the building commissioner, um,

420
00:35:56,505 --> 00:36:00,666
needs an opinion from the solicitor to shut down operations.

421
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:05,527
Also, the hours of operation, it seems like it's going all through the night, all through the morning.

422
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:09,048
There is a start time and an end time that should be followed.

423
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:11,529
So I think that's an important piece of information as well.

424
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:15,670
I can't imagine every night listening to that noise.

425
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:24,071
So whatever the city needs to do, I think they need to do it as if it was their home that was on 8 or 9 Alfred Street.

426
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:25,832
So I would second that.

427
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:27,412
resolve.

428
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:29,793
Councilor Knight.

429
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:39,017
Mr. President, to clarify the motion that I made, the motion that I was making was to refer the paper to the Building Commissioner Enforcement of the Zoning Act, which would be all-encompassing.

430
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:44,159
It would take into consideration any and all steps that he needs to take to make sure that there's a complying use at this location.

431
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,680
Okay.

432
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,454
We have two motions on the floor.

433
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:58,019
We have one from Councilor Marks, Vice President Marks, and we have one from Councilor Knight.

434
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,900
As amended.

435
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,801
As amended.

436
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:03,743
So, which one are we gonna go with?

437
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,745
I think they're one and the same.

438
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,967
I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

439
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:14,172
The purpose of enforcing the zoning act is to get a modification

440
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,616
Councilor Marks is asking for a cease and desist.

441
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:26,120
Which is probably a step in the process of enforcing the Zoning Act.

442
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,923
Right, I think we're at the point right now where that's the highest level of council to accomplish the request.

443
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:31,044
Okay.

444
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,165
Other than the zoning, that's fine.

445
00:37:33,265 --> 00:37:41,192
All right, we'll go with Councilor Marks' motion that the building commissioner order a cease and desist, seconded by?

446
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:42,153
Councilor DelaRusso.

447
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,034
Councilor DelaRusso, all those in favor?

448
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:44,394
Aye.

449
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:45,776
Motion passes.

450
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:50,085
Motion to revert back to- Thank you very much.

451
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:50,946
Thank you, Mr. Lola.

452
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:51,266
Thank you.

453
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:51,967
Have a good night.

454
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:58,894
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scott Pelli.

455
00:37:58,954 --> 00:37:59,595
All those in favor.

456
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:16,906
17785, and offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the double poles on Alexander Avenue, pole number 4444 and 4443, and on Barnaround, pole number 2994, be removed in the interest of public safety.

457
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:17,907
Vice President Mox.

458
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:19,468
Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:24,511
I would just ask that this be sent to National Grid for immediate removal of the double poles.

460
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:26,692
And also, if we can get a report

461
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:34,934
I believe it was several months back I asked for an update on the double pole report, and I don't think we have yet to receive an update.

462
00:38:35,794 --> 00:38:39,315
I'm seeing more and more double poles throughout the community, which is good.

463
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:46,657
It means they're replacing older poles, but we also want to stay on top of the utilities to make sure they're removing the double pole, Mr. President.

464
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:48,597
Thank you.

465
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,338
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by

466
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:56,659
by Councilor Scott Pelly, all those in favor?

467
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,742
Motion passes.

468
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:12,819
17-786, petition by Roberta Cameron, Ralph Nordstrom of the mass to address the council for an update of the completion of the community preservation plan in the opening of the application process for the first round of funding.

469
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:19,592
Yes, Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in Medford.

470
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,893
Roberta Cameron is on her way here.

471
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:22,954
She should be here shortly.

472
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:25,716
She's the chair of the Community Preservation Committee.

473
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,637
She asked me to speak on her behalf until she gets here.

474
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,540
and to answer any questions that the Council may have.

475
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,244
I've been serving on the committees, the CPC, since it was formed in May of this year.

476
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:43,471
I believe you have a four-page handout that summarizes the plan in front of you that was distributed with the meeting minutes today.

477
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:53,121
And I just want to summarize a couple quick points and then take any questions you may have about the CPA and CPC.

478
00:39:54,023 --> 00:40:01,894
So over the last six months, the Community Preservation Committee has undertaken to fulfill its obligation to undertake a study of the community needs across Medford.

479
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:08,984
We coordinated with many of the boards in this building and a lot of stakeholders and committees across the entire city.

480
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:20,390
That included things like the Friends of the Memphis Public Library, the Royal House, Friends of the Fells, really anyone who could possibly be a recipient or a stakeholder in the CPA process.

481
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,433
So we've just published our final community preservation plan.

482
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:28,915
It's online, and it's soon to be available in print.

483
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:33,098
And we have also opened up the application process for the first round of funding.

484
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:37,280
There will be two rounds in 2018.

485
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,163
The first application process is just for determining if the project is viable.

486
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:43,884
That is due on December 15th, which is 10 days from today.

487
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:50,450
They'll be awarded, the funds will be awarded in March of next year and then the fall of next year as well.

488
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,772
Two rounds for fiscal year 17 and 18.

489
00:40:53,473 --> 00:40:57,796
And every year following will just be in one round in the fall of each year.

490
00:40:57,816 --> 00:41:08,126
So we, again, May will be the award of the first round, October the award of the second round, and October going forward for each year.

491
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:29,379
It's a two-stage process to determine eligibility first, which is the 12-15 date, and then a more detailed application that will obviously get into more details about how much money it costs, the project, who's going to benefit, if there's any matching funds, and how it will serve the city of Medford in terms of the most number of people.

492
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:35,869
We'll also consider some off-cycle applications on an as-needed basis.

493
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,850
There has to be extraordinary circumstances to do that.

494
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:44,911
We're not going to just open up the process unless there's a real need.

495
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:46,332
And that could be the city of Medford.

496
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,132
It could be somebody else.

497
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,833
But we're not going to do that as part of our regular basis.

498
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:53,113
We're going to have everyone compete and then evaluate all the projects.

499
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:54,554
As the city council knows, you are

500
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:58,297
the final step in the process in terms of approving these projects.

501
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:00,959
But the projects start really from the ground up.

502
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:05,484
They're more of a grassroots thing from nonprofits and from citizens.

503
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:11,510
It could be community groups, neighborhood groups, park advocates, a whole bunch of different options, obviously.

504
00:42:12,755 --> 00:42:22,683
So we also intend to set aside $25,000 in funding for small projects for CPA funds, up to $5,000 for projects with a total cost of up to 10.

505
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:30,529
A very simplified application process to, again, to kind of make sure we capture both the big and the small and the medium-sized projects as well.

506
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:42,218
It's important to note, as I mentioned before, the city council has the final approval for our CPA funding in order to spend community preservation committee grants.

507
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:48,446
All proposals will be vetted open to the public.

508
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,607
There'll be public hearings.

509
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:56,752
People will have a chance to advocate for their project and evaluate and give opinions on all the projects that are being submitted.

510
00:42:57,593 --> 00:43:10,963
At present, the general consensus of the Community Preservation Committee is that we basically equally distribute the funds right now until we understand what's going to be submitted between open space and recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation.

511
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:14,964
Obviously, we don't know what's going to be submitted yet, because nothing has been submitted yet.

512
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:17,985
When we get the projects, we'll obviously evaluate them then.

513
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:31,129
But our thought was, after the public forums we had, the public input we had, and talking to all the stakeholders, that we wanted to kind of give ourselves flexibility, but keep generally distributed evenly amongst those three categories.

514
00:43:31,749 --> 00:43:36,811
As you all know, by statute, we'd have to have 10% minimum for each of those categories.

515
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:47,997
But that leaves 70% that is beyond the administrative needs that is discretionary in terms of which bucket of grants that they go into.

516
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:58,544
As shown in the handout, if you look at the first page, the priorities and goals are laid out pretty clearly.

517
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:07,507
And I'm obviously here to answer any questions, specific questions you may have about the process or what the needs are or how we're going to evaluate these projects.

518
00:44:07,627 --> 00:44:10,808
So I open up to the council to ask any questions you may have.

519
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:12,762
Council Member Kern.

520
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:14,423
Thank you, President Carvialho.

521
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:17,144
Thank you, Doug Kerr, for coming to explain.

522
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:27,589
My first question just would be with regards to, I understand May and October will be, funds will be awarded, and then October, every year after that, going forward.

523
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,451
And I think going forward, it will be more of a timeline known to the public.

524
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:39,135
So my question is with regards to this December 15th eligibility determination form due date.

525
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,417
How have we advertised that so far?

526
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:46,840
And when did the advertisement start?

527
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:52,324
I just want to make sure that people are well aware of it and have known for a while.

528
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:54,345
It seems just like a very quick date.

529
00:44:54,965 --> 00:45:00,769
We do have a coordinator, as everyone knows, Danielle Evans, who was hired by the CPC.

530
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,354
who works three days a week in this building.

531
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:14,384
And as part of her job is to basically distribute that information as wide as possible into the city.

532
00:45:14,404 --> 00:45:18,328
I know she has a big email list that's been developed over the last

533
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:21,470
six or seven months with all the people that we've met.

534
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:25,092
Obviously it's on our website as well.

535
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:27,354
I believe there's a link on the city website as well.

536
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:37,399
I don't know if there are any other advertisements in the paper, but picking up on what was just talked about with the Green Line extension, obviously

537
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,721
The more people that know about this, the better.

538
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:45,285
And that we can't do enough in terms of trying to make sure, whether it's reverse 9-1-1, putting in a transcript.

539
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:51,590
The point is that we will do our best to let as many people know as possible through as many forums as possible.

540
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,533
We've already had two public forums attended by about 100 people over the last few months.

541
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,698
And our meetings are obviously open to the public, as every open meeting is.

542
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,043
But frankly, it is quick.

543
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:05,825
It is happening relatively fast.

544
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:09,690
It is the holiday season, so I can understand why people might miss it.

545
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:15,097
The point also I think is worth noting is that if people don't get it in by December 15, there's still

546
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:21,383
There's still opportunity to get it in, and there's still a second round in next year, so they don't have to rush.

547
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:26,106
There's going to be at least $1.2 million, I believe, in each of those two rounds available.

548
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:27,446
That's a significant amount of dollars.

549
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:32,429
If your project is $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000, that's going to go a long way.

550
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:36,111
And we obviously want to have the maximum impact on the city of Medford in terms of

551
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:42,699
improving the quality of our city, whether it's restoring a park, whether it's restoring a historic building, creating affordable housing.

552
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,081
There's so many different avenues.

553
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:51,230
If you had a chance to read the document that was put together by the CPC over the last few months, the needs in Medford are great.

554
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:52,672
They are really profound.

555
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,153
It's a real challenge with affordable housing in this city.

556
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:58,334
There's a lot of historic needs in this city.

557
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:02,895
And there's certainly a lot of demand for open space and recreation across this city.

558
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:07,756
That is clearly, these funds are meant to fill those gaps and take the city, move the city forward.

559
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:13,757
So I can try to get as much information to you, Councilor, as I can beyond what I just described in terms of the advertising.

560
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:17,197
But I would just obviously ask people to go to our website, read the plan.

561
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:21,238
And the application will take somebody 10 minutes to fill out.

562
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:23,847
really to get it approved.

563
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:26,809
Point of information, Joan Sear, 40 Cedar Road North.

564
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:34,195
I believe the coordinator sent a request into the Medford transcript to have something in the paper, but I think she missed last week's deadline, so it's likely going to be in this week.

565
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:44,944
It's not a lot of time, but this is a very quick round because we had to get our process in place, and then we finally got the application done, and we're trying to get the money out as quickly as we can.

566
00:47:44,984 --> 00:47:46,365
So the first round is going to be really quick.

567
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:49,246
The second round is going to be on a regular time schedule and then future rounds.

568
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:55,090
So when did the coordinator send out a notice to her whole email list?

569
00:47:55,574 --> 00:48:06,081
I believe it was directly after we had, sorry, the initial meeting where we announced the plan and had some input from the public, which was, I believe, the last Monday.

570
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:06,602
Last Monday.

571
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:07,282
Last Monday night.

572
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:10,164
So the end of November.

573
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:11,665
End of November, correct.

574
00:48:11,865 --> 00:48:13,987
And about how many emails does that go out to, do you know?

575
00:48:16,088 --> 00:48:17,169
I want to say over 200 people.

576
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:33,819
And then if they miss the December 15th deadline, that's for a determination form, so do they still have until March 2nd to do a full application for the first round?

577
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,721
That, I'm not sure about that.

578
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:37,642
It might be the second round.

579
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:43,819
I think for the smaller projects, it's going to be very simple.

580
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:49,001
So I don't think it'll be difficult to get those in by the March actual award.

581
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:55,183
We just want to make sure that nobody spends time working on a project that will not be funded by statute.

582
00:48:55,203 --> 00:49:02,385
We want to make sure it's viable as a project, so they don't fundraise, match grants, write all these details, and then it's not viable.

583
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:03,946
We don't want to waste anyone's time, obviously.

584
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:07,107
So it's important to get that step out of the way.

585
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:11,073
And our coordinator, I think, will be, remember, she's here to answer all these questions.

586
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:15,155
People can call her here at Medfed or stop by her office three days a week.

587
00:49:16,315 --> 00:49:18,316
I think it's Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

588
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:22,759
To talk about the process, to answer questions.

589
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:25,280
She's been a resource for the committee as well, because we're new at this.

590
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,402
She has experience in the community preservation arena from previous jobs.

591
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:41,825
She'll be able to help people with the actual applications too?

592
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:42,045
Yes.

593
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:47,009
And she's invited people to call her before they fill out the eligibility form to help them walk through the process.

594
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:56,375
Is there a particular form of communication that the council thinks would be helpful for us to use when these deadlines come up besides website, Medford transcript, email?

595
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:58,817
the loop maybe?

596
00:49:59,218 --> 00:49:59,538
I'm sorry?

597
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:01,441
The loop on cable access.

598
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:07,470
Cable access, Facebook, any type of... I'm sure one on the Facebook page.

599
00:50:07,531 --> 00:50:07,631
Okay.

600
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:08,252
I missed that one.

601
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:12,383
Yeah, no, my concern, and I appreciate all the hard work you've done.

602
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:22,025
I know the committee's worked very hard, and I attended one of the forums, which was very, you know, it was a two-hour forum, definitely learned a lot.

603
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:29,926
My concern just with this first round is that today is the 5th, and December 15th is when the applications are due.

604
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:33,387
So that is, that's just my concern for this initial round.

605
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,107
I feel like

606
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:39,908
Yes, there will be many more rounds, but we're talking about $1.2 million.

607
00:50:39,968 --> 00:50:46,409
So I feel like it's a lot of money to rush organizations when you could maybe extend it a few weeks.

608
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:54,751
And there's no guarantee that we would award even half that if the projects aren't there or not enough people.

609
00:50:55,691 --> 00:50:58,671
That money just goes back into the fund for the next round.

610
00:50:58,691 --> 00:50:59,831
It becomes a much bigger round.

611
00:51:00,492 --> 00:51:02,952
We don't know that until we see what comes before us, obviously.

612
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:22,569
So I know it is quick, but we are hoping that people will at least put in, literally spend 10 minutes, put together a project name, a couple sentences description, see if it's viable, and then spend the next few months really developing the project, really figuring it out.

613
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,091
Do you need to hire someone?

614
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:28,154
You know, is it available?

615
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:29,315
Is the property available?

616
00:51:29,335 --> 00:51:32,897
Has the property got a master plan already in place?

617
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:34,078
Is it something that's shovel ready?

618
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:36,020
There's so many different factors here.

619
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,620
That's just it.

620
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,881
We just don't know what we're going to get.

621
00:51:38,522 --> 00:51:40,103
We could get a ton of applications.

622
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:41,224
We could get no applications.

623
00:51:41,284 --> 00:51:42,284
I doubt that's going to happen.

624
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:46,647
But if we need to change the timeline based on what we get, we'll have to do that.

625
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:49,570
It's basically what our first option out there is.

626
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,411
And if we need to change that, we will.

627
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,718
And they're being funded.

628
00:51:53,758 --> 00:51:56,519
It's not in the key dates, but the first round, you said, was in March.

629
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,060
You'll be awarding.

630
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:58,661
Right.

631
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:06,105
So in consultation with you folks, since you're going to be approving the plan, we're trying to, on the first round, it's going to probably coincide a little bit.

632
00:52:06,305 --> 00:52:08,646
We're trying to get it ahead of your regular normal budget schedule.

633
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:14,249
So that's why we tried to get it done in March, and then moving it to the fall to get away from your normal budget schedule.

634
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:19,312
That's it for now.

635
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:21,395
Councilor Falco.

636
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:22,635
Thank you, Mr. President.

637
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,957
And I'd like to thank you for all your hard work.

638
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:29,040
I know this group has been meeting nonstop putting this program together.

639
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,823
And I had an opportunity to attend the forum last Monday night at the South Memphis Fire Station.

640
00:52:32,863 --> 00:52:34,404
And you did a great job.

641
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:36,265
I mean, it was explaining the program.

642
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:38,987
And there were a lot of good questions.

643
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,628
And it was well attended.

644
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:42,830
But I would definitely agree.

645
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,252
If you can put something on cable access, I think even

646
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:54,698
almost like an infomercial, just kind of describing what it's about, you know, how people can, you know, apply the process, who to contact with questions.

647
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,960
I think that would be definitely beneficial.

648
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,303
You know, people do, people do watch programs on that station.

649
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:06,106
So I think it's something that, it's a great mode to, of communication to actually get a message out to people.

650
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:08,107
So I think that, I would definitely agree.

651
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:11,290
I think that, you know, a lot of,

652
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,842
successful programs, it all comes down to communication.

653
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,404
And I think that this is the key.

654
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:19,566
But I had a quick question for you.

655
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:23,629
Can you talk a little bit about the small projects?

656
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:24,850
I think it was 25,000.

657
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:25,670
You talked about that.

658
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,732
I know that question came up last Monday as well.

659
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:29,914
So if you could just shed a light on that, that would be great.

660
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:42,023
So when Roberta and I attended a CPC forum that was run by the city of Somerville a couple months back, the other towns that have already implemented the CPA said that they had set aside a little bit of funding

661
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,328
for really small projects, your gardens or that kind of thing.

662
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:55,438
And I think what we said was the request would be up to $5,000 per project if the total project was 10, so really small projects.

663
00:53:55,718 --> 00:54:00,524
We just don't want the little guy feeling like they're going to get taken over by the big project that comes in.

664
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,147
We wanted to set something aside for them.

665
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:04,714
So that's pretty much what it is.

666
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:05,534
It's a trial.

667
00:54:05,554 --> 00:54:06,535
We're going to see how it works.

668
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:08,296
No, I think it's a great idea.

669
00:54:08,316 --> 00:54:12,919
So the total project has to be $10,000.

670
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:15,320
Is the total budget for that piece $25,000?

671
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,022
The total request for CPA funding would be $5,000, as long as the total project was $10,000.

672
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:22,645
So you put in $5,000 from some other source, we'd put in $5,000.

673
00:54:23,943 --> 00:54:30,025
If I could echo on that, one of the evaluation criteria is for matching funds as much as possible.

674
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:47,991
Not 100%, but it always, I think, and this is quite common in any grant application, if the applicant brings some money to the table to show that there's public support for it, and that money will go further, obviously, if we can spread that money and get matching.

675
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:50,892
It could be a one-to-one, or it could be a partial match.

676
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:58,858
I think that is one of the criteria that we evaluate, which most grant applications do, to benefit to the money to stretch as far as it can go.

677
00:54:59,438 --> 00:55:13,507
So we urge people, if they're looking for a $20,000 project, maybe they bring $5,000, $10,000, or even another $20,000 to the table, because it will obviously help the process and stretch the money further for the whole city.

678
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,100
And again, everything is a trial for this first year.

679
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,081
We've seen what other towns have done.

680
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:19,122
We're going to try it here.

681
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:19,762
If it works, great.

682
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:20,963
If it doesn't, we'll try something else.

683
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:30,029
And as far as in the other cities and towns that you've talked to, that small piece of the budget that was allocated to small projects, is that something that's been successful?

684
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:31,090
Oh, very successful.

685
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,011
Very successful.

686
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,312
That's why we wanted to implement it.

687
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:33,692
Good.

688
00:55:33,912 --> 00:55:34,252
Sounds good.

689
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:34,593
I like it.

690
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:35,053
Thank you.

691
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:37,055
Counselor Nice.

692
00:55:37,556 --> 00:55:38,997
Mr. President, thank you very much.

693
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:41,158
I just want to say, keep doing what you're doing.

694
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:42,759
You guys are doing an excellent job.

695
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:49,223
This is a group that's been very dedicated to this initiative and endeavor since collecting the signatures for the ballot drive back in 2015.

696
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:52,525
And to date, we've seen some great progress.

697
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:53,845
So I just want to thank you for your efforts.

698
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:55,546
This really is a marathon, not a sprint.

699
00:55:56,067 --> 00:56:03,071
And you guys have really been holding government's feet to the fire to make sure that this is done appropriately and in a fashion that's going to be successful.

700
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:04,812
So I want to thank you for your efforts and your hard work.

701
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:08,395
Again, keep doing what you're doing, because I think it's work, and the word's getting out there.

702
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:13,597
People are talking about it, and people are excited to see the fruits of the labor that has been put into this.

703
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:14,738
So thank you very much for your work.

704
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,000
Roberta Cameron, who's not here, obviously.

705
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,660
She's right behind you.

706
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,520
Oh, she's here.

707
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:20,961
Who's hiding behind me.

708
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:22,422
She's hiding behind us.

709
00:56:22,522 --> 00:56:23,923
Has been the driving force of this.

710
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:26,524
Really, the credit should go to her and the rest of the committee.

711
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,105
But she's been fantastic on this.

712
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,425
Yes, and we appreciate all the help that you are giving us because, again, we're new at this.

713
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,949
The more we communicate, the better the product is going to be at the end.

714
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,513
These progress reports will come on occasion.

715
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:40,655
We're not going to keep you in the dark.

716
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:42,977
We want to keep you involved as to what's happening.

717
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:47,102
Guide us, help us, and it's going to be a collaborative effort.

718
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:51,968
I thank you, Mr. President, again.

719
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:56,840
I thank typical Roberta sitting in the back and sitting down.

720
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,363
But again, this is

721
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,251
what people would be doing.

722
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,053
She's definitely not the lazy one.

723
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:14,803
But I will tell you, if you see what's going on in neighboring communities that have implemented the Community Preservation Act, and you see the small projects that are happening, it makes such a huge impact on the community.

724
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:17,385
And it really makes a neighborhood a true neighborhood again.

725
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:19,967
So I'm really excited to see that.

726
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:25,772
I think that one of the conversations I've had with different organizations, a lot of the youth organizations,

727
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,463
It's something as simple as getting the word out to their organizations.

728
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:35,990
For instance, Little League, Babe Ruth, Girls Softball, Youth Socket.

729
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:44,221
Those organizations talk about fields and some questions they've had because I know they've been trying to capture some funding through the city.

730
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:52,894
But everybody that voted for the CPA had talked about, well, this could be a viable source.

731
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:58,282
So I think this is another avenue that maybe we can tap into and reach out to those organizations.

732
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:15,367
There's one group that contacted me and I directed them right to the site, so I know that they're coming with a, it's not a huge project, but it's also a project that what I like to hear and like to see is that you have organizations that come

733
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,529
coming in that will be asking for something that they'll work for as well.

734
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,754
It's not just my hands out, give it to me so we can take care of this one group and that's it.

735
00:58:24,554 --> 00:58:37,664
I think that what's nice to see is the partnership to say, hey listen, this is what our community voted on and this is what hard people worked on to make this happen, but at the same time we want to do something great for our community

736
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:40,506
but we're willing to put in the work with you.

737
00:58:40,606 --> 00:58:47,410
So it's impressive to see the community stakeholders now as we move forward with this process.

738
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:59,457
So I'm, for one person who worked very hard with the recreation group and this being one of the pieces that when you talked about arts and not just sports and fields but

739
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:01,738
the whole gamut of what we can do.

740
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,459
I think it's really exciting to see.

741
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:05,421
So, again, I thank you for all your hard work.

742
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,863
I know Roberta's still sitting back there, but thank you for everything you've done.

743
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:12,606
And I'm, for one council, I'm very excited to see what's coming in front of us.

744
00:59:12,646 --> 00:59:13,506
So, thank you.

745
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:15,008
Council Member Kern.

746
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:15,648
Thank you.

747
00:59:16,048 --> 00:59:29,238
If we could just request a copy of the email that went out to the 200 organizations and people from Devens, Ms.

748
00:59:29,258 --> 00:59:29,558
Devens?

749
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:31,919
Danielle Evans.

750
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:32,700
Oh, Danielle Evans.

751
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:34,062
If we could get that email.

752
00:59:34,382 --> 00:59:44,633
And then I request that you just take another look and potentially, possibly push the first date two weeks just to get a little more, two to three weeks just to get a little more.

753
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:48,723
let the public know a little bit more.

754
00:59:48,763 --> 00:59:50,484
I feel like I get the transcript.

755
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,925
I didn't know of this date.

756
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:58,250
And I feel like I just want to make sure that it is potentially $1.2 million.

757
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:04,834
And I want to make sure that everybody and every organization is fully aware of this application date.

758
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:06,415
That's just my only request.

759
01:00:06,956 --> 01:00:07,196
Thank you.

760
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:07,776
Respectfully.

761
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:12,680
Roberta, did you want to say anything?

762
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:17,993
Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to hear everything that was said.

763
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:19,114
I kind of walked in in the middle.

764
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:32,879
But just in response to your last statement or request about the timeline is that we're squeezing the first round in because we're already a year overdue.

765
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:47,704
And we worked backwards from when we needed you to be able to approve the funds and worked backwards to give ourselves the minimal time that we felt that we needed to be able to consider each of the applications fully.

766
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:50,725
And that's what drove the December 15 date.

767
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:57,267
So we worked very hard to have the plan completed in time to be able to roll out the application.

768
01:00:59,548 --> 01:01:11,951
We've been doing the best that we can to get the word out about that, but as Doug mentioned earlier, the first hurdle, the eligibility determination form, is a very brief form.

769
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:19,993
So if people are aware of it, if they have a project that they think is ready to go for the first round, submit the form immediately.

770
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:24,854
If you have a project that needs a little bit more time to cook, submit for the second round.

771
01:01:25,194 --> 01:01:28,115
We'll take your eligibility application form any time.

772
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:34,819
And we can work with you to figure out which funding round you best fit into.

773
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:39,061
But there's a second funding round coming up this coming year.

774
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:46,545
So really the deadline is, if you look at it, March is your next chance to get in line.

775
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:54,519
Also, just if you submit an eligibility form, it does not commit you to doing that project immediately.

776
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,802
It could be done in the second round.

777
01:01:56,822 --> 01:01:57,983
You just want to know, is it eligible?

778
01:01:58,023 --> 01:02:00,446
You don't have to do it as quickly as possible.

779
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:04,210
I can tell you that I know the Berkshire State is going to submit like seven.

780
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,556
They're not going to do seven in one year.

781
01:02:06,576 --> 01:02:08,037
We're going to do that over three years.

782
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:10,159
We want to know if they're eligible just to get in line.

783
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,840
Might be only one or two.

784
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,522
And then, of course, we don't even know if they're going to be funded.

785
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:15,603
And obviously, I have a conflict of interest.

786
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:22,129
And I will recuse myself, as the counselor just did right now, earlier this evening on the evaluation.

787
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:24,991
So just getting the eligibility form is just the first step.

788
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:29,655
But it doesn't mean you're going to start building this in March of next year at all.

789
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:33,018
There'll be time to properly vet things.

790
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:35,728
Through the chair, thank you.

791
01:02:36,228 --> 01:02:37,829
Because maybe that's where I'm confused.

792
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:42,832
So the way I'm looking at the key dates, I think it's different than what you're saying.

793
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:48,055
Because December 15, it says that simple form is due for round one.

794
01:02:48,635 --> 01:02:52,798
And then it says March 2, full applications are due for round one.

795
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:55,259
But I asked the question, when will they be awarded?

796
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:57,300
And I thought you said March.

797
01:02:58,161 --> 01:03:00,582
No, they will be awarded in May.

798
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,344
So in April, we'll be having.

799
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:04,085
And that's my problem.

800
01:03:04,105 --> 01:03:06,826
So May isn't on this key date, which is confusing, I guess.

801
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,427
Yeah, and that is the key date for you.

802
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:11,529
So I should have put that on the memorandum for you.

803
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:23,738
The key date for the public is to know that they'll be asked, if they're applicants, they'll be asked to present to us publicly in April so that we can vet those projects before we recommend them to you.

804
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:27,440
And then we would ask for your, we'll give that,

805
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:32,003
the round of recommendations for your approval in May.

806
01:03:33,203 --> 01:03:45,730
Okay, so if an organization does not have the simple form done by the end of next week or December 15th, they are not eligible to fill out a full application for March 2nd?

807
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:55,875
Correct, but they will be eligible to submit the full application in September, or I'm sorry,

808
01:03:58,455 --> 01:03:59,075
For round two?

809
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:00,756
For round two, yes.

810
01:04:00,776 --> 01:04:05,319
Okay, so that's where I just find an issue with regards to this.

811
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:09,842
This is the first we've publicly kind of learned of the December 15th date.

812
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:16,786
Like I said, I try to stay on top of the politics on social media and the transcript.

813
01:04:16,806 --> 01:04:18,868
This is the first I'm learning of the December 15th date.

814
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:26,212
which even though there's going to be a round two, a lot of organizations may want to get in on that first round.

815
01:04:26,252 --> 01:04:35,694
I mean, they're going to know there's going to be less applicants, they're going to have more ability to potentially get some part of the CPA funding.

816
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:47,538
If you don't plan on meeting, you know, the week of Christmas and New Year's, I respectfully ask, I know it's time crunch, and I know how hard you work, but I just ask that we give this,

817
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:53,559
you know, full transparency to the public and definitely publicize this a little bit more.

818
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,621
That's really my only concern.

819
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:56,301
Yeah.

820
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:07,931
Did you mention that we also have a process where we will be willing to accept off-cycle applications?

821
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:08,352
Yes.

822
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:32,347
So if there's an applicant who has an urgent need for funding for a high priority project that doesn't fall within our timeline that we've laid out, we're willing to work with the applicant for those urgent high priority projects to meet the timeline that they need to consider their application.

823
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:35,561
Thank you.

824
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:36,462
Thank you.

825
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,924
Councilor Falco.

826
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:39,665
Thank you, Mr. President.

827
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:40,525
One quick question.

828
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:47,231
So as far as those projects go, those urgent projects, what would be an example of an urgent project that would be eligible for this type of funding?

829
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:50,120
A common example is property acquisition.

830
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,363
If there's an opportunity to make a property acquisition, it can't wait months.

831
01:05:55,124 --> 01:06:07,213
They would need to be able to line up the funding in a timely manner so that they can close on a property acquisition in the time that the market demands.

832
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:11,457
So like something that was maybe

833
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:19,074
potentially going to be developed, but the city had the option to buy it and prevent development, something like that?

834
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:19,575
Yes.

835
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,738
Okay, thank you very much.

836
01:06:21,918 --> 01:06:22,418
Councilor Nights.

837
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,080
Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

838
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,381
Second.

839
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:29,447
Motion by Councilor Nights to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

840
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:30,308
All those in favor.

841
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:30,728
Aye.

842
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:32,310
I'm sorry.

843
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:36,223
Name and address of the record.

844
01:06:36,263 --> 01:06:39,245
Thank you, Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford.

845
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:40,986
Good evening, honorable counselors.

846
01:06:41,006 --> 01:06:45,149
I guess this Tuesday must be Medford City Council meeting.

847
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:50,553
I have an idea for a CPA fix, if they could do this.

848
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:57,238
It may seem trivial to some of you, but presentation, I believe, is everything.

849
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:01,602
And I'm talking about the staple that's missing at 30 Salem Street.

850
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:02,903
As you're coming in,

851
01:07:04,576 --> 01:07:10,801
from Route 93, north or south, the only Route 16 exit, through the square.

852
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:20,929
In front of, or next door, I should say, to the Methodist Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, there's a church there at 30 Salem Street.

853
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:25,553
It's been missing the steeple for many years.

854
01:07:26,994 --> 01:07:28,695
And it is the gateway into the city.

855
01:07:31,117 --> 01:07:32,599
Now, I would think,

856
01:07:35,215 --> 01:07:39,939
It would be a good idea to place some sort of finial on there.

857
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:44,342
It doesn't have to be a full-blown, heavy-duty, original staple.

858
01:07:45,803 --> 01:07:50,167
However, anything would be better than a flat top.

859
01:07:51,688 --> 01:08:01,095
I think it would be appropriate in our downtown center as it is in most other downtowns I've been to, whether it's Chelsea, Malden, or especially Winchester.

860
01:08:01,115 --> 01:08:04,378
You should contact that group and have them file with the CPA.

861
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:09,788
to contact the church and have the church file an application.

862
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:15,690
Just feel for at least 25 years, it seems to me that I shouldn't be the one that brings it forward.

863
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,750
It should have been done a long time ago.

864
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:18,991
If it was structurally sound.

865
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:20,991
Thank you for listening.

866
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:21,411
Thank you.

867
01:08:23,572 --> 01:08:24,672
Communications from the mayor, 17787.

868
01:08:27,845 --> 01:08:43,371
Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approves the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $268,000.00 to fund repairs to Douglas Road due to a leak in the water main line causing flooding.

869
01:08:43,931 --> 01:08:46,352
The balance of retained earnings before this vote is $7,389,422.00.

870
01:08:46,412 --> 01:08:52,195
DDBW Commissioner Brian Kerins is present to answer any questions for the council regarding this matter.

871
01:08:58,108 --> 01:09:00,049
Mr. Kearns, name and address for the record, please.

872
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,492
Brian Kearns, Milton Terrace Hyde Park.

873
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:06,474
Do we have any questions for Mr. Kearns?

874
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:07,675
Councillor Falco.

875
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:08,956
Thank you, Mr. President.

876
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:10,517
Mr. Kearns, just a couple of quick questions.

877
01:09:10,557 --> 01:09:14,920
Can you just tell us a little bit about the water leak, the cause of the water leak, when it happens?

878
01:09:16,178 --> 01:09:24,943
It was brought to my attention by a constituent a little over a month ago that he was getting water in his basement.

879
01:09:25,823 --> 01:09:33,668
At that point in time, I had our water and sewer department dispatched out there to see where the source was potentially coming from.

880
01:09:34,848 --> 01:09:42,872
And the long and short of it is we narrowed it down to the actual main itself on the street.

881
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:47,334
And we had our own leak detection equipment out there.

882
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:52,216
We also called in MWRA to come in and assist us.

883
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:53,877
They have a more elaborate setup.

884
01:09:54,617 --> 01:10:00,500
Off peak time, daytime, nighttime, to try to narrow down exactly where this leak was occurring.

885
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:14,549
All right, and we've actually isolated it down to a 400-foot section of main that the leak is in, but we can't narrow it down any further than that because that whole area is impacted with clay.

886
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:22,154
Clay is actually acting as an insulation around the existing pipe that's there, and we're losing the sound.

887
01:10:22,194 --> 01:10:25,456
It's almost like sonar gear for a submarine, all right?

888
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:27,698
We can hear it, but then it stops.

889
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:38,080
Now, we've shut off the actual main itself, all right, in both directions, and when we do that, the leak in the home stops, okay?

890
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:45,762
So, as a result of that, we know that there is a leak that has occurred and is occurring within this 400-foot section.

891
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:52,744
Now, going back through the history, all right, obviously, this is Douglas Road, by the way, between Summer and George, all right?

892
01:10:53,324 --> 01:10:56,665
The water main that exists today was installed in 1927.

893
01:10:58,585 --> 01:11:16,106
It's a six inch main and given the age factor with tuberculation has occurred, there's probably maybe only a three inch clearance going through the existing pipe as it stands today, which is not uncommon in the water and sewer business.

894
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:23,714
The main service is 32 homes on that street.

895
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:33,684
Going through all the records and everything, it was just several years ago, the gas main was replaced on that entire street.

896
01:11:35,186 --> 01:11:50,137
Well, as a result of the age and the condition of this pipe, the amount of pipe that we already have to replace, meeting with the mayor, we both agreed to replace the entire main on the street.

897
01:11:51,777 --> 01:12:02,242
And to do it right away because even if we just replace that 400 foot section, through my experience in this business, once you touch something, it spreads.

898
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:06,963
And let's do it one stop shopping here.

899
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:09,244
Replace the entire main right away.

900
01:12:10,505 --> 01:12:17,948
We already have a contractor in the city who's actually working down on, I think it's one of the side streets down there.

901
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:22,550
I can have them start as early as next week to put the new main in.

902
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:27,852
Now, we put a winter binder on the main once it's installed.

903
01:12:29,072 --> 01:12:40,217
Then return in the spring because with the money that the DPW has requested, $268,000, that's also going to do curb-to-curb repaving in the spring.

904
01:12:41,277 --> 01:12:50,465
some casting adjustments and some new castings as needed, curbing adjustments as needed, and sidewalk replacement panels as needed.

905
01:12:50,505 --> 01:12:57,951
All right, we're gonna go full, full width down the entire length of that street, and that will, you know, to completely upgrade the street.

906
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:09,961
Actually, in addition to that, we're probably also gonna install an additional fire hydrant, okay, even though there's adequate fire suppression there, an additional one while we're installing, okay, the new main.

907
01:13:11,162 --> 01:13:14,247
It sounds like there's two parts to the project.

908
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:19,334
As far as replacing the main, putting in the new hydrant, how long will that take?

909
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:34,678
The new main, if he were to get the green light from the council this evening, he probably would be starting maybe actually a week from today, all right, or next Wednesday he'd start, and he could probably go within a couple of weeks.

910
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:39,462
Again, with weather, you know, that would also have to be the concern as well.

911
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:44,465
But, you know, we want to, you know, go right ahead and do it right away.

912
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:47,708
And, you know, within two weeks he'd have the new main in.

913
01:13:48,743 --> 01:13:59,225
So when they're actually installing the new main, what can the residents expect as far as will they be without water periods during the day, I imagine?

914
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:10,907
No, there'd be no loss of water service council because what we would do is we would install a temporary line that would be on the surface of the roadway in the gutter line going to the individual homes.

915
01:14:11,607 --> 01:14:16,908
And then at that point, we shut the main down and then excavate and start replacing it.

916
01:14:18,109 --> 01:14:24,153
So I actually took a ride down the street the other day just to kind of check out the situation and view it firsthand.

917
01:14:24,713 --> 01:14:27,495
And there's markings all over the place.

918
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:31,938
Actually, at one point, the street looks like it comes up on a mound.

919
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:34,020
It looks like something's going on underneath.

920
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,141
Yeah, it's the soil.

921
01:14:36,441 --> 01:14:43,365
Like I said, it's heavily loaded with clay in that area.

922
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:48,608
It's probably one of the worst types of soil you want to deal with.

923
01:14:48,668 --> 01:14:56,373
When we come back in in the spring and we scarify and do repaving, we'd be eliminating it at that point in time.

924
01:14:56,893 --> 01:15:03,437
Is there any concern, so when you connect that main on Douglas, that's connecting then to?

925
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:04,958
Yeah, it's Summer and George.

926
01:15:05,338 --> 01:15:06,219
Summer and George, okay.

927
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:08,400
Okay, and they're okay.

928
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,160
Those are newer mains?

929
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,101
Right, yeah, no problems there.

930
01:15:11,362 --> 01:15:18,186
But this will also include new T's, valves, shutoffs, be the full gamut on that street.

931
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:25,051
We can take advantage of it because, like I said, it was only several years ago the new gas main was installed there.

932
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:30,575
So I'm not concerned with the utility companies coming in for an emergency at any point in time in the near future.

933
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:37,848
I mean, it sounds like, I mean, it's almost 100 years old, so it sounds like the whole thing probably should be replaced, but thank you very much.

934
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:38,708
Okay, thank you, sir.

935
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:39,989
Counselor Del Rosso.

936
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:43,170
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

937
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:53,175
If I could, through the chair, say thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this forward and taking the course of action that you're taking in repairing this.

938
01:15:54,175 --> 01:16:03,741
I think it's an appropriate use of this money, and it's going to go a long way in giving a good quality of life to the citizens there.

939
01:16:04,582 --> 01:16:05,002
Thank you.

940
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:18,390
I know your staff does excellent work in communicating to the neighbors what they're going to encounter in these projects, and I can only foresee this going well.

941
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:20,111
So thank you very much.

942
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:21,632
Good luck, Mr. President.

943
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:23,013
Mr. Chairman, move approval.

944
01:16:24,508 --> 01:16:26,309
On the motion of approval, Councilwoman Locarno.

945
01:16:26,369 --> 01:16:27,570
Thank you, Vice President Marks.

946
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:37,097
If you could just explain, Commissioner Karens, a little bit more about how you're going to potentially start the work very shortly, and then you're going to finish it in the spring.

947
01:16:37,117 --> 01:16:40,020
Will the road be closed back up and then reopened?

948
01:16:40,756 --> 01:16:48,218
Yeah, okay, right now the contractor, as a matter of fact, he's on, I think it's a Linden Street, actually putting a new water main in there.

949
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:58,340
What we would do is we would put in the temporary water lines that would go into the homes, the 32 homes in that street.

950
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,321
And then at that point in time, saw, cut, and excavate a trench exposing the existing pipe.

951
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:09,582
Excavate it, remove it, and install the new pipe.

952
01:17:11,023 --> 01:17:13,627
backfill with clean fill and not clay.

953
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:23,201
All right, tamper it down, put a winter patch on it, energize it, chlorinate it, and then remove the temporary pipe that we had installed in the homes.

954
01:17:24,783 --> 01:17:25,743
And they'll be done now?

955
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:27,404
Yeah, OK.

956
01:17:27,784 --> 01:17:29,784
That's the process.

957
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:37,346
If they're going to be without water at any point in time, it's when we're going to be connecting up the temporary line from the permanent line.

958
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,887
Probably an hour's job, OK, they'd be without water.

959
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,567
But they would certainly get plenty of notification.

960
01:17:43,907 --> 01:17:46,748
And it would happen at an off-peak time.

961
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:51,869
So that way, we're not concerned with people trying to get to work in the morning, lacking water for showers, and so forth.

962
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:54,390
At the same time, we don't want to inconvenience people at night.

963
01:17:56,032 --> 01:17:59,378
You had mentioned there's going to be no loss of water, so I believe you on that one.

964
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:08,134
Could you just clarify, will the street be – you had mentioned doing some of the work now and then doing the rest in the spring.

965
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:10,579
so the street will remain open?

966
01:18:10,779 --> 01:18:13,500
The street will remain passable at all times.

967
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:23,723
The only time that the street may be shut down will be in the spring, when we coal plane it and repave the entire street.

968
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:36,508
So depending on the location of the equipment, at the time when they resurface it in the spring, it'll only be like a temporary shutdown till we either remove the old existing asphalt or install the new asphalt.

969
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:41,128
And the reason we can't do the whole project now?

970
01:18:41,228 --> 01:18:44,230
The weather is coming upon us, Council.

971
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,830
That's correct.

972
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,491
So too cold to repave.

973
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:48,173
OK, that's correct.

974
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:50,174
That's the only step that needs to be done in the spring.

975
01:18:50,194 --> 01:18:51,075
That's correct, yeah.

976
01:18:51,155 --> 01:18:53,016
OK, and some casting adjustments.

977
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:56,579
OK, manholes.

978
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:59,200
Manhole either adjustments or replacements.

979
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:05,165
And then also curbing, realignment, and then possibly some sidewalk work.

980
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:11,822
So how will Douglas Road be left from when you finish the first portion until the spring?

981
01:19:11,842 --> 01:19:19,588
It'll be a long, fresh patch, trench patch, down the center of the road.

982
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:24,623
And then in the springtime, we'll return.

983
01:19:24,643 --> 01:19:26,485
And pave the whole streets?

984
01:19:26,525 --> 01:19:27,345
That's correct.

985
01:19:27,365 --> 01:19:29,366
But the trench patch will be safe?

986
01:19:29,386 --> 01:19:30,807
Or are we going to be blocking it off?

987
01:19:30,827 --> 01:19:32,468
No, it'll be up to street grade.

988
01:19:32,749 --> 01:19:34,249
It'll be a winter hot top.

989
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,050
Gotcha.

990
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,051
That's what I'm trying to get.

991
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:36,191
OK.

992
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:36,371
OK.

993
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:37,151
Winter hot top.

994
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:37,271
Yeah.

995
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:37,391
OK.

996
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,954
DPW has its own language on some of these terms.

997
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:47,419
Okay, so there'll be a winter hot tub, everything will be safe, and then in the spring we're going to repave the whole street, do any sidewalk repair.

998
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:48,220
That's correct, Councilor.

999
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,141
Thank you.

1000
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:50,262
Thank you, Councilor.

1001
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:51,102
Councilor Scott Pelley.

1002
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:52,603
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1003
01:19:53,924 --> 01:19:58,048
I can feel my phone blowing up already from Parris Street and Evans Street.

1004
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:02,651
This is being done because there's a major water leak.

1005
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:09,533
And those projects are still on course as we've talked about for the spring, correct?

1006
01:20:09,593 --> 01:20:11,434
Yeah, nothing's been compromised.

1007
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:14,395
I can just only imagine.

1008
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:18,616
So again, this is because there's a major water leak in that area that needs to be done.

1009
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:19,456
That's correct.

1010
01:20:19,576 --> 01:20:19,976
OK.

1011
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:24,357
Matter of fact, I have almost weekly dialogue with two of the homeowners out there.

1012
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:26,958
And they've been very, very patient and understanding.

1013
01:20:27,258 --> 01:20:29,978
But they also know there's a process that we have to go through.

1014
01:20:30,518 --> 01:20:31,179
I can understand that.

1015
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:32,039
Thank you, Mr. Cairns.

1016
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:32,559
Thank you.

1017
01:20:32,919 --> 01:20:34,079
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

1018
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:35,120
Councilor Knight.

1019
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,880
Thank you, Mr. President.

1020
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,261
Mr. Kearns, can you tell me who the contractor is that's been selected to perform the work, if the money is appropriate?

1021
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:45,163
Kydilla Construction, Councilor, who's presently in the city doing work.

1022
01:20:46,103 --> 01:20:48,084
And in your experiences, do you think that this is a

1023
01:20:49,432 --> 01:20:51,594
A-plus outfit, B-minus outfit?

1024
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:52,715
An A-plus.

1025
01:20:53,336 --> 01:21:04,746
I had actually the owner, Mark Cardillo, in my office yesterday to lay out potentially this job coming up if the council were to approve it.

1026
01:21:05,386 --> 01:21:11,532
I wanted to know if he was capable of taking it on in addition to the responsibilities that he presently has on board.

1027
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:14,053
And, you know, he was.

1028
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:15,674
I've seen his work.

1029
01:21:16,114 --> 01:21:17,295
I've seen his equipment.

1030
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:21,297
And, you know, I'm pretty confident we'll, you know, get it done and done right.

1031
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:22,237
Excellent.

1032
01:21:22,257 --> 01:21:22,537
Thank you.

1033
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:26,339
Move the question, Mr. President.

1034
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:27,280
Motion of approval.

1035
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,260
All those in favor?

1036
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:29,181
Roll call.

1037
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:29,661
Opposed?

1038
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:31,142
The roll call vote has been requested.

1039
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,062
Councilor Thompson?

1040
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:37,503
Yes.

1041
01:21:37,723 --> 01:21:38,245
Councilor Lange?

1042
01:21:38,285 --> 01:21:38,545
Yes.

1043
01:21:38,586 --> 01:21:39,809
Councilor Kern?

1044
01:21:39,849 --> 01:21:40,049
Yes.

1045
01:21:40,089 --> 01:21:43,278
Councilor Kerrio?

1046
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:43,538
Yes.

1047
01:21:45,316 --> 01:21:46,137
Councilor Scott Beally?

1048
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:46,437
Yes.

1049
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:47,738
Vice President Marks?

1050
01:21:47,918 --> 01:21:48,258
Yes.

1051
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,479
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1052
01:21:50,499 --> 01:21:51,820
The motion is adopted.

1053
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:54,942
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1054
01:21:54,982 --> 01:21:57,223
Suspend the rules, take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

1055
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:58,044
All those in favor?

1056
01:21:58,064 --> 01:21:58,304
Aye.

1057
01:21:58,644 --> 01:21:59,665
Opposed, the ayes have it.

1058
01:22:00,946 --> 01:22:12,233
Offered by Council President Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Marguerite Regan, teacher of over 40 years at the Swan School.

1059
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:15,192
Thank you, Mr. President.

1060
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:33,662
Mr. President, Mrs. Regan has been a teacher in this system for 40 years, and there's not many teachers that can make that claim, and she recently passed away this week, and I'd like to send condolences to her family this week, if we could have a moment of silence, Mr. President, in memory of her.

1061
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:35,203
All rise for a moment of silence.

1062
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:52,448
offered by President Caviello.

1063
01:22:52,568 --> 01:23:08,537
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have a representative from the bicycle company give the city a plan on how they are picking up the bicycles that are being left over the city for several days at a time.

1064
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:09,698
Councilor.

1065
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:11,679
Thank you Mr. President.

1066
01:23:14,095 --> 01:23:21,161
We have this new company that you sort of pick up a bike any way you want, you leave it any way you want.

1067
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:26,306
But as you're going around the city, you're seeing them left in the middle of sidewalks and all over the place.

1068
01:23:26,326 --> 01:23:37,275
There's been a bicycle in particular that sat on the rotary over at Winter Street for the last five days, and now it's gone from the rotary over to the sidewalk on Winter Street.

1069
01:23:37,996 --> 01:23:41,459
And I've seen them left over at the school and all over the city.

1070
01:23:42,858 --> 01:23:54,925
I don't know, I've never seen a plan or anything to how this company got into the city or even does business here.

1071
01:23:55,766 --> 01:24:04,471
So if the city can have some type of, we can get some type of representative to either come to the council or somebody from the city to let us know how this company operates.

1072
01:24:04,491 --> 01:24:09,554
And they say you just can't leave stuff in the middle of sidewalks for days at a time and not pick them up.

1073
01:24:10,194 --> 01:24:11,694
So that's been a concern.

1074
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:22,437
Like I said, there's been a particular one that sat on the rotary of Winthrop Street right in the middle for five days, and now somebody took it off, and it's on the sidewalk on Winthrop Street.

1075
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:31,499
So again, we could have somebody from that, either have somebody come here, or somebody from the city give us a plan on how this company works, or some kind of contact with them.

1076
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:33,280
I don't even know where these people are from.

1077
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,481
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1078
01:24:39,632 --> 01:24:40,533
Council Member Curran.

1079
01:24:41,113 --> 01:24:45,737
Thank you, Vice President Mox, and thanks for bringing up Council Member Carviello.

1080
01:24:45,837 --> 01:24:58,948
I actually just ran out to the DPW Commissioner to get an update on Marshall Street in issue and also the bike left on Winthrop Rotary because I had emailed the Mayor's office this morning to see if they had that company's contact.

1081
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:01,248
It's on the sidewalk now.

1082
01:25:01,508 --> 01:25:06,869
They didn't have a contact, I don't believe, because they called Mr. Karens to try to go remove it.

1083
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,210
So we definitely need a contact.

1084
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:16,091
And I think it's the Maldon's new pilot program they're using, and the bikes are being left on Medford streets all over.

1085
01:25:16,531 --> 01:25:18,091
So we do need to get a handle on it.

1086
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:23,072
He said he's going to remove the one on Winthrop Street right after he takes pitches, hopefully tomorrow.

1087
01:25:23,152 --> 01:25:25,553
So I just wanted to point of information on that.

1088
01:25:25,873 --> 01:25:26,113
Thank you.

1089
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:30,727
On the motion, all those in favor, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1090
01:25:31,688 --> 01:25:34,510
All those opposed, the ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

1091
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:45,356
Paper from Councilor Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the Traffic Department look into illegal parking of out-of-state automobiles on Cherry Street.

1092
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:47,497
Councilor Scott Pelley.

1093
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:48,638
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1094
01:25:48,738 --> 01:25:50,859
I received a few phone calls on

1095
01:25:52,851 --> 01:26:03,494
automobiles that are being left in front of residential homes that are resided by some seniors and the cars are left there for days at a time.

1096
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:21,278
If we could just have someone from the traffic enforcement office or Officer Hardin and maybe reach out and just take a few trips down there to Cherry Street and maybe do a little extra enforcement and making sure that these out of state cars aren't left here overnight for a long period of time.

1097
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:22,458
Thank you.

1098
01:26:23,419 --> 01:26:25,301
Thank you Mr. President.

1099
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:40,015
I want to thank Council colleague for bringing this forward tonight because I think this is an issue that is coming up more and more throughout our community and if I could just amend the resolution to also include Tainter Street, Everett Street and lower Fulton Street as well between

1100
01:26:41,937 --> 01:26:43,558
Salem Street and Webster Street.

1101
01:26:44,638 --> 01:26:50,521
That whole area, that whole block, there's a lot of cars down there with out of state plates.

1102
01:26:51,202 --> 01:26:54,063
And it's an issue that really needs to be addressed.

1103
01:26:54,103 --> 01:26:58,845
And I believe it's happening in other sections of the city or other neighborhoods of the city as well.

1104
01:26:59,606 --> 01:27:02,867
But it's a resolution that I certainly support.

1105
01:27:03,007 --> 01:27:04,048
So I second the resolution.

1106
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:12,115
On the motion offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, amended further by Councilor Falco.

1107
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:13,397
