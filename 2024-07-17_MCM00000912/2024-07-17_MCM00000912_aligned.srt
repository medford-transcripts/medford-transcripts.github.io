00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome to the final report subcommittee of the Medford Charter Study Committee for July 15, 2024.

2
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:13,244
I've been heard from Daveed.

3
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:19,490
I think Gene might show up, I hope, but we do have a quorum, so we're going to go ahead.

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:47,719
last time we just we we talked about the drafting and um gene is still drafting some parts and i drafted a bunch and i know phyllis made some comments and it looks like gene made a bunch of comments one thing that we didn't really i love the comments the comments are great

5
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:52,211
We didn't talk about like how we're gonna, I guess, I don't know.

6
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:54,374
I guess I'll just accept whatever I want to accept.

7
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:54,774
I don't know.

8
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:57,919
I'll accept some and then we can review them again.

9
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:58,519
How's that?

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,421
Good.

11
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:00,362
Okay.

12
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:01,624
That's great.

13
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:06,010
So I will review comments and

14
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:27,311
I guess one thing I was wondering for people who did look at it, the other thing I wanted people to do, and Jean may have done it, I haven't looked that much at her comments, but is to say if there's something that we should, I mean, obviously, everything is in our draft charter, right?

15
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:35,315
But we're highlighting things in that sort of recommendations in the report part, sort of we want to highlight the,

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,402
sort of big decisions, the changes, and the rationale.

17
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:45,404
So if there's something that maybe wasn't included that should be in there, that would be good to know.

18
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:55,789
And then the other thing that we need to do is the appendix.

19
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:04,053
So I made a folder in our subcommittee folder.

20
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:15,399
In addition to all those drafts of the different art, you know, the report itself, there's a folder that says appendix materials.

21
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:24,620
So if, you know, I mean, the other thing we were talking about is how much do we put in the appendix?

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,321
It's going to be long.

23
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,521
I mean, the charter is long.

24
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:33,482
And then, but, you know, we seem to think last time that it was important to include

25
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,637
some of the materials we use.

26
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:41,277
So right now what's in there is three memos from the Collins Center.

27
00:02:43,098 --> 00:03:01,962
The generic charter that we used as a framework, the comparison of mayor and manager forms of government that we used to help us decide to keep mayor, and the memo they gave us on the authority of Medford's mayor, which was one of the things we had asked for because

28
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:09,254
of the impression that Medford's mayor has more power than other mayors in the state.

29
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,075
And we found out that that's not the case.

30
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,796
I think those have to be in the appendix, those things.

31
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,717
Yeah.

32
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,298
And then we're going to make footnotes of studies we looked at.

33
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:30,200
We also are going to have to put the, I mean, I was hoping David would be here.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,261
I might ask him to,

35
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,804
We need to put the survey in the report in a digestible way, right?

36
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,367
You know, the results of the survey.

37
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,633
Right, some results, but not all of them.

38
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:51,137
I mean, the survey has to go, the entire survey has to go in the appendix also.

39
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,678
The entire, right.

40
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:55,881
So, but you know, right.

41
00:03:55,961 --> 00:04:01,966
So, but I don't know, like, it has to be exported from Google surveys and put into some kind of form.

42
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:02,747
That's what I mean.

43
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,168
And David is a graduate student.

44
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,629
He should be able to do all of this, right?

45
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,812
He probably has what's called EndNote on his computer.

46
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,875
He probably has the latest software where he can just do this kind of thing.

47
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:19,438
I know when I was doing my doctoral studies, I know I had a program like that, and it was fabulous.

48
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:20,059
OK.

49
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,259
So he must have that.

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,324
I'm going to ask him to just sort of put the survey into some formatting that works.

51
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,286
Yeah.

52
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:36,848
Jean already created a report for the listening session.

53
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:40,810
So we want to put that in there too.

54
00:04:41,190 --> 00:05:00,678
And she's also writing a little, a little, you know, we're going to put all, we're going to put the survey, the listening sessions report in the, in the actual appendix, but she's also writing a little section for the report about all the community engagement we did.

55
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,171
So the data that was collected from the survey, who analyzed that data?

56
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:08,192
David.

57
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:14,154
So then David should be, listen, he can do this, there's no question.

58
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,376
David has a survey, he has the results, he has that.

59
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,561
That can be his contribution toward the end here.

60
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,462
And he's got it.

61
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:26,182
So it's not going to be a big jump for him.

62
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:27,183
That's right.

63
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,103
So he will do that.

64
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:36,126
The other pieces we had, and then we had all the listening sessions, which Gene made a great report about.

65
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:41,547
But we also had the three sessions at City Hall.

66
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:43,428
We had Wright's Pond.

67
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:44,608
We had the farmer's market.

68
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:45,729
We had Circle the Square.

69
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:50,711
And we also had a form on our website.

70
00:05:51,192 --> 00:06:00,820
So we also have this sort of also this collection of community feedback that doesn't easily fall into the listening sessions.

71
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:11,450
So I'll work on trying to put that together, but somehow we have to figure out the best way to present it in the report.

72
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:22,482
Yeah, but we also need to, I'm not sure what category falls in when we sat down with the mayor's assistant.

73
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:25,084
The interviews.

74
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,985
So let's talk about that.

75
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:31,567
What were you going to say about the community feedback, Phyllis?

76
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,690
Well, what I was going to say is, can we not just reference?

77
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,892
So let's say we had the sessions that we had at City Hall.

78
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:39,592
They're recorded.

79
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:43,813
can we not just say you can refer to, I mean, that's a public document.

80
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,173
Yes, we can do that.

81
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,074
We can do that, you're right.

82
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,374
That's a public document for those.

83
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,575
That's a good point, Phyllis, too.

84
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,016
It'll save a lot of space.

85
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:53,396
Yeah.

86
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,057
Yeah, absolutely.

87
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,457
Good point.

88
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,838
So the other thing is then those comments that came in through the form.

89
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:04,339
And the other question, and I'm writing interviews down because I want to talk about that next.

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:04,900
Yeah.

91
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:16,543
In the survey, we had the survey questions and then we have the results of that, but then there were comments, pages of comments.

92
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:36,115
I don't, you know, so so we have like a lot of public comment that so maybe what we need to do is take those public comments and the things we got from our, you know, email and maybe put them into categories.

93
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:51,583
You know, in a folder as a reference folder or someone, you know, make note of it in the in the document for people to go in and to review comments from fellow citizens and so forth like that.

94
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:54,164
Keep it short and sweet.

95
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:55,706
I agree, Murray.

96
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,147
Those should not all be in the document.

97
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,109
If people want to see those, we could say, okay, this is the file.

98
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,671
You can access that information here.

99
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,472
Yeah.

100
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:10,056
We can put it all into Google and make a link that's publicly available.

101
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:10,936
That's right.

102
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:15,560
Make a link to City Hall or the Charter Study Committee that is on the city's webpage.

103
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,930
So, I'll work on putting those together.

104
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:29,917
Some of them, you know, some of the people who submitted forms and even their names are there, but I'm going to redact all that.

105
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:30,718
Right.

106
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:33,900
Okay.

107
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:35,982
Now, the interview.

108
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,344
I think one way you could do that, Milba is,

109
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:48,535
You could do public responses, and then you could do a private response, whatever we're calling it, official or city employee forms.

110
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:52,036
You could do a public and a private kind of category.

111
00:08:52,156 --> 00:09:03,340
And then I think we don't want to get too caught up in making too many pockets for people to go to, because then they'll say, oh, they're making it difficult for us to get to it.

112
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:04,841
Yeah.

113
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,882
So I think the listening sessions,

114
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:13,987
the Rights Pond things, the documents, those can all go in one folder.

115
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:14,768
Right.

116
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,112
And we can title them.

117
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,475
Anybody wants to pick up a specific, oh, this happened.

118
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:25,479
And even the interviews, there's no reason to listen.

119
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,844
Put it all together on one group, all different titles.

120
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:30,344
Okay.

121
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:31,245
Yeah.

122
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:36,587
Well, we're going to talk about the interviews in one second.

123
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:37,087
Hi, Gene.

124
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:38,168
Hi, Gene.

125
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,849
I just want to catch up, Gene.

126
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:52,934
So basically, we're going to ask Daveed to just kind of put a survey result into whatever program he has that works, that we can actually put into the report.

127
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,375
But we were talking about what to do with

128
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:05,175
We have that Google sheet, that issues sheet that you created, so that has a good amount of public feedback.

129
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:11,384
But then we also have a lot of comments that people made when they took the survey.

130
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:12,938
Yeah.

131
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,999
And we also have some emails that we got.

132
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:16,820
Right.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,462
But Melba, the survey information should all stay in one spot.

134
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:27,745
The comments should not necessarily be separated out from the data that's analyzed from the survey.

135
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:29,825
That should all be one thing.

136
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:37,949
I mean, when I did my survey comments, I had to keep them with the survey analytics.

137
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:38,629
OK.

138
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,090
So go ahead, Jean.

139
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,308
I haven't written this yet, so take all your comments under advisement.

140
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:56,976
It's happening this week, but we could put in some comments just to, as examples, you know, like I might look- In the body of the report.

141
00:10:57,196 --> 00:11:06,563
In the community engagement section, like we put a little pullout boxes just for examples, but I agree, it could all just go in one place for the- Yeah.

142
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:17,027
Well, Jean, what I'm thinking about is, I mean, because otherwise we will have the survey data and then we'll just have a long list of comments, right?

143
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:24,692
And then we'll have a long list of comments from other places, but the Google sheets, the issue sheets you created,

144
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:35,668
It would be labor intensive maybe to put all the comments in there, but that had categories where it said where the comments came from, right?

145
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:40,370
So we had said this feedback was from the city hall session.

146
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:46,133
This feedback was from, and then we could say these were comments from the survey.

147
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,094
So we could also do that, right?

148
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:48,955
Does that make sense?

149
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:49,755
I see.

150
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,758
So we decided not to put the listening sessions

151
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:58,025
in that big feed I created.

152
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:03,127
Well, you have a report that you created for the listening chat sessions.

153
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,488
And we'll put that right into the final report.

154
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,849
Right.

155
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,810
I'm just thinking of the actual comments that were written down by people.

156
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,410
Sure.

157
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,411
We could do that.

158
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:14,992
We could do that.

159
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:19,013
Maybe it's a link to the Google Doc.

160
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,334
Maybe you uploaded it in the report.

161
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:22,134
Exactly.

162
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:22,695
Yeah.

163
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,862
people wanna go and look at it, they can see.

164
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:34,744
And that looks very thorough because I think some of the, what we're hearing is people are concerned that we didn't get a lot of community engagement.

165
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:37,145
That way.

166
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,986
I'll look at putting it to the goal.

167
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,287
Well, I think it's really important.

168
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:51,750
The point you just bring up, Jean, I think somewhere in the document that we're presenting, it has to say, this is the community engagement we received.

169
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,062
This is what we experienced from the community, then if they want the breakdown, they can go to that link.

170
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,743
Yeah, gene is writing that right?

171
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:00,263
Yeah.

172
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:00,823
Yeah.

173
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:05,085
I mean, I referenced it in the introductory letter, but just quickly.

174
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:05,825
I saw that.

175
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:06,365
Yeah.

176
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,927
So, so, yeah, we're going to have that.

177
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:26,002
The other, so all right, so I'll work on that with the issue sheets, and I'll at the very least put together all the comments that we've received, because some of them came in by email, and I had shared them when they came in, but the interviews.

178
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:34,229
I feel like, so we had an interview form, but not everybody we interviewed filled out, right?

179
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,853
We may have three or four of those that were actually filled out by the person we interviewed,

180
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:44,939
And then we have the interview reports, which were sort of like notes from the interview.

181
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:55,281
But I don't know, I guess I'm, I don't know about including those or making them public.

182
00:13:55,861 --> 00:14:00,042
No, we didn't tell, like I did two or three interviews.

183
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,483
We did not say we were gonna make them public.

184
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:05,303
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:09,404
We did that purposely so that they could be free to tell us.

186
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:11,197
Like Donato.

187
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:12,958
Exactly.

188
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,018
I don't know if they want to be on the record.

189
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:16,259
Yeah.

190
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,660
And we made those notes so that we could, you know, just the committee could use them.

191
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:29,262
So, uh, so my feeling is that we should just say that we interviewed these people maybe, but not, what do you think Jean?

192
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,643
We don't have to include the transcripts of those.

193
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:30,883
Yeah.

194
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,963
Do you agree?

195
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:37,765
I think we should, we could say something like we interviewed these people, um,

196
00:14:40,027 --> 00:15:01,242
we're not including them, the transcripts of those interviews because we, I'm just trying to think of, and maybe you guys can wordsmith this better, that we wanted to encourage free and open conversation about the charter and did not say that we would make these public.

197
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:05,006
Like, we just want something like that, like some, you know.

198
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,267
Yeah, you're close, Jean.

199
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:21,881
I know what you're saying, but maybe our, you know, elected, not elected officials, but members of the political side of government or something like that.

200
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:22,482
And, you know.

201
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,854
Can we make it go really without naming names?

202
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:36,903
You can put the council school committee, state representative may as assistant clerk or something like that without superintendent.

203
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,544
Well, we could yeah.

204
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:45,915
I'll put together just a list of the people that we interviewed.

205
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:47,016
Jean, how about that?

206
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:47,876
And I'll send it to you.

207
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:48,617
Sure.

208
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,697
We could do a list.

209
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:51,638
We could do key themes, too.

210
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:55,180
We could also say these key themes came from the interviews.

211
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,480
That's true.

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,702
We can aggregate the data.

213
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:08,586
But then just say the individual transcripts, we offered them confidentiality to encourage free discussion.

214
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:17,421
How about if we just said we conducted off-the-record interviews with X number of city councilors?

215
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:24,028
The minute you use a word like off-the-record, people's heads shoot up.

216
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,389
Yeah, okay.

217
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,511
I know what you're getting at.

218
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:29,372
No, no, I know.

219
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:32,834
No, you're hiding.

220
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,436
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

221
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:34,856
You're right.

222
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:39,940
And I would just simply put, we interviewed and sought input and feedback from the following.

223
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,162
I think that's, I think that's right.

224
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,723
I don't think we need to explain a lot.

225
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:45,725
We had surveys, city officials, you know, whatever.

226
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,127
Maybe group it all into one without saying anything.

227
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:04,585
Okay.

228
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:11,330
So Jean, just so you have the data of exactly like how many people we interviewed and who they were, I'll send you a list of the people.

229
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:18,395
And also in there, there are some interview reports if you want to look at them to pull out general themes.

230
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:28,483
But the only thing about pulling out general, I don't know, would it, would it be, does that take like a data analyst?

231
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:29,263
I don't know.

232
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:31,225
You know, like what if,

233
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,095
Oh, three people said this, so we can call it a general theme.

234
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,277
You know what I mean?

235
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,500
Like, how do we determine what a general theme is?

236
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,907
Yeah, it'd be nice if it was a couple of...

237
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:49,968
I mean, when I've done this in the past, I would do something like we did with the model charter.

238
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:54,649
Like we do an Excel spreadsheet and we could put the themes and then we could put who said it.

239
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:59,750
And then if you had a majority of people, it would be your, but it is a little bit of work.

240
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:12,514
And the other thing that I feel like a lot of people that we interviewed, like, you know, maybe they would say, well, I'm in favor of such and such, maybe under these circumstances or you know what I mean?

241
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:23,640
I think you should say that we interviewed these people and we discussed the following topics or whatever.

242
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,041
Or even just say why we interviewed them.

243
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:26,762
Right.

244
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:39,509
Because it was really almost for our own, so that we could understand more about their jobs and how certain things might affect their jobs or what their experience.

245
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,150
Yeah, we were seeking clarification from them.

246
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,971
Yeah.

247
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,886
Yeah, we also got history history.

248
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,028
Yeah, exactly.

249
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:48,649
Yeah.

250
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,651
Yeah, so those kinds of things.

251
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:52,233
Okay, so that's good.

252
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,879
The other thing we were discussing on gene before you got here was the appendix.

253
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,265
So, a lot of the stuff that we've just been talking about.

254
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:12,241
I'll make a link like for that public feedback, but we're definitely putting so far in the folder I created in our subcommittee folder, folder within a folder.

255
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,042
There's three memos from the Collins Center.

256
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,384
I also, I haven't put it in yet, but I have it.

257
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,105
Your listening sessions report is going to go in there.

258
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:21,205
Okay.

259
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:30,902
And I guess what else do we need to attach?

260
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:36,830
We're going to put that public feedback we just discussed in a link.

261
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,114
And then we're also going to have some footnotes to studies.

262
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,357
Those won't be in the appendix per se.

263
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:43,518
They'll just be footnoted.

264
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:45,074
Yeah.

265
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,695
What else do you think we need in the appendix?

266
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:51,596
Well, the survey, the actual survey will go on the appendix.

267
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,776
Survey questions.

268
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:57,277
The interview questions for the, like not the answers, but just the template we used.

269
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,517
The template that we used.

270
00:19:59,077 --> 00:19:59,757
Yeah.

271
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:03,558
The template we used for the listening sessions.

272
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:03,818
Yeah.

273
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,899
You know, the questions that we had, but not the answers.

274
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,099
Not the answers, yeah.

275
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,120
Will you put that in the appendix, Jane?

276
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:11,840
Sure.

277
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,700
Okay.

278
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,509
Is there anything else from the Collins Center that we have to put in the appendices?

279
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,311
You referenced quite a few.

280
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,852
I have three in there.

281
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:24,893
Three, yeah.

282
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:42,461
You know, it's funny because some of the things we got from the Collins Center were kind of like official memos that were on Collins and stationary, but some of them were some of it was just sort of in more informal like, you know, so.

283
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:52,090
So I put the memos in there that were, I felt like were relevant to our final report that were official.

284
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,412
You know what I mean?

285
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:10,480
What about the slides that we did at the, I guess maybe just, I don't know, the ward representation slide where the... What do you think?

286
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,661
Should we put that in the appendix?

287
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:15,616
Slide presentation.

288
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,497
I think I would leave that on the link.

289
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:23,918
Just leave it in the general public access link.

290
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:24,999
OK.

291
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,900
Yeah, we're going to link to those.

292
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,082
This final report is going to all be electronic, right?

293
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:41,123
So maybe, Jean, when you make the, no, they'd have to be separate.

294
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,544
I was going to say you could hyperlink.

295
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:56,394
Let me think about how I've got to come up with, I've got to find the links to the, they were all on CCTV and we recorded the Zoom, we recorded the Zoom.

296
00:21:56,614 --> 00:22:03,417
That's the other thing is how do we, maybe we should just link to the TV recording because it's easier to watch than the Zoom recording, right?

297
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:06,285
I was just thinking the slides.

298
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:18,147
No, what we were saying was that the three City Hall events we did, we would just link to those recordings so people could watch them and then they would see the slides, right?

299
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:24,268
So now that's another question, should we also pull out the slide presentation and include it in the appendix?

300
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,949
But I was sort of going off on what links are we going to use for that?

301
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,790
So in the community engagement section, I would just link to those.

302
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,763
I was thinking we could hyperlink them.

303
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:38,925
Yeah, but then you'd have to have three.

304
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:40,607
Yeah, you could.

305
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,588
I don't know.

306
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:42,849
You can think about that.

307
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:45,171
We'll think about the best way to include those links.

308
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,133
I can put the date if you click on the date.

309
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:48,894
Exactly.

310
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:49,334
Yeah.

311
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:58,119
And like I said, we have Zoom recordings of them, but it might be better to find them on the CCTV, because those are easier to look.

312
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,019
Right?

313
00:22:59,699 --> 00:22:59,880
Right.

314
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,781
And also, they would have, if it wouldn't be just the slide, it would be the conversation that took place regarding the slides.

315
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:06,721
Yeah.

316
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:11,763
I mean, two of those were kind of slow turnout.

317
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,664
Well, actually, maybe we should use the Zoom for that reason.

318
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:18,945
But the Ward one, we had more engagement.

319
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:19,965
Yeah.

320
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,943
Did we have three or four at City Hall?

321
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,964
We might have had, I said three in my letter, but now I'm thinking maybe we had four.

322
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:41,406
Because we had one sort of general information section, then we have Ward 1, the one that we focused on ward representation, and then was there one or two after that?

323
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:44,287
I have to look that up.

324
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,007
I looked through my calendar.

325
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,647
Yeah, I'll have to look that up.

326
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:50,188
Okay, let me write that down.

327
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,820
OK, so thanks for your comments, Jean.

328
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,222
I'll look through them all and incorporate whatever.

329
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,263
And same with Phyllis.

330
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:11,427
And then just, I guess, be thinking about if we need to put other things in the appendix.

331
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:17,110
And any other thoughts on this?

332
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:21,923
There was a couple I thought, do we want to talk about?

333
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:22,965
Yeah, OK.

334
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:24,708
That's good, because I haven't looked at them.

335
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:28,875
I haven't looked a lot at them, so that's good if you bring them up.

336
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,886
Yeah, I'm trying to, I closed everything out.

337
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:38,967
For the letter you said, should we say something about how we voted to adopt a full new charter instead of working on a few sections?

338
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:47,529
And then I think I did that at, yeah, in the general recommendations, but do you think we should also mention it in the introductory letter?

339
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:57,612
Well, I'm just thinking like strategically, if we can get a full charter,

340
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:02,780
past, even if they take out pieces.

341
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,023
But if we have it all in one place and then there's a regular review, I feel like that's a win.

342
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,105
Because it's just all over the place.

343
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,466
Nobody can find the charter.

344
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:15,186
So it's a win.

345
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:28,293
And so that's why I just thought maybe putting that in the letter and saying, one big decision we made was it's so hard to know what our charter is, that this is really important to have it in one place and putting that in the letter.

346
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,741
That's just my thoughts.

347
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,901
So to emphasize it.

348
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:32,542
No, that's good.

349
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:34,443
I'll work on that.

350
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:35,463
What was the other?

351
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:42,266
That looks more or less like a writing thing, which I can look at.

352
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:47,869
And let's see, Article 2, what did you do?

353
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,811
A lot of this is writing, punctuation, links.

354
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,172
Oh, OK.

355
00:25:55,172 --> 00:26:18,671
Did you have anything do you have anything you remember in there because I'm trying to find your email where the Well, I have you want me to pull it up I have it on the screen well Is it too much of a reveal before we're While it's still in draft form I mean we one time remember we

356
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:23,803
We talked about the survey when we were partway through the survey, and we put it all up.

357
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:28,645
And then there was all this discussion on social media about the results of our survey before it was even done.

358
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:30,386
So I guess I'm a little.

359
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:31,566
Yeah.

360
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,487
I'm just trying to get into Google Drive.

361
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:43,010
So under the general recommendations, you just had a writing suggestion.

362
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,632
The other thing I guess I could ask is, under general recommendations,

363
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:53,977
These were two overall.

364
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,380
Are there any other overall big recommendations?

365
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:05,607
Right now, it's draft a new and modernized charter and keep mayor council form of government.

366
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:09,151
I'm thinking maybe- What about the wards?

367
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:12,654
Well, that's under Article 2.

368
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:14,035
Okay.

369
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:16,237
Because that's city council.

370
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:27,731
These were more sort of overall kind of, I mean, we could put under article three recommendation, we could put the keep mayor council form of government.

371
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:33,953
I mean, maybe we don't need a general recommendations page.

372
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:40,136
I like, I like having a general.

373
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,561
That's how Somerville did it, right?

374
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:53,368
I liked when they had, but I wonder if we bullet it more, like maybe we don't, because then don't we talk about it later?

375
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:57,672
Which, the new, which one?

376
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:03,898
Well, I like having like an executive summary at the beginning of the major decisions.

377
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:05,139
Right, okay.

378
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,421
So in that case, we should put more in it.

379
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:08,162
Yeah.

380
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:16,145
So keep draft a new, and then maybe I would call it major recommendations.

381
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:18,185
Yeah, major.

382
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,266
Instead of general, what do you think?

383
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:21,046
Yeah.

384
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:23,607
Yeah.

385
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:27,609
So add to major recommendations.

386
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,392
Ward representation is a major recommendation.

387
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,135
Let me just look at article two.

388
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:42,858
So does that mean we would move the ward representation?

389
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:58,992
So I was thinking like maybe just the more detailed, but you just have little short, you know, like it could even just be a bullet, like keep under major, major recommendation.

390
00:28:59,072 --> 00:28:59,472
Yeah.

391
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:00,893
Just like bullet points.

392
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:01,553
Yeah.

393
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:02,373
Bullet points.

394
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:09,394
I think the only thing that's not covered is the drafted new and modernized charter.

395
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,814
I think you're right.

396
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:11,995
Any of the sections.

397
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,315
And that's why maybe that goes in the introduction.

398
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:22,533
So I will play around with that, but what else do we consider our major recommendations?

399
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,154
Terms.

400
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,475
Terms.

401
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,377
Just for mayor.

402
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:29,337
Mayor's term.

403
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,178
Term for mayor.

404
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,079
Mayoral term.

405
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,460
And which includes a term limit.

406
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,701
With limit.

407
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:36,502
Yeah.

408
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:36,962
Right.

409
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,563
Because we didn't change the terms for the others.

410
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:40,184
Nope.

411
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:41,525
So that's...

412
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:43,510
Sorry, go ahead.

413
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,070
No, go ahead.

414
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,711
What were you going to say?

415
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:49,474
School committee, the board.

416
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:51,115
Yeah.

417
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:56,979
Maybe what we do in the major recommendations when we put the board representation, we include that it's for both.

418
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:12,169
Because we're going to keep in the Article 4 recommendations, we'll go into more detail, but we'll say in the major recommendations that we're recommending hybrid board representation for city council and school committee.

419
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:13,118
Right.

420
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:22,096
Yeah, I think what you had here was general recommendations that weren't covered by the articles, right?

421
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,883
Pretty much that's what I was going for.

422
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:27,605
But now we're changing that.

423
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:35,610
And then I was just thinking having like a bulleted executive summary before you get into the details, which is separate than what you have done.

424
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:36,411
We'll do that.

425
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:43,636
And then we'll move the detail on the new and modernized charter to the introductory letter.

426
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,758
I'll keep it in here.

427
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,479
I just won't go into as much detail.

428
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,260
Right.

429
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,320
OK.

430
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:58,210
There's the whole section on citizen petition, I think.

431
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,911
Yeah.

432
00:31:00,411 --> 00:31:07,314
So we're going to add word representation for CC and SC, term or mayor with term limit.

433
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:11,735
Is there anything else about school committee?

434
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,097
I don't think there's anything else major that we decided.

435
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:20,459
We talked a lot about should the mayor be the chair, should this and that, but we did not change that.

436
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,371
I mean, we could say keep mayor as chair of school committee, or we could just save that for the school committee section.

437
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,932
Well, it is our recommendation.

438
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:35,933
I know, but is it big enough to go under major recommendations?

439
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:36,913
I think so.

440
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:41,354
Maybe because a lot of people don't want the mayor to be the chair.

441
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:42,174
Right.

442
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:43,535
Okay.

443
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:50,525
And let's see, I'm just going through that in my head.

444
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:57,371
Six was, do we want to put, I'm just thinking of them in order of what they are in the charter.

445
00:31:57,851 --> 00:32:04,597
Was there anything about the, I mean, an annual budget meeting was probably the biggest change we put under the budget, right?

446
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:22,643
Yeah, and I mean, you could say annual budget meeting and a recommendation future charter review, a compensation, there's the compensation committee and the charter review looking at.

447
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:28,686
Yeah, that's in nine.

448
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:31,949
So I'm just going in my head, six, we're on six now.

449
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:33,970
Was there anything else about the budget?

450
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:44,810
We recommended that they mean you're you're writing up you're writing that recommendation section right now this is just for the bullet bulleted.

451
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:53,437
Well, just, we did not do what the city council wanted, which was the authority to increase budget lines.

452
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:59,506
But we should put in that sentence that I proposed and cannot remember.

453
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:02,247
It's got to be written down somewhere.

454
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,607
But that would go in.

455
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:08,068
When you write up the Article 6 recommendations, that would go in there, right?

456
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:09,169
Right.

457
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:22,272
So I just don't know if under the executive summary, you want to say added the annual budget meeting and recommend future reviews

458
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,560
go more in-depth on the budget issue.

459
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,601
I don't know.

460
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:28,963
Does that make sense or am I not making sense?

461
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:30,344
No, I hear what you're saying.

462
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:35,189
I'm just wondering if we should reserve that part for the more detailed.

463
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,991
More detailed area, okay.

464
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,592
Because we're really thinking bullets.

465
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:39,573
Yeah.

466
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:40,113
I don't know.

467
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:44,077
The detail part is what we said how many months before and all that kind of stuff.

468
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:46,780
That's in there, if I recall.

469
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:52,986
I don't think we made any other big changes in there.

470
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:58,310
And then in elections, the biggest change we made in elections was ballot position.

471
00:33:59,651 --> 00:33:59,951
Right.

472
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:03,753
I mean, is that significant enough to put under major recommendations?

473
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:05,474
I don't think so.

474
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:07,055
Oh, you do, Phyllis?

475
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:08,336
Yeah, I do.

476
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,398
I don't really think so.

477
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:12,059
One way or the other, it really doesn't matter.

478
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:13,780
It's going to come up either way.

479
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,181
That's a big change.

480
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:17,022
To me, that's a big change.

481
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,097
I consider it one of the important things we decided.

482
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:22,878
I think that's a big change.

483
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:23,919
All right, so.

484
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,700
So ballot position, okay, now we're on eight.

485
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:37,945
Now there's a lot of stuff in eight, so do we want to bullet point them separately or just say?

486
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:43,928
I just created a citizen's petition section that includes

487
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,170
ballot questions, recall, referendums, or something.

488
00:34:51,991 --> 00:35:01,534
Including initiative petitions, referendum, and recall.

489
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:03,195
Yeah.

490
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,795
Was there something else besides?

491
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,236
There was some other, right?

492
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,977
There's like getting it on the city council agenda.

493
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,598
I thought that was the initiative petition.

494
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:12,878
Then there was the

495
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:17,348
Yeah, they were like there was another, but I can't remember what it was called.

496
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:17,608
I'll look.

497
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:19,209
I'll look.

498
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:24,030
And then in nine, the regular charter review.

499
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:33,873
But I was thinking for the bullet point, I might just put that in with the draft new and modernized charter.

500
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,431
Well, maybe we should have regular and I was going to include it in that.

501
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,535
But maybe regular charter review is yeah, I think it should go a couple times.

502
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:46,298
I think that's a I think that's a major recommendation.

503
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:47,019
Yeah, I know.

504
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:52,604
I didn't know if I should put it with the With that or give it its own regular charter review.

505
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:54,627
Okay, and

506
00:35:56,692 --> 00:36:02,854
The other thing in Article 9, there's still the outstanding question of the ethics reporting.

507
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:03,914
I was just reading that.

508
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:05,074
Yeah.

509
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:06,114
We'll see about that.

510
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:07,515
That's not going to go on the list yet.

511
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:13,396
The compensation committee, we are going to have to discuss that.

512
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,877
I don't know if you guys have gotten that far in the Collins Center materials yet.

513
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:20,658
So we'll talk about that.

514
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:30,025
I'll put it in, highlight it in creation of compensate, whatever we called it.

515
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:34,226
I'll just put a compensation committee in my notes, but I won't put that.

516
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,907
I'm trying to think if there was something else in that.

517
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:42,008
There were a few that we talked a lot about a lot of stuff in Article 9.

518
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,383
Well, I have it up.

519
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:48,686
It's the Periodic Charter Review, the Periodic Ordinance Review.

520
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,646
Oh, there we go.

521
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:49,986
Yeah.

522
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:50,527
Yeah.

523
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:51,407
Ordinance.

524
00:36:51,427 --> 00:36:53,988
So maybe we should put the Ordinance Review in there, too.

525
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:54,408
Yeah.

526
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,010
Periodic Ordinance Review.

527
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,712
Then the public comment, which we talked about.

528
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:01,272
Oh, yeah.

529
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:04,613
Do we want to put that under major recommendations?

530
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:07,335
What is the public comment?

531
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:18,209
I don't know if we, I mean, is it a major recommendation?

532
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,231
No, because I think we said that they all already have something in place regarding this anyhow.

533
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:24,451
Okay.

534
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:25,431
All right.

535
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,372
So there's a lot of bullets on the major recommendations.

536
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:30,313
So can you read them back to us?

537
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:30,853
Okay.

538
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:46,210
Well, we have the creative drafting new modernized charter, a complete charter, ward representation for city council and school committee, term length and limits for mayor.

539
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,192
I won't necessarily say it that way, but that's right.

540
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:56,198
Mayor as chair of school committee, annual budget meeting, ballot position,

541
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:12,541
citizen participation mechanisms, including initiative petition, referendum, and recall provisions, regular charter review, regular ordinance review.

542
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:15,742
I could use periodic instead of regular for both of them.

543
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:17,703
Periodic, yeah.

544
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,703
And creation in

545
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:30,520
notes mode, creation of a compensation committee, because we're going to have to talk about that after seeing the call-in centers.

546
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:30,801
Right.

547
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:37,025
And Melva, I might put the regular, adopt a regular charter and charter review together.

548
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,367
I was thinking about that.

549
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:42,368
I would put those as one bullet point.

550
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:43,208
OK.

551
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:44,029
They're separate.

552
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:44,970
Yeah.

553
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,210
Yeah.

554
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,470
Yeah.

555
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:45,890
OK.

556
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,110
OK.

557
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,250
OK.

558
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,040
And then, okay.

559
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:56,262
Okay.

560
00:38:56,502 --> 00:39:03,025
So, I mean, obviously, so I'll change that general recommendations document to be a bullet point.

561
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:10,168
I'll make the changes that we talked about to the introductory letter, and I'll look at some of the edits for the other sections, too.

562
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:20,372
And then, Jean, you're working on the community engagement and six and... Do you feel like you're...

563
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,101
You're good with doing all that?

564
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,503
Yeah, and my deadline is the 22nd.

565
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:27,424
OK.

566
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:30,065
Or is it the 19th?

567
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:32,407
22nd or the 19th.

568
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:33,808
I'll try to get it done by the 19th.

569
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,269
Yeah, 22nd sounds fine.

570
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:48,377
I mean, people are going to read the draft charter and the memo from the Collins Center for August 1st.

571
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:51,119
And we're going to talk about,

572
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:55,570
when we're going to pass this off to the whole committee too.

573
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,792
I feel like we need to finalize more before we do that.

574
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:01,954
Four?

575
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:03,755
No, you're not working on four.

576
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:07,537
You're working on six, eight, and community engagement.

577
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:13,981
So it's just going to be pretty, you know, it's going to be a good body of work, I think.

578
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:20,009
Is there anything else that we need to do?

579
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:23,930
I mean, we're getting a sense of the shape of it now.

580
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:29,132
Maybe Davida ultimately can create our table of contents and all that.

581
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:30,312
Or maybe you can, Jane.

582
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:32,913
I don't know, because you seem to have some software, too, that can do that.

583
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:34,613
I know how to do that in Word, yeah.

584
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:34,873
Yeah.

585
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:54,858
Is that the best format when in the end when we finish it where I mean are we're submitting it to the mayor and then she will pass it to the city council or I don't know you know it's up to her kind of how she can deals with it after that but.

586
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,169
I would turn it into a PDF.

587
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:58,310
I have Adobe.

588
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,330
I can edit it.

589
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,711
Although sometimes Adobe isn't accessible.

590
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:09,472
So like the state, when they put documents up, put both the Word and the PDF.

591
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,814
Blind people have trouble reading.

592
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:20,515
But anyways, you can lock your Word document so it can't be edited.

593
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:24,786
Well, and we can incorporate whatever visuals we might.

594
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:35,388
I mean, in terms of however Daveed does the survey report, like he might have it in some other kind of program.

595
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:39,329
Yeah, you can put that in a PDF.

596
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:41,350
You can merge it into your PDF.

597
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,070
All right, so we'll be able to do all that.

598
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,631
Yeah, OK.

599
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:49,112
I also think that we should give the mayor a printed out bound copy.

600
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:50,692
Yeah, we can do that too.

601
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,021
I really do.

602
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:56,023
We don't have to give it to anyone else, but I think the mayor.

603
00:41:57,343 --> 00:41:58,564
Yeah, that's my respect.

604
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:04,626
I'm sure Francis can help us print, you know, copy it at City Hall and then deliver it.

605
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:08,927
And when we deliver it, we can deliver it the same day as we deliver it electronically.

606
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:09,668
Yes.

607
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:12,108
Okay.

608
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:16,230
And ultimately, we're going to have to merge the

609
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:21,779
actual charter document that we finalize into the report too.

610
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,541
Yeah.

611
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:30,745
Well, they'd be companion pieces, they'll be the report, and then the charter would be separate, but though.

612
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,626
Well, you know, that's good.

613
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,007
We could do it that way.

614
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:45,996
I mean, when I noticed that the final, a lot of, most of the final reports that we looked at, they just had a table of contents and at some point in the table of contents was draft charter, you know, like on page

615
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:48,217
28 or something or whatever.

616
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:53,301
Then that goes for 30 pages and then after that comes the appendix.

617
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,282
Okay.

618
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:55,143
Sure.

619
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:58,105
We can do that too.

620
00:42:58,745 --> 00:42:59,826
Okay.

621
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,031
Is there anything else we need to do?

622
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:09,293
I guess what I feel like is we're doing pretty well.

623
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:13,136
We can finalize this maybe in another meeting and then we can share it with the committee.

624
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,000
do we, what do you think?

625
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,321
Well, so they have a communications office.

626
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:21,142
I don't know who heads it.

627
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:26,684
I mean, it's up to the mayor whether, like, I can put it in Word.

628
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,765
I don't do, like, I'm not a fancy layout person.

629
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:31,166
Yeah, right.

630
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:37,228
So if you want a fancy, like, I don't know if you want to check and see, you know, if we're doing a bound copy, do they?

631
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:39,960
want to lay it out.

632
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,383
It's like icing on the cake.

633
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,905
It doesn't need to happen.

634
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:49,452
But sometimes the communication like it, if I create like a report, that's a good idea.

635
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:52,676
Gene, I think they should maybe put that together for this.

636
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,640
Wait, so Steve Smarty is the communications guy.

637
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:56,702
Is he?

638
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:57,282
Okay.

639
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:57,683
Yeah.

640
00:43:57,743 --> 00:43:59,984
So tell me again what we would be asking him to do.

641
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:09,948
Also, when I create reports for Department of Public Health, like I'll put the word document, but then they sometimes take it and they lay it out.

642
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:16,971
Sometimes they have margins and more white space and make it look fancier.

643
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:27,773
I don't know if they have the time or if that's something the mayor wants them to spend their time on, but you could ask potentially.

644
00:44:28,693 --> 00:44:30,174
So I'm going to ask.

645
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:35,636
This is once we're finished, right?

646
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,338
Yes, we give them a finished document and then they just.

647
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,811
lay it out, which it looks like none of the other cities did.

648
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,751
So the bar is very low.

649
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:52,193
The other thing we could think about is a press release and whether the mayor would be okay with us doing a press release.

650
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:59,895
I think it would be great if we could do a press release and say- Yeah, I should have some reporters at City Hall when it's being presented to her.

651
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:00,916
Yeah.

652
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:01,296
Yeah.

653
00:45:01,696 --> 00:45:05,137
I think that's not a bad idea.

654
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:19,267
You know, I was just thinking of something else, and I don't, I don't know that we could, I mean, it's going to be a long document, but I don't know if translating that document, you know, is something.

655
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:20,509
It's going to have to be translated.

656
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:31,959
I mean, and which, which really, which I'm wondering if we have a bunch of materials that we got translated, do we want to put some of the translations in the appendix?

657
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:41,915
Could you translate the introductory letter and the executive summary, which is not as much as a document.

658
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:43,877
I can talk to Frances about that.

659
00:45:50,942 --> 00:46:01,911
So and what I mean, we won't we we don't need to maybe put the all the translate the translated survey that the.

660
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:10,399
because nobody can take it anymore anyway, but we also had just informational materials that we had translated.

661
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:14,540
Yeah, that should go in our community engagement explanation.

662
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,741
Yeah.

663
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:20,643
Can you send me the languages and the... Yes, I will do that.

664
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:29,526
An executive summary, so I'm going to send Jane translations.

665
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:32,127
Okay, then we can figure out how to work that out.

666
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:35,890
Okay.

667
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:44,315
But yeah, that's, I mean, ideally the draft charter could get translated, but that would be, that would be a lot.

668
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:57,562
Cause I feel, I feel like I should remember this because when we translated the survey, we talked about how, you know, how the, what the cost was and it might've gone by page.

669
00:46:57,722 --> 00:46:59,123
I can't quite remember.

670
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,664
Yeah, it might be by word or by page.

671
00:47:01,744 --> 00:47:12,014
The other problem with translating it is that, you know, we had that whole issue where it all has to be like at fourth grade level or below in order to kind of work.

672
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:15,677
Yeah.

673
00:47:16,157 --> 00:47:17,399
And the charter won't be.

674
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:19,621
Just won't be.

675
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:21,823
No, I mean it.

676
00:47:24,532 --> 00:47:35,357
Yeah, for the ease of translation, just, you know, but we won't be able to because the charter has all that sort of almost archaic language, you know.

677
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:46,382
And it can't, we can't, you know, it could be translated, it would just be, it would be a big deal.

678
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,063
It's a lot of pages.

679
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,388
I think if you do the introductory letter.

680
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,968
Yeah, we'll definitely look at that for sure.

681
00:47:54,988 --> 00:48:00,950
It's going to change and we don't at this point translate any of our ordinances, do we?

682
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,611
That's a good point.

683
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:03,991
We don't, you're right.

684
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:09,012
Yeah, but but we I'll talk to Francis about those two pieces.

685
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:11,133
See what she says.

686
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:15,394
I'm not sure, but we can try.

687
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:17,215
I'm just thinking of

688
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:21,018
all the people that gave us input.

689
00:48:21,758 --> 00:48:28,641
How do we get back to them and say thank you for your feedback, thank you for

690
00:48:32,948 --> 00:48:35,769
here's how to find the final report.

691
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:37,369
Thanks for making it happen.

692
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:48,893
Well, we thanked them all after we interviewed them and we thanked them in the introductory letter, not by name, but you need to reach out to them individually and share the final report with them.

693
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:55,875
Yeah, the survey respondents and- Is there any way we can make an announcement on the city website?

694
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,391
Oh, yeah, that will all get announced.

695
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:26,049
But we have an email list, because when we did the survey, we will we have it from events where people signed up for their email, and then a bunch of people signed up, we have a good, good number of people, I think a few hundred at least, that took the survey that left their email that, you know, they included their email, because we said, you know, if you'd like to know about our events or whatever, sign up, so we have a list.

696
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:27,645
So we.

697
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:37,226
It'd be nice if we had like a little mini communications plan of like, perhaps the mayor wants to see it first before we do a press release and stuff.

698
00:49:37,326 --> 00:49:41,069
But assuming that it goes to her, she's okay.

699
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:43,190
Then we do a press release.

700
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,071
We send things out to people via email.

701
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:50,395
We have it translated and kind of just try to get it in whatever paper or.

702
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:51,976
Yeah, yeah.

703
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:55,578
So we get it out before it goes to city council.

704
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,079
So we create some funds.

705
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:58,131
Right, right.

706
00:49:58,452 --> 00:49:58,692
Yeah.

707
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:08,040
And I was going to say, we would want to coordinate it with whenever the city council is going to, you know, when they put it on their agenda, when it goes to the city council.

708
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,200
Yeah.

709
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:16,948
Because you could as chair do an op-ed, you know, here's in the patch, I guess, like, here's what we did.

710
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:17,228
Right.

711
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,410
That's all that's left.

712
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:19,991
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,261
But I kind of agree with you.

714
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:28,667
I would give it to the mayor first and not do anything like overstepping our bonds.

715
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,390
Show the respect that she is the mayor.

716
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,254
And this is this is what we're looking at before you get any of the word out.

717
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:38,157
And then maybe just the page with the bullet points.

718
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:42,201
If if if if she's good with all of our stuff.

719
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:54,192
maybe just a page with all bullet points that, you know, what the Charter Study Commission has worked on and, you know, without putting the whole thing out there, just... Right.

720
00:50:54,532 --> 00:50:58,474
I do it yesterday, Jean, create a little interest and buzz about it before it comes out.

721
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:01,375
I do think that the final report will be public.

722
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,956
I mean, most of them are, right?

723
00:51:03,976 --> 00:51:05,416
But that will be the mayor, right?

724
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:07,277
The communications director will...

725
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:09,849
And the mayor will put it up.

726
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:10,609
Yeah.

727
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:14,253
And any press release, I was assuming would go through the mayor's office.

728
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:17,536
Yeah, I think they were already appointed by the mayor.

729
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:21,500
So I just want to clarify, I don't think we'd go wrong press release.

730
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,722
And they did press release when we were appointed.

731
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:25,924
They did a press release about the survey.

732
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:30,709
So there will be, I'm sure they will do something.

733
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:31,630
I'm sure.

734
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:38,912
I mean, I don't know 100% because I haven't talked to them, but I would predict strongly.

735
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:42,973
Okay.

736
00:51:43,153 --> 00:51:43,954
So this is good.

737
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:51,776
I guess the question now is do we... We're going to have a meeting on August 1st.

738
00:51:53,176 --> 00:52:00,878
So for the whole committee, our current scheduled meetings are August 1st, and then whatever the first Thursday in September is,

739
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:03,889
and whatever the first Thursday in October is.

740
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:12,711
So unless we schedule more meetings, that leaves us three meetings to finish everything.

741
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:19,652
And we are pretty much done, but then again, you know, there could be details that might take a little time, right?

742
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:31,114
So on August 1st, we're gonna address this ethics reporting issue that, but then we're also gonna just sort of, I haven't made an agenda yet, but we're gonna,

743
00:52:31,494 --> 00:52:42,752
We're going to look at the draft charter and spend some time sort of seeing if anybody has any issues with it.

744
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:45,937
I think we don't have all eyes on it.

745
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:46,678
Right.

746
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:56,436
And then we would hopefully maybe finish that in September and maybe then in August, we send the committee the final report.

747
00:52:56,676 --> 00:53:00,039
And then we can start on the final report in September too.

748
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,980
I'm hoping we don't have to schedule any more meetings.

749
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,121
But you know what else I'm gonna suggest?

750
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:05,983
Why don't we see how the August 1st meeting goes?

751
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:07,043
Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

752
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:16,750
What kind of dialogue and conversation goes on and dictate whether we need another meeting before the December meeting and wrap it all up there.

753
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:27,959
That's what we'll do, but for us, for the final report, for us, we have not scheduled another meeting.

754
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:28,479
We could.

755
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,285
Well, there's the pieces I'm writing, or do we just want to do that via Google Doc?

756
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:40,191
Well, I'm wondering if we should maybe have one more meeting and say, OK, we're good to go.

757
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:46,103
let's share this with the whole committee now so that they can read it for September.

758
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,444
So should we do that?

759
00:53:49,884 --> 00:53:50,564
I think so.

760
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:52,684
I'm good with that.

761
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:56,805
So early August, and then maybe we'll get David.

762
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:03,347
Well, we're going to have a full committee meeting on August 1st.

763
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:04,407
Yeah, we are.

764
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,307
I think we should meet before then.

765
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,187
Okay.

766
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:10,028
How about the 29, two weeks from today?

767
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:12,555
Sure.

768
00:54:12,575 --> 00:54:13,256
Monday?

769
00:54:13,276 --> 00:54:14,216
I'm just in my head.

770
00:54:14,236 --> 00:54:15,497
That's two weeks from today.

771
00:54:16,118 --> 00:54:16,718
Yeah, two weeks.

772
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:18,500
Is that OK, Gene?

773
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,940
Can you?

774
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,821
Is that too far up?

775
00:54:21,902 --> 00:54:23,063
I can do a time.

776
00:54:23,884 --> 00:54:24,424
Same time?

777
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:25,805
What time works for you?

778
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:26,566
I can do two.

779
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:27,887
I have a doctor's appointment.

780
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:29,508
OK, name a time.

781
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:31,209
Morning?

782
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:32,730
I do morning.

783
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,711
Hey, I'm in.

784
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,133
What day of the week on a Thursday?

785
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:36,813
Monday.

786
00:54:37,253 --> 00:54:38,134
No, that's a Monday.

787
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:40,936
Monday, July.

788
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,145
29?

789
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:45,145
Yeah, Monday, July 29th.

790
00:54:45,706 --> 00:54:47,308
Yeah, I like the morning.

791
00:54:47,848 --> 00:54:48,149
Yeah.

792
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:49,470
So 10 a.m.?

793
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,451
Sure, yeah.

794
00:54:50,812 --> 00:54:51,052
Sure.

795
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:52,514
Okay.

796
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,897
I'm not looking at my calendar, but I'm pretty sure I can...

797
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,698
OK, so I'll send.

798
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:01,639
We can have read through any of the changes or updates of things.

799
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:02,039
Yeah.

800
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,880
I'll send minutes, and that'll have written down.

801
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,001
Hopefully, I wrote down what everybody said they're going to do.

802
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:13,002
But most people, except for Jean, you're writing stuff.

803
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:17,183
And I'm going to fix a few things and send you a bunch of stuff.

804
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,363
But so the big thing is to just read over what we have.

805
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:20,523
Yeah.

806
00:55:23,811 --> 00:55:31,134
Okay, no, but when you say listening session report, like, I mean, I meant that you that you sent me your member.

807
00:55:31,154 --> 00:55:35,335
I still have it in my email.

808
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:35,975
I've been holding.

809
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:36,896
I don't remember.

810
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,936
Okay.

811
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:38,176
And.

812
00:55:42,398 --> 00:55:43,318
Hang on, here it is.

813
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,579
Oh, it was a slide presentation.

814
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:46,279
That's what I thought.

815
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:49,620
Okay, I did a slide presentation.

816
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:49,961
Okay.

817
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:52,942
Can that go into the report as like a document?

818
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:54,242
Yeah, we can just put it.

819
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:58,303
I mean, I'm going to put it in the appendix right now, but we can get that.

820
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:02,065
You can do two slides per page or something so people can see.

821
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:02,165
Yeah.

822
00:56:02,805 --> 00:56:09,287
So, and I mean, that would be in the appendix in addition to what you're writing for the community report.

823
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:09,627
Sure.

824
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,067
Okay.

825
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:12,008
I mean, the community engagement section.

826
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:15,195
Sounds good.

827
00:56:16,796 --> 00:56:21,178
I'm almost wondering if we need like a separate appendix.

828
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:28,622
We'll see when we get the appendix all together if we want to put headings like, you know, make sections for the appendix.

829
00:56:29,743 --> 00:56:32,544
Community engagement, you know, study, I don't know.

830
00:56:34,345 --> 00:56:34,766
We'll see.

831
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:35,426
We'll see.

832
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:37,347
Yeah.

833
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:40,629
This mostly just sort of organizing it and putting the pieces together.

834
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,680
Yeah.

835
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,781
I think it'll be clear once you have everything.

836
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:44,521
Yeah.

837
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,642
And then we'll just figure out how to put it together.

838
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:52,884
And maybe whether it's you or Daveed that's going to do all the formatting, you guys just decide how to do that.

839
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:53,745
I don't know.

840
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:54,485
Yeah.

841
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:56,726
OK.

842
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:57,246
Awesome.

843
00:56:58,187 --> 00:56:58,527
All right.

844
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:01,868
I will send the minutes, and I will see you all on August 1st.

845
00:57:02,368 --> 00:57:03,128
No, July 29.

846
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:03,309
July 29.

847
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:03,409
OK.

848
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:03,509
OK.

849
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:03,829
Bye.

850
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:04,149
Thanks.

851
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:05,009
Bye, everyone.

852
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:05,329
Bye.

853
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,589
Bye.
