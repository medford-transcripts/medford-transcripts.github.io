1
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,696
37th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council, November 28th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:14,278
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,320
Councilor DelaRusso?

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,601
Present.

5
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:19,222
Councilor Falco?

6
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:19,522
Present.

7
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:21,123
Councilor Night?

8
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:21,643
Present.

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:22,944
Councilor Kern?

10
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:23,084
Yes.

11
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:25,626
Vice President Marks?

12
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:26,627
Present.

13
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:28,128
Councilor Scott Kelly?

14
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:28,468
Present.

15
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:30,109
President Caviello?

16
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:31,010
Present.

17
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:33,275
Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:45,766
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:49,990
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

20
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:53,964
Councilor Del Rosso.

21
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:58,225
Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?

22
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:19,510
Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,511
And so there is an additional

24
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:30,072
A couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline.

25
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:42,634
And their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.

26
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:44,135
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.

27
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:58,249
If the messenger could make a few copies of this to maybe some people in the audience, it would be appreciated.

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,350
Thank you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

29
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,971
And that'll also be posted on the website.

30
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:11,811
Did you want to make a comment?

31
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,312
Name and address for the record, please.

32
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:15,872
Hold on one second.

33
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,353
Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Meffitt.

34
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,133
I spoke before the council last week

35
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,650
about this issue, about the non-notification.

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:32,053
And because of the intercession of the council, we got the deadline

37
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,045
pushed back to December 12th.

38
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,447
However, I have one other question.

39
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:51,488
You know, I mentioned last week that I knocked on 150 doors to inform people about the meeting that didn't know about it.

40
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:58,070
So now, those 150 people don't know about the extension of the deadline for the comments.

41
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:07,106
So it is a long address and Councilor De La Ruza just read it off, but I was wondering if you people had any suggestions on how you could get that.

42
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,208
It will be on the city website also.

43
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,529
Yeah, but people need to know to go there.

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,972
You see, we have to, people don't know that the deadline has been extended.

45
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:18,313
So.

46
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,974
Point of information, Councilor Longo-Kurin.

47
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,695
I think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call

48
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:35,437
to go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.

49
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,518
Right, that might be, I was thinking of that also.

50
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:44,482
You could probably, on the government access channel where you post the street sweeping session, you could probably post a notice there as well.

51
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,804
I think that would be a good idea if you could do that.

52
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:51,625
And going forward, and a newspaper notice.

53
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:56,786
I don't know if the T or the city is planning on any kind of newspaper notice.

54
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:57,967
We'll have to see about that.

55
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:03,668
But going forward, I appreciate the efforts that the council made on behalf of the residents.

56
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:14,271
And I urge you all to please stay involved with this project because it's been a long drawn out thing and advocate for resident involvements.

57
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:29,817
The city, I think, down the road, needs to have a dedicated meeting for our butters and those directly affected in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the track, because there are a lot of new people who have moved in.

58
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,919
This project has been going on for 12 years.

59
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,702
And those new people who have come in the neighborhood, some of them don't even know what this is all about.

60
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:51,691
I think the city should try to get those abutters together and bring them up to date of what's going on, what the future is, what the city has planned, if there's economic development, where it is, who it's going to involve, and so forth.

61
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,633
And my offer stands that I gave you people last week.

62
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:01,416
I'd be glad to lead a walking tour through the neighborhoods for both the council and the mayor.

63
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,940
Because a picture is worth a thousand words.

64
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,363
If you can see what it is we're talking about, you have a better appreciation of what's going on.

65
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,505
So thank you for your time and thank you for your advocacy.

66
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,887
And you know, you may see me again if we have another issue.

67
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,268
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:18,828
Thank you.

69
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:24,251
If I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week.

70
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,992
There was about five people here.

71
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:31,565
advocating for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification.

72
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,807
I think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:50,339
So I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,260
Thank you.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,642
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

76
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:56,867
Councilor DelaRusso.

77
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:09,472
That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.

78
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:16,795
On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern, as amended by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Falco.

79
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:17,676
All those in favor?

80
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:18,096
Aye.

81
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,677
Motion passes.

82
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:25,199
17-778, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved

83
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:33,670
that the MBTA install a bus shelter at the bus stop on South Porter Road at Roosevelt Circle Rotary in the interest of public safety.

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,750
Vice President Mox.

85
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:42,717
Mr. President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scott Pelly has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.

86
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:47,381
Let's see.

87
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:55,167
1779, offered by Councilor Scott Pelly, being resolved the city administration reach out to the MBTA to inquire about placing a bus shelter at the bus stop

88
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:58,622
located at Southwater Road in Roosevelt Circle.

89
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,178
Vice President Mox, continue.

90
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,239
Thank you, Mr. President.

91
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,344
And I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus.

92
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:18,472
If anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle.

93
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:28,661
If you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop.

94
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:52,647
And this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation.

95
00:07:53,337 --> 00:08:02,310
and or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop.

96
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:08,239
And this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter.

97
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:15,937
to protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location.

98
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:24,280
And it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,082
It also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location.

100
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,423
And Rep Donato reached out to me just recently

101
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:43,213
and said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter.

102
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:49,880
And the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one.

103
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,095
and said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop.

104
00:08:54,856 --> 00:09:01,480
And the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it.

105
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:17,631
But what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth.

106
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,987
and safety of commuters.

107
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:26,648
And it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus.

108
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:44,652
So hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench.

109
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,372
So I would ask, Mr. President, that

110
00:09:48,150 --> 00:10:07,802
This council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President.

111
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,404
We may also have a resident here.

112
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,705
I don't know if Barney's here tonight.

113
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:13,646
She said she was going to come.

114
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,514
And if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

115
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:19,095
Thank you.

116
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,155
Councilor Scott Billy.

117
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,836
Thank you, Councilor.

118
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:28,038
Mr. President, Councilor Moxwell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.

119
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:30,518
You brought up the same points.

120
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,979
I think that in today's, um,

121
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,238
Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.

122
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:49,360
And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.

123
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,940
We're limiting them from using public transportation.

124
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,102
So I second the resolve from Council Marks and

125
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:25,086
I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,

126
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:32,051
information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.

127
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:35,554
So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.

128
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:41,320
And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.

129
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,723
And to put a picnic bench out there, it's

130
00:11:48,775 --> 00:12:02,620
it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.

131
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:15,785
So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, council marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,

132
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,008
an answer back within two weeks.

133
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:18,428
Thank you.

134
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:18,888
Thank you.

135
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,209
Councilor Falco.

136
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,150
Thank you, Mr. President.

137
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,351
I was also contacted by Bonnie as well.

138
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,392
And I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

139
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:31,416
Um, this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation.

140
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:39,420
And I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus.

141
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,963
I, myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now.

142
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:45,244
And, uh, I've been taking the,

143
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:59,813
for a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern.

144
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,295
That can be a very dangerous stop.

145
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:12,744
It's right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day,

146
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:13,823
it gets even worse.

147
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:17,345
So I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone.

148
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:22,507
So I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward.

149
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:22,967
Thank you.

150
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:24,628
Council Member O'Karn.

151
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:25,348
Thank you.

152
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:29,930
President Carviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward.

153
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,091
It is a concerning spot.

154
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:36,453
There is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements.

155
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,875
I think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live

156
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:47,704
in the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters.

157
00:13:48,304 --> 00:14:01,827
The use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus.

158
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,588
I think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to

159
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,737
at least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community.

160
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:16,061
Hopefully the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there.

161
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,763
I think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly.

162
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:19,844
So I second the approval.

163
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:20,624
Thank you.

164
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:21,905
Councillor Knight.

165
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,546
Mr. President, thank you very much.

166
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:28,289
I think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location.

167
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:31,271
And the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there?

168
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:36,104
And Councilman Scott Pelley made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA.

169
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:39,226
I'd like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President.

170
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:47,133
And I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this.

171
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,135
some impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers.

172
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,118
We have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line.

173
00:14:55,158 --> 00:15:00,262
We have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President.

174
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:05,207
And it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended.

175
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:15,696
So I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.

176
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,115
Thank you.

177
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:23,319
On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scott Pelley.

178
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,561
All those in favor?

179
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,402
I'm sorry?

180
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,605
Do we have someone that wants to speak?

181
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,966
Oh, I'm sorry.

182
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,387
I can't.

183
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:35,748
I couldn't see the process.

184
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:37,834
Hi, my name is Bonnie Styer.

185
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:42,557
I live at 35 Roosevelt Road, just a couple blocks away from this bus shelter.

186
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:50,022
Thank you, council members, for your prompt and considerable response to my concern about this bus shelter.

187
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:55,746
I do believe that it would be really helpful to have a bus shelter there.

188
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,868
I think it would increase the ridership.

189
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:07,953
I think this bus stop, well the bus, the 325 and the 100 bus are wonderful ways to get into Boston on a daily basis.

190
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:13,716
And I think that more riders would be encouraged to take it if there was a shelter there in place.

191
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:16,077
Again, like you mentioned earlier,

192
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:31,152
It's very busy there and now that I'm leaving in the morning when it's, you know, the sun was rising at 6.50, being there in the dark is not a very great place to be with all those cars moving during the rush hour time.

193
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:41,280
So I appreciate all of your assistance and I'd be more than willing to help out with getting signatures or petition should the MBT need something like that.

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,741
So thank you again.

195
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:43,822
Thank you.

196
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:49,410
On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scott Pellicott.

197
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:51,931
Vice President Mox.

198
00:16:52,711 --> 00:17:06,578
Just if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Meffitt, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community.

199
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,239
And we all pay for it as riders.

200
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,080
We pay through the sales tax.

201
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,081
There's a percent that goes towards

202
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,001
the operation of transit in this state.

203
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:26,773
And I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA.

204
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,955
That money comes right off our cherry sheet.

205
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,778
So it's money that goes right out of

206
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:35,402
the city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing.

207
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:48,833
And I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just

208
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,954
this shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations.

209
00:17:53,594 --> 00:18:01,817
In the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters.

210
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:14,600
You know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scott Pelly, that we get a quick response to this issue.

211
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,201
And also, Mr. President, based on the fact that

212
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:25,037
We're one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great.

213
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,421
I like John Falco.

214
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,378
take the bus every day also.

215
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:35,881
But I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents.

216
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:48,107
We're paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President.

217
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:55,270
And I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.

218
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:56,962
Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

219
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:57,542
Counselor Knight.

220
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:58,483
Mr. President.

221
00:18:58,523 --> 00:18:58,723
Yes.

222
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:02,725
Also where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella.

223
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:06,988
I think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation.

224
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,829
So they're aware of the request that the council's making.

225
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,070
Thank you.

226
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:18,896
On the motion by vice president mocks and counselor Scott Pelley as amended by counselor night.

227
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,597
seconded by Councilor Falco.

228
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:22,557
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

229
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:25,160
Roll call vote has been requested.

230
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,881
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

231
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:35,889
They're both together, 1779 and 1778, as amended by Councilor Knight.

232
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,106
Councilor DelaRusso?

233
00:19:59,386 --> 00:19:59,526
Yes.

234
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:00,846
Councilor Fevella?

235
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:01,127
Yes.

236
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,267
Councilor Night?

237
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:02,767
Yes.

238
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,047
Councilor Locker?

239
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:04,247
Yes.

240
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:05,627
Vice-President Marks?

241
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:05,927
Yes.

242
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,508
Councilor Scarpelli?

243
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:07,888
Yes.

244
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:08,988
President Caviello?

245
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:09,468
Yes.

246
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:15,749
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

247
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:26,351
17-780 offered by Councilor Locker, be it resolved that the administration through the Energy and Environment Office develop a database and start an opt-out list for those who want to opt out

248
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,430
of any potentially implemented community aggregation plans.

249
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,010
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

250
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,292
Thank you, President Carviello.

251
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:40,955
I think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation.

252
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:53,762
We've had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the energy environment director in Melrose, which I think,

253
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:59,530
personally, for me, helped answer a lot of my questions.

254
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,652
And it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding.

255
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:15,819
I think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out.

256
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,143
And when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to

257
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:27,773
move forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford.

258
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:51,372
But there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns.

259
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:54,074
They want to make sure that that opt-out plan is

260
00:21:54,781 --> 00:22:00,886
well publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to.

261
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:04,750
And one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth.

262
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:21,224
What if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out.

263
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:26,644
If you want to, you can do it now, just in case something is implemented.

264
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:33,408
I know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea.

265
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:38,330
I think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months.

266
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,352
And we just need to be ready on all accounts.

267
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,993
So I move this forward.

268
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,455
I think it's definitely something worth exploring.

269
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:46,555
It's simple.

270
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,276
It's just a database.

271
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:50,918
It could be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be

272
00:22:52,066 --> 00:23:13,943
listed as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.

273
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:15,204
Thank you.

274
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,885
Councilor Scott Pelli.

275
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,419
Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,979
Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.

277
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:35,928
I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.

278
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:52,085
in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.

279
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:59,431
And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were

280
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:14,993
The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.

281
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:18,236
So one other thing that I want to point out,

282
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:29,078
question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.

283
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:42,621
And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had

284
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,543
asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.

285
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:58,671
Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.

286
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:08,336
So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.

287
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:12,459
I think it's something that every

288
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:17,351
constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.

289
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,993
I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.

290
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:25,837
And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.

291
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:33,222
And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that

292
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:46,765
When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.

293
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:50,786
Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.

294
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:58,607
Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.

295
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:02,248
So that in turn goes back out to our residents.

296
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:08,705
I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.

297
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,686
Thank you, Councilor Scott-Bailey.

298
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:11,326
Councilor Knight.

299
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,108
Mr. President, thank you very much.

300
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,071
When it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year.

301
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:25,095
And quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore.

302
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:28,057
And again, I think the time to move forward on it is now.

303
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,699
Ultimately, the question is, do we want

304
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:37,174
to request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council.

305
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,857
We're asking a department head to say, start creating a list.

306
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,119
We may or may not adopt municipal aggregation.

307
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,502
And I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President.

308
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,244
If we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation.

309
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,805
Let's take the vote and let's allow it to happen.

310
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:55,710
But to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

311
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:01,164
the Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list.

312
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,305
So she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt.

313
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,527
So I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time.

314
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,568
Mr. President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.

315
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:14,768
Thank you.

316
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,009
Councilor Falco.

317
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,549
Thank you, Mr. President.

318
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,471
As many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one.

319
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,292
I think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good

320
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,562
a good plan, I think it's a good program.

321
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:43,087
And I, I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department in Melrose just to get a different perspective.

322
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,908
And I think, I thought that was a very good presentation.

323
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:50,650
She did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project.

324
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,831
And she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out.

325
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,513
But I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor Knight.

326
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:01,978
I think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going.

327
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:06,322
You know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way.

328
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,806
I mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass.

329
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:12,269
So, you know, I think, you know, it's time.

330
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:16,263
This has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now.

331
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:24,786
We've had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down, and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this.

332
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:32,409
And I know, I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in Committee of the Wholes, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point.

333
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:39,792
But I think that, in my opinion, I really don't, I think a lot of our

334
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,422
departments to stretch with regard to resources.

335
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:50,564
And I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass.

336
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:55,625
So, um, I, I, uh, agree with my colleague, uh, councilor Knight on this issue.

337
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:56,365
So thank you.

338
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:57,265
Thank you.

339
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,906
Councilor DelaRusso.

340
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:00,266
Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:09,388
Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.

342
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:13,999
It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.

343
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:18,180
Their agenda is to get METFIT into municipal aggregation.

344
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:26,324
And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.

345
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:36,968
And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.

346
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:39,789
And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.

347
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:46,449
A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.

348
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:55,718
So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.

349
00:29:56,238 --> 00:30:03,885
Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.

350
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,787
They have something to gain.

351
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,222
Obviously, always someone has something to gain, and there's nothing wrong with that.

352
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:24,549
I think this is a stretch in some areas, and I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.

353
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:25,809
What does this do to them?

354
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,750
Does this target them in some way?

355
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,431
Who has an access to this list?

356
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:34,261
Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?

357
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:38,784
Um, these are questions, uh, serious questions that I have.

358
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:44,548
These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President, that they need a voice as well.

359
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:46,570
I'm going to give them that voice.

360
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,652
And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.

361
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:53,895
I think we need to have further discussion on municipal, uh, aggregation.

362
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,797
And I think we need to have a credible,

363
00:30:57,338 --> 00:31:03,759
bona fide expert on this matter who is going to give the argument contra.

364
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,480
Thank you, Mr. President.

365
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,980
Thank you, Mr. Counselor.

366
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,560
Counselor Lugo-Curran.

367
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,981
Thank you, President Carviello.

368
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:15,242
I understand the sentiments of my colleagues.

369
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:19,023
I just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess.

370
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:24,524
I don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people

371
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,707
call or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list.

372
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:34,790
I actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this.

373
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,251
I think it's simple, take minutes.

374
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:53,077
And I agree with Councilor DelaRusso, there is an agenda for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their

375
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:03,676
option to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they can opt out whenever, they're going to be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days.

376
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:05,497
And that's what people are concerned about.

377
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:20,385
So that's why you would implement something like this far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out, and they would get what they want.

378
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:21,826
The people that don't want to be involved

379
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,374
would be able to do that sooner than later.

380
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:29,877
And when the council does meet in committee of the whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it.

381
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,738
And I think we're definitely close to it.

382
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:34,820
And I know people have definitely changed their minds.

383
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,341
And they've learned a lot.

384
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,402
There are some people that maybe are still against it.

385
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:44,566
But for me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better knowing that they have more than that 30 days.

386
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:48,008
Because that's the complaints I've been getting.

387
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,849
And I thought this was just a way

388
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:56,210
sway another vote towards approving it and ease in people's fears.

389
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:57,051
I'll say it again.

390
00:32:57,412 --> 00:32:59,134
So I move approval.

391
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:01,716
I'd like to see how it goes.

392
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:06,441
And of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.

393
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,003
Thank you, Councilor Locario.

394
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,285
Vice President Mox.

395
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,087
Thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:19,880
I can't support this resolution tonight based on the fact that I agree with my colleagues that this is something that hasn't been approved by the council as of yet.

397
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:28,249
And I'm not going to partake in something that is going to tell residents that they can get out of something that the council is going to vote on.

398
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,873
Um, and in my opinion, what we should do,

399
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:44,879
and I've stated this from day one, Mr. President is, uh, the energy and environment committee where this was sent at one point in this process, um, had a public hearing on it and we asked the city solicitor to attend.

400
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:59,126
And one of the questions, and it was actually my question was whether or not we can file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which, uh, is everyone is opted into the program.

401
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:00,347
And, um,

402
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:07,918
automatically and change it so you can opt into the program.

403
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,709
And according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel

404
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:21,161
at the statehouse and they believe that we could file a home loan petition.

405
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,403
And that is my number one concern.

406
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:35,656
In my opinion, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company, not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Meffitt.

407
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:39,759
I don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you.

408
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,504
I realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint.

409
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:51,669
I realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit to by aggregating everyone together.

410
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,752
And so I realize what the intent is.

411
00:34:56,313 --> 00:35:03,078
But I, as one member of the council, don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program.

412
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,380
And if this is such a great program,

413
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,122
It's going to be overwhelming.

414
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:13,085
People will be knocking on the door here at City Hall to get involved and say, I want to opt into that program.

415
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,107
Let the program work.

416
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:16,648
Let the program work.

417
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,649
So that would be my recommendation.

418
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:29,647
Mr. President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion.

419
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:31,408
Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

420
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:41,450
Maybe it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from.

421
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,112
That's why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way.

422
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:47,093
I don't believe that should be the case.

423
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:50,735
I believe we should give residents of this community an option.

424
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,096
If they want to opt into the program, then so be it.

425
00:35:54,136 --> 00:36:01,300
You can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President.

426
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:10,685
There's also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy.

427
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:23,632
And you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%.

428
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:27,535
Now that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community.

429
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,177
And you can opt out of that also.

430
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,419
But now you say you can opt out of the program.

431
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,784
And if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that.

432
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,825
That's be up front with the people.

433
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,748
Let them choose whether they want to partake in this program.

434
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,230
And I could support that, Mr. President.

435
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,475
So I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.

436
00:36:53,535 --> 00:36:54,556
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

437
00:36:55,537 --> 00:37:01,822
On the motion by Councilor Alongo Kern, seconded by, name and address of the record, please.

438
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:02,982
Thank you.

439
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:06,344
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street.

440
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,665
Good evening, honorable counselors.

441
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:14,388
I'm not against the energy, especially clean energy.

442
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:21,471
And if I may get a little bit off track, supposedly this country sent man to the moon a dozen times and brought him back safely.

443
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:25,473
If that's true, there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels, period.

444
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:31,216
There's only a good reason, I'm sure, and that's capitalism from down deep in Texas.

445
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:42,111
And also, I believe Tesla, the famous inventor from Yugoslavia, was creating a power grid over 80 years ago, backed by J.P.

446
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,091
Morgan, I believe.

447
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:44,913
And once J.P.

448
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:53,139
Morgan found out that Tesla wanted to give free energy from power plant to power plant without wires, mind you, he pulled the plug.

449
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,900
So, so much for capitalism.

450
00:37:57,142 --> 00:38:00,645
This community aggregation, I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing.

451
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,962
I don't know what's in it for the city.

452
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:22,479
I don't know why they would force undemocratically to pull all, I'm estimating, 40,000 National Grid electric ratepayers into the pool and making them opt out if they want to get out, which means they have to be proactive or, as I would say, reactive.

453
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:33,016
And very well could be, instead of me paying $0.10 for the delivery charge on my electric bill, it could come in at $0.16.

454
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,576
I'm hearing different numbers.

455
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:40,338
That would be a 60% increase in my electric bill on the delivery charge only.

456
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:49,820
So if I'm using an average of 400 kilowatts times $0.06 extra, that would be approximately $25, $26 extra.

457
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:57,977
And so a lot of people may be having a hard time paying the electric bills as we speak.

458
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:04,720
So I just hope this community aggregation does not become community aggravation.

459
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:06,241
Thank you.

460
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:06,862
Thank you.

461
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,504
On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kernan, seconded by?

462
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,487
Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

463
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:17,908
All those in favor?

464
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:22,013
All those opposed?

465
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:36,024
Motion fails.

466
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,085
Councilor Langel-Kern was in favor.

467
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:43,930
And George, and Councilor Scott Pelli.

468
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,233
17781 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, be it resolved that the administration look into replacing

469
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:59,292
with the help of Eversource, all lead pipes and outdated pipes that need an upgrade while the streets will be open during the construction period if the Eversource project is approved.

470
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:00,813
Councilor Longo-Kern.

471
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:03,494
Thank you, President Carviello.

472
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:14,080
We had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely

473
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:28,974
Doug Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement.

474
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:40,640
Now, I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis.

475
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,222
I just wanna make sure that the city administration

476
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,252
really is on top of that.

477
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:48,092
I know Cassandra is going to be on top of it.

478
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:55,556
She seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it.

479
00:40:56,056 --> 00:41:07,641
So I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we

480
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:13,089
We look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated.

481
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,890
So we think about this before our streets are even open.

482
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,052
And I don't know if the administration has already thought about that.

483
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:23,214
Obviously, I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible.

484
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:27,217
But no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing.

485
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:32,360
And I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced.

486
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:38,289
couple miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets.

487
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:46,514
I think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced.

488
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:50,476
And when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then.

489
00:41:50,596 --> 00:42:00,642
So whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.

490
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:01,603
Thank you.

491
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:07,496
On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Falco.

492
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:08,276
All those in favor?

493
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:08,857
Aye.

494
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:09,977
Motion passes.

495
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:23,202
Reports of committee 17766, committee of the whole meeting from November 14th, 2017 regarding Enstar Eversource.

496
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,103
And I have the report here which I will read.

497
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:36,928
The purpose of the meeting was to receive a presentation from Eversource on their request for grants of location on the transmission project from moving through Medford.

498
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:38,909
The following recommendations were made.

499
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:43,531
That one, a traffic plan be submitted to the council and the police chief.

500
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:49,753
Two, construction schedule with start dates, days of weeks, and times be submitted.

501
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:55,115
Three, that Eversource set up an informational meeting at the high school to include

502
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:05,811
the winter street residents in a budding neighborhoods for that a contact name for the project with a telephone number and email be posted to the city's website.

503
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:17,258
Five that plans be provided by ever source on route on the route from question street to the city line that were included seven

504
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:20,823
Eversource develop a regional communication plan.

505
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:31,872
That plan would entail them developing a strategy of contacting TV and radio station, notifying non-Method residents about the project, and to notify them of alternate routes.

506
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:38,938
A motion was made by council tonight to send this report out.

507
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,720
Let me answer.

508
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:44,890
Vice President Mox.

509
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,213
Was there a number six on that?

510
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:51,980
There was another missing somewhere along the line.

511
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,424
I think there was only supposed to be seven and it ended up being eight.

512
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,472
No, I, okay.

513
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:58,332
I thought a number.

514
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:13,860
Yeah, no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken, as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route.

515
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,223
And we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting.

516
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:20,964
And I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said,

517
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:34,310
We can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth, but it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookups.

518
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,891
Was that the meeting from last week or the week before?

519
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:37,652
Last week.

520
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:38,772
It was last week.

521
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:39,553
This is from two weeks ago.

522
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,891
Okay, so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?

523
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:51,693
Okay, so those questions will come out again.

524
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:53,074
Yes.

525
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,836
Well, our questions still go somewhere, right?

526
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:57,396
When we ask,

527
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:10,245
I mean, Eversource was before us.

528
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,486
We asked Eversource to produce some information.

529
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:18,008
Are you saying that information doesn't go anywhere?

530
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,310
Next week, when we meet next week with them again, we'll bring it up to them again.

531
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:23,370
OK.

532
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,150
OK.

533
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:33,467
Councilor Neistat.

534
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:43,293
So this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation.

535
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:45,535
And that this isn't related to that meeting then.

536
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:50,958
Because one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.

537
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:51,799
Absolutely.

538
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:52,139
Yeah.

539
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:55,441
So this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day.

540
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:55,501
OK.

541
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,402
Sounds good to me.

542
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:06,434
But we may not get that information before next Tuesday.

543
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:07,874
This issue is coming up again, correct?

544
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:08,254
Yes, it is.

545
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,716
So we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting.

546
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:16,598
That's an issue.

547
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,881
That's why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.

548
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:39,565
I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.

549
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,406
Yeah, we only got halfway through right halfway through.

550
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:47,607
I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?

551
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,988
Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.

552
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:52,528
All right

553
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:57,335
OK, Mr. Clerk, if you could have this letter sent up to the city engineer.

554
00:46:57,355 --> 00:47:00,220
Maybe she can help us out before the next week's meeting with that.

555
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,968
If I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.

556
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,291
Mr. Clerk, if you could take care of that, please.

557
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:13,159
Thank you.

558
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,061
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

559
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:17,003
I believe I still have the floor, Mr. President.

560
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:17,544
I'm sorry?

561
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:18,645
I believe I still have the floor.

562
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:19,465
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

563
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:21,868
So we negotiated a memorandum of understanding.

564
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:32,778
And as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route.

565
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:34,837
the stretch that it's going to go.

566
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:41,101
And the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation.

567
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:45,585
And what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in.

568
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:55,972
If we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan.

569
00:47:55,992 --> 00:48:01,356
And then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed.

570
00:48:02,063 --> 00:48:05,648
And if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void.

571
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:07,530
So that's a concern that we have as well.

572
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:17,503
So I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.

573
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:23,548
Vice President Mox.

574
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:37,141
I appreciate Councilman Light sharing that information and knowing that any approval comes before the mayor and also the council as a two-pronged approach, it would be very helpful maybe in future projects

575
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:43,967
that the administration sit down with this council and say, you know, we're crafting an MOU, memorandum of understanding.

576
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:47,529
You have partial approval of the streets.

577
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,210
What are your thoughts?

578
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,652
And that would have been helpful, Mr. President.

579
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:58,796
So now we're after the fact negotiating with the utility company that has already entered into an agreement with the city administration.

580
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:14,281
And in my opinion, I think we have every authority, otherwise it would be just a rubber stamp body just approving things to put conditions on this, Mr. President, that make sense to the rate payers and the tax payers of this community.

581
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:22,690
When you have a project coming into a city that has zero benefit to this community, I say zero benefit.

582
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:29,222
and 100% disruption, I think we have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents of this community.

583
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:32,565
So I look forward to speaking with the city solicitor on this.

584
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:34,787
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

585
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:35,688
Mr. President.

586
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:37,249
Councilor LaRusso.

587
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,331
Motion that the paper be received.

588
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:45,682
On the motion by Councilor De La Ruta, that the paper be received, seconded by Councilor Knight.

589
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:46,462
All those in favor?

590
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:46,922
Aye.

591
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:48,222
Motion passes.

592
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:54,724
Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?

593
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:55,424
Yes, you may.

594
00:49:55,904 --> 00:50:03,365
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17-764, request of the mayor to take 200 grand from free cash

595
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:10,046
for the plight of the people of Brooks Estate.

596
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:12,727
Would you like me to read the communication?

597
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,408
I wish you wouldn't, Mr. President.

598
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:25,173
We debated it extensively last week and we had a lot of words from those in favor from the gallery, Mr. President.

599
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,634
Okay, move approval.

600
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:33,057
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russa to take

601
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:40,881
Under suspension, to take this paper 17764 off the table, seconded by Councilor Falco.

602
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:41,722
All those in favor?

603
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:42,062
Aye.

604
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,443
Motion passes.

605
00:50:43,643 --> 00:50:46,524
Motion for approval on the paper, Mr. President.

606
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:56,849
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso on the paper, seconded by Councilor Falco.

607
00:50:57,029 --> 00:50:59,210
Mr. Clerk, please call.

608
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,031
Mr. President.

609
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:02,772
Councilor Mox, Vice President Mox.

610
00:51:03,816 --> 00:51:05,556
Thank you, Mr. President.

611
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:21,640
As the financial steward of this community, as we are as a body, and the mayor is coming before us requesting $200,000 of taxpayers' money, I would ask that the administration answer a few questions regarding this money, Mr. President.

612
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,440
And what questions would they be, Mr. Vice President?

613
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:33,082
Well, if the administration appears before the podium, Mr. President, I'd be more than happy to relay my questions.

614
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:40,789
Obviously, we have no one from the administration here this evening to answer those questions.

615
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:41,930
Mr. Vice President.

616
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:57,324
So the mayor is presenting a paper, Mr. President, a financial paper, and not one person could take the time out of their schedule to come up before the council to answer a question regarding taxpayers' money.

617
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,927
I just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President.

618
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:13,868
that not one person from the city administration was here last week, and they had ample opportunity because it was tabled for a week, or here tonight, Mr. President, to answer one question on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

619
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,612
But, Mr. President, I still will ask my questions.

620
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:34,896
I posed last week, and many of them, as representatives from the Brooks Estates quite eloquently stated, is not under the ability wig to answer why we don't have a capital plan in this community.

621
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:44,001
And I can appreciate the fact that representatives from the Brooks Estates, all volunteers that have been doing tremendous work to keep that

622
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:58,677
building and the carriage house afloat for so many years, and actually moved towards the rehabilitation of the manor and the property, have done great work, Mr. President.

623
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:12,003
My concern, and I reiterated this last week, is not with the Brooks Estates, is not with shoring up a building that I witnessed just recently as a building that's on the verge of collapse.

624
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:13,404
I agree with that.

625
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:20,386
I don't think anyone else could go over into that area or that building and say this building is not going to come down very shortly.

626
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,827
I think we all agree with it.

627
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:29,991
My concern, Mr President, is why don't we have a game plan in this community on capital improvement?

628
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,632
This is one issue.

629
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:38,454
There are a laundry list of issues that we need a capital plan for.

630
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:41,575
Last week, I mentioned the fire departments.

631
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:53,578
Each fire station has dire need, Mr. President, for upgrades and renovation in the fire stations where our brave men and women spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

632
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:59,436
That is one aspect that needs a capital plan.

633
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:02,957
We're not going to be able to do that work within the confines of our budget.

634
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:05,337
And I think we can all appreciate that.

635
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:14,099
Over the last several years, every member of this council has spoken about the poor condition of our sidewalks and our roads.

636
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:25,202
And based on over the years, that information, this city has put zero dollars for road replacement in the budget.

637
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:33,369
$0.

638
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:33,369
The only money we get for road replacement is through Chapter 90 money through the state.

639
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:45,255
It's about $980,000 a year, which is not going to be enough to start even remotely replacing and repaving the streets we know we need in this community.

640
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,777
We're never going to get ahead of the game in the way we're doing business.

641
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:53,440
We need a capital plan to address roads and sidewalks.

642
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:58,259
We have yet to get any capital plan regarding roads and sidewalks.

643
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,960
We talk about tree stumps.

644
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:10,644
Do we have to bring up the list again of tree stumps in this community that we just either don't have the will to take them out or don't have the funding to take them out?

645
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:11,724
It's one or the other.

646
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:17,126
I would hope it's the funding and not the will to take these out, Mr. President.

647
00:55:17,366 --> 00:55:20,327
But that's another capital plan we need to move forward on.

648
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:21,628
Catch basins.

649
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:24,399
Talk to the DPW commissioner.

650
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,720
Go down any street.

651
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:40,110
I'd venture to say, and this is just off the top of my head, 50 to 60% of our catch basins that are capturing rain runoff water and taking it out to the Mystic River are imploding.

652
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,111
And they're sinking into the ground.

653
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:44,753
We're not addressing these.

654
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,875
It needs to be a capital issue.

655
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:50,587
It needs to be a capital issue that we have to move forward to.

656
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:52,669
Traffic calming measures.

657
00:55:52,749 --> 00:56:04,398
We just had a meeting about the revitalization of Method Square and the master plan, much of which calls for traffic calming plans on main street and high street and Salem street.

658
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:13,466
We have many other streets in this community, upwards of 600 streets in this community that need the same traffic calming approaches.

659
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:22,372
But yet, we put nothing in the budget, or very little, I should say, to address these very important pedestrian safety issues.

660
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:24,692
We need a capital plan.

661
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,013
We're moving forward on a new library.

662
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:27,793
That's great.

663
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:31,055
We'll probably need a capital plan for that, a portion of that.

664
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:33,675
You know, we're moving forward on a police station.

665
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:37,857
We're probably gonna need some type of capital plan moving forward on the police station.

666
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:45,184
There are a lot of issues that we need a direction from this administration.

667
00:56:46,165 --> 00:56:58,992
The easy way out is to keep on allowing this administration to sit back and not give us a capital plan and take each issue one at a time.

668
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:01,933
That's our vision for this community.

669
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,454
When there's a need, we'll take the issue.

670
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:05,955
The carriage house is going to fall down.

671
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,176
Let's take some money out of free cash.

672
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:09,237
We'll repair that.

673
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,110
We'll wait till the next emergency.

674
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,392
We'll take care of that.

675
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:16,920
If we don't have a game plan in this community, we're never going to move forward.

676
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:18,903
We're never going to move forward.

677
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:26,164
And whether this is the carriage house or any other issue in this community, I've preached about this for years now.

678
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:31,907
And members of this council, I think, can agree that we've all asked for capital plans over the last several years.

679
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:37,550
And there have been few in coming by the last administration and this current administration.

680
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,231
So I'm not going to continue to work piecemeal.

681
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,753
If we want to ask the administration

682
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:51,852
To start looking at some of the needs we have in this community, I think we have to put our foot down at some point.

683
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:54,152
The easy thing is just to prove everything.

684
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:56,293
We have over $8 million in free cash.

685
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:58,653
The coffers are open.

686
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:00,574
Just keep on approving it.

687
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:01,954
That's the least resistance.

688
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:03,275
That's just to prove everything.

689
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:04,055
But guess what?

690
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,456
Someday, those coffers are going to be closed.

691
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:08,076
Times aren't going to be as good.

692
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,037
We're not going to have a reserve of $8 million in free cash.

693
00:58:11,937 --> 00:58:14,079
And the decisions are going to get tougher and tougher.

694
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:20,044
And that's why we need to have a game plan to tackle the most important issues, the pressing issues.

695
00:58:20,945 --> 00:58:27,791
So tonight, Mr. President, I'd like to find out what is the vision for the Brooks Banner?

696
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:32,909
We had a group that did Yeoman's work, and we heard about it last week.

697
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:44,432
Back in 2012, they created a master plan for the Brooks Estates, and how the Brooks Estates is gonna be able to be self-sustaining and reinvest back into the Brooks Estates.

698
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:57,556
And part of that vision was to use the carriage house as the economic engine, as a function hall, to generate money that we could put into road repair.

699
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:03,118
I said this last week, and I hope people from the Brooks Estates don't get offended.

700
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,920
You need a four-wheel truck to get up to the Brooks Estates.

701
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,002
And if you make it up there in a four-wheel pickup truck, you're lucky.

702
00:59:10,563 --> 00:59:12,123
That's how bad that road is.

703
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,424
It's awful.

704
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:17,326
It needs over a million and a half dollars of repair and underground utility.

705
00:59:19,408 --> 00:59:21,709
There's a lot of work that needs to take place up there.

706
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:23,070
What's the vision?

707
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,111
We were presented with the vision in 2012.

708
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,633
And what did this council do?

709
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:30,641
We sat on it.

710
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:35,742
Five years later, now we're talking about buckling up the carriage house.

711
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:40,103
Let's put an envelope over it and let it sit there for another five years.

712
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,223
That's our vision for the Brooks Estates.

713
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,684
That's what we're doing for historic preservation in this community.

714
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,465
Let's bring the plan out again.

715
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:52,765
Let's discuss the plan.

716
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:54,485
Let's see what our direction is.

717
00:59:55,945 --> 00:59:58,926
If it's the druthers of this council not to approve the plan,

718
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:04,750
again or not to ask for additional information, then so be it.

719
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:13,598
But to wait five years and then put a band-aid approach to just putting a capsule over the building, yes, it will preserve the building.

720
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:18,082
But we're still in the same spot we were, Mr. President, the same spot.

721
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,503
We're not moving forward.

722
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:26,970
As Mr. Lincoln eloquently said last week, this is a city-owned building, no different than Chevalier.

723
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:32,378
The city has to step up to the plate and take ownership.

724
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:37,079
And ownership is not putting a band-aid on a much larger problem.

725
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:45,362
So that would be my question to the mayor, or if your staff was here, what's the vision for the building for future use?

726
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:49,060
Do you have the same vision that the Brooks Estates has?

727
01:00:49,720 --> 01:01:10,254
Completely restore two buildings, the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House for public benefit, restore historic landscape, open space, natural habitat, capture the historic look and feel, promote biodiversity, improve habitat values, create the necessary economic engine to ensure long-term self-sufficiency of the property?

728
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:11,895
Is that the mayor's goal?

729
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,320
That's what I'd like to know, Mr. President.

730
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:16,162
We're putting $200,000.

731
01:01:17,566 --> 01:01:18,749
Is that the mayor's goal?

732
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:22,398
Is the mayor going to come up with a capital plan that includes the Brooks estates?

733
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:29,239
These are the questions I think we, as the financial stewards in this community, should be asking.

734
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:40,910
And the quick knee-jerk reaction, I've talked to a lot of people, I got a lot of emails, Tommy did a great job, got a lot of emails from residents of this community, and actually it enlightened me on a lot of issues.

735
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:46,074
And I found myself, which many residents said, that's compromise.

736
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:48,276
We need to secure the building.

737
01:01:48,676 --> 01:01:49,117
I agree.

738
01:01:50,145 --> 01:01:56,288
You know, we had a member of this council five years ago that said, let's tear down the building and build a new one.

739
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:00,530
I mean, that was the thought five years ago.

740
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:05,052
I don't know how they're going to vote now, but maybe they have a change in heart.

741
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:17,558
But I would ask Mr. President that this be a condition on the paper that the city administration present the council within the next six months

742
01:02:20,129 --> 01:02:24,271
After approval tonight, a capital plan addressing the city needs.

743
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:27,812
You will have my vote tonight if we can get that.

744
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:29,613
I think that's a simple request.

745
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:35,415
We can move ahead with the $200,000, and we're asking as a council, which we should be.

746
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:37,236
I think that should be unanimous.

747
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:40,677
Madam Mayor, present us with a capital plan.

748
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,478
You have six months to do so.

749
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,199
Present us with a capital plan.

750
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,379
Let us know your directions.

751
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,580
Let us know if it includes the Brooks Estates.

752
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:52,534
because these are the decisions we have to make as a body.

753
01:02:54,136 --> 01:03:11,594
And I'm prepared to make a decision either way tonight, but I thought if the people I spoke with that sent me emails and through my phone conversations, that this would be a great compromise to move the paper forward and also have an understanding that, Madam Mayor, we're gonna hold your feet to the fire.

754
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,072
We're going to make sure you're accountable.

755
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:20,956
You may not want to come out with a list of things that you want to accomplish, because then we can measure you by that.

756
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:23,137
So you may not want that on record.

757
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:24,037
But guess what?

758
01:03:24,578 --> 01:03:26,919
We as a city need to have that on record.

759
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,181
We need that to move issues forward in our community.

760
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:42,448
So that would be my condition on this paper, Mr. President, that the administration present the council within the next six months, after approval tonight, a capital plan addressing all city needs.

761
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:44,587
Point of order, Mr. President.

762
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:47,828
Point of order, Councilor Del Rosso.

763
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:53,249
Can we amend or make an attachment to a financial paper as such?

764
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:57,010
Mr. Clerk, is that a possibility?

765
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:06,332
This would be a little difficult because in six months the money might be already spent.

766
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,012
It's not a condition to spend your money.

767
01:04:09,032 --> 01:04:09,792
It's a condition.

768
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:11,493
If I could have my mic.

769
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:20,049
This is first of all a financial paper and the council has purview over whether we approve it or not.

770
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,651
So we can put a condition on any paper.

771
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,953
Secondly, we do it all the time with the utility companies.

772
01:04:26,394 --> 01:04:39,303
When they come in and they ask us to do work and open our streets up and they only want to repave the little area that they do work on, we put conditions of approval based on the fact that they have to do curb to curb restoration.

773
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,621
So we put conditions all the time.

774
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:42,761
This is no different.

775
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,962
I had a conversation with the city solicitor.

776
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:51,165
I won't speak for him, but this is no different than any other paper requesting us to approve something.

777
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:54,907
We're saying we will approve this, but you also have to do this.

778
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:59,790
So I don't think there's any problem putting a condition as I just mentioned.

779
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:05,052
So you want a vision for the whole city or just the Brooks Manor?

780
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,573
Capital plan addressing the entire city's needs.

781
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:08,734
Capital plan.

782
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,121
addressing the entire city.

783
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,143
Thank you.

784
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:17,364
Council Member Kern.

785
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:22,387
Thank you, President Carviello.

786
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:38,316
I too have just concerns, not only about the capital plan, but I voiced my concerns last week and requested that we sit down with the administration with regards to not only the entire capital plan and where the Brooks Estates fits into that, but also

787
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:48,061
how we plan on moving forward with the restored or rehabbed building if we do spend the $200,000 to rehab it.

788
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,462
I know that paper was failed.

789
01:05:50,562 --> 01:05:55,764
I think my questions could have been answered in a committee of the whole meeting, but we didn't have that.

790
01:05:55,904 --> 01:06:06,808
So I did reach out to Paul Mokey from the building department because I did have some questions, one of which was, if we do put $200,000 into the Carriage House

791
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:15,203
stabilize it, how long will that last us and how can it be used?

792
01:06:15,964 --> 01:06:25,106
Briefly, he did mention that he thinks it would stabilize the building for, I'm going to read a word for it, around five years or so.

793
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:29,547
So say then between four and six years, this building will be stabilized.

794
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:44,635
He then went on to say that people could go in it, but you couldn't necessarily, and I'm not speaking for him, I did speak to him over the phone and I did email with him, but people couldn't necessarily be of use within the building.

795
01:06:45,555 --> 01:06:59,203
Then I reached out to the mayor's office yesterday morning and thankfully got a little bit of a response, which was any future, I asked, what is the plan, what's the vision, if we stabilize this building,

796
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:04,056
how are we going to move forward, not only with CPA funds, but how are we going to move forward?

797
01:07:04,176 --> 01:07:12,579
And the answer was any future work for the Brooks Estates to be considered for funding through the CPA, which is great.

798
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:22,481
I think we have a good amount of money in the CPA that is in will and should go to a number of different things.

799
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:28,583
So in my head, calculating it a little bit, if you even took half of the CPA funds,

800
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:38,642
to rehab the building, and obviously you need the money to fix the road so that it could be economically viable as an option for a function facility.

801
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,303
You need the $4 million.

802
01:07:40,863 --> 01:07:48,629
Even if you took half of the CPA funds, you would only come up with between $2.5 and $3 million.

803
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:58,756
You wouldn't have the funds to rehab the building for the purpose that, you know, the committee has obviously presented to us in the past.

804
01:07:59,414 --> 01:08:01,595
And that's where I find it concerning.

805
01:08:01,615 --> 01:08:09,481
Yes, this building needs to be stabilized, but if we're going to spend the $200,000, I want to know that it's for a purpose.

806
01:08:09,621 --> 01:08:11,842
And I didn't get that answer from the mayor.

807
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:23,810
Are we going to use any of city monies to... And those are the questions that I think still are outstanding and need to be answered for my vote because

808
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:35,279
Yes, I would want to stabilize the building, but I want to know the plan, not only for that, but for the fire stations, for the roads, for all the other complaints that we get and money that we need to spend money on.

809
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,486
I think of the fire department taking the tour, and where they shower, there is like mold coming out of the bottom of the stalls.

810
01:08:43,506 --> 01:08:45,147
And nobody talks about that.

811
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:50,391
We're not asked to put money towards fixing the bathrooms in the fire department.

812
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:53,574
There's just so many different needs.

813
01:08:54,477 --> 01:09:00,661
I think the last time we got the capital plan was last January, February, two years ago, almost two years ago.

814
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:06,825
And we sat with the mayor for an hour, we looked at the capital plan, and I think this was a component in the capital plan.

815
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:10,087
It didn't pass two years ago, and now it's before us again.

816
01:09:10,107 --> 01:09:23,436
And I just think after two years, we need to sit down with the mayor as soon as next week and discuss how we're gonna move forward with the Brooks Estate, and how we're gonna move forward in this city entirely.

817
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,243
can't receive a paper.

818
01:09:26,383 --> 01:09:32,404
Last week I did table it, because what the paper said was, please approve $200,000 for the Brooks Estates.

819
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:40,407
Thankfully, the Brooks Estates had somewhat of a breakdown, which was more than we sometimes get from the city administration.

820
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:50,470
But for Paul Mokey to not even know it came before us last week, and not really, he's going to be, the building department is going to be involved in all of this.

821
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,031
And for him to not even know, never mind be available to

822
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:55,300
answer our questions in a committee of the whole meeting.

823
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,981
I find that extremely concerning for the taxpayers in this community.

824
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:03,843
If I voted for this tonight or last week, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions.

825
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:11,025
I wouldn't be able to say necessarily what the plan was or what I was even necessarily fully voting on.

826
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:13,907
And I don't think that's right.

827
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,888
I again ask that we just sit with the mayor and discuss this.

828
01:10:17,228 --> 01:10:22,110
You very well may have my vote next week if I sit with the mayor and just figure out her vision.

829
01:10:23,806 --> 01:10:29,667
for a million to a million and a half to do a road, plus the rehab to completely redo the building.

830
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:39,109
And then it hit the nail on the head last week when the new member of the board, who was very well-spoken, did mention that, why don't we take it down and rebuild it?

831
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:41,809
And I think one of the councilors said that a couple years ago.

832
01:10:41,849 --> 01:10:42,049
It was me.

833
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:45,130
Yeah, Councilor Carvillo, you said that, why don't we rebuild it?

834
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,590
It would cost us less money.

835
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,851
And I mean, nobody wants it.

836
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,731
We want to preserve it, but it's

837
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:55,993
You have to be realistic in a way where we have needs.

838
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,413
People want a library.

839
01:10:57,693 --> 01:11:00,094
People want new fire station.

840
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,134
We're building a new police station for millions and millions of dollars.

841
01:11:03,394 --> 01:11:07,375
We have needs and maintenance issues in our schools that need to be addressed.

842
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,836
So where does this fit in?

843
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:12,576
And that's where I'm concerned tonight.

844
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:14,177
It's where I was concerned last week.

845
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:20,398
Forget about personnel that we need to hire and to make our police and fire to the staffing levels that

846
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:34,909
people, you know, the city wants, there's just so much that goes into this money papers and we never get a good enough, we usually always meet in the Committee of the Whole, we get our questions answered, we discuss it, we round table it.

847
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:40,392
For this, you know, we obviously didn't meet in Committee of the Whole and I practically begged for it last week.

848
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:43,913
I think we need a meeting with the mayor on this one.

849
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:45,513
Thank you, Council.

850
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:46,714
Councilor Knight.

851
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,771
Mr. President, thank you very much.

852
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:55,334
I can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community, and prioritizing these needs are vital.

853
01:11:55,795 --> 01:11:57,756
And that's why we get elected.

854
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:11,583
The redevelopment of the Carriage House and the creation of the Shepard Brooks Estates to be a full-fledged function hall was part of the chart the course plan that was presented by Mayor McGlynn.

855
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:16,146
It was the last item that came before this council as part of the chart the course plan, and the council voted it down.

856
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:28,249
After the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan.

857
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:35,432
Regardless of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in.

858
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:42,195
They want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates.

859
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,047
And they came before us and they asked for this money.

860
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:52,490
And we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up.

861
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,251
And we had a committee of the whole on that.

862
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,812
And that was all we had.

863
01:12:57,492 --> 01:13:00,273
And now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming.

864
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:10,658
And the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan.

865
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:20,395
Regardless of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the carriage house is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area.

866
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:22,658
The carriage house is the catalyst.

867
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:25,782
The carriage house is also falling apart.

868
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:26,422
It's a disgrace.

869
01:13:26,683 --> 01:13:29,706
I mean, any one of us could go up there and if we look at it, it's not a carriage house.

870
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,268
It's a shell of a building that's falling apart.

871
01:13:32,497 --> 01:13:35,519
But that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President.

872
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:42,683
Week in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts.

873
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:48,786
This is one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community.

874
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:50,407
But this is by far the most beautiful.

875
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:54,429
It's got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there.

876
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:59,092
And I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan,

877
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:03,536
I think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there.

878
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:05,997
There are many options and many opportunities for us.

879
01:14:06,017 --> 01:14:11,059
And we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future.

880
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:11,459
I don't know.

881
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:16,521
But what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location.

882
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:27,324
And this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week.

883
01:14:28,445 --> 01:14:29,365
And quite frankly,

884
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:34,962
the vital need that we have in Sheppard Brooks Estates if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President.

885
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:38,263
So with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.

886
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:40,443
Thank you.

887
01:14:40,463 --> 01:14:41,063
Councilor Nay.

888
01:14:41,803 --> 01:14:44,364
On the motion by Councilor Falco.

889
01:14:44,904 --> 01:14:45,724
Thank you, Mr. President.

890
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,645
I also want to go on the record of supporting this.

891
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:56,066
Um, I take a look at the Brooks Estate and I take a look at the, uh, the money that, um, I mean, I look at it as,

892
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:59,456
If we appropriate this money tonight, to me, to me, this is an investment.

893
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:01,298
It's an investment in the Brooks estate.

894
01:15:01,838 --> 01:15:03,119
It's an investment in our community.

895
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:07,723
I mean, there are other cities and towns that would really love to have a property like this.

896
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:11,645
Uh, like council and I said, 50 acres of, uh, open space.

897
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:12,966
I think it's a great opportunity.

898
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:17,550
Um, and I think that's something that we need to look at, but I think we need to, I think we need to embrace this.

899
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,711
I mean, I think that this is a,

900
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,615
This is a historical site.

901
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:25,157
I think there's a lot of opportunity here, the potential to actually bring in revenue.

902
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:28,479
So this is something that I do support as well.

903
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,240
Thank you.

904
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,221
Thank you, Councilor Palco.

905
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,161
Move the question, Mr. President.

906
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:32,162
Councilor Scott Pelli.

907
01:15:32,302 --> 01:15:33,202
Thank you, Mr. President.

908
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:34,943
I don't want to be redundant, but I will.

909
01:15:37,425 --> 01:15:44,329
I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.

910
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:49,012
I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we

911
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:51,339
weren't looking at the bigger picture.

912
01:15:51,379 --> 01:16:07,628
But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.

913
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:12,031
Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.

914
01:16:12,771 --> 01:16:18,895
And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,

915
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:39,581
And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from

916
01:16:40,049 --> 01:16:46,551
the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.

917
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:52,313
And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.

918
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:58,914
So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.

919
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:09,793
to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.

920
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:10,353
Thank you.

921
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:12,214

Councilor Lungo-Kern.

924
01:17:27,163 --> 01:17:30,705
I just want to note my opposition because I believe

925
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,781
Questions need to be answered, even if it just took a week.

926
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,303
Thank you, Councilor Long-Kern.

927
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:37,984

President Caviello?

941
01:17:51,151 --> 01:17:51,411
Yes.

942

Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

Well, we have the meeting on December 26th, the city council meeting will be canceled so everybody knows.

The

951
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:37,125
Do we have a motion to, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso, that we cancel the December 26th City Council meeting?

01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:54,913
Mr. President.

962
01:18:54,953 --> 01:18:57,414
I apologize, I have not had an opportunity to read the records.

963
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:00,382
Do you think we'll have them by the end of the year?

964
01:19:00,962 --> 01:19:02,623
I'm hoping it'll be my New Year's resolution.

965
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:03,123
All right.

I want to thank the ladies from the Jingle Bell Committee who do this every year.

973
01:19:32,307 --> 01:19:38,231
And all the monies raised from this event go to the Buddy Collins Center in Medford.

974
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,952

I just want to thank Mr. President.

981
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:59,045
Over this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, we had a very important democratic moment in this community where we had a recount.

982
01:19:59,865 --> 01:20:05,750
And there were many, many volunteers that spent eight to nine hours on both Saturday and Sunday.

983
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:11,134
And I just want to thank all the volunteers that allowed this process to move forward.

01:20:11,835 --> 01:20:14,157
And I want to thank this city

985
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:16,838
for being a great city to live in, Mr. President.

986
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:24,421
I was one of those volunteers, and to see how the projects work was quite an experience, and I'm glad I was here to help.
