19
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:49,990

00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:53,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

21
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:58,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?

22
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:19,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there is an additional

24
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:30,072
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline.

25
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:42,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.

26
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:44,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.

27
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:58,249
[SPEAKER_05]: If the messenger could make a few copies of this to maybe some people in the audience, it would be appreciated.

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

29
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll also be posted on the website.

30
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:11,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to make a comment?

31
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

32
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:15,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on one second.

33
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford.

34
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I spoke before the council last week

35
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,650
[SPEAKER_10]: about this issue, about the non-notification.

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:32,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And because of the intercession of the council, we got the deadline

37
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,045
[SPEAKER_10]: pushed back to December 12th.

38
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,447
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I have one other question.

39
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:51,488
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mentioned last week that I knocked on 150 doors to inform people about the meeting that didn't know about it.

40
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:58,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So now, those 150 people don't know about the extension of the deadline for the comments.

41
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:07,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a long address and Councilor De La Ruza just read it off, but I was wondering if you people had any suggestions on how you could get that.

42
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be on the city website also.

43
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but people need to know to go there.

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,972
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, we have to, people don't know that the deadline has been extended.

45
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:18,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

46
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Longo-Kurin.

47
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call

48
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:35,437
[SPEAKER_07]: to go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.

49
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, that might be, I was thinking of that also.

50
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:44,482
[SPEAKER_10]: You could probably, on the government access channel where you post the street sweeping session, you could probably post a notice there as well.

51
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,804
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be a good idea if you could do that.

52
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:51,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And going forward, and a newspaper notice.

53
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:56,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the T or the city is planning on any kind of newspaper notice.

54
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to see about that.

55
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:03,668
[SPEAKER_10]: But going forward, I appreciate the efforts that the council made on behalf of the residents.

56
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:14,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And I urge you all to please stay involved with this project because it's been a long drawn out thing and advocate for resident involvements.

57
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:29,817
[SPEAKER_10]: The city, I think, down the road, needs to have a dedicated meeting for our butters and those directly affected in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the track, because there are a lot of new people who have moved in.

58
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,919
[SPEAKER_10]: This project has been going on for 12 years.

59
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And those new people who have come in the neighborhood, some of them don't even know what this is all about.

60
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:51,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the city should try to get those abutters together and bring them up to date of what's going on, what the future is, what the city has planned, if there's economic development, where it is, who it's going to involve, and so forth.

61
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And my offer stands that I gave you people last week.

62
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:01,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be glad to lead a walking tour through the neighborhoods for both the council and the mayor.

63
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Because a picture is worth a thousand words.

64
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,363
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can see what it is we're talking about, you have a better appreciation of what's going on.

65
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for your time and thank you for your advocacy.

66
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, you may see me again if we have another issue.

67
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

68
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:18,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

69
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:24,251
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week.

70
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,992
[SPEAKER_07]: There was about five people here.

71
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:31,565
[SPEAKER_07]: advocating for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification.

72
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:50,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,642
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

76
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

77
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:09,472
[SPEAKER_13]: That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.

78
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:16,795
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Falco.

79
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:17,676
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

80
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:18,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

81
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

82
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:25,199
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-778, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved

83
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:33,670
[SPEAKER_05]: that the MBTA install a bus shelter at the bus stop on South Porter Road at Roosevelt Circle Rotary in the interest of public safety.

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

85
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:42,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scarpelli has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.

86
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:47,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

87
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:55,167
[SPEAKER_05]: 1779, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, being resolved the city administration reach out to the MBTA to inquire about placing a bus shelter at the bus stop

88
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: located at Southwater Road in Roosevelt Circle.

89
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox, continue.

90
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

91
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,344
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus.

92
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:18,472
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle.

93
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:28,661
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop.

94
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:52,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation.

95
00:07:53,337 --> 00:08:02,310
[SPEAKER_12]: and or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop.

96
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:08,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter.

97
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:15,937
[SPEAKER_12]: to protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location.

98
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:24,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,082
[SPEAKER_12]: It also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location.

100
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,423
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rep Donato reached out to me just recently

101
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:43,213
[SPEAKER_12]: and said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter.

102
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:49,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one.

103
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,095
[SPEAKER_12]: and said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop.

104
00:08:54,856 --> 00:09:01,480
[SPEAKER_12]: And the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it.

105
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:17,631
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth.

106
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,987
[SPEAKER_12]: and safety of commuters.

107
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:26,648
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus.

108
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:44,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench.

109
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,372
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that

110
00:09:48,150 --> 00:10:07,802
[SPEAKER_12]: This council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President.

111
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,404
[SPEAKER_12]: We may also have a resident here.

112
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if Barney's here tonight.

113
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:13,646
[SPEAKER_12]: She said she was going to come.

114
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

115
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:19,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

116
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Billy.

117
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

118
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.

119
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:30,518
[SPEAKER_09]: You brought up the same points.

120
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that in today's, um,

121
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.

122
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:49,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.

123
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We're limiting them from using public transportation.

124
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,102
[SPEAKER_09]: So I second the resolve from Council Marks and

125
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:25,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,

126
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:32,051
[SPEAKER_09]: information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.

127
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.

128
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:41,320
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.

129
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And to put a picnic bench out there, it's

130
00:11:48,775 --> 00:12:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.

131
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:15,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, Councilor Marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,

132
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,008
[SPEAKER_09]: an answer back within two weeks.

133
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:18,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

134
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

135
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

136
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

137
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also contacted by Bonnie as well.

138
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

139
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:31,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation.

140
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:39,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus.

141
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I, myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now.

142
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:45,244
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I've been taking the,

143
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:59,813
[SPEAKER_08]: for a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern.

144
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,295
[SPEAKER_08]: That can be a very dangerous stop.

145
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:12,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day,

146
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:13,823
[SPEAKER_08]: it gets even worse.

147
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:17,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone.

148
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:22,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward.

149
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:22,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

150
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member O'Karn.

151
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:25,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

152
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:29,930
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caraviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward.

153
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a concerning spot.

154
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:36,453
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements.

155
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live

156
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:47,704
[SPEAKER_07]: in the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters.

157
00:13:48,304 --> 00:14:01,827
[SPEAKER_07]: The use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus.

158
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to

159
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,737
[SPEAKER_07]: at least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community.

160
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:16,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there.

161
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly.

162
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:19,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So I second the approval.

163
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:20,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

164
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:21,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

165
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

166
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:28,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location.

167
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:31,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there?

168
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:36,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And Councilman Scarpelli made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA.

169
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:39,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President.

170
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:47,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this.

171
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,135
[SPEAKER_11]: some impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers.

172
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,118
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line.

173
00:14:55,158 --> 00:15:00,262
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President.

174
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:05,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended.

175
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:15,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.

176
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

177
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scarpelli.

178
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,561
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

179
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

180
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have someone that wants to speak?

181
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

182
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

183
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:35,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't see the process.

184
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:37,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Bonnie Styer.

185
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:42,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 35 Roosevelt Road, just a couple blocks away from this bus shelter.

186
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:50,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, council members, for your prompt and considerable response to my concern about this bus shelter.

187
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:55,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that it would be really helpful to have a bus shelter there.

188
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would increase the ridership.

189
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:07,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this bus stop, well the bus, the 325 and the 100 bus are wonderful ways to get into Boston on a daily basis.

190
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:13,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that more riders would be encouraged to take it if there was a shelter there in place.

191
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:16,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, like you mentioned earlier,

192
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:31,152
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very busy there and now that I'm leaving in the morning when it's, you know, the sun was rising at 6.50, being there in the dark is not a very great place to be with all those cars moving during the rush hour time.

193
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:41,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate all of your assistance and I'd be more than willing to help out with getting signatures or petition should the MBT need something like that.

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,741
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again.

195
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:43,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

196
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:49,410
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scarpellicott.

197
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:51,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

198
00:16:52,711 --> 00:17:06,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Just if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Medford, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community.

199
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all pay for it as riders.

200
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,080
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay through the sales tax.

201
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,081
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a percent that goes towards

202
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,001
[SPEAKER_12]: the operation of transit in this state.

203
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:26,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA.

204
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,955
[SPEAKER_12]: That money comes right off our cherry sheet.

205
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,778
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's money that goes right out of

206
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:35,402
[SPEAKER_12]: the city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing.

207
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:48,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just

208
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,954
[SPEAKER_12]: this shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations.

209
00:17:53,594 --> 00:18:01,817
[SPEAKER_12]: In the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters.

210
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:14,600
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scarpelli, that we get a quick response to this issue.

211
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, Mr. President, based on the fact that

212
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:25,037
[SPEAKER_12]: We're one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great.

213
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I like John Falco.

214
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,378
[SPEAKER_12]: take the bus every day also.

215
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:35,881
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents.

216
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:48,107
[SPEAKER_12]: We're paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President.

217
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:55,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.

218
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:56,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

219
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:57,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

220
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:58,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

221
00:18:58,523 --> 00:18:58,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

222
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:02,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Also where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella.

223
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:06,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation.

224
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're aware of the request that the council's making.

225
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

226
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:18,896
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by vice president mocks and Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Knight.

227
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,597
[SPEAKER_05]: seconded by Councilor Falco.

228
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:22,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

229
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:25,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested.

230
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

231
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both together, 1779 and 1778, as amended by Councilor Knight.

232
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Dello Russo?

233
00:19:59,386 --> 00:19:59,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

234
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:00,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

235
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:01,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

236
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

237
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:02,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

238
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Locker?

239
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:04,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

240
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:05,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice-President Marks?

241
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:05,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

242
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

243
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:07,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

244
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:08,988
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

245
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

246
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:15,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

247
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:26,351
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-780 offered by Councilor Locker, be it resolved that the administration through the Energy and Environment Office develop a database and start an opt-out list for those who want to opt out

248
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,430
[SPEAKER_05]: of any potentially implemented community aggregation plans.

249
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

250
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

251
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation.

252
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:53,762
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the energy environment director in Melrose, which I think,

253
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:59,530
[SPEAKER_07]: personally, for me, helped answer a lot of my questions.

254
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding.

255
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:15,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out.

256
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to

257
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:27,773
[SPEAKER_07]: move forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford.

258
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns.

259
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:54,074
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to make sure that that opt-out plan is

260
00:21:54,781 --> 00:22:00,886
[SPEAKER_07]: well publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to.

261
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:04,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth.

262
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:21,224
[SPEAKER_07]: What if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out.

263
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:26,644
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to, you can do it now, just in case something is implemented.

264
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:33,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea.

265
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:38,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months.

266
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just need to be ready on all accounts.

267
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So I move this forward.

268
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's definitely something worth exploring.

269
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:46,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's simple.

270
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a database.

271
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:50,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be

272
00:22:52,066 --> 00:23:13,943
[SPEAKER_07]: listed as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.

273
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:15,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

274
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

275
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.

277
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:35,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.

278
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:52,085
[SPEAKER_09]: in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.

279
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:59,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were

280
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:14,993
[SPEAKER_09]: The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.

281
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:18,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So one other thing that I want to point out,

282
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:29,078
[SPEAKER_09]: question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.

283
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:42,621
[SPEAKER_09]: And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had

284
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.

285
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:58,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.

286
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:08,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.

287
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:12,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's something that every

288
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:17,351
[SPEAKER_09]: constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.

289
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.

290
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:25,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.

291
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:33,222
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that

292
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:46,765
[SPEAKER_09]: When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.

293
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:50,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.

294
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:58,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.

295
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:02,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So that in turn goes back out to our residents.

296
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:08,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.

297
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scott-Bailey.

298
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:11,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

299
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

300
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,071
[SPEAKER_11]: When it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year.

301
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:25,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore.

302
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:28,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I think the time to move forward on it is now.

303
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, the question is, do we want

304
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:37,174
[SPEAKER_11]: to request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council.

305
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,857
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking a department head to say, start creating a list.

306
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,119
[SPEAKER_11]: We may or may not adopt municipal aggregation.

307
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President.

308
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,244
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation.

309
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take the vote and let's allow it to happen.

310
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:55,710
[SPEAKER_11]: But to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

311
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:01,164
[SPEAKER_11]: the Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list.

312
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt.

313
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time.

314
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.

315
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:14,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

316
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

317
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

318
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,471
[SPEAKER_08]: As many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one.

319
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good

320
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,562
[SPEAKER_08]: a good plan, I think it's a good program.

321
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:43,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department in Melrose just to get a different perspective.

322
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, I thought that was a very good presentation.

323
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:50,650
[SPEAKER_08]: She did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project.

324
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out.

325
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,513
[SPEAKER_08]: But I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor Knight.

326
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going.

327
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:06,322
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way.

328
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass.

329
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:12,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I think, you know, it's time.

330
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:16,263
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now.

331
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:24,786
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down, and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this.

332
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:32,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know, I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in Committee of the Wholes, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point.

333
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:39,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that, in my opinion, I really don't, I think a lot of our

334
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: departments to stretch with regard to resources.

335
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:50,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass.

336
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:55,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I, I, uh, agree with my colleague, uh, councilor Knight on this issue.

337
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:56,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

338
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:57,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

339
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

340
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:00,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:09,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.

342
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:13,999
[SPEAKER_13]: It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.

343
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:18,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Their agenda is to get METFIT into municipal aggregation.

344
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:26,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.

345
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:36,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.

346
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:39,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.

347
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:46,449
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.

348
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:55,718
[SPEAKER_13]: So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.

349
00:29:56,238 --> 00:30:03,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.

350
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,787
[SPEAKER_13]: They have something to gain.

351
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, always someone has something to gain, and there's nothing wrong with that.

352
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:24,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a stretch in some areas, and I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.

353
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:25,809
[SPEAKER_13]: What does this do to them?

354
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Does this target them in some way?

355
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Who has an access to this list?

356
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:34,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?

357
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:38,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, these are questions, uh, serious questions that I have.

358
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:44,548
[SPEAKER_13]: These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President, that they need a voice as well.

359
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:46,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to give them that voice.

360
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.

361
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:53,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to have further discussion on municipal, uh, aggregation.

362
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,797
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we need to have a credible,

363
00:30:57,338 --> 00:31:03,759
[SPEAKER_13]: bona fide expert on this matter who is going to give the argument contra.

364
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

365
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

366
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

367
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

368
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:15,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the sentiments of my colleagues.

369
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:19,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess.

370
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:24,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people

371
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,707
[SPEAKER_07]: call or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list.

372
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:34,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this.

373
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's simple, take minutes.

374
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:53,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with Councilor Dello Russo, there is an agenda for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their

375
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:03,676
[SPEAKER_07]: option to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they can opt out whenever, they're going to be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days.

376
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:05,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what people are concerned about.

377
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:20,385
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why you would implement something like this far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out, and they would get what they want.

378
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:21,826
[SPEAKER_07]: The people that don't want to be involved

379
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,374
[SPEAKER_07]: would be able to do that sooner than later.

380
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:29,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the council does meet in committee of the whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it.

381
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're definitely close to it.

382
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:34,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know people have definitely changed their minds.

383
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've learned a lot.

384
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,402
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some people that maybe are still against it.

385
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:44,566
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better knowing that they have more than that 30 days.

386
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:48,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the complaints I've been getting.

387
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought this was just a way

388
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:56,210
[SPEAKER_07]: sway another vote towards approving it and ease in people's fears.

389
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:57,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say it again.

390
00:32:57,412 --> 00:32:59,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So I move approval.

391
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:01,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see how it goes.

392
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:06,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.

393
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Locario.

394
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Mox.

395
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:19,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't support this resolution tonight based on the fact that I agree with my colleagues that this is something that hasn't been approved by the council as of yet.

397
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:28,249
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not going to partake in something that is going to tell residents that they can get out of something that the council is going to vote on.

398
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and in my opinion, what we should do,

399
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:44,879
[SPEAKER_12]: and I've stated this from day one, Mr. President is, uh, the energy and environment committee where this was sent at one point in this process, um, had a public hearing on it and we asked the city solicitor to attend.

400
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:59,126
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the questions, and it was actually my question was whether or not we can file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which, uh, is everyone is opted into the program.

401
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:00,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um,

402
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:07,918
[SPEAKER_12]: automatically and change it so you can opt into the program.

403
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel

404
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:21,161
[SPEAKER_12]: at the statehouse and they believe that we could file a home loan petition.

405
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,403
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is my number one concern.

406
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:35,656
[SPEAKER_12]: In my opinion, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company, not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Medford.

407
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:39,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you.

408
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint.

409
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:51,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit to by aggregating everyone together.

410
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,752
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I realize what the intent is.

411
00:34:56,313 --> 00:35:03,078
[SPEAKER_12]: But I, as one member of the council, don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program.

412
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And if this is such a great program,

413
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be overwhelming.

414
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:13,085
[SPEAKER_12]: People will be knocking on the door here at City Hall to get involved and say, I want to opt into that program.

415
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the program work.

416
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:16,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the program work.

417
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be my recommendation.

418
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:29,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion.

419
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:31,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

420
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:41,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from.

421
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,112
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way.

422
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:47,093
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe that should be the case.

423
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:50,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we should give residents of this community an option.

424
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,096
[SPEAKER_12]: If they want to opt into the program, then so be it.

425
00:35:54,136 --> 00:36:01,300
[SPEAKER_12]: You can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President.

426
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:10,685
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy.

427
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:23,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%.

428
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:27,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community.

429
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can opt out of that also.

430
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,419
[SPEAKER_12]: But now you say you can opt out of the program.

431
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,784
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that.

432
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,825
[SPEAKER_12]: That's be up front with the people.

433
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Let them choose whether they want to partake in this program.

434
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,230
[SPEAKER_12]: And I could support that, Mr. President.

435
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.

436
00:36:53,535 --> 00:36:54,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

437
00:36:55,537 --> 00:37:01,822
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by, name and address of the record, please.

438
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:02,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

439
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:06,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

440
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, honorable Councilors.

441
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:14,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not against the energy, especially clean energy.

442
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:21,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I may get a little bit off track, supposedly this country sent man to the moon a dozen times and brought him back safely.

443
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:25,473
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's true, there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels, period.

444
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:31,216
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a good reason, I'm sure, and that's capitalism from down deep in Texas.

445
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:42,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I believe Tesla, the famous inventor from Yugoslavia, was creating a power grid over 80 years ago, backed by J.P.

446
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan, I believe.

447
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:44,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And once J.P.

448
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:53,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan found out that Tesla wanted to give free energy from power plant to power plant without wires, mind you, he pulled the plug.

449
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so much for capitalism.

450
00:37:57,142 --> 00:38:00,645
[SPEAKER_01]: This community aggregation, I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing.

451
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's in it for the city.

452
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:22,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they would force undemocratically to pull all, I'm estimating, 40,000 National Grid electric ratepayers into the pool and making them opt out if they want to get out, which means they have to be proactive or, as I would say, reactive.

453
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:33,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And very well could be, instead of me paying $0.10 for the delivery charge on my electric bill, it could come in at $0.16.

454
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing different numbers.

455
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:40,338
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a 60% increase in my electric bill on the delivery charge only.

456
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:49,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm using an average of 400 kilowatts times $0.06 extra, that would be approximately $25, $26 extra.

457
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:57,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people may be having a hard time paying the electric bills as we speak.

458
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:04,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just hope this community aggregation does not become community aggravation.

459
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:06,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

460
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:06,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

461
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehnan, seconded by?

462
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

463
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:17,908
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

464
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

465
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion fails.

466
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn was in favor.

467
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:43,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And George, and Councilor Scarpelli.

468
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,233
[SPEAKER_05]: 17781 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the administration look into replacing

469
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:59,292
[SPEAKER_05]: with the help of Eversource, all lead pipes and outdated pipes that need an upgrade while the streets will be open during the construction period if the Eversource project is approved.

470
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:00,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

471
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:03,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

472
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:14,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely

473
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:28,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement.

474
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis.

475
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna make sure that the city administration

476
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,252
[SPEAKER_07]: really is on top of that.

477
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:48,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Cassandra is going to be on top of it.

478
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:55,556
[SPEAKER_07]: She seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it.

479
00:40:56,056 --> 00:41:07,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we

480
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:13,089
[SPEAKER_07]: We look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated.

481
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So we think about this before our streets are even open.

482
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if the administration has already thought about that.

483
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:23,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible.

484
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing.

485
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:32,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced.

486
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:38,289
[SPEAKER_07]: couple miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets.

487
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:46,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced.

488
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:50,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then.

489
00:41:50,596 --> 00:42:00,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.

490
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:01,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

491
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:07,496
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Falco.

492
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:08,276
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

493
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:08,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

494
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:09,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

495
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:23,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Reports of committee 17766, committee of the whole meeting from November 14th, 2017 regarding Enstar Eversource.

496
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have the report here which I will read.

497
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:36,928
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of the meeting was to receive a presentation from Eversource on their request for grants of location on the transmission project from moving through Medford.

498
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: The following recommendations were made.

499
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:43,531
[SPEAKER_05]: That one, a traffic plan be submitted to the council and the police chief.

500
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:49,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, construction schedule with start dates, days of weeks, and times be submitted.

501
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:55,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, that Eversource set up an informational meeting at the high school to include

502
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:05,811
[SPEAKER_05]: the winter street residents in a budding neighborhoods for that a contact name for the project with a telephone number and email be posted to the city's website.

503
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:17,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Five that plans be provided by ever source on route on the route from question street to the city line that were included seven

504
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:20,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Eversource develop a regional communication plan.

505
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: That plan would entail them developing a strategy of contacting TV and radio station, notifying non-Method residents about the project, and to notify them of alternate routes.

506
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:38,938
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion was made by council tonight to send this report out.

507
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me answer.

508
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:44,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

509
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there a number six on that?

510
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:51,980
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another missing somewhere along the line.

511
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was only supposed to be seven and it ended up being eight.

512
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,472
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I, okay.

513
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:58,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought a number.

514
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:13,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken, as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route.

515
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,223
[SPEAKER_12]: And we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting.

516
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:20,964
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said,

517
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:34,310
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth, but it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookups.

518
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the meeting from last week or the week before?

519
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:37,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week.

520
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: It was last week.

521
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:39,553
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from two weeks ago.

522
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?

523
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:51,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so those questions will come out again.

524
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:53,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

525
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our questions still go somewhere, right?

526
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:57,396
[SPEAKER_12]: When we ask,

527
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:10,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Eversource was before us.

528
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,486
[SPEAKER_12]: We asked Eversource to produce some information.

529
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that information doesn't go anywhere?

530
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, when we meet next week with them again, we'll bring it up to them again.

531
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

532
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,150
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

533
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:33,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Neistat.

534
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:43,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation.

535
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:45,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And that this isn't related to that meeting then.

536
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Because one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.

537
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:51,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

538
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:52,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

539
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:55,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day.

540
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:55,501
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

541
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good to me.

542
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:06,434
[SPEAKER_12]: But we may not get that information before next Tuesday.

543
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:07,874
[SPEAKER_12]: This issue is coming up again, correct?

544
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:08,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

545
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,716
[SPEAKER_12]: So we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting.

546
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:16,598
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an issue.

547
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,881
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.

548
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:39,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.

549
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we only got halfway through right halfway through.

550
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:47,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?

551
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.

552
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:52,528
[SPEAKER_05]: All right

553
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, Mr. Clerk, if you could have this letter sent up to the city engineer.

554
00:46:57,355 --> 00:47:00,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe she can help us out before the next week's meeting with that.

555
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,968
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.

556
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, if you could take care of that, please.

557
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:13,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

558
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,061
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

559
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:17,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe I still have the floor, Mr. President.

560
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:17,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry?

561
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:18,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe I still have the floor.

562
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:19,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

563
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:21,868
[SPEAKER_11]: So we negotiated a memorandum of understanding.

564
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:32,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route.

565
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:34,837
[SPEAKER_11]: the stretch that it's going to go.

566
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:41,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation.

567
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:45,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in.

568
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:55,972
[SPEAKER_11]: If we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan.

569
00:47:55,992 --> 00:48:01,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed.

570
00:48:02,063 --> 00:48:05,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void.

571
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:07,530
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a concern that we have as well.

572
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:17,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.

573
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:23,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Mox.

574
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:37,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate Councilman Light sharing that information and knowing that any approval comes before the mayor and also the council as a two-pronged approach, it would be very helpful maybe in future projects

575
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:43,967
[SPEAKER_12]: that the administration sit down with this council and say, you know, we're crafting an MOU, memorandum of understanding.

576
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:47,529
[SPEAKER_12]: You have partial approval of the streets.

577
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,210
[SPEAKER_12]: What are your thoughts?

578
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,652
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would have been helpful, Mr. President.

579
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:58,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So now we're after the fact negotiating with the utility company that has already entered into an agreement with the city administration.

580
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:14,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And in my opinion, I think we have every authority, otherwise it would be just a rubber stamp body just approving things to put conditions on this, Mr. President, that make sense to the rate payers and the tax payers of this community.

581
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:22,690
[SPEAKER_12]: When you have a project coming into a city that has zero benefit to this community, I say zero benefit.

582
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:29,222
[SPEAKER_12]: and 100% disruption, I think we have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents of this community.

583
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:32,565
[SPEAKER_12]: So I look forward to speaking with the city solicitor on this.

584
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:34,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

585
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:35,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

586
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:37,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor LaRusso.

587
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion that the paper be received.

588
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:45,682
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor De La Ruta, that the paper be received, seconded by Councilor Knight.

589
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:46,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

590
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:46,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

591
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:48,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

592
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:54,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?

593
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:55,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you may.

594
00:49:55,904 --> 00:50:03,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17-764, request of the mayor to take 200 grand from free cash

595
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:10,046
[SPEAKER_13]: for the plight of the people of Brooks Estate.

596
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:12,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like me to read the communication?

597
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish you wouldn't, Mr. President.

598
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:25,173
[SPEAKER_13]: We debated it extensively last week and we had a lot of words from those in favor from the gallery, Mr. President.

599
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, move approval.

600
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:33,057
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dela Russa to take

601
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:40,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Under suspension, to take this paper 17764 off the table, seconded by Councilor Falco.

602
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:41,722
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

603
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:42,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

604
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

605
00:50:43,643 --> 00:50:46,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval on the paper, Mr. President.

606
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:56,849
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo on the paper, seconded by Councilor Falco.

607
00:50:57,029 --> 00:50:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call.

608
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

609
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:02,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, Vice President Mox.

610
00:51:03,816 --> 00:51:05,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

611
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:21,640
[SPEAKER_12]: As the financial steward of this community, as we are as a body, and the mayor is coming before us requesting $200,000 of taxpayers' money, I would ask that the administration answer a few questions regarding this money, Mr. President.

612
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And what questions would they be, Mr. Vice President?

613
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:33,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if the administration appears before the podium, Mr. President, I'd be more than happy to relay my questions.

614
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:40,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have no one from the administration here this evening to answer those questions.

615
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:41,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Vice President.

616
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:57,324
[SPEAKER_12]: So the mayor is presenting a paper, Mr. President, a financial paper, and not one person could take the time out of their schedule to come up before the council to answer a question regarding taxpayers' money.

617
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President.

618
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:13,868
[SPEAKER_12]: that not one person from the city administration was here last week, and they had ample opportunity because it was tabled for a week, or here tonight, Mr. President, to answer one question on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

619
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,612
[SPEAKER_12]: But, Mr. President, I still will ask my questions.

620
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:34,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I posed last week, and many of them, as representatives from the Brooks Estates quite eloquently stated, is not under the ability wig to answer why we don't have a capital plan in this community.

621
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:44,001
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can appreciate the fact that representatives from the Brooks Estates, all volunteers that have been doing tremendous work to keep that

622
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:58,677
[SPEAKER_12]: building and the carriage house afloat for so many years, and actually moved towards the rehabilitation of the manor and the property, have done great work, Mr. President.

623
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:12,003
[SPEAKER_12]: My concern, and I reiterated this last week, is not with the Brooks Estates, is not with shoring up a building that I witnessed just recently as a building that's on the verge of collapse.

624
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:13,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

625
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:20,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think anyone else could go over into that area or that building and say this building is not going to come down very shortly.

626
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,827
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we all agree with it.

627
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:29,991
[SPEAKER_12]: My concern, Mr. President, is why don't we have a game plan in this community on capital improvement?

628
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,632
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one issue.

629
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:38,454
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a laundry list of issues that we need a capital plan for.

630
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:41,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week, I mentioned the fire departments.

631
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:53,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Each fire station has dire need, Mr. President, for upgrades and renovation in the fire stations where our brave men and women spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

632
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:59,436
[SPEAKER_12]: That is one aspect that needs a capital plan.

633
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:02,957
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to be able to do that work within the confines of our budget.

634
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:05,337
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we can all appreciate that.

635
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:14,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the last several years, every member of this council has spoken about the poor condition of our sidewalks and our roads.

636
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:25,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And based on over the years, that information, this city has put zero dollars for road replacement in the budget.

637
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:33,369
[SPEAKER_12]: $0.

638
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:33,369
[SPEAKER_12]: The only money we get for road replacement is through Chapter 90 money through the state.

639
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:45,255
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about $980,000 a year, which is not going to be enough to start even remotely replacing and repaving the streets we know we need in this community.

640
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,777
[SPEAKER_12]: We're never going to get ahead of the game in the way we're doing business.

641
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:53,440
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a capital plan to address roads and sidewalks.

642
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:58,259
[SPEAKER_12]: We have yet to get any capital plan regarding roads and sidewalks.

643
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,960
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about tree stumps.

644
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:10,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have to bring up the list again of tree stumps in this community that we just either don't have the will to take them out or don't have the funding to take them out?

645
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:11,724
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one or the other.

646
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:17,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hope it's the funding and not the will to take these out, Mr. President.

647
00:55:17,366 --> 00:55:20,327
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's another capital plan we need to move forward on.

648
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:21,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Catch basins.

649
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:24,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk to the DPW commissioner.

650
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Go down any street.

651
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:40,110
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd venture to say, and this is just off the top of my head, 50 to 60% of our catch basins that are capturing rain runoff water and taking it out to the Mystic River are imploding.

652
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're sinking into the ground.

653
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:44,753
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not addressing these.

654
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,875
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be a capital issue.

655
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:50,587
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be a capital issue that we have to move forward to.

656
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:52,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Traffic calming measures.

657
00:55:52,749 --> 00:56:04,398
[SPEAKER_12]: We just had a meeting about the revitalization of Method Square and the master plan, much of which calls for traffic calming plans on main street and high street and Salem street.

658
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:13,466
[SPEAKER_12]: We have many other streets in this community, upwards of 600 streets in this community that need the same traffic calming approaches.

659
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:22,372
[SPEAKER_12]: But yet, we put nothing in the budget, or very little, I should say, to address these very important pedestrian safety issues.

660
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:24,692
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a capital plan.

661
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,013
[SPEAKER_12]: We're moving forward on a new library.

662
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:27,793
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

663
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:31,055
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll probably need a capital plan for that, a portion of that.

664
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:33,675
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're moving forward on a police station.

665
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:37,857
[SPEAKER_12]: We're probably gonna need some type of capital plan moving forward on the police station.

666
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:45,184
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of issues that we need a direction from this administration.

667
00:56:46,165 --> 00:56:58,992
[SPEAKER_12]: The easy way out is to keep on allowing this administration to sit back and not give us a capital plan and take each issue one at a time.

668
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:01,933
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our vision for this community.

669
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,454
[SPEAKER_12]: When there's a need, we'll take the issue.

670
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:05,955
[SPEAKER_12]: The carriage house is going to fall down.

671
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's take some money out of free cash.

672
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:09,237
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll repair that.

673
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,110
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll wait till the next emergency.

674
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,392
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take care of that.

675
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:16,920
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't have a game plan in this community, we're never going to move forward.

676
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:18,903
[SPEAKER_12]: We're never going to move forward.

677
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:26,164
[SPEAKER_12]: And whether this is the carriage house or any other issue in this community, I've preached about this for years now.

678
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:31,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And members of this council, I think, can agree that we've all asked for capital plans over the last several years.

679
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:37,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And there have been few in coming by the last administration and this current administration.

680
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,231
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not going to continue to work piecemeal.

681
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,753
[SPEAKER_12]: If we want to ask the administration

682
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:51,852
[SPEAKER_12]: To start looking at some of the needs we have in this community, I think we have to put our foot down at some point.

683
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:54,152
[SPEAKER_12]: The easy thing is just to prove everything.

684
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:56,293
[SPEAKER_12]: We have over $8 million in free cash.

685
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:58,653
[SPEAKER_12]: The coffers are open.

686
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Just keep on approving it.

687
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:01,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the least resistance.

688
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:03,275
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just to prove everything.

689
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:04,055
[SPEAKER_12]: But guess what?

690
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Someday, those coffers are going to be closed.

691
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:08,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Times aren't going to be as good.

692
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,037
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to have a reserve of $8 million in free cash.

693
00:58:11,937 --> 00:58:14,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And the decisions are going to get tougher and tougher.

694
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:20,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we need to have a game plan to tackle the most important issues, the pressing issues.

695
00:58:20,945 --> 00:58:27,791
[SPEAKER_12]: So tonight, Mr. President, I'd like to find out what is the vision for the Brooks Banner?

696
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:32,909
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a group that did Yeoman's work, and we heard about it last week.

697
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:44,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Back in 2012, they created a master plan for the Brooks Estates, and how the Brooks Estates is gonna be able to be self-sustaining and reinvest back into the Brooks Estates.

698
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:57,556
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of that vision was to use the carriage house as the economic engine, as a function hall, to generate money that we could put into road repair.

699
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:03,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I said this last week, and I hope people from the Brooks Estates don't get offended.

700
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,920
[SPEAKER_12]: You need a four-wheel truck to get up to the Brooks Estates.

701
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you make it up there in a four-wheel pickup truck, you're lucky.

702
00:59:10,563 --> 00:59:12,123
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how bad that road is.

703
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,424
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awful.

704
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:17,326
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs over a million and a half dollars of repair and underground utility.

705
00:59:19,408 --> 00:59:21,709
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of work that needs to take place up there.

706
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:23,070
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the vision?

707
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,111
[SPEAKER_12]: We were presented with the vision in 2012.

708
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And what did this council do?

709
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:30,641
[SPEAKER_12]: We sat on it.

710
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:35,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Five years later, now we're talking about buckling up the carriage house.

711
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:40,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's put an envelope over it and let it sit there for another five years.

712
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,223
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our vision for the Brooks Estates.

713
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,684
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we're doing for historic preservation in this community.

714
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's bring the plan out again.

715
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:52,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's discuss the plan.

716
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:54,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what our direction is.

717
00:59:55,945 --> 00:59:58,926
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's the druthers of this council not to approve the plan,

718
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:04,750
[SPEAKER_12]: again or not to ask for additional information, then so be it.

719
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:13,598
[SPEAKER_12]: But to wait five years and then put a band-aid approach to just putting a capsule over the building, yes, it will preserve the building.

720
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:18,082
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're still in the same spot we were, Mr. President, the same spot.

721
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,503
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not moving forward.

722
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:26,970
[SPEAKER_12]: As Mr. Lincoln eloquently said last week, this is a city-owned building, no different than Chevalier.

723
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:32,378
[SPEAKER_12]: The city has to step up to the plate and take ownership.

724
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:37,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And ownership is not putting a band-aid on a much larger problem.

725
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:45,362
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be my question to the mayor, or if your staff was here, what's the vision for the building for future use?

726
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:49,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have the same vision that the Brooks Estates has?

727
01:00:49,720 --> 01:01:10,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely restore two buildings, the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House for public benefit, restore historic landscape, open space, natural habitat, capture the historic look and feel, promote biodiversity, improve habitat values, create the necessary economic engine to ensure long-term self-sufficiency of the property?

728
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:11,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the mayor's goal?

729
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'd like to know, Mr. President.

730
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:16,162
[SPEAKER_12]: We're putting $200,000.

731
01:01:17,566 --> 01:01:18,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the mayor's goal?

732
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:22,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the mayor going to come up with a capital plan that includes the Brooks estates?

733
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:29,239
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the questions I think we, as the financial stewards in this community, should be asking.

734
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:40,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And the quick knee-jerk reaction, I've talked to a lot of people, I got a lot of emails, Tommy did a great job, got a lot of emails from residents of this community, and actually it enlightened me on a lot of issues.

735
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:46,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found myself, which many residents said, that's compromise.

736
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:48,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to secure the building.

737
01:01:48,676 --> 01:01:49,117
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

738
01:01:50,145 --> 01:01:56,288
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we had a member of this council five years ago that said, let's tear down the building and build a new one.

739
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:00,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that was the thought five years ago.

740
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:05,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how they're going to vote now, but maybe they have a change in heart.

741
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:17,558
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would ask Mr. President that this be a condition on the paper that the city administration present the council within the next six months

742
01:02:20,129 --> 01:02:24,271
[SPEAKER_12]: After approval tonight, a capital plan addressing the city needs.

743
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:27,812
[SPEAKER_12]: You will have my vote tonight if we can get that.

744
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:29,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a simple request.

745
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:35,415
[SPEAKER_12]: We can move ahead with the $200,000, and we're asking as a council, which we should be.

746
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:37,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that should be unanimous.

747
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:40,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, present us with a capital plan.

748
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,478
[SPEAKER_12]: You have six months to do so.

749
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Present us with a capital plan.

750
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Let us know your directions.

751
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Let us know if it includes the Brooks Estates.

752
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:52,534
[SPEAKER_12]: because these are the decisions we have to make as a body.

753
01:02:54,136 --> 01:03:11,594
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm prepared to make a decision either way tonight, but I thought if the people I spoke with that sent me emails and through my phone conversations, that this would be a great compromise to move the paper forward and also have an understanding that, Madam Mayor, we're gonna hold your feet to the fire.

754
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,072
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to make sure you're accountable.

755
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:20,956
[SPEAKER_12]: You may not want to come out with a list of things that you want to accomplish, because then we can measure you by that.

756
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:23,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So you may not want that on record.

757
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:24,037
[SPEAKER_12]: But guess what?

758
01:03:24,578 --> 01:03:26,919
[SPEAKER_12]: We as a city need to have that on record.

759
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,181
[SPEAKER_12]: We need that to move issues forward in our community.

760
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:42,448
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be my condition on this paper, Mr. President, that the administration present the council within the next six months, after approval tonight, a capital plan addressing all city needs.

761
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:44,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of order, Mr. President.

762
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:47,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of order, Councilor Dello Russo.

763
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:53,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we amend or make an attachment to a financial paper as such?

764
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:57,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, is that a possibility?

765
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:06,332
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be a little difficult because in six months the money might be already spent.

766
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,012
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a condition to spend your money.

767
01:04:09,032 --> 01:04:09,792
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a condition.

768
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:11,493
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could have my mic.

769
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:20,049
[SPEAKER_12]: This is first of all a financial paper and the council has purview over whether we approve it or not.

770
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,651
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can put a condition on any paper.

771
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Secondly, we do it all the time with the utility companies.

772
01:04:26,394 --> 01:04:39,303
[SPEAKER_12]: When they come in and they ask us to do work and open our streets up and they only want to repave the little area that they do work on, we put conditions of approval based on the fact that they have to do curb to curb restoration.

773
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So we put conditions all the time.

774
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:42,761
[SPEAKER_12]: This is no different.

775
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,962
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a conversation with the city solicitor.

776
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:51,165
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't speak for him, but this is no different than any other paper requesting us to approve something.

777
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:54,907
[SPEAKER_12]: We're saying we will approve this, but you also have to do this.

778
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:59,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think there's any problem putting a condition as I just mentioned.

779
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:05,052
[SPEAKER_12]: So you want a vision for the whole city or just the Brooks Manor?

780
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Capital plan addressing the entire city's needs.

781
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:08,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Capital plan.

782
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,121
[SPEAKER_05]: addressing the entire city.

783
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

784
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:17,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

785
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:22,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

786
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:38,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I too have just concerns, not only about the capital plan, but I voiced my concerns last week and requested that we sit down with the administration with regards to not only the entire capital plan and where the Brooks Estates fits into that, but also

787
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:48,061
[SPEAKER_07]: how we plan on moving forward with the restored or rehabbed building if we do spend the $200,000 to rehab it.

788
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that paper was failed.

789
01:05:50,562 --> 01:05:55,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my questions could have been answered in a committee of the whole meeting, but we didn't have that.

790
01:05:55,904 --> 01:06:06,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did reach out to Paul Mokey from the building department because I did have some questions, one of which was, if we do put $200,000 into the Carriage House

791
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:15,203
[SPEAKER_07]: stabilize it, how long will that last us and how can it be used?

792
01:06:15,964 --> 01:06:25,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Briefly, he did mention that he thinks it would stabilize the building for, I'm going to read a word for it, around five years or so.

793
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:29,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So say then between four and six years, this building will be stabilized.

794
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:44,635
[SPEAKER_07]: He then went on to say that people could go in it, but you couldn't necessarily, and I'm not speaking for him, I did speak to him over the phone and I did email with him, but people couldn't necessarily be of use within the building.

795
01:06:45,555 --> 01:06:59,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I reached out to the mayor's office yesterday morning and thankfully got a little bit of a response, which was any future, I asked, what is the plan, what's the vision, if we stabilize this building,

796
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:04,056
[SPEAKER_07]: how are we going to move forward, not only with CPA funds, but how are we going to move forward?

797
01:07:04,176 --> 01:07:12,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer was any future work for the Brooks Estates to be considered for funding through the CPA, which is great.

798
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:22,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a good amount of money in the CPA that is in will and should go to a number of different things.

799
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:28,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So in my head, calculating it a little bit, if you even took half of the CPA funds,

800
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: to rehab the building, and obviously you need the money to fix the road so that it could be economically viable as an option for a function facility.

801
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You need the $4 million.

802
01:07:40,863 --> 01:07:48,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you took half of the CPA funds, you would only come up with between $2.5 and $3 million.

803
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:58,756
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't have the funds to rehab the building for the purpose that, you know, the committee has obviously presented to us in the past.

804
01:07:59,414 --> 01:08:01,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I find it concerning.

805
01:08:01,615 --> 01:08:09,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this building needs to be stabilized, but if we're going to spend the $200,000, I want to know that it's for a purpose.

806
01:08:09,621 --> 01:08:11,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't get that answer from the mayor.

807
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:23,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to use any of city monies to... And those are the questions that I think still are outstanding and need to be answered for my vote because

808
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:35,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I would want to stabilize the building, but I want to know the plan, not only for that, but for the fire stations, for the roads, for all the other complaints that we get and money that we need to spend money on.

809
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I think of the fire department taking the tour, and where they shower, there is like mold coming out of the bottom of the stalls.

810
01:08:43,506 --> 01:08:45,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody talks about that.

811
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:50,391
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not asked to put money towards fixing the bathrooms in the fire department.

812
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:53,574
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just so many different needs.

813
01:08:54,477 --> 01:09:00,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last time we got the capital plan was last January, February, two years ago, almost two years ago.

814
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And we sat with the mayor for an hour, we looked at the capital plan, and I think this was a component in the capital plan.

815
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't pass two years ago, and now it's before us again.

816
01:09:10,107 --> 01:09:23,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think after two years, we need to sit down with the mayor as soon as next week and discuss how we're gonna move forward with the Brooks Estate, and how we're gonna move forward in this city entirely.

817
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,243
[SPEAKER_07]: can't receive a paper.

818
01:09:26,383 --> 01:09:32,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week I did table it, because what the paper said was, please approve $200,000 for the Brooks Estates.

819
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:40,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, the Brooks Estates had somewhat of a breakdown, which was more than we sometimes get from the city administration.

820
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:50,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But for Paul Mokey to not even know it came before us last week, and not really, he's going to be, the building department is going to be involved in all of this.

821
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And for him to not even know, never mind be available to

822
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:55,300
[SPEAKER_07]: answer our questions in a committee of the whole meeting.

823
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that extremely concerning for the taxpayers in this community.

824
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:03,843
[SPEAKER_07]: If I voted for this tonight or last week, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions.

825
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:11,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be able to say necessarily what the plan was or what I was even necessarily fully voting on.

826
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:13,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's right.

827
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I again ask that we just sit with the mayor and discuss this.

828
01:10:17,228 --> 01:10:22,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You very well may have my vote next week if I sit with the mayor and just figure out her vision.

829
01:10:23,806 --> 01:10:29,667
[SPEAKER_07]: for a million to a million and a half to do a road, plus the rehab to completely redo the building.

830
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:39,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it hit the nail on the head last week when the new member of the board, who was very well-spoken, did mention that, why don't we take it down and rebuild it?

831
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:41,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one of the councilors said that a couple years ago.

832
01:10:41,849 --> 01:10:42,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It was me.

833
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:45,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Councilor Caraviello, you said that, why don't we rebuild it?

834
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It would cost us less money.

835
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, nobody wants it.

836
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to preserve it, but it's

837
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:55,993
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be realistic in a way where we have needs.

838
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,413
[SPEAKER_07]: People want a library.

839
01:10:57,693 --> 01:11:00,094
[SPEAKER_07]: People want new fire station.

840
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We're building a new police station for millions and millions of dollars.

841
01:11:03,394 --> 01:11:07,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We have needs and maintenance issues in our schools that need to be addressed.

842
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So where does this fit in?

843
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:12,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I'm concerned tonight.

844
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:14,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where I was concerned last week.

845
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:20,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget about personnel that we need to hire and to make our police and fire to the staffing levels that

846
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:34,909
[SPEAKER_07]: people, you know, the city wants, there's just so much that goes into this money papers and we never get a good enough, we usually always meet in the Committee of the Whole, we get our questions answered, we discuss it, we round table it.

847
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:40,392
[SPEAKER_07]: For this, you know, we obviously didn't meet in Committee of the Whole and I practically begged for it last week.

848
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:43,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need a meeting with the mayor on this one.

849
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:45,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council.

850
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:46,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

851
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

852
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:55,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community, and prioritizing these needs are vital.

853
01:11:55,795 --> 01:11:57,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we get elected.

854
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:11,583
[SPEAKER_11]: The redevelopment of the Carriage House and the creation of the Shepard Brooks Estates to be a full-fledged function hall was part of the chart the course plan that was presented by Mayor McGlynn.

855
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:16,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the last item that came before this council as part of the chart the course plan, and the council voted it down.

856
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:28,249
[SPEAKER_11]: After the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan.

857
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:35,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in.

858
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:42,195
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates.

859
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And they came before us and they asked for this money.

860
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:52,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up.

861
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had a committee of the whole on that.

862
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was all we had.

863
01:12:57,492 --> 01:13:00,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming.

864
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:10,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan.

865
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:20,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the carriage house is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area.

866
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:22,658
[SPEAKER_11]: The carriage house is the catalyst.

867
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:25,782
[SPEAKER_11]: The carriage house is also falling apart.

868
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:26,422
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a disgrace.

869
01:13:26,683 --> 01:13:29,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, any one of us could go up there and if we look at it, it's not a carriage house.

870
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,268
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a shell of a building that's falling apart.

871
01:13:32,497 --> 01:13:35,519
[SPEAKER_11]: But that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President.

872
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:42,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Week in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts.

873
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:48,786
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community.

874
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:50,407
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is by far the most beautiful.

875
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:54,429
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there.

876
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:59,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan,

877
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:03,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there.

878
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:05,997
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many options and many opportunities for us.

879
01:14:06,017 --> 01:14:11,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future.

880
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:11,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

881
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:16,521
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location.

882
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:27,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week.

883
01:14:28,445 --> 01:14:29,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly,

884
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:34,962
[SPEAKER_11]: the vital need that we have in Sheppard Brooks Estates if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President.

885
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:38,263
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.

886
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:40,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

887
01:14:40,463 --> 01:14:41,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Nay.

888
01:14:41,803 --> 01:14:44,364
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Falco.

889
01:14:44,904 --> 01:14:45,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

890
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to go on the record of supporting this.

891
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:56,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I take a look at the Brooks Estate and I take a look at the, uh, the money that, um, I mean, I look at it as,

892
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:59,456
[SPEAKER_08]: If we appropriate this money tonight, to me, to me, this is an investment.

893
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:01,298
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an investment in the Brooks estate.

894
01:15:01,838 --> 01:15:03,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an investment in our community.

895
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:07,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there are other cities and towns that would really love to have a property like this.

896
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:11,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, like council and I said, 50 acres of, uh, open space.

897
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:12,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great opportunity.

898
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:17,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I think that's something that we need to look at, but I think we need to, I think we need to embrace this.

899
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that this is a,

900
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,615
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a historical site.

901
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:25,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of opportunity here, the potential to actually bring in revenue.

902
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:28,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something that I do support as well.

903
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Palco.

905
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Move the question, Mr. President.

906
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:32,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

907
01:15:32,302 --> 01:15:33,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

908
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:34,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be redundant, but I will.

909
01:15:37,425 --> 01:15:44,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.

910
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:49,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we

911
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:51,339
[SPEAKER_09]: weren't looking at the bigger picture.

912
01:15:51,379 --> 01:16:07,628
[SPEAKER_09]: But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.

913
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:12,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.

914
01:16:12,771 --> 01:16:18,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,

915
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:39,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from

916
01:16:40,049 --> 01:16:46,551
[SPEAKER_09]: the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.

917
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:52,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.

918
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:58,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.

919
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:09,793
[SPEAKER_09]: to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.

920
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:10,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

921
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:12,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

922
01:17:13,235 --> 01:17:23,381
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Mox, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

923
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:26,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

924
01:17:27,163 --> 01:17:30,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to note my opposition because I believe

925
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions need to be answered, even if it just took a week.

926
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

927
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:37,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

938

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

939
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:49,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

01:17:51,151 --> 01:17:51,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

942
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:54,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

943
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

944
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tabled.

945
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:04,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

946
01:18:05,574 --> 01:18:06,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sorry to interrupt.

947
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll withdraw my remarks.

948
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:09,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

949
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:25,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have the meeting on December 26th, the city council meeting will be canceled so everybody knows.

950
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The

951
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:37,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a motion to, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, that we cancel the December 26th City Council meeting?

952
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:38,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved, Mr. President.

953
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:41,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Fowler, by Councilor Knight.

954
01:18:41,107 --> 01:18:41,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

955
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:41,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

956
01:18:42,327 --> 01:18:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

957
01:18:42,947 --> 01:18:44,448
