    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=30.689s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=31.974s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=33.936s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=48.608s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=53.004s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=54.144s">Before</a>  we begin, may I just make one brief indication here? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=59.005s">Due</a>  to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=80.27s">And</a>  so there is an additional <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=82.911s">A</a>  couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=90.692s">And</a>  their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=102.674s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Del Rosario.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=112.588s">If</a>  the messenger could make a few copies of this to maybe some people in the audience, it would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=121.03s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=126.531s">And</a>  that'll also be posted on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=127.991s">Did</a>  you want to make a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=133.172s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=135.292s">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[Ducey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=136.612s">Mary</a>  Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=138.453s">I</a>  spoke before the council last week <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=140.649s">about</a>  this issue, about the non-notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=144.03s">And</a>  because of the intercession of the council, we got the deadline <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=158.565s">pushed</a>  back to December 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=160.866s">However,</a>  I have one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=165.047s">You</a>  know, I mentioned last week that I knocked on 150 doors to inform people about the meeting that didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=172.449s">So</a>  now, those 150 people don't know about the extension of the deadline for the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=179.042s">So</a>  it is a long address and Councilor De La Ruza just read it off, but I was wondering if you people had any suggestions on how you could get that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=187.347s">It</a>  will be on the city website also.</p>

    <p>[Ducey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=189.648s">Yeah,</a>  but people need to know to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=192.93s">You</a>  see, we have to, people don't know that the deadline has been extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=198.012s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=199.193s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Longo-Kurin.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=201.534s">I</a>  think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=205.171s">to</a>  go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.</p>

    <p>[Ducey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=215.457s">Right,</a>  that might be, I was thinking of that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=217.538s">You</a>  could probably, on the government access channel where you post the street sweeping session, you could probably post a notice there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=224.783s">I</a>  think that would be a good idea if you could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=228.304s">And</a>  going forward, and a newspaper notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=231.645s">I</a>  don't know if the T or the city is planning on any kind of newspaper notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=236.886s">We'll</a>  have to see about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=238.467s">But</a>  going forward, I appreciate the efforts that the council made on behalf of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=244.248s">And</a>  I urge you all to please stay involved with this project because it's been a long drawn out thing and advocate for resident involvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=256.127s">The</a>  city, I think, down the road, needs to have a dedicated meeting for our butters and those directly affected in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the track, because there are a lot of new people who have moved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=269.837s">This</a>  project has been going on for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=272.339s">And</a>  those new people who have come in the neighborhood, some of them don't even know what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=277.483s">I</a>  think the city should try to get those abutters together and bring them up to date of what's going on, what the future is, what the city has planned, if there's economic development, where it is, who it's going to involve, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=292.991s">And</a>  my offer stands that I gave you people last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=296.733s">I'd</a>  be glad to lead a walking tour through the neighborhoods for both the council and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=302.059s">Because</a>  a picture is worth a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=304.1s">If</a>  you can see what it is we're talking about, you have a better appreciation of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=310.123s">So</a>  thank you for your time and thank you for your advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=313.125s">And</a>  you know, you may see me again if we have another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=316.987s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=318.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=319.488s">If</a>  I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=324.271s">There</a>  was about five people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=326.661s">advocating</a>  for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=331.625s">I</a>  think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=335.268s">So</a>  I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=350.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=351.84s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=355.946s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=357.087s">That</a>  the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=370.713s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=376.915s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=377.976s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=378.796s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=381.697s">17-778,</a>  offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=385.643s">that</a>  the MBTA install a bus shelter at the bus stop on South Porter Road at Roosevelt Circle Rotary in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=393.79s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=395.851s">Mr.</a>  President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scarpelli has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=403.578s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=407.401s">1779,</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli, being resolved the city administration reach out to the MBTA to inquire about placing a bus shelter at the bus stop <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=415.609s">located</a>  at Southwater Road in Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=419.397s">Vice</a>  President Mox, continue.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=421.259s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=422.64s">And</a>  I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=429.065s">If</a>  anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=439.733s">If</a>  you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=449.541s">And</a>  this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=473.337s">and</a>  or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=483.031s">And</a>  this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=488.635s">to</a>  protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=496.578s">And</a>  it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=505.16s">It</a>  also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=510.842s">And</a>  Rep Donato reached out to me just recently <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=514.023s">and</a>  said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=524.014s">And</a>  the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=530.433s">and</a>  said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=534.856s">And</a>  the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=542.061s">But</a>  what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=558.007s">and</a>  safety of commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=560.747s">And</a>  it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=567.069s">So</a>  hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=585.652s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=588.15s">This</a>  council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=608.103s">We</a>  may also have a resident here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=610.424s">I</a>  don't know if Barney's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=612.765s">She</a>  said she was going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=614.233s">And</a>  if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">Councilor</a>  Scott Billy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">You</a>  brought up the same points. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">I</a>  think that in today's, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">Studies</a>  have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">And</a>  when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">We're</a>  limiting them from using public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">So</a>  I second the resolve from Council Marks and <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">I'd</a>  like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">information</a>  back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">So</a>  I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">And</a>  when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">And</a>  to put a picnic bench out there, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">it's</a>  disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">So,</a>  um, I second the resolve from, uh, Councilor Marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">an</a>  answer back within two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=739.509s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=740.389s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=741.17s">I</a>  was also contacted by Bonnie as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=743.411s">And</a>  I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=746.073s">Um,</a>  this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=751.476s">And</a>  I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=759.461s">I,</a>  myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=763.683s">And,</a>  uh, I've been taking the, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=766.082s">for</a>  a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=780.054s">That</a>  can be a very dangerous stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=781.495s">It's</a>  right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.123s">it</a>  gets even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.843s">So</a>  I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=797.445s">So</a>  I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=802.627s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=803.808s">Council</a>  Member O'Karn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=804.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=805.648s">President</a>  Caraviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=810.611s">It</a>  is a concerning spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=812.371s">There</a>  is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=816.973s">I</a>  think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=821.363s">in</a>  the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=828.304s">The</a>  use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=841.847s">I</a>  think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=846.055s">at</a>  least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=849.797s">Hopefully</a>  the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=856.081s">I</a>  think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=858.843s">So</a>  I second the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=859.864s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Styer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=936.553s">Hi,</a>  my name is Bonnie Styer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=937.934s">I</a>  live at 35 Roosevelt Road, just a couple blocks away from this bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=942.897s">Thank</a>  you, council members, for your prompt and considerable response to my concern about this bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=950.042s">I</a>  do believe that it would be really helpful to have a bus shelter there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=955.766s">I</a>  think it would increase the ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=958.888s">I</a>  think this bus stop, well the bus, the 325 and the 100 bus are wonderful ways to get into Boston on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=968.553s">And</a>  I think that more riders would be encouraged to take it if there was a shelter there in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=974.796s">Again,</a>  like you mentioned earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=977.38s">It's</a>  very busy there and now that I'm leaving in the morning when it's, you know, the sun was rising at 6.50, being there in the dark is not a very great place to be with all those cars moving during the rush hour time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=991.272s">So</a>  I appreciate all of your assistance and I'd be more than willing to help out with getting signatures or petition should the MBT need something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1001.84s">So</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1012.711s">Just</a>  if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Medford, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1027.518s">And</a>  we all pay for it as riders. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1029.659s">We</a>  pay through the sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1032.74s">There's</a>  a percent that goes towards <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1034.717s">the</a>  operation of transit in this state. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1038.742s">And</a>  I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1047.093s">That</a>  money comes right off our cherry sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1049.376s">So</a>  it's money that goes right out of <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1051.498s">the</a>  city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1056.082s">And</a>  I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1069.213s">this</a>  shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1073.594s">In</a>  the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1082.937s">You</a>  know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scarpelli, that we get a quick response to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1095.08s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, based on the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1097.677s">We're</a>  one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1105.438s">I</a>  like John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1107.057s">take</a>  the bus every day also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1109.118s">But</a>  I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1116.361s">We're</a>  paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1128.567s">And</a>  I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1233.671s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1235.312s">I</a>  think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1241.035s">We've</a>  had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the energy environment director in Melrose, which I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1255.748s">personally,</a>  for me, helped answer a lot of my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1259.57s">And</a>  it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1263.672s">I</a>  think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1276.44s">And</a>  when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1284.591s">move</a>  forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1287.874s">But</a>  there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1311.392s">They</a>  want to make sure that that opt-out plan is <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1314.781s">well</a>  publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1320.906s">And</a>  one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1324.87s">What</a>  if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1342.421s">If</a>  you want to, you can do it now, just in case something is implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1347.224s">I</a>  know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1353.428s">I</a>  think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1359.011s">And</a>  we just need to be ready on all accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1361.552s">So</a>  I move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1363.073s">I</a>  think it's definitely something worth exploring. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1365.935s">It's</a>  simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1366.655s">It's</a>  just a database. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1368.336s">It</a>  could be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1372.066s">listed</a>  as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1394.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1396.144s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1397.298s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1398.459s">Thank</a>  you, my colleague, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1400.72s">I</a>  know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1418.095s">in</a>  discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1432.146s">And</a>  when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1440.083s">The</a>  plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1455.113s">So</a>  one other thing that I want to point out, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1458.976s">question</a>  that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1469.678s">And</a>  with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1483.521s">asked</a>  me about and how would we find out who would pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1487.004s">Well,</a>  it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1498.731s">So</a>  my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1508.356s">I</a>  think it's something that every <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1513.208s">constituent</a>  can use in bringing their electricity bill down. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1517.391s">I</a>  mean, not dramatically, but it does help. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1520.693s">And</a>  again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1526.477s">And</a>  I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1533.982s">When</a>  that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1546.805s">Because</a>  again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1551.206s">Well,</a>  with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1558.687s">So</a>  that in turn goes back out to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1563.441s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1569.525s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott-Bailey.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1570.726s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1571.727s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1573.948s">When</a>  it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1578.671s">And</a>  quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1585.596s">And</a>  again, I think the time to move forward on it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1589.238s">Ultimately,</a>  the question is, do we want <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1591.209s">to</a>  request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1597.394s">We're</a>  asking a department head to say, start creating a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1600.057s">We</a>  may or may not adopt municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1603.66s">And</a>  I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1605.522s">If</a>  we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1608.284s">Let's</a>  take the vote and let's allow it to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1611.647s">But</a>  to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1618.003s">the</a>  Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1622.204s">So</a>  she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1628.226s">So</a>  I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1631.547s">Mr.</a>  President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1634.428s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1636.249s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1637.229s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1640.33s">As</a>  many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1645.051s">I</a>  think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1648.021s">a</a>  good plan, I think it's a good program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1650.722s">And</a>  I, I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department in Melrose just to get a different perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1663.107s">And</a>  I think, I thought that was a very good presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1664.948s">She</a>  did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1670.71s">And</a>  she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1674.589s">But</a>  I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1677.573s">I</a>  think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1682.318s">You</a>  know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1686.342s">I</a>  mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1689.826s">So,</a>  you know, I think, you know, it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1692.742s">This</a>  has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1696.563s">We've</a>  had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down, and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1705.207s">And</a>  I know, I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in Committee of the Wholes, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1712.489s">But</a>  I think that, in my opinion, I really don't, I think a lot of our <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1720.322s">departments</a>  to stretch with regard to resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1722.482s">And</a>  I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1730.804s">So,</a>  um, I, I, uh, agree with my colleague, uh, councilor Knight on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1735.665s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1736.885s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1737.946s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1739.186s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1741.306s">Um,</a>  every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1750.017s">It's</a>  quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1754.539s">Their</a>  agenda is to get METFIT into municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1758.701s">And</a>  so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1767.124s">And</a>  maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1777.428s">And</a>  a lot of people are concerned about that in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1780.404s">A</a>  lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1786.87s">So</a>  the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1796.238s">Now</a>  obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1804.626s">They</a>  have something to gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1806.46s">Obviously,</a>  always someone has something to gain, and there's nothing wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1812.323s">I</a>  think this is a stretch in some areas, and I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1824.629s">What</a>  does this do to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1826.229s">Does</a>  this target them in some way? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1827.81s">Who</a>  has an access to this list? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1829.878s">Are</a>  they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1834.281s">Um,</a>  these are questions, uh, serious questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1839.225s">These</a>  are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President, that they need a voice as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1845.069s">I'm</a>  going to give them that voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1847.09s">And</a>  so I do not support this motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1850.192s">I</a>  think we need to have further discussion on municipal, uh, aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1854.275s">And</a>  I think we need to have a credible, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1857.338s">bona</a>  fide expert on this matter who is going to give the argument contra. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1864.46s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1869.401s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1872.101s">I</a>  understand the sentiments of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1875.402s">I</a>  just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1879.063s">I</a>  don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1885.086s">call</a>  or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1888.827s">I</a>  actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1895.33s">I</a>  think it's simple, take minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1897.771s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Dello Russo, there is an agenda for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1913.61s">option</a>  to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they can opt out whenever, they're going to be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1923.816s">And</a>  that's what people are concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1925.597s">So</a>  that's why you would implement something like this far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out, and they would get what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1940.425s">The</a>  people that don't want to be involved <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1942.193s">would</a>  be able to do that sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1944.514s">And</a>  when the council does meet in committee of the whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1949.897s">And</a>  I think we're definitely close to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1951.818s">And</a>  I know people have definitely changed their minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1954.9s">And</a>  they've learned a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1956.381s">There</a>  are some people that maybe are still against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1958.462s">But</a>  for me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better knowing that they have more than that 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1965.286s">Because</a>  that's the complaints I've been getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1968.048s">And</a>  I thought this was just a way <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1971.806s">sway</a>  another vote towards approving it and ease in people's fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1976.411s">I'll</a>  say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1977.412s">So</a>  I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1979.234s">I'd</a>  like to see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1981.937s">And</a>  of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.</p>

day one, Mr. President is, uh, the energy and environment committee where this was sent at one point in this process, um, had a public hearing on it and we asked the city solicitor to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2025.499s">And</a>  one of the questions, and it was actually my question was whether or not we can file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which, uh, is everyone is opted into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2040.106s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2041.969s">automatically</a>  and change it so you can opt into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2049.54s">And</a>  according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2056.856s">at</a>  the statehouse and they believe that we could file a home loan petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2061.641s">And</a>  that is my number one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2064.564s">In</a>  my opinion, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company, not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2076.056s">I</a>  don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2080.139s">I</a>  realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2085.984s">I</a>  realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit to by aggregating everyone together. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2092.289s">And</a>  so I realize what the intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2096.313s">But</a>  I, as one member of the council, don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2103.879s">And</a>  if this is such a great program, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2106.121s">It's</a>  going to be overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2107.182s">People</a>  will be knocking on the door here at City Hall to get involved and say, I want to opt into that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2113.866s">Let</a>  the program work. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2115.707s">Let</a>  the program work. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2116.968s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2119.005s">Mr.</a>  President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2130.368s">Maybe</a>  it wasn't a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2131.648s">Maybe</a>  it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2141.95s">That's</a>  why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2145.572s">I</a>  don't believe that should be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2147.473s">I</a>  believe we should give residents of this community an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2151.115s">If</a>  they want to opt into the program, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2154.136s">You</a>  can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2161.6s">There's</a>  also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2171.722s">And</a>  you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2184.573s">Now</a>  that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2188.336s">And</a>  you can opt out of that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2190.737s">But</a>  now you say you can opt out of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2192.839s">And</a>  if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2199.244s">That's</a>  be up front with the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2200.865s">Let</a>  them choose whether they want to partake in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2204.628s">And</a>  I could support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2206.25s">So</a>  I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2213.535s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2215.537s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2222.602s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2223.502s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2228.245s">Good</a>  evening, honorable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2231.206s">I'm</a>  not against the energy, especially clean energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2235.548s">And</a>  if I may get a little bit off track, supposedly this country sent man to the moon a dozen times and brought him back safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2241.751s">If</a>  that's true, there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2246.374s">There's</a>  only a good reason, I'm sure, and that's capitalism from down deep in Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2252.383s">And</a>  also, I believe Tesla, the famous inventor from Yugoslavia, was creating a power grid over 80 years ago, backed by J.P. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2262.151s">Morgan,</a>  I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2264.072s">And</a>  once J.P. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2264.973s">Morgan</a>  found out that Tesla wanted to give free energy from power plant to power plant without wires, mind you, he pulled the plug. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2273.219s">So,</a>  so much for capitalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2277.142s">This</a>  community aggregation, I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2281.48s">I</a>  don't know what's in it for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2283.982s">I</a>  don't know why they would force undemocratically to pull all, I'm estimating, 40,000 National Grid electric ratepayers into the pool and making them opt out if they want to get out, which means they have to be proactive or, as I would say, reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2306.394s">And</a>  very well could be, instead of me paying $0.10 for the delivery charge on my electric bill, it could come in at $0.16. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2313.436s">I'm</a>  hearing different numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2315.016s">That</a>  would be a 60% increase in my electric bill on the delivery charge only. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2321.178s">So</a>  if I'm using an average of 400 kilowatts times $0.06 extra, that would be approximately $25, $26 extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2333.314s">And</a>  so a lot of people may be having a hard time paying the electric bills as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2340.098s">So</a>  I just hope this community aggregation does not become community aggravation.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2376.124s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn was in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2379.026s">And</a>  George, and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2383.95s">17781</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the administration look into replacing <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2388.666s">with</a>  the help of Eversource, all lead pipes and outdated pipes that need an upgrade while the streets will be open during the construction period if the Eversource project is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2399.712s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2401.493s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2403.754s">We</a>  had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2415.928s">Doug</a>  Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2429.054s">Now,</a>  I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2441.34s">I</a>  just wanna make sure that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2445.191s">really</a>  is on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2446.272s">I</a>  know Cassandra is going to be on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2448.112s">She</a>  seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2456.056s">So</a>  I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2468.226s">We</a>  look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2473.169s">So</a>  we think about this before our streets are even open. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2476.311s">And</a>  I don't know if the administration has already thought about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2479.172s">Obviously,</a>  I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2483.274s">But</a>  no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2487.257s">And</a>  I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2493.786s">couple</a>  miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2498.429s">I</a>  think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2506.654s">And</a>  when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2510.596s">So</a>  whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2521.323s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2522.174s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2527.556s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2528.296s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2529.017s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2530.877s">Reports</a>  of committee 17766, committee of the whole meeting from November 14th, 2017 regarding Enstar Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2543.402s">And</a>  I have the report here which I will read. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2548.646s">The</a>  purpose of the meeting was to receive a presentation from Eversource on their request for grants of location on the transmission project from moving through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2557.129s">The</a>  following recommendations were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2559.329s">That</a>  one, a traffic plan be submitted to the council and the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2563.751s">Two,</a>  construction schedule with start dates, days of weeks, and times be submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2569.873s">Three,</a>  that Eversource set up an informational meeting at the high school to include <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2576.325s">the</a>  winter street residents in a budding neighborhoods for that a contact name for the project with a telephone number and email be posted to the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2587.752s">Five</a>  that plans be provided by ever source on route on the route from question street to the city line that were included seven <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2597.921s">Eversource</a>  develop a regional communication plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2601.104s">That</a>  plan would entail them developing a strategy of contacting TV and radio station, notifying non-Method residents about the project, and to notify them of alternate routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2613.734s">A</a>  motion was made by council tonight to send this report out.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2621.34s">Let</a>  me answer.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2624.229s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2626.032s">Was</a>  there a number six on that?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2628.996s">There</a>  was another missing somewhere along the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2632.08s">I</a>  think there was only supposed to be seven and it ended up being eight.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2636.291s">No,</a>  I, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2637.752s">I</a>  thought a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2638.372s">Yeah,</a>  no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken, as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2654.821s">And</a>  we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2658.803s">And</a>  I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2661.324s">We</a>  can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth, but it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookups.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2674.33s">Was</a>  that the meeting from last week or the week before?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2677.292s">Last</a>  week.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2678.112s">It</a>  was last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2678.792s">This</a>  is from two weeks ago.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2684.349s">Okay,</a>  so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2689.132s">Okay,</a>  so those questions will come out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2691.753s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2693.094s">Well,</a>  our questions still go somewhere, right?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2696.876s">When</a>  we ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2709.005s">I</a>  mean, Eversource was before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2710.626s">We</a>  asked Eversource to produce some information.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2712.986s">Are</a>  you saying that information doesn't go anywhere?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2720.489s">Next</a>  week, when we meet next week with them again, we'll bring it up to them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2723.33s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2724.07s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2732.927s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2733.848s">So</a>  this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2743.814s">And</a>  that this isn't related to that meeting then. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2745.555s">Because</a>  one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2751.118s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2751.919s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2752.279s">So</a>  this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.461s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.561s">Sounds</a>  good to me.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2762.332s">But</a>  we may not get that information before next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2766.474s">This</a>  issue is coming up again, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2767.894s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2768.875s">So</a>  we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2775.997s">That's</a>  an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2782.12s">That's</a>  why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2789.943s">I</a>  believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2799.985s">Yeah,</a>  we only got halfway through right halfway through.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2802.426s">I</a>  think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2809.687s">Maybe</a>  the city engineer can give us some information.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2812.008s">All</a>  right <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2813.229s">OK,</a>  Mr. Clerk, if you could have this letter sent up to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2817.355s">Maybe</a>  she can help us out before the next week's meeting with that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2820.42s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2826.729s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could take care of that, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2829.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2833.66s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2835.101s">I</a>  believe I still have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.263s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.764s">I</a>  believe I still have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2838.845s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2840.186s">So</a>  we negotiated a memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2841.888s">And</a>  as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2853.876s">the</a>  stretch that it's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2855.477s">And</a>  the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2861.842s">And</a>  what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2866.385s">If</a>  we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2875.992s">And</a>  then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2882.063s">And</a>  if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2886.088s">So</a>  that's a concern that we have as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2887.55s">So</a>  I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.</p>
