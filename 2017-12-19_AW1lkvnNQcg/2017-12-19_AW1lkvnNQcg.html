    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=30.689s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=31.974s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=33.936s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=48.608s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=53.004s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=54.144s">Before</a>  we begin, may I just make one brief indication here? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=59.005s">Due</a>  to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=80.27s">And</a>  so there is an additional <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=82.911s">A</a>  couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=90.692s">And</a>  their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=102.674s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Del Rosario.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=112.588s">If</a>  the messenger could make a few copies of this to maybe some people in the audience, it would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=121.03s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=126.531s">And</a>  that'll also be posted on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=127.991s">Did</a>  you want to make a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=133.172s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=135.292s">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=136.612s">Mary</a>  Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=138.453s">I</a>  spoke before the council last week <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=140.649s">about</a>  this issue, about the non-notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=144.03s">And</a>  because of the intercession of the council, we got the deadline <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=158.565s">pushed</a>  back to December 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=160.866s">However,</a>  I have one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=165.047s">You</a>  know, I mentioned last week that I knocked on 150 doors to inform people about the meeting that didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=172.449s">So</a>  now, those 150 people don't know about the extension of the deadline for the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=179.042s">So</a>  it is a long address and Councilor De La Ruza just read it off, but I was wondering if you people had any suggestions on how you could get that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=187.347s">It</a>  will be on the city website also.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=189.648s">Yeah,</a>  but people need to know to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=192.93s">You</a>  see, we have to, people don't know that the deadline has been extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=198.012s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=199.193s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Longo-Kurin.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=201.534s">I</a>  think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=205.171s">to</a>  go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=215.457s">Right,</a>  that might be, I was thinking of that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=217.538s">You</a>  could probably, on the government access channel where you post the street sweeping session, you could probably post a notice there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=224.783s">I</a>  think that would be a good idea if you could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=228.304s">And</a>  going forward, and a newspaper notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=231.645s">I</a>  don't know if the T or the city is planning on any kind of newspaper notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=236.886s">We'll</a>  have to see about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=238.467s">But</a>  going forward, I appreciate the efforts that the council made on behalf of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=244.248s">And</a>  I urge you all to please stay involved with this project because it's been a long drawn out thing and advocate for resident involvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=256.127s">The</a>  city, I think, down the road, needs to have a dedicated meeting for our butters and those directly affected in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the track, because there are a lot of new people who have moved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=269.837s">This</a>  project has been going on for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=272.339s">And</a>  those new people who have come in the neighborhood, some of them don't even know what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=277.483s">I</a>  think the city should try to get those abutters together and bring them up to date of what's going on, what the future is, what the city has planned, if there's economic development, where it is, who it's going to involve, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=292.991s">And</a>  my offer stands that I gave you people last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=296.733s">I'd</a>  be glad to lead a walking tour through the neighborhoods for both the council and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=302.059s">Because</a>  a picture is worth a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=304.1s">If</a>  you can see what it is we're talking about, you have a better appreciation of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=310.123s">So</a>  thank you for your time and thank you for your advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=313.125s">And</a>  you know, you may see me again if we have another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=316.987s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=318.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=319.488s">If</a>  I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=324.271s">There</a>  was about five people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=326.661s">advocating</a>  for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=331.625s">I</a>  think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=335.268s">So</a>  I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=350.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=351.84s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=355.946s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=357.087s">That</a>  the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=370.713s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=376.915s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=377.976s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=378.796s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=381.697s">17-778,</a>  offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=385.643s">that</a>  the MBTA install a bus shelter at the bus stop on South Porter Road at Roosevelt Circle Rotary in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=393.79s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=395.851s">Mr.</a>  President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scarpelli has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=403.578s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=407.401s">1779,</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli, being resolved the city administration reach out to the MBTA to inquire about placing a bus shelter at the bus stop <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=415.609s">located</a>  at Southwater Road in Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=419.397s">Vice</a>  President Mox, continue.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=421.259s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=422.64s">And</a>  I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=429.065s">If</a>  anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=439.733s">If</a>  you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=449.541s">And</a>  this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=473.337s">and</a>  or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=483.031s">And</a>  this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=488.635s">to</a>  protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=496.578s">And</a>  it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=505.16s">It</a>  also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=510.842s">And</a>  Rep Donato reached out to me just recently <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=514.023s">and</a>  said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=524.014s">And</a>  the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=530.433s">and</a>  said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=534.856s">And</a>  the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=542.061s">But</a>  what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=558.007s">and</a>  safety of commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=560.747s">And</a>  it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=567.069s">So</a>  hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=585.652s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=588.15s">This</a>  council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=608.103s">We</a>  may also have a resident here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=610.424s">I</a>  don't know if Barney's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=612.765s">She</a>  said she was going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=614.233s">And</a>  if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">Councilor</a>  Scott Billy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">You</a>  brought up the same points. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">I</a>  think that in today's, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">Studies</a>  have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">And</a>  when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">We're</a>  limiting them from using public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">So</a>  I second the resolve from Council Marks and <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">I'd</a>  like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">information</a>  back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">So</a>  I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">And</a>  when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">And</a>  to put a picnic bench out there, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">it's</a>  disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">So,</a>  um, I second the resolve from, uh, Councilor Marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">an</a>  answer back within two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=739.509s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=740.389s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=741.17s">I</a>  was also contacted by Bonnie as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=743.411s">And</a>  I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=746.073s">Um,</a>  this is a very important issue and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=751.476s">And</a>  I think that this, um, doing this, I think does encourage people to, um, to, to, uh, look at, uh, taking the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=759.461s">I,</a>  myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=763.683s">And,</a>  uh, I've been taking the, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=766.082s">for</a>  a long time, and I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop, and I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location, and it is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=780.054s">That</a>  can be a very dangerous stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=781.495s">It's</a>  right at the rotary and an off ramp, and especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day, but I think on a bad day, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.123s">it</a>  gets even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=793.843s">So</a>  I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=797.445s">So</a>  I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=802.627s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=803.808s">Council</a>  Member O'Karn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=804.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=805.648s">President</a>  Caraviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=810.611s">It</a>  is a concerning spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=812.371s">There</a>  is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=816.973s">I</a>  think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=821.363s">in</a>  the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=828.304s">The</a>  use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=841.847s">I</a>  think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=846.055s">at</a>  least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=849.797s">Hopefully</a>  the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=856.081s">I</a>  think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=858.843s">So</a>  I second the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=859.864s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=861.345s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=862.325s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=863.606s">I</a>  think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=868.849s">And</a>  the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=872.601s">And</a>  Councilman Scarpelli made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=876.124s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=879.747s">And</a>  I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=888.792s">some</a>  impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=892.195s">We</a>  have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=895.158s">We</a>  have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=900.623s">And</a>  it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=905.487s">So</a>  I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=916.715s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=918.096s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=924.78s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=925.581s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=929.724s">Do</a>  we have someone that wants to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=931.685s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=934.067s">I</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=935.047s">I</a>  couldn't see the process.</p>

    <p>[Styer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=936.553s">Hi,</a>  my name is Bonnie Styer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=937.934s">I</a>  live at 35 Roosevelt Road, just a couple blocks away from this bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=942.897s">Thank</a>  you, council members, for your prompt and considerable response to my concern about this bus shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=950.042s">I</a>  do believe that it would be really helpful to have a bus shelter there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=955.766s">I</a>  think it would increase the ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=958.888s">I</a>  think this bus stop, well the bus, the 325 and the 100 bus are wonderful ways to get into Boston on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=968.553s">And</a>  I think that more riders would be encouraged to take it if there was a shelter there in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=974.796s">Again,</a>  like you mentioned earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=977.38s">It's</a>  very busy there and now that I'm leaving in the morning when it's, you know, the sun was rising at 6.50, being there in the dark is not a very great place to be with all those cars moving during the rush hour time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=991.272s">So</a>  I appreciate all of your assistance and I'd be more than willing to help out with getting signatures or petition should the MBT need something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1001.84s">So</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1003.502s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1005.448s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scarpellicott. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1011.151s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1012.711s">Just</a>  if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Medford, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1027.518s">And</a>  we all pay for it as riders. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1029.659s">We</a>  pay through the sales tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1032.74s">There's</a>  a percent that goes towards <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1034.717s">the</a>  operation of transit in this state. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1038.742s">And</a>  I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1047.093s">That</a>  money comes right off our cherry sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1049.376s">So</a>  it's money that goes right out of <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1051.498s">the</a>  city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1056.082s">And</a>  I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1069.213s">this</a>  shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1073.594s">In</a>  the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1082.937s">You</a>  know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scarpelli, that we get a quick response to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1095.08s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, based on the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1097.677s">We're</a>  one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1105.438s">I</a>  like John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1107.057s">take</a>  the bus every day also. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1109.118s">But</a>  I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1116.361s">We're</a>  paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1128.567s">And</a>  I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.</p>
