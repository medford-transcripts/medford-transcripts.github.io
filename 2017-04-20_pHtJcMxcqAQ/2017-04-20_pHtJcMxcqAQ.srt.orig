[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take the paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

21
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:55,465
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

22
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:56,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

23
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:57,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

24
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

25
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:05,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I move to take paper 1771, the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance, from the table.

26
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:08,012
[SPEAKER_19]: It is eligible this evening for its third reading.

27
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:12,355
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a paper that has gone through the subcommittee process and through the committee of the whole process.

28
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:20,900
[SPEAKER_19]: And what it is, Mr. President, is it's a proposal to ensure that people that are bidding on public contracts here in the city of Medford comply with the wage and hour laws.

29
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,702
[SPEAKER_19]: It requires that a series of certifications are made

30
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:34,690
[SPEAKER_19]: and a series of statements of credibility I made to the administration so that when they're awarding a contract, the individuals that are awarded the contract have not been found in violation of any wage and hour laws.

31
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Wage theft is a problem across the country, Mr. President.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,471
[SPEAKER_19]: It's something that we see here in Massachusetts a lot of times with contracts like cleaning contracts.

33
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:48,252
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, the high school has a cleaning contract, and they may bring people in to clean the high school.

34
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,013
[SPEAKER_19]: And the prevailing wage rate, which they are supposed to be paid by law, is $26 an hour.

35
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:58,114
[SPEAKER_19]: But these employees are hourly workers that make $18 an hour when not working on the prevailing wage.

36
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,415
[SPEAKER_19]: And their employer will withhold those funds, Mr. President.

37
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:03,216
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're actually employers that are stealing money from their employees.

38
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:13,421
[SPEAKER_19]: So this ordinance requires that people that are bidding on public projects that are covered under the prevailing wage laws and other state and federal hour and wage laws, Mr. President, are in compliance.

39
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,002
[SPEAKER_19]: They inform the city whether or not they've been found in violation.

40
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,624
[SPEAKER_19]: And they take out certain bonds if they have been found in violation.

41
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:26,444
[SPEAKER_19]: With us here this evening, we have some individuals that were instrumental in putting this work, this ordinance together, Mr. President.

42
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:30,449
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a paper that was originated through a group called Community Labor United.

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,734
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been a matter that's been endorsed and supported by the Greater Boston Labor Council.

44
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:38,398
[SPEAKER_19]: And here this evening with us from the Greater Boston Labor Council, we have Rich Rogers.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,761
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have representing Sean O'Brien from Local 25, James Donovan, political director.

46
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,882
[SPEAKER_19]: We have from Local 537, Bill Young here with us this evening.

47
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:57,544
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be remiss not to mention Louie Mandarini from Local 22, a long-time Medford resident, Mr. President, who was instrumental in crafting this language and also helped with some technical assistance.

48
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,865
[SPEAKER_19]: And also with us we have Phil Reason from the Painters Union here.

49
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:06,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, this is a paper that Mayor Burke and I worked on in concert with the individuals that have been forementioned.

50
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,471
[SPEAKER_19]: It's something that I wholeheartedly support and I'd ask my colleagues this evening to vote in favor of it.

51
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:13,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

52
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:15,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor DelaRusso?

53
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:16,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

54
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:26,096
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

55
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRusso?

00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:31,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

64
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:38,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

65
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:39,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

66
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:40,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

67
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:42,304
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caviello.

68
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:43,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

69
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:46,625
[SPEAKER_13]: 17 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

70
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:48,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

71
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,606
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're under suspension.

72
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:49,606
17, 3, 7, 2.

73
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:49,606
17, 3, 7, 0.

74
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:49,606
17, 3, 7, 2.

75
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:49,606
17, 3, 7, 2.

76
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:15,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Petition for sign denial reversal by Jason Perillo of BAC may sign for George's Bakery, 25 Hall Street, Medford.

77
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:19,186
[SPEAKER_13]: OCD application 2017-3 exceeds allowable size 94-307-2.

78
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:23,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks is chairman of the sign committee.

79
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, we have the petition in front of us.

80
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:39,446
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can just give us a brief synopsis on the sign itself.

81
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:42,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

82
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Jason Perillo with Back Bay sign company.

83
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:55,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, our petition to hear tonight is to ask petition to ask for permission to install a wall sign for George's bakery products incorporated over at 25 hall street.

84
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:02,444
[SPEAKER_08]: The sign that we propose this evening is 35 square feet over what the ordinance allows.

85
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,845
[SPEAKER_08]: The building is 111 feet wide.

86
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the sign is designed to fit the architecture of the building.

87
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the sign is not illuminated.

88
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,008
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no residences that can see the sign.

89
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:19,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, if you, uh, George is also here this evening, if you have any questions for the business owner.

90
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

91
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

92
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:25,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I see no reason to object to this request for a variance.

94
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:38,644
[SPEAKER_16]: This gentleman brings business and good commerce to the city of Medford.

95
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:45,886
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a decent family business, and we wish them all the best.

96
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have no objection.

97
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:48,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

98
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:49,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

99
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:50,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Neistat.

100
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:55,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, George's Bakery has been in this community for a very long time without incident, without

101
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:56,085
[SPEAKER_19]: issue.

102
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I get some bread from there every once in a while.

103
00:05:58,306 --> 00:05:58,886
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to lie.

104
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:07,509
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, I certainly think that, uh, this proposal that's before us this evening is within reason and, um, meets the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance, uh, relative to signage.

105
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,091
[SPEAKER_19]: And I too move for approval with a second to councilor Della Russo's motion.

106
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:13,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

107
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:13,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice-president Moxley.

108
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:15,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you motion for motion for approval?

109
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:22,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, based on the paperwork submitted, uh, and the, uh,

111
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:40,190
[SPEAKER_11]: rendering of the sign itself and the location of the sign, I, too, see no concern with the size of the sign, even though it's nonconforming to existing zoning sign ordinances.

112
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this point, Mr. President, it's not internally illuminated.

113
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:50,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this point, I would move approval, Mr. President.

114
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,896
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by vice president marks, seconded by counselor night.

115
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:56,977
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

116
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I have, I have, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, council marks is the sign a committee chairman.

118
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:03,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

119
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion comes from the sign chairman.

120
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:06,681
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

121
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,722
[SPEAKER_13]: And seconded by councilor Donald Russo.

122
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:10,623
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

123
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:12,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

124
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:14,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

125
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:15,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

126
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,065
[SPEAKER_13]: So George, good luck.

127
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:20,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, if we could also take, um,

128
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:32,459
[SPEAKER_13]: 17352, the nominees while they're here, that were appointed last week that are coming here to be vetted this evening.

129
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scott, would you second that motion?

130
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I second that motion.

131
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:39,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

132
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:50,929
[SPEAKER_13]: This evening, we have some people that were selected to be on the Community Preservation Committee, and under the rule of transparency,

133
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:55,579
[SPEAKER_13]: We feel that it's good to vet all these candidates.

134
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:05,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So at this point, while they're here, when we ask your name, if you could please come to the podium and give us a little brief resume.

135
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:07,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Jones here?

136
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:07,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Jones here?

137
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

138
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North, Medford.

139
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:23,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent an application in to the mayor for a seat on the Community Preservation Commission.

140
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:33,309
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I'm a resident of Medford, 17 years, was part of the Preserve Medford campaign committee a couple years ago to collect signatures to get the CPA on the ballot.

141
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it did pass, I was a member of the ad hoc committee.

142
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:42,052
[SPEAKER_00]: that was assembled to draft the ordinance and to usher it to completion to the City Council.

143
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:55,665
[SPEAKER_00]: In the application, it stated, you know, that an applicant should be a resident who has expertise or demonstrated interest in open space, recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing, among other things.

144
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I sort of applied for because

145
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,194
[SPEAKER_00]: improving these things in the city of Medford is very important to me.

146
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:07,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that these are the things that are usually on the bottom of the list when it comes to budget time.

147
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:13,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, police, fire, safety, those kinds of things are much more important and usually get the dollars, and these ones don't.

148
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:15,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the reasons why

149
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:22,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I really felt that we could bring some good dollars to Medford, that we could improve the city and bring money into Medford by improving the city.

150
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:32,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So my certification as a project manager, one of the things that I do is I help the others that are in the room kind of use their expertise and bring it to fruition.

151
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:38,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the one who sort of helps people remove roadblocks, bring people together, open communication, that kind of thing.

152
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:43,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the expertise that I could bring to this committee to kind of help the process move along and keep in time.

153
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:52,063
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I applied, and I would appreciate your support, and I really do hope to help Medford become a more inviting city.

154
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Sharon.

155
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:55,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

156
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I move to approval for Joan Cyr.

157
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:13,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Joan's done so many great things in our community, and her dedication and commitment and her leadership is going to drastically be needed with such a huge endeavor, so I move forward to accept Joan Cyr.

158
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,139
[SPEAKER_09]: as one of our members.

159
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:15,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

160
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:17,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

162
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to second Councilor Scott Pelley.

163
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:27,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked with Joan on the CPC committee when we put together the resolution.

164
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: She was vital to the process.

165
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:30,826
[SPEAKER_03]: She's smart.

166
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:31,427
[SPEAKER_03]: She's committed.

167
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know she'll do a great job.

168
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:39,251
[SPEAKER_03]: This commission is going to be working very hard, especially in its infancy.

169
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I definitely support

170
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:46,886
[SPEAKER_03]: being an appointee to this commission, and I just want to say good luck.

171
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:47,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

172
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:47,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

173
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:48,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Knight.

174
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Mr. President, if you review Ms.

175
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:58,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Cyr's resume in contrast with the ordinance and the requirements that are set forth in the ordinance relative to what would make an appropriate appointee, you'll see that Ms.

176
00:10:58,953 --> 00:10:59,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Cyr hits all the high spots.

177
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:07,337
[SPEAKER_19]: I, too, had the opportunity to work with her on the Community Preservation Commission subcommittee that helped draft the ordinance.

178
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:10,668
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wanted to thank her for her technical expertise and her input and involvement.

179
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:12,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, this is a great appointment.

180
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,550
[SPEAKER_19]: It's someone that I'd wholeheartedly support.

181
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,272
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like to thank you for the opportunity for having us come up here this evening and vet this.

182
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:18,472
[SPEAKER_19]: I move approval as well.

183
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:18,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

184
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:20,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

185
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,614
[SPEAKER_16]: President, I was prepared to approve this last week.

186
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm prepared again tonight.

187
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the delight of appointing her.

188
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:28,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

189
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Community Preservation Commission.

190
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:31,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

191
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,359
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Longo Kern.

192
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,460
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you briefly.

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,361
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to thank Joan and all the other members that are

194
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:41,193
[SPEAKER_30]: have been appointed and coming to let us vet them tonight.

195
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:46,795
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to thank them for being here and thank them for wanting to be on such a committee that's going to take a lot of time and effort.

196
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:49,937
[SPEAKER_30]: Joan is definitely going to do a great job.

197
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,357
[SPEAKER_30]: So I wish you the best of luck.

198
00:11:51,497 --> 00:12:03,122
[SPEAKER_30]: I would ask that all the members, obviously, we'd love to be able to get the minutes of the meetings, whether it's email or hard copy of the minutes of the meetings, and to keep us informed so we know how the process is going.

199
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:03,742
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

200
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:04,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

201
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:05,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Mox.

202
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

203
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:16,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy that the council last week voted to invite all the appointments to this council.

204
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:21,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we all realize that this is a good group of candidates.

205
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:32,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was nice to hear, Joan, that you appreciate the responsibilities of this particular appointment and also know that it does impact open space within our community.

206
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,671
[SPEAKER_11]: historic preservation, housing, and a number of really important issues.

207
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:43,473
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe it's roughly a million dollars a year that'll be generated through the CPA.

208
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:47,914
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is an important task, and I know you as one person will take this very seriously.

209
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:53,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues and move approval.

210
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:53,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

211
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:54,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Outstanding choice.

212
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,337
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

213
00:12:59,017 --> 00:12:59,817
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

214
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

215
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

216
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:03,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Joan.

217
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:03,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

218
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

219
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

220
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

221
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:18,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Roberta Cameron said she's gonna be a little late, so we'll get her when she comes in.

222
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Elizabeth Cary Soul, are you here?

223
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:20,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

224
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

225
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,059
[SPEAKER_28]: My name's Elizabeth Cary Soul, and my address is 50 Douglas Road.

226
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,850
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm a relatively new resident of Medford.

227
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:44,195
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been here for just under two years and I'm extremely excited about living here and really excited about the prospect that CPA funds could bring to Medford.

228
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,076
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a landscape architect.

229
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:49,618
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been working as a landscape architect for about seven years.

230
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,541
[SPEAKER_28]: I currently work for the Trustees of Reservations as a project manager.

231
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:57,523
[SPEAKER_28]: I manage their capital projects along

232
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:07,295
[SPEAKER_28]: structures and landscapes or restorations of historic landscapes and new buildings on our properties and specifically on our historically significant properties.

233
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:21,999
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think I bring a lot of project management experience, a lot of appreciation for landscape and open spaces, appreciation for historic restoration, and I'm extremely excited about the prospect of being involved in this committee.

234
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

235
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

236
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, once again, if you take a look at Ms.

237
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:34,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Sewell's resume and contrast that with the ordinance and the criteria that's put forth therein, you'll see that she meets all the major requirements that have been put forth.

238
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:44,690
[SPEAKER_19]: It appears to me, although I don't know the woman personally, that she's been a qualified and dedicated professional in her field of expertise, and she's someone that I will have no problem supporting this evening.

239
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,350
[SPEAKER_19]: I move for approval.

240
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

241
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,632
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern, Councilor Marks.

242
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

243
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,853
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to see Elizabeth and I welcome you to the community.

244
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:57,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

245
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:57,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Two years.

246
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:58,474
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a rookie.

247
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,015
[SPEAKER_11]: So welcome to the community.

248
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for partaking on a very important committee.

249
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:11,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just wondering if you had any feedback relative to the lack of funding

250
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:23,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Originally, this program started off with matching funds from the state, and over the years, it has dwindled down to, I think it's at 18% now, or maybe even less than that.

251
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any thoughts on that, or?

252
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,816
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it's concerning that it's dwindling.

253
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:38,418
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope that positive projects and positive success of the initiative will give reason

254
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,067
[SPEAKER_28]: that are matching in the future.

255
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:48,113
[SPEAKER_28]: So hopefully the success of the initiative will continue its longevity.

256
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:48,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

257
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:50,595
[SPEAKER_13]: I also move approval, Mr. President.

258
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:51,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

259
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:56,260
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Logan Kern.

260
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,562
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

261
00:15:58,202 --> 00:15:58,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

262
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:00,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

263
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations and thank you for your service.

264
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

265
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:10,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph Pecora.

266
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:16,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

267
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

268
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:20,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Joseph Pecora, 25 Adams Street, Medford.

269
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:24,299
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to give a little brief synopsis of yourself?

270
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:24,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

271
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been living in Medford for about five years now.

272
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:33,485
[SPEAKER_21]: And I work as a real estate agent out of Cambridge.

273
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:36,287
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been practicing as a real estate agent for about 15 years.

274
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,929
[SPEAKER_21]: I come from the trades.

275
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,453
[SPEAKER_21]: My family's involved with development in the suburbs, in the metro Boston region.

276
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:49,576
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think I bring the experience both as

277
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:54,503
[SPEAKER_21]: real estate agent and as a contractor to the table.

278
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,444
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm looking forward to working on the committee.

279
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:58,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

280
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

281
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:10,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if you review Mr. Pecora's resume and contrast with the city ordinance, you'll see that he also hits all the high points in terms of criteria that's been established.

282
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:16,595
[SPEAKER_19]: As we all know, the Community Preservation Act does have a focus, number one, on land acquisition and number two, on affordable housing.

283
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:20,197
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think he brings some much needed expertise in those fields and I move for approval.

284
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:21,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

285
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:22,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

286
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:24,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:32,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And this may be a good opportunity for members of the committee to meet each other also, which is a great suggestion.

288
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:44,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe, knowing that you're in the field of real estate, what are your thoughts about what this community needs in regards to affordable housing?

289
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think we're where we should be?

290
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that there's a need for additional

291
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:51,093
[SPEAKER_11]: affordable housing?

292
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:57,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what the numbers are, what the stats reflect, but I know that's a concern as prices continue to soar.

293
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:08,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I know in other areas closer to, you know, Cambridge, Somerville and those markets, Somerville's been seeing real new price points, a million dollar condos left and right now.

294
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,028
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Medford's been

295
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,119
[SPEAKER_21]: moving up as well in terms of price.

296
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:19,762
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's a pretty big concern for the community, pushing people out and not having a fairly decent mix of people from all walks of life.

297
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:28,685
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's important to consider and to work toward making sure that we create opportunities that are affordable for people.

298
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:34,767
[SPEAKER_21]: I would imagine that Medford is feeling a pinch as well, rents as well as sales.

299
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:43,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I know just recently, the other day on North Street, there were a couple of condos that sold for a million dollars, almost a million in Medford.

300
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,287
[SPEAKER_21]: So people are talking about price.

301
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:47,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Rents are high.

302
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:52,848
[SPEAKER_21]: And, yeah, I think it's a pretty significant question or point.

303
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:54,468
[SPEAKER_21]: We ought to look at it.

304
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:02,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, so far, we've seen three candidates, and they all have their own expertise and style.

305
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:15,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's refreshing to hear Joe just mention the fact that with the housing market, as we know, in Cambridge, Somerville, and Method is experiencing right now, that there is a lack of affordability in this community.

306
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:24,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know with my children and other children in the community, that's a big concern that eventually someday they may not be able to afford to live in this community.

307
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:30,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you hear Joe mention that, that is something that's on his radar, and he's well aware of it.

308
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,087
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me feel comfortable as one member

309
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:43,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Although a million dollars every year may not go far to adding a lot of additional affordable housing, but it's something that this committee will be responsible for.

310
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I also, Mr. President, move approval.

311
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:46,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

312
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:52,343
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

313
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:53,943
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

314
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:54,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

315
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:55,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

316
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:59,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations and thank you for your time and volunteers in our community.

317
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:05,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Heidi Davis.

318
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

319
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Just those four, we're not gonna do the other ones?

320
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

321
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:31,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're just waiting for Roberta to come, she'll be in later and we'll do her when she gets here.

322
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,306
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll table this until Roberta.

323
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, table the paper.

324
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:43,616
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to table by Council Member Kern and seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

325
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:46,119
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

326
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

327
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:52,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight has requested a brief recess.

328
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,088
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

329
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to return back to regular business.

330
00:23:54,281 --> 00:24:09,848
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're under suspension, 17370, offered by Councilor Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council vote to support the establishment of a local historic district at 21 Toro Avenue.

331
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:11,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo Kern.

332
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,490
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carviello.

333
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,731
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a number of meetings and a number of

334
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:25,424
[SPEAKER_30]: neighbors that were concerned about the property at 21 Toro Ave.

335
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:40,168
[SPEAKER_30]: It was purchased about a year ago and the neighborhood really worked with the Medford Historical Commission to create a local historic district for 21 Toro.

336
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:47,550
[SPEAKER_30]: It's something that the neighborhood is extremely excited about and it was quite refreshing having attended those meetings with

337
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:56,494
[SPEAKER_30]: a few of my colleagues, refreshing to have the owners of 21 Toro Ave be on board and almost excited about this endeavor.

338
00:24:56,614 --> 00:25:11,567
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's something that's long overdue for the council approval, and I would like to vote on that tonight, that we make 21 Toro Ave a local historic district to preserve the history of the property and into the future.

339
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:12,308
[SPEAKER_30]: This will

340
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:20,427
[SPEAKER_30]: be recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and it's something that is long overdue to be voted by the Council, and hopefully we can all support this and move forward.

341
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:28,850
[SPEAKER_30]: And I believe we're the last step in getting this push forward, so I think it's something that we need to act on sooner than later.

342
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Locren.

343
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

344
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:33,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

345
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:36,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Locren, for bringing this up.

346
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:40,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, went to those meetings, and I think it's so important

347
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we also visited that whole neighborhood and visiting

348
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:51,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And looking into that, I believe that we also voted during budget time to approve some funding to increase.

349
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:57,145
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be something that, if we can, to maybe help us where we are with those monies.

350
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:00,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they been expended?

351
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:10,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that we were putting the, not the monuments, but there was the plaques at historical locations.

352
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:16,186
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that we were looking to... Typically, we have not provided plaques, but we can certainly... Excuse me.

353
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:17,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, sorry.

354
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me introduce myself.

355
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,309
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Chris Bader.

356
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,810
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address of the record, please.

357
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,331
[SPEAKER_22]: 298 High Street.

358
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:31,917
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the chair of the Historic District Commission, and we're in charge of creating new historic districts.

359
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:32,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Chris.

360
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:39,323
[SPEAKER_22]: And as you say, we should absolutely put a plaque indicating this is the King House

361
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,804
[SPEAKER_22]: with its construction date, approximate construction date of the 1840s.

362
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:52,271
[SPEAKER_22]: It's part of the historic, it's an important historic building in South Medford.

363
00:26:53,112 --> 00:27:02,881
[SPEAKER_22]: And let me just give you a brief summary of the events that led to this becoming

364
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:27,446
[SPEAKER_22]: a candidate for her local historic district, which is that it was owned by Tufts University, and they kind of pulled a fast one on the grandfather's house, where they subdivided it with no public input, and then sold the entire property to a contractor who immediately sold off grandfather's house itself, and built a

365
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,780
[SPEAKER_22]: prefab house on the remaining property.

366
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,981
[SPEAKER_22]: And everyone was upset about that.

367
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:41,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Then they wanted to do exactly the same thing on 21 Turo.

368
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:48,764
[SPEAKER_22]: They had no intention of destroying the historic house, but they had their eye on that very juicy piece of property.

369
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:51,665
[SPEAKER_22]: The neighbors were outraged.

370
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:57,567
[SPEAKER_22]: It was really a grassroots uprising, you might even say.

371
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:11,358
[SPEAKER_22]: And finally, the Tufts and the new perspective owner backed down and agreed to sell it to someone who agreed not to subdivide the property.

372
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:19,821
[SPEAKER_22]: I think historic districts, part of our job is not just to preserve historic buildings, but to preserve open space.

373
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,122
[SPEAKER_22]: And a lot of these historic houses are on big lots.

374
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:26,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And the neighbors want to keep it that way.

375
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:37,213
[SPEAKER_22]: It was tentatively resolved with the new owners that they would put a historic preservation restriction on the deed.

376
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:45,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, the problem is this is a historic preservation deed of preservation restriction of limited duration.

377
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,785
[SPEAKER_22]: And moreover, the building department does not have easy access to preservation restrictions.

378
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:55,067
[SPEAKER_22]: It's there at the registry of deeds.

379
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:03,383
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's not something there that a building inspector is going to be able to look at in a few minutes.

380
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:13,007
[SPEAKER_22]: So we decided we would, in addition to the historic preservation restriction, we would seek local historical status.

381
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:20,350
[SPEAKER_22]: We sent out, there's an elaborate process spelled out by the Mass Historical Commission, which we followed.

382
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,471
[SPEAKER_22]: It took about a year to actually get it through.

383
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:25,072
[SPEAKER_22]: We held a public hearing.

384
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,131
[SPEAKER_22]: We were actually amazed to find that no one opposed it, including the owners.

385
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:32,893
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, they really were delighted.

386
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:41,098
[SPEAKER_22]: We held this public hearing after a 60-day waiting period and blah, blah, blah.

387
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:45,421
[SPEAKER_22]: And really, the last step is now for you guys to vote on it.

388
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:53,586
[SPEAKER_22]: It requires per Massachusetts General Laws 40C, it requires a 2 3rds vote.

389
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:59,929
[SPEAKER_22]: of the City Council, that means five of you guys.

390
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,830
[SPEAKER_22]: And we would appreciate your support.

391
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:05,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

392
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:07,072
[SPEAKER_22]: Any questions?

393
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

394
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:17,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me what this, in creation, this historic district at 21 Toro Ave.

395
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

396
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Define 21 Toro Ave.

397
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:23,497
[SPEAKER_22]: It is the current, it is the house

398
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:31,671
[SPEAKER_22]: And the current property that is registered at the Registry of Deeds as 21 Turo.

399
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:41,273
[SPEAKER_22]: So it is both, this is not something that can be subdivided or built on without the permission of the Historic District Commission.

400
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:42,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

401
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris, can you give me the law again?

402
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:44,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me?

403
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:44,854
[SPEAKER_13]: The law again.

404
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:44,894
[SPEAKER_13]: 40C.

405
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:45,514
[SPEAKER_13]: 40C?

406
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,114
[SPEAKER_13]: General, Mass General Law is 40C, yes.

407
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:48,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

408
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. President.

409
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:59,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Del Rosso, point of information.

410
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we received any communique on this from the city solicitor?

411
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:04,473
[SPEAKER_16]: We have not.

412
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:10,237
[SPEAKER_16]: The city solicitor has the habit of speaking for himself.

413
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:14,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

414
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:21,125
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, there was very basic language added to the existing bylaws of the city of Medford.

415
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:29,103
[SPEAKER_22]: in accordance with Master Nolan's 40C, and the city solicitor approved that language.

416
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:40,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, there's nothing in there besides adding the King House to the list of the other two historic districts in Medford.

417
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, no changes whatsoever to the Medford bylaws.

418
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

419
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:50,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Bader, how are you?

420
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:51,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Good to see you.

421
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:51,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Good to see you.

422
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:56,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, all the procedural requirements have been met by the district commission.

423
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:58,568
[SPEAKER_22]: So now right now, okay.

424
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:07,551
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now, um, this would bring this, if we take this to a vote this evening, it would bring this issue of 21 to wrap the finality and it would have its single home historic district classification.

425
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:09,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

426
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:10,812
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I move for approval.

427
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:11,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

428
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:13,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice president box.

429
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:15,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

430
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we do we have any other properties in the city that are in a similar circumstance?

431
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:33,571
[SPEAKER_22]: That are in immediate danger of subdivision As the reason for the developer buying them not that I'm aware of no There are of course historic houses all over Medford.

432
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:43,978
[SPEAKER_22]: They need protection and we're working on a plan to a general plan to protect these houses particularly those

433
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:48,713
[SPEAKER_22]: in close to Medford Square.

434
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:56,436
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, the Andrew House, the David Osgood House, which is owned by the Unitarian Church but is in very poor condition.

435
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:03,098
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't think Grandfather's House is in any danger at this point.

436
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:10,960
[SPEAKER_22]: The damage has already been done with the construction of the prefab house that was built next to it.

437
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:13,621
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're focusing

438
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:18,504
[SPEAKER_22]: at the moment houses near, uh, uh, uh, square.

439
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:25,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the council were to vote on this tonight, do you know when it would become effective?

440
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:29,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it something that, uh, you would have to talk to the city solicitor about that.

441
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:32,634
[SPEAKER_22]: But, but I would believe it would be effective immediately.

442
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:33,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Effective immediately.

443
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:33,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

444
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:34,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

445
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:36,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I too would move approval.

446
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

447
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

448
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

449
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to, uh,

450
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:45,455
[SPEAKER_03]: say thank you for your hard work on this and thank everyone here tonight.

451
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:46,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is important.

452
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:49,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something I support wholeheartedly.

453
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:52,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to protect our historic homes.

454
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:55,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this goes a long way in doing that.

455
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:57,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we could probably see more of it, too.

456
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:05,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think with developers coming in all the time trying to tear things down, I think they're tearing apart our history.

457
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:06,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's unfortunate.

458
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to do more.

459
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to thank you for all your efforts.

460
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:11,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much.

461
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:17,601
[SPEAKER_03]: and move approval.

462
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

463
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:25,366
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kernan, seconded by Councilor Falco.

464
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,948
[SPEAKER_13]: And this requires a two-third vote.

465
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:30,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

466
00:34:37,794 --> 00:34:38,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor De La Russa.

467
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:38,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

468
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:41,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

469
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:41,664
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

470
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:42,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

471
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:43,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

472
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:44,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kern.

473
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:44,966
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

474
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:46,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

475
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:47,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

476
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:48,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

477
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:48,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

478
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:51,109
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caviello.

479
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:51,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

480
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

481
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:56,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

482
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:57,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

483
00:34:57,873 --> 00:34:58,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

484
00:35:06,578 --> 00:35:07,699
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're under suspension, 17-371,

485
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:27,517
[SPEAKER_13]: offered by Councilor Lungo Kern, being resolved that the Medford City Council move forward with extending the demolition delay of historic properties from six months to 18 months to 24 months by changing Chapter 48 of the City of Medford Ordinances.

486
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:28,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo Kern.

487
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,458
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carviello.

488
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,640
[SPEAKER_30]: I know that the demo delay, Chapter 48, isn't

489
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:59,668
[SPEAKER_30]: subcommittee, so I'm not sure what councils have been able to read it, but I believe the commission and myself or whoever will be able to get a copy to anybody that hasn't, um, this proposal was voted in favor by the Medford historical commission and it is outlined in yellow.

490
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:05,274
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, the version I have outlined in yellow with the potential changes.

491
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:14,425
[SPEAKER_30]: And obviously, one of the biggest changes is we currently have a six-month demo delay that has been around for quite some time.

492
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:26,074
[SPEAKER_30]: But times are changing, and a number of different communities are moving towards extending their demo delay or already have a 12-, 18-, or 24-month demo delay.

493
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:33,119
[SPEAKER_30]: I know that, I believe, Winchester's working on pushing it to a year.

494
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:34,060
[SPEAKER_30]: Watertown has 24 months.

495
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,918
[SPEAKER_30]: has an extended demo delay.

496
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,620
[SPEAKER_30]: Lexington, Concord, they're at Woburn.

497
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,983
[SPEAKER_30]: There are a number of cities and towns around us that do have a demo delay.

498
00:36:48,444 --> 00:37:03,572
[SPEAKER_30]: The commission in their annual report, Medford Historical Commission in their annual report, it shows 2016, the amount of demo delays is up, I don't know, would you say 90%?

499
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:11,728
[SPEAKER_30]: The norm was about one to two requests for a demolition of a historical property.

500
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:18,729
[SPEAKER_30]: This current ordinance we have is anything 1900 or above, built in 1900 or above.

501
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:35,612
[SPEAKER_30]: In 2016, not only were there 17 applications for demo delays, but the historic commission found that 17 properties were historically significant and preferably preserved.

502
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:37,792
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that's an important factor.

503
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:40,753
[SPEAKER_30]: It goes to show that times really are changing.

504
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:44,976
[SPEAKER_30]: We've had uproar in the city over a number of different parcels.

505
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:53,320
[SPEAKER_30]: Walnut Street brings to mind what's been, as of recent, you have 18 Walnut Street.

506
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,821
[SPEAKER_30]: You have the property across the street.

507
00:37:55,481 --> 00:38:04,546
[SPEAKER_30]: You also have a property that was listed, and I'm not going to name the address, but listed, and I believe it was listed on MLS, because I do have access to MLS.

508
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:05,935
[SPEAKER_30]: did read it.

509
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:13,281
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have it in front of me, but it was advertised as a single-family home that could be turned into four units.

510
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,104
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's a problem to the community.

511
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:17,605
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a problem to our neighborhoods.

512
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:22,088
[SPEAKER_30]: The residents in the community are not happy with the current state.

513
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:27,873
[SPEAKER_30]: And the six-month delay is not deterring what it used to deter.

514
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:33,898
[SPEAKER_30]: You can go over the Walnut Street property and what's going on there, and that gives you significant proof of

515
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,628
[SPEAKER_30]: you know, what I just stated.

516
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,829
[SPEAKER_30]: So why is the delay?

517
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:43,050
[SPEAKER_30]: And this is put, this is question and answers that have been put out by the historical commission.

518
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,051
[SPEAKER_30]: Why is the delay being changed from six months to 24 months or potentially why are we requesting that?

519
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:50,972
[SPEAKER_30]: Why am I asking the council to support this?

520
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:56,033
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, primarily because the commission has found that the present six month delay is not effective.

521
00:38:56,693 --> 00:39:02,394
[SPEAKER_30]: The commission has seen numerous cases where owners or developers have showed no interest in working with either the commission

522
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:11,627
[SPEAKER_30]: or the neighborhood to look at alternatives to demolition and simply waited out the six-month demo delay time frame and demolished the property anyway.

523
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:19,612
[SPEAKER_30]: A larger potential demo delay time frame of up to 24 months is generally too long a time frame for a project to become dormant.

524
00:39:20,513 --> 00:39:26,757
[SPEAKER_30]: And the commission feels that the extra time will give the demo delay some teeth and leverage that will serve Medford and our neighborhoods better.

525
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:31,416
[SPEAKER_30]: and why the changes are being proposed.

526
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:40,321
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just stated already over the last five minutes, there are several significant historic buildings that have been demoed.

527
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,302
[SPEAKER_30]: Residents have been upset.

528
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:46,565
[SPEAKER_30]: And as the real estate market continues to improve, no more vacant land exists.

529
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:49,827
[SPEAKER_30]: The threat of Medford's historic buildings is ever increasing.

530
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:58,813
[SPEAKER_30]: The proposed bylaws tries to address these concerns by providing time to research alternatives to demo before any more historic buildings are lost.

531
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:07,582
[SPEAKER_30]: It also clarifies previously undefined terms and creates a standard set of mandates for applicants to complete in order for the commission to lift the delay.

532
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:11,603
[SPEAKER_30]: I know we have a number of residents, and we have Ryan Haywood.

533
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:20,065
[SPEAKER_30]: I reached out to him last week after I got emails and phone calls from concerned residents on the Walnut Street property.

534
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,146
[SPEAKER_30]: And you see Facebook.

535
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,266
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a number of people that are interested in this.

536
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:28,007
[SPEAKER_30]: And I believe the time is now, whether we have a Committee of the Whole meeting,

537
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:35,254
[SPEAKER_30]: or we decide to move forward with this tonight, I think it's something that we need to move on quickly.

538
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:51,178
[SPEAKER_30]: Ryan was gracious enough to meet with me, and I know he'll meet with or has met with other counselors as well to explain in depth what the ordinance entails, the proposed changes to it, how they will affect in more detail than I can give the community.

539
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:56,160
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's a win-win, and I think it's something that we need to discuss and move forward with.

540
00:40:57,695 --> 00:41:01,616
[SPEAKER_30]: leave it to the residents who thankfully came tonight to support the paper.

541
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Beally.

542
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

543
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:06,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I thank Councilor Longo Kern for bringing this forward.

544
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:12,038
[SPEAKER_09]: This issue is greater than what it reads itself.

545
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:19,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that what we're seeing in our community with our questions in zoning and lack of true development plan, I think it

546
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:30,311
[SPEAKER_09]: This one key issue really sums up what we're seeing as probably the number one now major issue and concern in our community.

547
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:41,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I too was part of the subcommittee that saw this as an issue and moved it forward for 12 months with a possible another six months.

548
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:46,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking at that 18 months, that's something we wholeheartedly supported in subcommittee.

549
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:56,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it is still was brought back and then put to the city solicitor for final approval.

550
00:41:56,499 --> 00:42:03,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that bringing this forward kind of gives you that kickstart that we need to get a final answer.

551
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:10,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And whether it's in committee of the whole or in the open meetings to get this

552
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:12,006
[SPEAKER_09]: get this through.

553
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:24,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very important because what we are seeing is free reign throughout our community and making sure right now, looking at a historical community and tying that

554
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:29,628
[SPEAKER_09]: and holding that off where we have that control right now, I think is vital.

555
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:33,529
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate my fellow council bringing this up.

556
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:41,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate all the hard work and the emails that I did receive from multiple community members and concerns that were brought forth.

557
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:48,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that one member came behind this reel last week and we had a depth conversation because you can hear it in their voices.

558
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And when people seeing communities that

559
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:56,813
[SPEAKER_09]: that we know as of Medford changing right in front of your eyes.

560
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:58,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like we have no control.

561
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:11,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this is a great resolution to at least put a stop to this right now and give us a little bit more control as we look into the zoning and development concerns that we do have for our community.

562
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:16,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wholeheartedly second this motion and moving this forward.

563
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:17,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

564
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:20,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

565
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:26,195
[SPEAKER_19]: By way of history, I'd like to just give a brief breakdown as to the process.

566
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:35,540
[SPEAKER_19]: In June of 2016, the historical commission came before the council during budget hearings and expressed some concern about the demolition delay.

567
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,883
[SPEAKER_19]: At that point in time, in June of 2016, I was working on a proposal with Mr. Haywood based upon some recommendations that he had.

568
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,694
[SPEAKER_19]: and Councilor Lungo-Kern put forward a resolution requesting that the demolition delay be looked at.

569
00:43:48,514 --> 00:43:56,581
[SPEAKER_19]: In June of 2016, that paper was referred to the Zoning and Ordinance Committee, and it was introduced by way of a subcommittee hearing language.

570
00:43:56,621 --> 00:44:10,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Language was put together, and in August of 2016, the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee reported the following changes to 48-78B out of committee favorably for full review and vetting from the Committee of the Whole.

571
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:18,472
[SPEAKER_19]: The first recommendation that the subcommittee made was to strike the figure 1900 and replace that with homes built within the last 75 years.

572
00:44:18,632 --> 00:44:29,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Presently, homes subject to demolition delay have to have been built before the year 1900, and the recommendation of the subcommittee was to strike that and replace it with homes built within the last 75 years.

573
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:37,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, the subcommittee agreed in their committee report, which was reported out favorably, underneath 48-78B,

574
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:44,117
[SPEAKER_19]: subsection H to strike the figure six months and replace it with the figure 12 months.

575
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:48,298
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, that would be the amount of time for which the demolition delay can take place.

576
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:59,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, also under section I two, um, would be strike six months and replaced with 12 months again, uh, housekeeping to ensure that, uh, the ordinance would reflect that demolition delay would be 12 months.

577
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:02,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, the subcommittee also recommended that a new section

578
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:15,321
[SPEAKER_19]: be added to 48-78, which would allow for the historical commission to petition the city council for an additional six months of demolition delay if they felt certain requirements and criterias weren't met.

579
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:24,067
[SPEAKER_19]: This was reported out of the committee in August of 2016 and set for a committee of the whole hearing.

580
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:31,532
[SPEAKER_19]: The matter was being scheduled for a committee of the whole hearing when the commission asked to hold off and presented us with

581
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:49,488
[SPEAKER_19]: a revamped ordinance that they wrote that was a little bit more than just increasing the number of years that it takes to make a house eligible for demolition delay and also increasing the amount of time for which they have to delay demolition of a house.

582
00:45:50,688 --> 00:45:55,051
[SPEAKER_19]: So in October of 2016, the historical commission presented those changes to the subcommittee.

583
00:45:55,898 --> 00:46:03,523
[SPEAKER_19]: And in October of 2016, the subcommittee requested some technical assistance relative to some questions that were raised relative to legalities.

584
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Those were sent to the Office of Community Development and the legal department.

585
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:10,267
[SPEAKER_19]: Those questions weren't answered.

586
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:14,690
[SPEAKER_19]: And in January 2017, there were some subcommittee changes with the change of the leadership to the president.

587
00:46:15,531 --> 00:46:21,815
[SPEAKER_19]: So Councilor Dela Rousseff, Councilor Falco, and Councilor Me, and I now make up the committee.

588
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:32,214
[SPEAKER_19]: In February of 2017, a meeting notice was posted to reconvene and discuss this matter where we had not received any response from the administration, at which time a snowstorm struck.

589
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:35,235
[SPEAKER_19]: And the meeting was canceled because City Hall was closed.

590
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,077
[SPEAKER_19]: So that brings us to February 2017, Mr. President.

591
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:48,121
[SPEAKER_19]: So it appears that as of August 2016, the subcommittee had reported out a paper favorably to the Committee of the Whole.

592
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:51,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And there is a paper that is now at the Committee of the Whole that would address this issue.

593
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:59,380
[SPEAKER_19]: The recommendations were to increase the number of years for which a home would be eligible for a demolition delay to be built within the last 75 years.

594
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:08,069
[SPEAKER_19]: It would also give a 12-month automatic demolition delay with the ability for the commission to petition this council for an opportunity for an additional six months, Mr. President.

595
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:13,574
[SPEAKER_19]: Recommendations still remain on the table and can be brought up at any time.

596
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:14,935
[SPEAKER_19]: We can move forward on those tomorrow.

597
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:26,943
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposed ordinance that the commission put together was a little bit more inclusive than just addressing issues of time and of delay.

598
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:30,105
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was a number of concerns that were raised by the subcommittee.

599
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:35,169
[SPEAKER_19]: The subcommittee was waiting to get some answers back from the administration's legal team and community development team.

600
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:36,249
[SPEAKER_19]: That hasn't happened.

601
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,731
[SPEAKER_19]: And we share the frustration that the individuals behind the rail share

602
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:51,031
[SPEAKER_19]: However, if the matter is just as simple as increasing the number of years to look at a house and the amount of time to delay demolition, there's a paper that's sitting right in our Committee of the Whole right now that we can act on, Mr. President, and that will address that issue.

603
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,793
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we can go and continue to properly vet the proposals.

604
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:55,694
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the course of action that I would recommend.

605
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:56,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

606
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:58,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks.

607
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:00,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

608
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:06,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, this is such an important ordinance.

609
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:17,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my opinion, waiting for a legal opinion, waiting for the administration to move on something is long overdue.

610
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:26,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd rather see something put forward and have us worry about maybe some ramifications down the line.

611
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:30,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather see some protections in place right now, Mr. President.

612
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,842
[SPEAKER_11]: And what makes this community so unique

613
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:44,716
[SPEAKER_11]: is the, and you hear it over and over again, is the very uniqueness of every neighborhood, Mr. President, and every style of home in this community.

614
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:57,523
[SPEAKER_11]: And slowly but surely, we're losing the style of this community to these large salt box type homes and condominium projects, Mr. President.

615
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:05,020
[SPEAKER_11]: all for the sake of adding additional units and additional money for the developers.

616
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:15,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And as was mentioned earlier, many of these older homes are on larger properties, like on Walnut, that have additional space.

617
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:20,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And the developers see this nothing more than a way of making additional money.

618
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:23,609
[SPEAKER_11]: And we as a community have to safeguard ourselves

619
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:26,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is a great step in the right direction.

620
00:49:27,915 --> 00:49:34,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather see the 75 years extended to 100 years and beyond, to be quite honest with you.

621
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:40,321
[SPEAKER_11]: And the 12 month, in my opinion, is not long enough.

622
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:51,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what was offered as 18 month for demolition delay, or even 24 month, at least provides this community with ample opportunity

623
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,891
[SPEAKER_11]: to safeguard its historic homes.

624
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:58,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So I personally would like to see us take a vote tonight.

625
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's what Councilor Longo-Kern has requested.

626
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: The resolve says from six months to 18 or 24.

627
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:10,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have to narrow it down naturally before we vote on it, because you can't have 18 or 24.

628
00:50:10,898 --> 00:50:11,959
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to be one or the other.

629
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:21,363
[SPEAKER_11]: But I definitely think, and I'm prepared tonight to move this forward, Mr. President, because I've been around a while.

630
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:33,247
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm not gonna wait to hear with an opinion that may be rendered down the line that we've been waiting on already for six months, because I'd rather move forward, Mr. President.

631
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:37,848
[SPEAKER_11]: This is long overdue, and I would support the resolution tonight, Mr. President.

632
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:40,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Member O'Karn.

633
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:50,530
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, I wanna get to allow the speakers to speak, but I too would be agreeable to even if we vote for a demo delay,

634
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:57,235
[SPEAKER_30]: tonight, whether it be the 12 months that the committee discussed with an extension of six months or an 18 month demo delay.

635
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,595
[SPEAKER_30]: I think we should move forward on a vote like that tonight.

636
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:03,416
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we do have a number of other changes.

637
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:07,797
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe we can meet in committee of the whole to discuss changing the ordinance completely.

638
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:09,778
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think we need to move forward on something.

639
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,638
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think the votes may be here to do that.

640
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:15,799
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'd like to hear from the speakers and I'm agreeable to my colleagues.

641
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:17,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor DelaRusso.

642
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

643
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:23,702
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could, through the chair, ask Councilor Knight again to restate his recommendation.

644
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:28,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that he was suggesting that we had something in Committee of the Whole.

645
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:34,432
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two contrasting things, so I just want some clarity, if I could.

646
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:35,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

647
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:43,400
[SPEAKER_19]: The recommendation of the subcommittee coming out of the August subcommittee report, which was favorable and unanimous,

648
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:45,916
[SPEAKER_19]: would be to strike the figure 1900.

649
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:49,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now it said any home built before 1900 was subject to a demolition delay.

650
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,322
[SPEAKER_19]: We wanted to reduce that figure to any home built within the last 75 years.

651
00:51:53,362 --> 00:51:56,284
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the recommendation of the committee that was reported out favorably.

652
00:51:57,005 --> 00:52:02,129
[SPEAKER_19]: That's subsection B under ordinance 48-78.

653
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:07,234
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have the opportunity to strike the figure six months and replace it with 12 months.

654
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:11,037
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was a reference to the amount of time for which the demolition delay would be in effect.

655
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,865
[SPEAKER_19]: That's under 48-78H.

656
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:23,747
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also have a reference to six months in 48-78I, subsection 2, which also made a reference to a six-month demolition delay.

657
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:27,728
[SPEAKER_19]: And the recommendation of the committee was to strike that and replace it with 12 months.

658
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:38,851
[SPEAKER_19]: So the committee made an initial recommendation to change the purview of homes that are subject to a demolition delay from houses that were built before 1900 to houses that were built within the last 75 years.

659
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:41,111
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be a rolling scale.

660
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:44,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we also agreed to give a 12 month demolition delay.

661
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:54,272
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there was new language that was reported out favorably, which said that, um, the commission would have the right to petition the city council for a delay of an additional six months.

662
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:58,495
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would give us 18 months of demolition delay if they could show that certain criteria weren't met.

663
00:52:58,936 --> 00:53:01,177
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was the recommendation that was reported out of the subcommittee.

664
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:10,605
[SPEAKER_16]: And that, uh, if I could, again, through the chair, that was all agreed to or arrived at with input from the commission and also, uh, the city solicitor.

665
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:11,733
[SPEAKER_16]: At Alia?

666
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:15,596
[SPEAKER_19]: That is correct, Mr. President, Councilor de la Russo.

667
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,679
[SPEAKER_19]: The commission and the council met on that.

668
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:24,123
[SPEAKER_19]: The language changes were minor in nature and didn't raise any question or concern about legality.

669
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:35,031
[SPEAKER_19]: When we started getting into a two-year demolition delay and some of the changes that were in place, some concerns came up relative to whether or not there would be legal standing as to whether or not that was a land-taking.

670
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:40,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Some questions and concerns about financing of projects and stuff, stuff that really

671
00:53:41,154 --> 00:53:44,236
[SPEAKER_19]: I think warranted concern, but not stuff that should be a deal breaker.

672
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:45,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Number one.

673
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:55,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Number two, I think that, you know, moving forward, we have some recommendations from the subcommittee that met that are sitting on the table at the committee of the whole that will address the issues in the ordinance that are brought forward.

674
00:53:55,184 --> 00:54:04,591
[SPEAKER_19]: They will extend the demolition delay period of time from six months to 18 months or a year guaranteed and potentially 18 months if need be.

675
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:07,233
[SPEAKER_19]: And it will also change the type of home.

676
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:09,092
[SPEAKER_19]: that is subject to a demolition delay.

677
00:54:09,172 --> 00:54:11,253
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's something that I could support this evening, Mr. President.

678
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:18,678
[SPEAKER_19]: I have the subsections and the languages, the language before me this evening and I'm writing it up right now for the city clerk and I'll present that by way of a motion.

679
00:54:18,979 --> 00:54:19,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

680
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:31,107
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if I could, so then if I remember correctly, we were prepared to have a committee of the whole meeting on those proposals, yet we were asked not to by the commission.

681
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:35,770
[SPEAKER_16]: So they had additional additional items that they wanted to put on.

682
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:44,617
[SPEAKER_16]: And then once we got those, the sequence events happened that we haven't met.

683
00:54:44,937 --> 00:54:48,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight.

684
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need to sort out what has to be done.

685
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Do that in the Committee of the Whole, at your discretion, Mr. President.

686
00:54:57,061 --> 00:55:00,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And also have the assistance, the paper was reported out to Committee of the Whole.

687
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:07,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have the assistance of the city solicitor present with us to lend his expertise.

688
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:14,451
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not at this point asking to table.

689
00:55:14,972 --> 00:55:19,095
[SPEAKER_16]: I will not support the motion that's before us to vote and approve this.

690
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:30,683
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to support an ordinance change without three readings until we have clear language and the opportunity to come to clarity on this.

691
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:32,429
[SPEAKER_16]: with papers before us.

692
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

693
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor Falco.

694
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:36,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

695
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:46,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to, uh, just go on the record of, um, you know, I was a member of the subcommittee that has been, um, that met with the commission and, uh, has been working on the ordinance changes.

696
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:50,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I definitely support, uh, you know, updating the ordinance.

697
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:53,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to do more to protect, protect our historic homes.

698
00:55:53,163 --> 00:56:00,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, as, as time goes on and we see these homes disappear, it really, uh, you know, has a negative impact on the,

699
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It really changes the fabric of our neighborhoods.

700
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:03,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to do more.

701
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:14,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The subcommittee has been working to actually make changes to the resolution, to the ordinance, to actually do more to protect historic homes.

702
00:56:14,745 --> 00:56:17,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far, I mean, I know we've been working hard on that.

703
00:56:17,847 --> 00:56:19,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working hard with the commission.

704
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:23,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do support extending the demolition delay as well.

705
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:25,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to go on the record of saying that.

706
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:27,555
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do support this resolution.

707
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:27,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

708
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:33,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you good, Council Member?

709
00:56:34,063 --> 00:56:34,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

710
00:56:35,404 --> 00:56:36,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

711
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:39,366
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Ryan Hayward, 40 Sheridan Ave, Medford.

712
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,549
[SPEAKER_27]: Councillors and friends of Medford history, I promise to be succinct tonight.

713
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:56,437
[SPEAKER_27]: Tonight, I stand before you as the chairman of the Medford Historical Commission, where the official municipal bodies charged with the preservation, promotion, and development of historical assets of our hometown.

714
00:56:57,403 --> 00:57:02,486
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the many ways we accomplish our mission is by administering the demo delay, which is before you tonight.

715
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:06,128
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was adopted in 1994 by this very board.

716
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:11,912
[SPEAKER_27]: It was established for protecting the city's significant historical, cultural, and architectural buildings.

717
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:18,015
[SPEAKER_27]: And if invoked, the delay period is a maximum currently of six months and only applicable to buildings built before 1900.

718
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:27,241
[SPEAKER_27]: The intent of this pause is so that the applicant can make reasonable, continued, and bona fide efforts to save the irreplaceable asset.

719
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:32,205
[SPEAKER_27]: In most cases, however, the commission has found that the existing bylaw is ineffective.

720
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:40,751
[SPEAKER_27]: And the commission has found that we have little influence over the course of action.

721
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:45,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Scores of developers, absentee landlords, neglectful property owners,

722
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:52,060
[SPEAKER_27]: and profit-seekers have chosen to wait out that short timeline and even build it into their schedules at this point.

723
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:57,783
[SPEAKER_27]: We have found that there is an unsettling trend towards demolition rather than renovation.

724
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:05,047
[SPEAKER_27]: Applications have tripled in the last three years alone, and many of these were notable landmarks that we knew and loved.

725
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:11,218
[SPEAKER_27]: The time now is to overhaul this bylaw and make it an effective preservation tool.

726
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:27,142
[SPEAKER_27]: Through Councilor Knight and now through Councilor Longo-Cohen, I respectfully request that the City Council immediately move forward with the demolition delay revision of Chapter 48, Article 4, as presented in subcommittee to the demo delay subcommittee last September.

727
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:30,443
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not the original bylaw that was proposed before that.

728
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:42,751
[SPEAKER_27]: I respectfully disagree with Councillor Knight that the commission had no input on that and that unfortunately we got word after the fact that that subcommittee did vote and so we put forth our own proposal which went to subcommittee.

729
00:58:45,670 --> 00:59:12,615
[SPEAKER_27]: Highlights of these changes include much needed revisions to the definitions, changes to the reviews and timeline, including buildings that are 50 years old to be in compliance with our certified local government status and the National Park Service, including language to discourage demolition by neglect, and most importantly, changing the timeline from six months to two years to give this board the leverage it needs to influence projects involving our historic buildings.

730
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:24,453
[SPEAKER_27]: By extending the demo delay, we will join scores of other communities that have said yes to better projects, yes to preservation, and yes to ensuring that we have something to leave behind for the next generation.

731
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:30,335
[SPEAKER_27]: I look to you all for your support, as it should be clear that you have our support.

732
00:59:30,836 --> 00:59:35,758
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have on this as you guys move forward in process.

733
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:41,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Just to be clear, too, the question was raised about properties that were up for demolition.

734
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:47,348
[SPEAKER_27]: I mentioned in my annual report that I will have sent to the mayor tomorrow.

735
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,309
[SPEAKER_27]: There were 18 properties that came under review last year.

736
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:54,910
[SPEAKER_27]: Only six of them fell under the demolition delay, but we reviewed

737
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:02,425
[SPEAKER_27]: I reviewed personally, at least double that amount that were not applicable to the review, unfortunately.

738
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:06,869
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're losing buildings on a month-to-month basis, and sometimes more than that.

739
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:20,221
[SPEAKER_27]: There are six buildings that have already come up, two of which are currently going through the process of demo delay review, one on Codding Street, one on Walnut Street, which is just coming up for the first leg.

740
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:27,659
[SPEAKER_27]: And then there is, I've heard, gotten word that there's another building just down the street from the other Codding Street building, which is currently under review.

741
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:39,307
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are several buildings which are coming up and just being bought, all of which have been owned by longtime owners, absentee landlords at this point, or have approached owners to sell their historic buildings.

742
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:44,310
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is an ever-increasing problem that I see will not be going away in the near future.

743
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,853
[SPEAKER_27]: So by changing this bylaw and doing it right now and doing it once,

744
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:56,796
[SPEAKER_27]: And being all-inclusive, it will afford us some time to be able to continue to influence projects in lieu of zoning until you guys are ready to change zoning.

745
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:00,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

746
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:02,418
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carvalho.

747
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:06,100
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for coming tonight and explaining that to the council.

748
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:12,302
[SPEAKER_30]: If I could ask you a question with regards to reviewing the entire ordinance and committee of the whole within the next month or two, if we wait,

749
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:17,284
[SPEAKER_30]: to put a demo delay and we don't vote on it tonight.

750
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:20,748
[SPEAKER_30]: What does that mean if it's postponed one, two, three, four months?

751
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,050
[SPEAKER_30]: There's going to be additional...

752
01:01:23,617 --> 01:01:28,181
[SPEAKER_30]: demo requests that are going to get grandfathered in, and we're not going to be able to stop it.

753
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:28,601
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

754
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:37,308
[SPEAKER_27]: I think you're going to find that there's going to be one of these huge rushes on demolition that anybody who might be even whispering or thinking demolition will put forth an application.

755
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:44,413
[SPEAKER_27]: Long-time owners who might be thinking of selling will probably put forth an application just so that they can clear the table and clear the hurdle long before.

756
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:49,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Because right now, there is no limit on the timeline of determination.

757
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:52,620
[SPEAKER_27]: So once we make a determination on whether a building is or isn't, unless there's

758
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:57,132
[SPEAKER_27]: significant reason to change that finding, it's a forever decision.

759
01:01:57,312 --> 01:02:01,453
[SPEAKER_27]: So people can wait out the six-month delay the moment that they have it.

760
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:03,794
[SPEAKER_27]: And even if they're not selling, then sell the building.

761
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:04,675
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a vacant lot.

762
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:06,575
[SPEAKER_27]: So there is no recourse.

763
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:10,997
[SPEAKER_30]: And just to make it clear, you don't have a developer

764
01:02:11,538 --> 01:02:17,840
[SPEAKER_30]: doesn't have to own the property to put in a demo delay, they just have to get approval and signature by the current owner, isn't that correct?

765
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,340
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

766
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:34,165
[SPEAKER_27]: In the current case of 18 Walnut, which is coming up for review, the developer is acting as the owner's representative, and I have received a letter of approval from the current building owner, giving him permission to apply for demolition.

767
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:37,826
[SPEAKER_27]: So even before he owns the property, an applicant can

768
01:02:38,434 --> 01:02:46,218
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, apply for the demolition and then just wait it out and have an active purchase and sales agreement and then move forward with a vacant lot as soon as they're ready.

769
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:58,705
[SPEAKER_30]: As one, one counselor to the chair, I don't see any reason why we can't vote to increase the demo delay tonight, especially where committees reviewed it and move forward with recommendations.

770
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:06,789
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, as well as in addition, I'd like to amend my resolve to include that any property 75 years or older be, um, I,

771
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:18,101
[SPEAKER_30]: 75 years or older, as the committee discussed and reviewed and put forward, that that be reviewable by the historic commission.

772
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:19,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

773
01:03:22,522 --> 01:03:22,902
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

774
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:23,562
[SPEAKER_27]: I missed it.

775
01:03:23,782 --> 01:03:25,162
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you asking me if it's reviewable?

776
01:03:25,182 --> 01:03:25,282
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

777
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:25,642
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

778
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:26,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

779
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:26,523
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

780
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:27,163
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else?

781
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,323
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

782
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:28,643
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

783
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:29,163
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

784
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:33,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

785
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:34,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

786
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:36,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Biffod.

787
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I serve and have served with Ryan

788
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:41,163
[SPEAKER_14]: on the historic commission for the past four years.

789
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:42,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to echo what he said.

790
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:52,270
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been really a snowballing effect in the city of Medford in the last couple of years as these properties have come one after another.

791
01:03:52,711 --> 01:04:00,976
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been a challenge for us because we haven't had the tools we need to protect the resources that we know we want to preserve for the long term.

792
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would recommend that 12 months is not enough.

793
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:05,999
[SPEAKER_14]: 18 is a minimum.

794
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:06,520
[SPEAKER_14]: 24 is preferred.

795
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:14,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep in mind that the commission, at any time during that period, can reduce that if they're getting cooperation with the developer.

796
01:04:15,372 --> 01:04:16,892
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not all inclusive.

797
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:19,692
[SPEAKER_14]: If they decide to save the building, we can immediately end it or amend it.

798
01:04:19,712 --> 01:04:24,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if they decide to renovate or add on to the building, there's ways that we can reduce it.

799
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:25,274
[SPEAKER_14]: But it gives us that leverage.

800
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: The leverage is the key with this thing, because we have virtually no leverage.

801
01:04:29,034 --> 01:04:32,255
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody comes in on September, the demo delay

802
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,762
[SPEAKER_14]: All they're doing is waiting out the winter, which they're not going to build anyway most of the time.

803
01:04:35,802 --> 01:04:38,663
[SPEAKER_14]: So it really is meaningless for a lot of developers if they time it right.

804
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:47,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's really important that it's truly a minimum of 18, preferably 24, and that we execute this as quickly as possible.

805
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:53,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to echo something that one of the councilors said earlier, that we're really missing.

806
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a first piece of several pieces.

807
01:04:56,612 --> 01:04:59,854
[SPEAKER_14]: You're missing a lot of pieces when it comes to planning in the city of Medford.

808
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:05,045
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have any design review in Medford for any building under 10,000 square feet.

809
01:05:05,686 --> 01:05:09,209
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can't control anything about a new building.

810
01:05:09,929 --> 01:05:11,411
[SPEAKER_14]: You have no tools in which to do that.

811
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:13,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has been brought before the council many years ago.

812
01:05:14,554 --> 01:05:15,555
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't go anywhere.

813
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:21,300
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the effort needs to be revived because design review is something that a lot of cities and towns have.

814
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets a higher quality development.

815
01:05:24,477 --> 01:05:27,938
[SPEAKER_14]: It forces developers who would put cookie cutter buildings to not do that.

816
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:37,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of our developers who's put up a building, they're just taking a building they built anywhere and plopping it down in every neighborhood they can.

817
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:42,743
[SPEAKER_14]: It has nothing to do with the character, context, or anything about the quality of the neighborhood.

818
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:44,683
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't prevent that right now.

819
01:05:44,743 --> 01:05:50,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So you need to look at demo, not only demo delay, but design review as well, which has been long overdue in the city of Medford.

820
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing that's missing here,

821
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,102
[SPEAKER_14]: is planning capacity.

822
01:05:55,442 --> 01:05:58,503
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have enough planning capacity in Medford.

823
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Lauren and Claude upstairs.

824
01:06:00,344 --> 01:06:01,244
[SPEAKER_14]: I've known them for 20 years.

825
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:05,305
[SPEAKER_14]: They do wonderful work, but they do not have enough people to do what they need to do.

826
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:09,046
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a complete rewrite of zoning right now in the city of Medford.

827
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:15,748
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why every project in the city needs multiple variances, because we have zoning that has frozen in time in 1960.

828
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:21,489
[SPEAKER_14]: You need 2.1 cars, whether you're 100 feet from a T station or two miles from a T station.

829
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:26,073
[SPEAKER_14]: So the planning aspect of the city is just completely outdated.

830
01:06:26,093 --> 01:06:29,834
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know the council has voted monies to increase the staff in last year's budget.

831
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:32,154
[SPEAKER_14]: But as of right now, that hasn't happened.

832
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:35,415
[SPEAKER_14]: So the planning capacity of Medford is critical.

833
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:46,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And I found it, frankly, embarrassing that the master plan for the city of Medford, which is now 12 years old and largely unexecuted, we still can't get to this day.

834
01:06:46,177 --> 01:06:51,258
[SPEAKER_14]: We're executing little pieces of it here and there with grants rather than with in-house planning and expertise.

835
01:06:51,920 --> 01:07:09,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So planning is the umbrella, and zoning, demo delay is one of these components, but there are two or three other legs of the stool that will help Medford get a higher quality built environment, preserve our historic architecture, and give us a better quality of new construction across the board.

836
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:16,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So I urge you all to pass this as quickly as possible, 18 or 24 months, but then start addressing the other concerns as well.

837
01:07:16,647 --> 01:07:16,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

838
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:18,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

839
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:24,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

840
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:26,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

841
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:27,369
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize.

842
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:28,370
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a bit of a cold.

843
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:37,173
[SPEAKER_26]: So being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts.

844
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:45,856
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford.

845
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:50,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently, today, the city of Medford has 13 properties

846
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:53,360
[SPEAKER_26]: listed for sale.

847
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:55,024
[SPEAKER_26]: Thirteen, that's it.

848
01:07:56,326 --> 01:08:03,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Of those thirteen, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes.

849
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:15,401
[SPEAKER_26]: Four are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized, and the remaining eight are listed single or two-family.

850
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:23,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Of those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors.

851
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:25,893
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's what's going on in our city.

852
01:08:26,574 --> 01:08:43,606
[SPEAKER_26]: It is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it.

853
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,488
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what's happening in the city of Medford.

854
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:55,826
[SPEAKER_26]: Another pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford.

855
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:57,426
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, what's a price-to-rent ratio?

856
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:09,794
[SPEAKER_26]: It's where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year.

857
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:13,319
[SPEAKER_26]: The city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4.

858
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:20,667
[SPEAKER_26]: There are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford.

859
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:25,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston.

860
01:09:26,352 --> 01:09:30,176
[SPEAKER_26]: Cambridge and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified.

861
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,658
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a measure of gentrification.

862
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,720
[SPEAKER_26]: What is gentrification?

863
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:43,388
[SPEAKER_26]: It is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here.

864
01:09:45,430 --> 01:10:08,016
[SPEAKER_26]: That mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in.

865
01:10:08,816 --> 01:10:13,260
[SPEAKER_26]: So this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about.

866
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:16,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Back Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill.

867
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:21,248
[SPEAKER_26]: Those are some pretty significant price point opportunities.

868
01:10:21,888 --> 01:10:24,150
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't discourage those types of price points.

869
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:27,193
[SPEAKER_26]: I think in the nature of real estate, they're critical.

870
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:30,016
[SPEAKER_26]: But we're getting a false inflation.

871
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:44,031
[SPEAKER_26]: that's happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity.

872
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:59,240
[SPEAKER_26]: What's critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property.

873
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:04,584
[SPEAKER_26]: And because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing.

874
01:11:05,485 --> 01:11:06,966
[SPEAKER_26]: So they're making all profit.

875
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:19,493
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock.

876
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:32,720
[SPEAKER_26]: It's simply not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for non-conforming units to put in another two-family or three-family.

877
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:36,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Because those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate.

878
01:11:37,104 --> 01:11:38,285
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not what's happening.

879
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:40,087
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not what's going to happen.

880
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:42,590
[SPEAKER_26]: Not unless we make a decision.

881
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:53,961
[SPEAKER_26]: We as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking as part of their process to preserve

882
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:56,543
[SPEAKER_26]: both building and green space.

883
01:11:57,043 --> 01:12:17,275
[SPEAKER_26]: And yet, we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put up these fast, prefabbed, fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick-built construction.

884
01:12:17,695 --> 01:12:18,996
[SPEAKER_26]: They're not bringing jobs.

885
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:20,897
[SPEAKER_26]: They're simply lining their pockets.

886
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:23,539
[SPEAKER_26]: in my opinion and my observation.

887
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,484
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee.

888
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:31,707
[SPEAKER_26]: And the message is, the line is drawn.

889
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:36,552
[SPEAKER_26]: We welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose.

890
01:12:37,112 --> 01:12:44,376
[SPEAKER_26]: that come with a desire to collaborate and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit.

891
01:12:44,676 --> 01:12:50,220
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months.

892
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,300
[SPEAKER_26]: Now it's 12.

893
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:51,621
[SPEAKER_26]: It's 18.

894
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:51,801
[SPEAKER_26]: It's 24.

895
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:52,941
[SPEAKER_26]: It's 12 with two options.

896
01:12:55,923 --> 01:13:02,646
[SPEAKER_26]: whatever, but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages.

897
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:16,793
[SPEAKER_26]: That we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us.

898
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:18,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your time.

899
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:27,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address of the record, please.

900
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:28,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

901
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Chris Bader again, 280 High Street.

902
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,201
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the chair of the Historic District Commission.

903
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:46,585
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to say that the Historic District Commission, which of course is rather confusingly separate from the Historical Commission, voted unanimously at our last meeting to support this resolution.

904
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:50,326
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask you for your support as well.

905
01:13:51,487 --> 01:13:51,767
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

906
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:58,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

907
01:13:58,211 --> 01:14:01,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street in sunny Medford.

908
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not sunny.

909
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:12,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been heavily involved in historic preservation and related issues with the Royal House and the slave quarters, of course, and the Brooks Estate as well as other projects.

910
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:16,807
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife and I moved here close to 30 years ago.

911
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:17,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to believe.

912
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:23,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And one reason, one big reason, is the historical fabric of the city.

913
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:32,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, in that period, we've seen some fairly regrettable losses of historical fabric and architectural fabric.

914
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not to say that every building deserves to be saved.

915
01:14:37,984 --> 01:14:38,985
[SPEAKER_05]: We do live in a capitalist.

916
01:14:43,337 --> 01:14:46,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Give the gentleman his due respect at the podium, please.

917
01:14:46,078 --> 01:14:46,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

918
01:14:46,759 --> 01:15:00,746
[SPEAKER_05]: That every building deserves to be saved, but certainly there needs to be a process where we can have careful consideration, use some creativity, encourage outside money or inside money and developers to do the

919
01:15:01,933 --> 01:15:05,535
[SPEAKER_05]: the right thing for neighborhoods and for our heritage.

920
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:11,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always true that once you lose an old building, it's not coming back.

921
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:28,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So I commend the council for bringing up this issue for the various boards that have advanced this cause and hope that you will extend the demolition delay period and provide other

922
01:15:29,678 --> 01:15:33,199
[SPEAKER_05]: means for advancing this important issue.

923
01:15:33,299 --> 01:15:33,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

924
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

925
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

926
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the circus party.

927
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:48,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history.

928
01:15:49,281 --> 01:15:58,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it.

929
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:01,938
[SPEAKER_07]: perfect example is Luminaires on Locust Street.

930
01:16:02,779 --> 01:16:06,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Puts the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone.

931
01:16:07,783 --> 01:16:10,465
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're talking about something right now is the history of our city.

932
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:18,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And while Councilman Uncle Kern brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this.

933
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Within the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property

934
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out of towners, outsiders.

935
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:49,072
[SPEAKER_07]: People are only here to do one thing and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit and leave town so they can take over, make some money and they can leave.

936
01:16:49,152 --> 01:16:49,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not right.

937
01:16:50,413 --> 01:16:55,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard one of your counselors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October,

938
01:16:56,193 --> 01:16:59,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It went from October to January, and then it got lost somewhere in translation.

939
01:17:00,674 --> 01:17:08,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That, in and of itself, is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods.

940
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:18,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood.

941
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:38,066
[SPEAKER_07]: South Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood.

942
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:44,592
[SPEAKER_07]: The state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning.

943
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:50,218
[SPEAKER_07]: He's proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there.

944
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:58,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood.

945
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:06,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it.

946
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:13,581
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way.

947
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:23,709
[SPEAKER_07]: If the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it, and the zoning should be changed, and the 24 months should be changed, because you tell you know,

948
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:35,153
[SPEAKER_07]: If a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things.

949
01:18:35,213 --> 01:18:38,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, I'm going to work with the people or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it.

950
01:18:39,374 --> 01:18:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know something?

951
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:43,676
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably the best thing because he's not the real person that should be here for the city.

952
01:18:43,956 --> 01:18:47,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners?

953
01:18:48,807 --> 01:19:02,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer for which finally found itself before your body and you folks likewise challenged the developer.

954
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:08,269
[SPEAKER_07]: The neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project.

955
01:19:08,809 --> 01:19:12,271
[SPEAKER_07]: The neighborhood people had to bring it together, not the city administration.

956
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:17,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know of any more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about.

957
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:28,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value.

958
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Do the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

959
01:19:31,882 --> 01:19:37,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you.

960
01:19:37,726 --> 01:19:48,413
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

961
01:19:48,633 --> 01:19:48,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

962
01:19:49,013 --> 01:19:57,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

963
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

964
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:00,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 281 Park Street.

965
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:06,152
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first thing that everyone says when we talk about Medford is the Medford market is hot.

966
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:09,953
[SPEAKER_12]: There was an article this Sunday in the Globe about, hey, Medford, move there.

967
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,994
[SPEAKER_12]: That place is great.

968
01:20:12,034 --> 01:20:15,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And Boston Magazine had an article recently about North Medford being great.

969
01:20:16,015 --> 01:20:20,296
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's great about the city being great already is that we're not desperate.

970
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:27,893
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have to sell to the guy who sends you that letter in the mail that says, hey, I'll buy you a house sight unseen for $300,000.

971
01:20:28,233 --> 01:20:28,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you know what?

972
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:32,137
[SPEAKER_12]: There are families with children that want to move to Medford.

973
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:34,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we have a deep history.

974
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,622
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a fabulous community.

975
01:20:37,102 --> 01:20:40,105
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a spirit of volunteerism that is unmatched in other towns.

976
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:41,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

977
01:20:42,398 --> 01:20:45,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Revere rode through here yesterday, and it was a very different Medford.

978
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:48,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to hold on to those pieces of history.

979
01:20:49,203 --> 01:20:57,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Back in the day that I was at Medford High, Dr. Valeriani, AP US History, sent us all out to research our homes, to trace the history.

980
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:01,591
[SPEAKER_12]: And we went into the tombs of the Cambridge District Court and traced the history.

981
01:21:02,151 --> 01:21:05,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And the home that my childhood home was a beautiful double lot.

982
01:21:06,254 --> 01:21:09,336
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't give the address, because I don't want any developers going and destroying it.

983
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:20,603
[SPEAKER_12]: When my grandparents moved to Florida, we left the book that I had made in high school that had traced the history all the way back to the shipbuilding days.

984
01:21:20,984 --> 01:21:24,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Medford is steeped with history, and it's important to all of us.

985
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:29,650
[SPEAKER_12]: My parents bought their home, and there were pictures of ships that had been built in the city.

986
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:31,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And these things are important.

987
01:21:31,232 --> 01:21:32,713
[SPEAKER_12]: These things need to be preserved.

988
01:21:33,313 --> 01:21:38,237
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought my own home here, and I got my own little Medford acre, which is a big yard.

989
01:21:38,597 --> 01:21:44,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you add up the square footage, I could probably build four units, but that's not what I want.

990
01:21:44,559 --> 01:21:46,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to keep Medford the way that it is.

991
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:55,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we need, we do need to grow and expand, but we don't need to go down the streets and look in people's yards and say, I could put three in there.

992
01:21:55,302 --> 01:21:55,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I could.

993
01:21:56,362 --> 01:21:59,783
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the kind of building that we're looking for.

994
01:22:00,603 --> 01:22:11,607
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that you should definitely pass this ordinance to do the 18 to 24 demo display delay, because the fastest way to get a legal opinion back from this administration is to pass something.

995
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's like, whoa!

996
01:22:13,347 --> 01:22:15,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you'll have your answer inside of a week, definitely.

997
01:22:16,268 --> 01:22:21,170
[SPEAKER_12]: And with all due respect, if I put in and I'm looking for information and I don't get follow-up,

998
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:31,236
[SPEAKER_12]: From the person I sent out to, I'll keep bothering them every two weeks, every month, because August 2016, not having an answer is totally unacceptable.

999
01:22:31,496 --> 01:22:37,100
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand that people in this administration are busy, but if this is important to us, zoning is important to us.

1000
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1001
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:43,564
[SPEAKER_19]: August 2016 was when the Zoning Subcommittee issued its report.

1002
01:22:43,664 --> 01:22:44,464
[SPEAKER_19]: September 2016 was when the,

1003
01:22:47,693 --> 01:22:49,794
[SPEAKER_19]: the commission presented their changes.

1004
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:58,136
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was a month break between when the council was moving forward and when the commission came before the council and then we asked those questions.

1005
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:00,817
[SPEAKER_19]: But the questions got asked after August, 2016.

1006
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:03,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1007
01:23:03,762 --> 01:23:06,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, September, that's a big difference.

1008
01:23:06,142 --> 01:23:07,903
[SPEAKER_12]: That 30 days, I mean, keep waiting.

1009
01:23:08,403 --> 01:23:10,103
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we on, seven months now?

1010
01:23:11,023 --> 01:23:12,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like this is important.

1011
01:23:12,564 --> 01:23:19,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo, demo permit, demo permit, demo permit.

1012
01:23:20,365 --> 01:23:22,365
[SPEAKER_12]: This needs to be done now.

1013
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:23,166
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have time.

1014
01:23:23,226 --> 01:23:28,827
[SPEAKER_12]: If you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee.

1015
01:23:28,907 --> 01:23:30,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I waited, was at a meeting.

1016
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,989
[SPEAKER_12]: for your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well.

1017
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:36,250
[SPEAKER_12]: These things are happening and they're happening now.

1018
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And once these houses are knocked down, they're gone.

1019
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:40,032
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't rebuild.

1020
01:23:40,372 --> 01:23:42,693
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't, oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house.

1021
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:43,854
[SPEAKER_12]: We never should have knocked it down.

1022
01:23:44,174 --> 01:23:44,994
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be too late.

1023
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:51,938
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab condos that are going up that cost more than a single family house.

1024
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:55,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And single family houses, people are desperate to get those in this city.

1025
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,861
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know why we wanna knock them down.

1026
01:23:58,781 --> 01:23:59,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1027
01:24:06,185 --> 01:24:07,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1028
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Sharon Guzik, 10 Manning Street.

1029
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:17,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, I'm just going to repeat a lot of what everybody else said, but I'll try to make that fast.

1030
01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:19,488
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm going to try to add some color.

1031
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:34,592
[SPEAKER_25]: I happen to live in the neighborhood that Bob Penta mentioned, which has had developers, a specific developer that has come in and discovered

1032
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:37,077
[SPEAKER_25]: The neighborhood's ripe for the picking.

1033
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:46,866
[SPEAKER_25]: And the points that were being made about losing open space because you can build more than one house on that lot.

1034
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:56,800
[SPEAKER_25]: and losing historic trees, which I'm sure you're all familiar with that.

1035
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:05,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Those pieces don't actually speak to the resolution that Brianna put forward, but they are important to us.

1036
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,029
[SPEAKER_25]: And as you heard with 21 Turro Ave,

1037
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:22,752
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, by making it a historic district, we have, as a city, have some control over what happens to that whole piece of property, the lot.

1038
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:41,757
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't do that for every house, obviously, but we can tighten the demolition regulations, ordinances, and give the Medford Historical Commission the tools it needs, tools with teeth,

1039
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:56,875
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would strongly suggest that you go for the 24-month delay, because you have to give people pause, or they are going to come in and just wait out the six months.

1040
01:25:57,596 --> 01:26:00,936
[SPEAKER_25]: Even if you make it 12 months, they'll wait out the 12 months.

1041
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:06,338
[SPEAKER_25]: It has to be long enough that somebody that's coming in and looking to,

1042
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:13,131
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it was Jean said that she calls it flipping.

1043
01:26:13,471 --> 01:26:19,119
[SPEAKER_25]: They're looking to get a property, demolish what's on it, subdivide it, and build whatever they can.

1044
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:29,106
[SPEAKER_25]: In my neighborhood, as I said, the character has been changed by one developer single-handedly.

1045
01:26:29,546 --> 01:26:35,169
[SPEAKER_25]: We've gotten a prefab duplex next to grandfather's house on South Street.

1046
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:39,851
[SPEAKER_25]: A large tree that had to be 150 years old was cut

1047
01:26:42,992 --> 01:26:47,115
[SPEAKER_25]: down to make way for another Prefab 2 family.

1048
01:26:47,955 --> 01:26:57,461
[SPEAKER_25]: A house on Summer Street and another large beech tree were demolished and cut down to make way for yet another Prefab 2 family.

1049
01:26:57,981 --> 01:27:12,051
[SPEAKER_25]: duplex, and now there's another house being threatened with demolition, a gorgeous, well, it could use a little TLC on the outside, but you can see it has great bones.

1050
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:21,438
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a gorgeous, large, Queen Anne-style house, probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know, but from the 1890s era.

1051
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,942
[SPEAKER_25]: It has a large lot, and it's very tempting.

1052
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:34,616
[SPEAKER_25]: We could lose this house in short order.

1053
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:45,787
[SPEAKER_25]: As you heard, the developer's already applied for a demo permit, even though he doesn't technically own the property.

1054
01:27:45,967 --> 01:27:48,629
[SPEAKER_25]: So he's already got the process started.

1055
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:56,954
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if there's any way we can impose a moratorium on these things happening at this point.

1056
01:27:56,994 --> 01:28:01,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you guys sort out whether you're going to vote for 18 or 24 months for the demo delay.

1057
01:28:06,863 --> 01:28:08,044
[SPEAKER_25]: It just breaks my heart.

1058
01:28:08,224 --> 01:28:16,728
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just seeing the character of my neighborhood with all its, I call them historic houses because they're older than 100 years old.

1059
01:28:18,329 --> 01:28:21,871
[SPEAKER_25]: It being, you know, okay.

1060
01:28:22,711 --> 01:28:23,932
[SPEAKER_25]: I get too emotional about this.

1061
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:36,058
[SPEAKER_25]: And as somebody else pointed out, it's fallen to the citizens, the neighbors on those streets to organize and try to fight for keeping those houses, keeping that green space open.

1062
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:45,032
[SPEAKER_25]: And in most cases, it's unsuccessful.

1063
01:28:45,092 --> 01:28:59,017
[SPEAKER_25]: The one good spot was 21 Turo, where Tufts wanted to do the right thing by the neighborhood and found a couple that wanted to live in a historic house and bring it back, restore it to.

1064
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:02,145
[SPEAKER_25]: It's former glory, and they've done a very nice job.

1065
01:29:04,387 --> 01:29:10,471
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just wanted to emphasize that time is of utmost importance.

1066
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:14,153
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to get this done if we're going to save the character of our neighborhoods.

1067
01:29:15,234 --> 01:29:22,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Right now, we're allowing developers to come in and decide what we want our neighborhoods to be.

1068
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:27,574
[SPEAKER_25]: We have no, as citizens, we have no recourse.

1069
01:29:27,774 --> 01:29:34,240
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to give the tools to the Historical Commission to save our historic houses.

1070
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,524
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, and Doug mentioned the other pieces that need to also be in place.

1071
01:29:41,346 --> 01:29:47,371
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that's not before you now, but you should keep it in your head and, you know, work on those things as well.

1072
01:29:52,855 --> 01:29:57,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I made so many notes, I don't know what I was saying.

1073
01:29:59,179 --> 01:30:00,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, I'll just stop there.

1074
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:04,422
[SPEAKER_25]: And thank you so much for listening to me ramble.

1075
01:30:10,665 --> 01:30:11,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1076
01:30:11,045 --> 01:30:12,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

1077
01:30:12,446 --> 01:30:14,607
[SPEAKER_01]: John Anderson, 102 Brooks Street.

1078
01:30:15,188 --> 01:30:18,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also president of the Medford Historical Society and Museum.

1079
01:30:20,091 --> 01:30:33,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can come down to our building at 10 Governors Avenue on a Sunday afternoon and see dozens upon dozens of pictures of lost Medford, buildings that are no more, many of them very beautiful.

1080
01:30:34,975 --> 01:30:47,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can assure you that I speak for the hundreds of people on our mailing list in saying that we strongly support increasing the ability of our commission

1081
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,692
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide the historic preservation that we all need.

1082
01:30:51,172 --> 01:30:51,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1083
01:30:58,557 --> 01:30:59,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

1084
01:31:00,018 --> 01:31:01,979
[SPEAKER_10]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1085
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:03,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1086
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:08,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'm probably not going to be the most popular person right now, but I just want to be pragmatic and

1087
01:31:09,268 --> 01:31:11,729
[SPEAKER_10]: speak about the other side of the picture a little bit.

1088
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:27,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I listened to what we have to say, what everybody has to say, and I'm 100% in favor of changing zoning and having historical areas of the city because I think that's incredibly popular for the preservation of the city.

1089
01:31:27,737 --> 01:31:28,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It gives a snapshot

1090
01:31:29,258 --> 01:31:31,481
[SPEAKER_10]: to the future of what we were in the past.

1091
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:34,124
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I just want to throw something out there.

1092
01:31:34,144 --> 01:31:36,626
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 years ago, I bought my house.

1093
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,069
[SPEAKER_10]: My house was not a historical house.

1094
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:43,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, if we pass the 75 years, it is now historical.

1095
01:31:44,581 --> 01:32:00,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow, if I choose to tear my house down and build a beautiful new little house that my wife and I can retire in, does that mean that that may not happen because the city council has decided that my home is now a historic home?

1096
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So as an owner of a piece of property with a home, that is a decent little home.

1097
01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:07,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

1098
01:32:07,459 --> 01:32:08,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1099
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:12,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. McKillop, the council doesn't make the determination as to whether or not the home is historic.

1100
01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:13,223
[SPEAKER_19]: The commission does that.

1101
01:32:13,663 --> 01:32:15,164
[SPEAKER_19]: So all we're doing is giving them the right development.

1102
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:15,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1103
01:32:15,424 --> 01:32:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we put it to the point at the hands of the commission, how many homes in the city after 75, 90 years, how many homes become historical homes?

1104
01:32:23,808 --> 01:32:24,468
[SPEAKER_19]: A very good portion.

1105
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:26,669
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the point I'm trying to make.

1106
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:29,771
[SPEAKER_10]: At one point, the entire city becomes locked.

1107
01:32:30,451 --> 01:32:31,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we have to consider.

1108
01:32:32,112 --> 01:32:43,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, painting a clear kind of balanced picture, I think that going in the direction of trying to preserve historical homes 100 years past is an incredibly important thing.

1109
01:32:43,685 --> 01:32:44,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

1110
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we have quiet in the back there?

1111
01:32:45,806 --> 01:32:47,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Respect the gentleman at the podium.

1112
01:32:47,766 --> 01:32:48,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1113
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1114
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:51,247
[SPEAKER_10]: That's quite all right.

1115
01:32:51,287 --> 01:32:53,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, opinions are very welcome.

1116
01:32:53,788 --> 01:32:55,369
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have to consider every aspect.

1117
01:32:55,429 --> 01:33:01,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that going through this process and finding the right way to make this work for everyone is the best way to go.

1118
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:04,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, let's take a look at another example.

1119
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,092
[SPEAKER_10]: A family has a home.

1120
01:33:06,552 --> 01:33:08,433
[SPEAKER_10]: passed down generation after generation.

1121
01:33:08,473 --> 01:33:10,014
[SPEAKER_10]: The family has increased in size.

1122
01:33:10,054 --> 01:33:11,636
[SPEAKER_10]: The family is no longer in Medford.

1123
01:33:12,076 --> 01:33:15,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last remaining people in that home have passed away.

1124
01:33:15,939 --> 01:33:17,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the family wants to sell that home.

1125
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,682
[SPEAKER_10]: A developer happens to come in and wants to purchase that home.

1126
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:27,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying to that family they cannot maximize their potential because it is a historical home?

1127
01:33:28,827 --> 01:33:31,970
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it we're trying to tell the taxpayers?

1128
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:35,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's two sides to the coin that have to be considered.

1129
01:33:35,932 --> 01:33:39,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And not that I'm against everything that's been spoken about tonight.

1130
01:33:39,074 --> 01:33:45,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm 100% for it because I think there's some incredibly beautiful homes in this town that have to be preserved.

1131
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:53,525
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are two sides to the coin that have to be looked at and that's the obligation of everyone to look at that and protect everyone.

1132
01:33:53,565 --> 01:33:59,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be a challenge to find the best way to come across with this and to find the best rules to make that happen.

1133
01:34:00,129 --> 01:34:00,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1134
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:01,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1135
01:34:06,088 --> 01:34:07,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record, please.

1136
01:34:07,528 --> 01:34:07,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1137
01:34:07,848 --> 01:34:10,329
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

1138
01:34:11,049 --> 01:34:18,471
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to speak in favor of the resolution to extend the demolition delay period for up to 24 months.

1139
01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:30,754
[SPEAKER_20]: I've observed the Medford Historic Commission do its work for a number of years and very impressed with their work.

1140
01:34:31,014 --> 01:34:34,315
[SPEAKER_20]: The current members, led by Ryan Haywood,

1141
01:34:34,827 --> 01:34:39,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Hayward and Doug Carr, and even back when Nino Susi was involved.

1142
01:34:39,849 --> 01:35:02,556
[SPEAKER_20]: They're extremely knowledgeable on these matters, very diligent, careful, and they're considerate and respectful, not only of the historic element and aspect, but of the neighborhood and the developer's perspective.

1143
01:35:04,548 --> 01:35:12,064
[SPEAKER_20]: They work very hard to try to come to a solution that benefits everyone, and it takes time.

1144
01:35:13,269 --> 01:35:21,592
[SPEAKER_20]: An 18- to 24-month period is not a punitive measure, or a change should not be seen as punitive.

1145
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:33,895
[SPEAKER_20]: What it really does is allow the commission time to thoroughly deliberate the matter and look at all alternatives.

1146
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:42,098
[SPEAKER_20]: It really just provides them adequate time to do their job, to do it to the best of their ability, and to do it

1147
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:44,360
[SPEAKER_20]: in the best interest of the community.

1148
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:53,115
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would urge the council to support extending the demolition day time delay time up to 24 months.

1149
01:35:53,355 --> 01:35:53,656
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1150
01:35:53,796 --> 01:35:54,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1151
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1152
01:36:00,952 --> 01:36:01,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean Izzo, 35 Parris Street.

1153
01:36:02,053 --> 01:36:03,193
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I've spoken already.

1154
01:36:03,253 --> 01:36:03,973
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be brief.

1155
01:36:04,173 --> 01:36:06,714
[SPEAKER_26]: I would just like to raise two points of information.

1156
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:14,876
[SPEAKER_26]: The first is simply by passing this, that doesn't give a designation to every home as a historical property.

1157
01:36:15,356 --> 01:36:23,239
[SPEAKER_26]: It just affords the committee the opportunity to review and decide whether a house is of historical significance.

1158
01:36:24,019 --> 01:36:28,300
[SPEAKER_26]: The second point I'd like to raise with regard to families who've aged here

1159
01:36:29,025 --> 01:36:35,768
[SPEAKER_26]: and have dwindled off to the last survivors or beneficiaries to benefit.

1160
01:36:36,568 --> 01:36:39,250
[SPEAKER_26]: Nobody lives in Medford and says, I live on a double lot.

1161
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:42,731
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, when I die, my beneficiaries are going to make a lot of money.

1162
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:49,034
[SPEAKER_26]: What's happening here is the developers coming in, seeing the opportunity, they're giving them market value.

1163
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:51,415
[SPEAKER_26]: and they're making the profit all for themselves.

1164
01:36:51,575 --> 01:36:56,736
[SPEAKER_26]: So the argument, I'm sorry to say, has some holes in it.

1165
01:36:56,796 --> 01:37:00,758
[SPEAKER_26]: The people who are benefiting are not really the people who are selling.

1166
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:15,522
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the developers who are coming in and taking advantage of those properties because they're able to identify them and they understand the non-conforming and variance rules and how to work with the ZBA and what to do with the Office of Community Development.

1167
01:37:15,902 --> 01:37:17,623
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not residents that are making that money.

1168
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:18,163
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1169
01:37:20,117 --> 01:37:20,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1170
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,401
[SPEAKER_27]: Name and address of the record again, please.

1171
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:24,661
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

1172
01:37:24,821 --> 01:37:26,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Ryan Hayward, 40 Sheridan Ave.

1173
01:37:26,983 --> 01:37:35,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Just to echo those previous comments on the buildings and the determination, the historical commission takes every application on a case by case basis.

1174
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:46,141
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, an applicant would really need to, you know, anybody would need to apply in order for a building to be determined eligible for this demo delay and then

1175
01:37:46,725 --> 01:37:50,649
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a two-step process to get to the actual invocation of the demo delay.

1176
01:37:50,789 --> 01:37:54,612
[SPEAKER_27]: So we would review the building for historic significance.

1177
01:37:54,652 --> 01:38:01,298
[SPEAKER_27]: We usually hire a consultant or we already have had forms, MHC, Massachusetts Historical Commission inventory forms.

1178
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:03,892
[SPEAKER_27]: prepared for each building in the city of Medford.

1179
01:38:03,932 --> 01:38:10,618
[SPEAKER_27]: Currently right now we're going through and preparing hundreds of forms for various neighborhoods across Medford.

1180
01:38:10,698 --> 01:38:17,584
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now we're working in East Medford where just FYI, there are 900 pre 1900 buildings in that neighborhood alone.

1181
01:38:17,604 --> 01:38:21,888
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the highest concentration of historic buildings anywhere in the city remaining.

1182
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:27,173
[SPEAKER_27]: So, um, once we get past the significant process, if we deem it significant per the bylaw,

1183
01:38:27,516 --> 01:38:32,357
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to determine whether it's preferably preserved in the interest of the city of Medford at large to save.

1184
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:36,098
[SPEAKER_27]: In a lot of cases, we have found that that is true.

1185
01:38:36,398 --> 01:38:38,359
[SPEAKER_27]: But in other cases, we have found that that's not true.

1186
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:41,759
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a higher threshold to achieve.

1187
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:46,240
[SPEAKER_27]: If we determine it's preferably preserved and significant, it invokes the demo delay.

1188
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:47,541
[SPEAKER_27]: It would be the exact same.

1189
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:50,702
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's a long process in order to get to that point.

1190
01:38:51,022 --> 01:38:53,622
[SPEAKER_27]: So every building is given fair review under the law.

1191
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:55,103
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1192
01:38:56,203 --> 01:38:56,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1193
01:38:59,598 --> 01:39:00,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1194
01:39:00,999 --> 01:39:19,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, after listening to the residents in the audience come up and speak and discussing at sidebar with some of my colleagues, I'd like to propose an 18-month demolition delay for all homes within the last 75 years by amending 48-78B, by striking 1900 and replacing that with the language within the past 75 years, by amending 48-78H, by striking

1195
01:39:27,608 --> 01:39:29,969
[SPEAKER_19]: the figure six months and replacing that with 18 months.

1196
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:37,053
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like to amend 48-78I2 by striking the figure six months and replacing that with the figure 18 months, Mr. President.

1197
01:39:38,494 --> 01:39:45,198
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposal that came out of the subcommittee gave the commission an opportunity to petition the council for an additional six months.

1198
01:39:46,519 --> 01:39:50,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that this is a paper based upon the sidebar conversations that I've had with my colleagues this evening.

1199
01:39:50,641 --> 01:39:54,183
[SPEAKER_19]: This is something we can support this evening and that we can pass this evening and we can put it through a first reading.

1200
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,867
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect such.

1201
01:39:58,728 --> 01:40:00,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you making that motion, Councilor Knight?

1202
01:40:00,489 --> 01:40:00,950
[SPEAKER_19]: I just did.

1203
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1204
01:40:04,312 --> 01:40:04,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1205
01:40:05,233 --> 01:40:05,833
Move for question.

1206
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:08,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Second on Councilor Knight's motion.

1207
01:40:10,076 --> 01:40:10,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mungo-Kern.

1208
01:40:11,537 --> 01:40:13,118
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1209
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:18,002
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to thank Councilor Knight and the rest of my colleagues for moving forward on this tonight.

1210
01:40:18,022 --> 01:40:21,444
[SPEAKER_30]: I heard loud and clear that the commission wants the 24 months

1211
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:35,640
[SPEAKER_30]: I understand maybe the votes aren't there, so I'm happy with the 18 months, but I do want to go on record as supporting the 24-month demo delay, as I think that is something that is going to give teeth to changing the ordinance.

1212
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:39,242
[SPEAKER_30]: I think 18 months is great, but I think 24 months would be better.

1213
01:40:39,502 --> 01:40:40,663
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to go on record.

1214
01:40:41,863 --> 01:40:42,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1215
01:40:44,365 --> 01:40:45,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

1216
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:48,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Cast and Eddie Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1217
01:40:50,728 --> 01:40:52,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm for historical preservation.

1218
01:40:53,988 --> 01:41:00,549
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, if I may tell you a short story, you might find it interesting, although most of the people behind me I'm sure know this story already.

1219
01:41:01,429 --> 01:41:19,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in 41 Mystic Avenue for 25 years in a three family, which was originally a single family, that was originally next to Gaffey's, Captain Isaac Hall's house.

1220
01:41:20,132 --> 01:41:22,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And they moved that house, I have no idea when,

1221
01:41:23,789 --> 01:41:28,553
[SPEAKER_02]: before I was born, where Governor Zav is today.

1222
01:41:29,134 --> 01:41:40,505
[SPEAKER_02]: They moved it, instead of destroying it, over 100 years ago, in order to make Governor Zav and you a reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, from what I understand.

1223
01:41:41,646 --> 01:41:45,149
[SPEAKER_02]: How they got it across the Karate Bridge, I have no idea.

1224
01:41:45,569 --> 01:41:46,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably explains why those

1225
01:41:49,884 --> 01:41:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: 200-year-old floors were sagging.

1226
01:41:52,245 --> 01:41:56,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The house was built in the 1750s, before Paul Revere.

1227
01:41:57,046 --> 01:42:00,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Revere went right by it before they broke up and that's where the house was.

1228
01:42:01,087 --> 01:42:06,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Isaac Hall had three sons, if I understand correctly, and I was the first of three sons.

1229
01:42:07,748 --> 01:42:10,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't get into the fact that they married three sisters from Cambridge.

1230
01:42:11,849 --> 01:42:18,131
[SPEAKER_02]: However, by the way, historical designation can be complicated, I'm sure.

1231
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:22,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's different entities that classify it, whatever strength of power they have.

1232
01:42:23,111 --> 01:42:23,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1233
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:32,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the federal, you have state, city, and I presume there's others, including possibly Middlesex County that I'm not aware of.

1234
01:42:32,734 --> 01:42:46,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But you should also consider the new growth as not anti-American, especially if we can fix up some blighted properties.

1235
01:42:49,600 --> 01:43:02,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as gentrification, as the lady had spoken earlier, I don't believe we would have much gentrification, even if real estate taxes, the real estate values, the prices, valuations went up drastically.

1236
01:43:04,627 --> 01:43:18,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't use that new growth from the new development to offset Prop 2.5 increases, then we will be pushed out, especially seniors on fixed income.

1237
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:21,173
[SPEAKER_02]: or zero income for the last 29 years.

1238
01:43:22,754 --> 01:43:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to volunteer a story from my childhood.

1239
01:43:25,595 --> 01:43:25,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1240
01:43:26,216 --> 01:43:26,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1241
01:43:26,796 --> 01:43:28,377
[SPEAKER_13]: And I saw you applauding here the other day.

1242
01:43:30,077 --> 01:43:31,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

1243
01:43:31,358 --> 01:43:32,939
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carvio.

1244
01:43:32,959 --> 01:43:43,844
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to move approval as amended, strike me 24, and added 18 month demo delay, if that's what the council so chooses, and move approval, roll call vote is requested.

1245
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

1246
01:43:46,463 --> 01:43:49,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And this will take its first reading this evening, where it is a noted exchange.

1247
01:43:49,186 --> 01:43:55,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1248
01:43:58,314 --> 01:44:04,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Procedurally, should we take the paper that's before the Committee of the Whole and report it out of Committee of the Whole?

1249
01:44:06,042 --> 01:44:08,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's a paper of similar subject matter.

1250
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:17,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Also nice, the council rules state that paper that met in subcommittee cannot be reported out of subcommittee until the committee of the whole meets and it's presented.

1251
01:44:18,029 --> 01:44:23,974
[SPEAKER_19]: So that paper would have to be presented to the committee of the whole in order to be reported out of the committee of the whole and reach the floor pursuant to our rules.

1252
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:27,437
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have Councilman Lungo's paper that's in front of us that we can amend.

1253
01:44:27,457 --> 01:44:31,780
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the theory that I was going with when I made the amendment to the piece of paper.

1254
01:44:35,472 --> 01:44:37,054
[SPEAKER_13]: What information, Councilor Dela Rosa?

1255
01:44:37,194 --> 01:44:53,629
[SPEAKER_16]: My assent to the paper before us was under the impression that it was a amendation of the original paper that was in subcommittee as presented and refined by Councilor Knight and presented to us at the sidebar tonight.

1256
01:44:56,522 --> 01:45:04,308
[SPEAKER_16]: which then I hope has taken over the substance in form of the resolution 17-371.

1257
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:06,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1258
01:45:07,751 --> 01:45:08,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1259
01:45:08,712 --> 01:45:10,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

1260
01:45:11,094 --> 01:45:13,015
[SPEAKER_11]: If the council's fine with that, I'm fine.

1261
01:45:13,035 --> 01:45:16,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1262
01:45:16,578 --> 01:45:20,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clegg, if you'd like to read it back so everybody understands what they're voting on.

1263
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:26,955
[SPEAKER_11]: put us, Michael, put us, Michael.

1264
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1265
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:31,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, okay.

1266
01:45:31,897 --> 01:45:39,942
[SPEAKER_15]: So the city of Medford revised ordinance article for section 48 be amended as follows.

1267
01:45:41,282 --> 01:45:49,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, section seven, section 77 definitions, uh, and the significant building

1268
01:45:52,137 --> 01:46:09,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Section, subsection three, we're gonna strike before 1900, and replace within, replace with, within previous 75 years.

1269
01:46:09,627 --> 01:46:10,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Within 75 years?

1270
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:17,811
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I have.

1271
01:46:24,848 --> 01:46:27,309
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1272
01:46:27,849 --> 01:46:29,729
[SPEAKER_30]: It should be 75 years or older.

1273
01:46:29,849 --> 01:46:30,649
[SPEAKER_30]: Right, correct.

1274
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:32,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

1275
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:34,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1276
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,830
[SPEAKER_11]: 75 years or older.

1277
01:46:36,471 --> 01:46:40,311
[SPEAKER_11]: If it says within, that means within now to 75 years.

1278
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:41,972
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1279
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:42,932
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're right.

1280
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:47,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would just be 75 years or older, correct?

1281
01:46:48,493 --> 01:46:48,893
[SPEAKER_13]: 75 years or older.

1282
01:46:48,913 --> 01:46:49,413
[SPEAKER_13]: 75 years or older.

1283
01:46:49,433 --> 01:46:49,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1284
01:46:49,613 --> 01:46:49,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1285
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:06,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Section 4878H.

1286
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:16,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to strike until at least six.

1287
01:47:18,041 --> 01:47:20,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Replace it with until at least 18.

1288
01:47:21,424 --> 01:47:22,785
[SPEAKER_15]: That's 18 months.

1289
01:47:28,048 --> 01:47:28,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Section 48-78I.2.

1290
01:47:35,342 --> 01:47:41,066
[SPEAKER_15]: strike at least six, replace with at least 18, 18 months.

1291
01:47:43,128 --> 01:47:44,028
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to add a new.

1292
01:47:47,811 --> 01:47:48,411
[SPEAKER_15]: No new section.

1293
01:47:48,431 --> 01:47:48,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1294
01:47:50,052 --> 01:47:50,353
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1295
01:47:50,773 --> 01:47:51,153
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1296
01:47:52,454 --> 01:47:56,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And does this require a, this requires a three reading, correct?

1297
01:47:56,957 --> 01:47:57,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to take three readings.

1298
01:47:57,998 --> 01:47:58,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1299
01:47:58,118 --> 01:47:58,699
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1300
01:47:58,799 --> 01:47:59,759
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by council,

1301
01:48:03,233 --> 01:48:05,494
[SPEAKER_13]: As amended, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1302
01:48:06,394 --> 01:48:07,194
[SPEAKER_13]: A roll call vote.

1303
01:48:07,594 --> 01:48:08,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this for the first reading or so?

1304
01:48:09,095 --> 01:48:10,175
[SPEAKER_13]: For the first reading.

1305
01:48:10,575 --> 01:48:12,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1306
01:48:14,457 --> 01:48:15,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRusso?

1307
01:48:15,637 --> 01:48:15,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1308
01:48:16,917 --> 01:48:17,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

1309
01:48:17,738 --> 01:48:17,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1310
01:48:18,718 --> 01:48:19,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

1311
01:48:19,438 --> 01:48:19,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1312
01:48:20,659 --> 01:48:21,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Long and Kern?

1313
01:48:21,499 --> 01:48:21,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1314
01:48:22,179 --> 01:48:22,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Marks?

1315
01:48:23,059 --> 01:48:23,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1316
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:24,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

1317
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:24,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1318
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:26,380
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caviello?

1319
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:26,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1320
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:30,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1321
01:48:30,782 --> 01:48:31,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1322
01:48:32,308 --> 01:48:34,811
[SPEAKER_13]: and it takes its first reading this evening.

1323
01:48:35,231 --> 01:48:41,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all my counselors for delivering this evening and getting this done.

1324
01:48:42,898 --> 01:48:46,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Langel Kern to revert back to regular business.

1325
01:48:51,086 --> 01:48:53,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo, all those in favor.

1326
01:48:54,470 --> 01:49:05,579
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-366 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the citywide street sweeping program be discussed.

1327
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox.

1328
01:49:08,882 --> 01:49:10,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1329
01:49:11,204 --> 01:49:21,892
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the midst of street sweeping, citywide street sweeping, and as I've mentioned in the past, Mr. President, it's

1330
01:49:23,912 --> 01:49:25,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe if we could have a recess until everyone leaves, Mr. President.

1331
01:49:27,003 --> 01:49:29,151
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could have a two-minute recess until the room clears out.

1332
01:55:53,013 --> 01:55:54,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Ladies and gentlemen in the back, we're ready to go.

1333
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:55,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1334
01:55:55,936 --> 01:56:02,181
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by Councilor De La Russo to revert back to regular business.

1335
01:56:04,823 --> 01:56:07,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by Councilor De La Russo to suspend the rules.

1336
01:56:07,964 --> 01:56:12,227
[SPEAKER_16]: The purpose of taking 17374 from the table, Mr. President.

1337
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:13,608
[SPEAKER_16]: He was already in the midst of his.

1338
01:56:14,488 --> 01:56:17,890
[SPEAKER_16]: My sincerest apologies then, I rescind my request.

1339
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:18,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1340
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:21,793
[SPEAKER_16]: And ask that the chairman reconvene the meeting.

1341
01:56:21,953 --> 01:56:22,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1342
01:56:24,074 --> 01:56:29,137
[SPEAKER_13]: The chairman will reconvene the meeting now, and Counselor Marks has the floor.

1343
01:56:29,157 --> 01:56:29,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1344
01:56:31,633 --> 01:56:32,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1345
01:56:33,654 --> 01:56:40,656
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned earlier, we are in the midst of a street-sweeping initiative that's going on currently right now.

1346
01:56:41,457 --> 01:56:53,121
[SPEAKER_11]: And as has been stated in the past by myself and many members of this council, that this particular program that we have right now is just a shell of a program.

1347
01:56:53,752 --> 01:56:57,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's existed that way for a number of years, Mr. President.

1348
01:56:57,816 --> 01:57:05,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why I bring this up is the fact that right now, in my opinion, the city is not giving proper notification to residents.

1349
01:57:06,679 --> 01:57:08,880
[SPEAKER_11]: regarding when street sweeping will take place.

1350
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:26,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I've recommended in the past, and will do so again tonight, that the city embark upon creating permanent signage indicating the date and time of sweeping on every road in the city, Mr. President, which provides residents with notification.

1351
01:57:26,923 --> 01:57:36,145
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows residents to know of a recurring patent of when streets will be swept, and it allows residents to plan ahead

1352
01:57:36,737 --> 01:57:37,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1353
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:44,286
[SPEAKER_11]: So permanent signage will accomplish the notification and the planning ahead of residence.

1354
01:57:44,890 --> 01:58:07,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Mr. President, as I've offered in the past, staggering parking on streets, whether it's odd or even parking during street sweeping, allows residents in those areas that are congested to, that don't have access to a driveway or to put their car somewhere, it'll allow them to park on one side of the street, similar to what we do in snow emergencies.

1355
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:14,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can sweep on one side and then on the other side, Mr. President, allowing residents

1356
01:58:15,321 --> 01:58:17,532
[SPEAKER_11]: ample opportunity to park their cars.

1357
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:20,051
[SPEAKER_11]: on either the odd or even side.

1358
01:58:20,471 --> 01:58:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask that this recommendation or these recommendations be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee for full recommendations on the creation of a street sweeping program.

1359
01:58:32,975 --> 01:58:42,998
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the first time I've asked that we take a long and hard look at how we operate and do business in this community, in particular regarding street sweeping.

1360
01:58:43,399 --> 01:58:47,160
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact we only sweep our streets twice a year

1361
01:58:48,401 --> 01:58:50,943
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, street sweeping accomplishes a number of things.

1362
01:58:51,403 --> 01:59:01,892
[SPEAKER_11]: It keeps our roads clean, but it also keeps the debris and clutter from going into our catch basins, which create flooding if they get filled up, Mr. President.

1363
01:59:02,232 --> 01:59:13,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a very important initiative that, for some reason, this city has been lax on creating an effective policy of notification and permanent signage.

1364
01:59:13,962 --> 01:59:16,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's long overdue, Mr. President,

1365
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:29,442
[SPEAKER_11]: If need be, if the city administration feels to act upon these recommendations, like they've done in the past, I would recommend that the city council, and in particular the Public Works Committee, create a city ordinance.

1366
01:59:30,323 --> 01:59:38,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it seems to me that the policy of street sweeping, which is created by the administration, is no longer effective in this community.

1367
01:59:38,465 --> 01:59:46,368
[SPEAKER_11]: When you see cars that are being tagged and towed, you know, and many of which do not receive

1368
01:59:46,788 --> 01:59:49,009
[SPEAKER_11]: the notification from the reverse 9-1-1.

1369
01:59:49,150 --> 02:00:03,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a shame, Mr. President, in this day and age, to hit residents up with a $175 bill before they even start their day off, if they're able to start their day off after their car gets towed.

1370
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:16,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee to review permanent signage with dates and times and a recurring

1371
02:00:16,611 --> 02:00:29,154
[SPEAKER_11]: patent on when our streets will be swept, and also to stagger the parking by aught even, allowing residents in congested areas to park on the streets during street sweeping.

1372
02:00:29,354 --> 02:00:30,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1373
02:00:30,174 --> 02:00:38,636
[SPEAKER_13]: The Public Works Subcommittee is headed by Councilor Knight, Vice President Marks, and Councilor Dela Russo.

1374
02:00:42,237 --> 02:00:42,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1375
02:00:44,053 --> 02:00:45,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Pelham.

1376
02:00:45,414 --> 02:00:46,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1377
02:00:46,295 --> 02:00:47,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1378
02:00:48,596 --> 02:01:00,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for clarity, Council Marks, we're looking to put an eight to 10 month program like neighbor communities have, a street sweeping program that runs daily.

1379
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:08,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1380
02:01:09,031 --> 02:01:10,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott probably brings up a great point.

1381
02:01:11,233 --> 02:01:14,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I would envision something starting in April, ending the end of December.

1382
02:01:15,876 --> 02:01:35,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I know our business districts probably should be swept probably on a daily basis, maybe the neighborhoods streets once a month based on the permanent signage, giving dates and times and so forth, and maybe, you know, staggering odd even, but definitely at least once a month from April to December in the neighborhoods.

1383
02:01:35,692 --> 02:01:36,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1384
02:01:36,253 --> 02:01:36,633
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could,

1385
02:01:37,128 --> 02:02:00,915
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, if you could allow me to make amendment to that paper and looking to ask the city administration for feasibility study, whether it's outsourcing or with hopes to provide what I would hope our DPW with the crew and machinery needed to perform that such act on that type of a basis.

1386
02:02:00,955 --> 02:02:05,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd love to see more in depth numbers and

1387
02:02:06,395 --> 02:02:08,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that I would love to see in our community.

1388
02:02:08,796 --> 02:02:09,796
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you.

1389
02:02:10,636 --> 02:02:11,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1390
02:02:12,517 --> 02:02:13,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1391
02:02:13,517 --> 02:02:14,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1392
02:02:14,297 --> 02:02:16,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Lomax for bringing this forward.

1393
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:18,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great resolution.

1394
02:02:18,178 --> 02:02:19,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

1395
02:02:21,179 --> 02:02:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I've received many phone calls when I bump into people in the streets.

1396
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:29,621
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will talk about the cleanliness of the roads in the city.

1397
02:02:30,241 --> 02:02:32,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that needs to be addressed.

1398
02:02:33,213 --> 02:02:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, Councilor Marks, you do bring up a good point.

1399
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:38,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this is something that should probably be in a city ordinance.

1400
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:46,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this does, I think, hold the city's feet to the fire and says, hey, you know what, this needs to be done X amount of times a year.

1401
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:49,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, two times a year right now to me is just not acceptable.

1402
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people pay their taxes here.

1403
02:02:51,681 --> 02:02:54,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They deserve to have clean streets and a clean city.

1404
02:02:54,742 --> 02:03:00,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think right now, you know, you go, you drive down many of the streets and, you know, there's debris all over the place, you know, with regard to, you know,

1405
02:03:01,132 --> 02:03:05,794
[SPEAKER_03]: sand, salt, rocks from the road being torn up after the winter.

1406
02:03:06,434 --> 02:03:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, these things need to be addressed.

1407
02:03:12,857 --> 02:03:14,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't even a bad winter.

1408
02:03:14,657 --> 02:03:18,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have a really bad winter, the street can be a real mess.

1409
02:03:18,559 --> 02:03:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I think I definitely would favor this to be in a city ordinance.

1410
02:03:26,422 --> 02:03:28,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the way we need to go long term.

1411
02:03:30,401 --> 02:03:39,124
[SPEAKER_03]: DPW subcommittee, I think that's fine, but I think we need to also look at this, you know, on the ordinance subcommittee as well.

1412
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:40,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Fasco.

1413
02:03:40,945 --> 02:03:41,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1414
02:03:42,046 --> 02:03:43,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1415
02:03:43,286 --> 02:03:47,668
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a topic that's not new to anybody behind this rail, especially during this time of year.

1416
02:03:48,268 --> 02:03:54,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the items that I see in terms of street sweeping in general that's lacking in the community is our public utilities.

1417
02:03:54,931 --> 02:03:58,592
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we issue permits to our public utilities to tear up our streets and they do it,

1418
02:03:59,235 --> 02:04:02,356
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they decide to come back whenever they feel like coming back to repair our streets.

1419
02:04:02,916 --> 02:04:08,358
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they leave the streets still looking in an awful situation, an awful mess with sand, with gravel, with dirt all over the place.

1420
02:04:09,759 --> 02:04:16,361
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't believe that public utilities are required as part of the permitting process when they open up our streets to perform a sweep when they're done.

1421
02:04:16,902 --> 02:04:18,822
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that that's something that we should also look at.

1422
02:04:18,842 --> 02:04:20,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect that.

1423
02:04:21,897 --> 02:04:32,461
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd also, as the chairman of the DPW subcommittee, would request that any of my colleagues behind this rail send out an email to the members of the subcommittee with any suggestions that they'd like to see, and we can get to the table and discuss these issues.

1424
02:04:33,161 --> 02:04:34,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

1425
02:04:35,242 --> 02:04:36,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor De La Russa.

1426
02:04:36,782 --> 02:04:41,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I am grateful to have this opportunity to work on this in a concrete way.

1427
02:04:42,084 --> 02:04:46,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the subcommittee will get things done, certainly under the leadership of Councillor Knight.

1428
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:51,047
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to point out, though, that I think it is fairly

1429
02:04:51,615 --> 02:05:06,424
[SPEAKER_16]: almost nightly, maybe every other night, I should say at four in the morning, as I am awakened every time it happens at four in the morning by our dear friends from the Street Sweeper who come by as I live adjacent to a business district.

1430
02:05:07,945 --> 02:05:16,190
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the beautiful sound of the humming of the engine, the whining of the transmission, and the scuffing of the

1431
02:05:16,868 --> 02:05:18,930
[SPEAKER_16]: the brushes that get our streets clean.

1432
02:05:20,151 --> 02:05:22,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of the main streets are done on a daily basis.

1433
02:05:22,834 --> 02:05:23,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1434
02:05:24,236 --> 02:05:29,341
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can continue to work on this and I think the idea of an ordinance is a good idea.

1435
02:05:29,361 --> 02:05:30,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1436
02:05:30,322 --> 02:05:31,283
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a good idea.

1437
02:05:34,166 --> 02:05:35,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record please.

1438
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:37,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1439
02:05:37,131 --> 02:05:38,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1440
02:05:38,592 --> 02:05:40,874
[SPEAKER_12]: My street is designated as a main artery.

1441
02:05:41,595 --> 02:05:48,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th.

1442
02:05:49,922 --> 02:05:56,167
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries, because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement.

1443
02:05:56,408 --> 02:05:59,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I, like Councillor Dela Rousseau, get the

1444
02:05:59,838 --> 02:06:00,539
[SPEAKER_12]: 1 to 2 a.m.

1445
02:06:00,579 --> 02:06:04,042
[SPEAKER_12]: wake-up call, now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night.

1446
02:06:04,622 --> 02:06:11,428
[SPEAKER_12]: But I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car.

1447
02:06:11,488 --> 02:06:18,813
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned, and my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road.

1448
02:06:19,534 --> 02:06:24,336
[SPEAKER_12]: broken glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house.

1449
02:06:24,976 --> 02:06:26,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's important as well.

1450
02:06:26,876 --> 02:06:37,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets.

1451
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:40,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well.

1452
02:06:40,642 --> 02:06:44,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work.

1453
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:48,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation.

1454
02:06:49,049 --> 02:06:58,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Because even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says, move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening.

1455
02:06:58,457 --> 02:06:59,958
[SPEAKER_12]: The street cleaners are just going around them.

1456
02:07:00,539 --> 02:07:03,001
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's not really useful for us.

1457
02:07:03,401 --> 02:07:05,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I do hope that it will do more street cleaning.

1458
02:07:05,263 --> 02:07:06,664
[SPEAKER_12]: My father lives on Garfield Avenue.

1459
02:07:07,045 --> 02:07:10,607
[SPEAKER_12]: and he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning.

1460
02:07:11,047 --> 02:07:11,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1461
02:07:13,229 --> 02:07:28,738
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by councilor marks as amended by councilor night, seconded by, and as amended by councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by councilor Longo Kern.

1462
02:07:31,839 --> 02:07:36,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And this, uh, to send this to the public,

1463
02:07:37,035 --> 02:07:38,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Public Works Subcommittee.

1464
02:07:39,336 --> 02:07:39,996
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1465
02:07:40,016 --> 02:07:40,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1466
02:07:41,137 --> 02:07:41,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1467
02:07:43,118 --> 02:07:43,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1468
02:07:44,619 --> 02:07:51,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to suspend the rules so we can have Roberta Cameron come up.

1469
02:07:51,822 --> 02:07:58,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I know she was a little bit late to speak on the Community Preservation Act.

1470
02:07:58,425 --> 02:07:59,066
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1471
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:00,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1472
02:08:01,407 --> 02:08:03,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1473
02:08:03,588 --> 02:08:03,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1474
02:08:05,793 --> 02:08:06,454
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

1475
02:08:06,474 --> 02:08:07,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1476
02:08:07,735 --> 02:08:09,636
[SPEAKER_29]: Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1477
02:08:10,297 --> 02:08:11,177
[SPEAKER_29]: My apologies.

1478
02:08:11,238 --> 02:08:14,200
[SPEAKER_29]: I was double booked tonight and I didn't realize how late they would keep me.

1479
02:08:16,122 --> 02:08:30,934
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, so, um, I, I think you all know me, uh, my familiarity with community preservation and I sincerely look forward to having the opportunity to help the city of Medford build this, um,

1480
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:42,737
[SPEAKER_29]: this program with the Community Preservation Act and see and understand what our needs are and how we can use these resources to carry out our community goals.

1481
02:08:44,598 --> 02:08:44,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1482
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:45,518
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1483
02:08:47,038 --> 02:08:48,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Neistat.

1484
02:08:48,118 --> 02:08:49,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1485
02:08:49,879 --> 02:09:01,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I first met Roberta when she asked me for a signature on the Preserve Medford petition and since that time I've had the opportunity to work with her through the passage of the Act and now the passage of the

1486
02:09:02,085 --> 02:09:03,286
[SPEAKER_19]: community preservation commission.

1487
02:09:03,766 --> 02:09:08,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, she was a member of the ad hoc subcommittee, um, that put together the language for our city ordinance.

1488
02:09:08,891 --> 02:09:17,178
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, if we take a look at miss Cameron's resume and credentials and contrast that with the city ordinance, you'll see that, uh, she meets all the criteria that has been outlined.

1489
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:24,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, she has a great wealth of experience and technical assistance and, uh, implementing the community preservation act and other communities.

1490
02:09:24,805 --> 02:09:28,468
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, it was really a pleasure working with her and other members of the committee to get this thing passed.

1491
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:35,273
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is really the final step that the City Council has this evening, Mr. President, in our involvement with the creation of the ordinance.

1492
02:09:36,473 --> 02:09:38,494
[SPEAKER_19]: We appoint the last member of the committee.

1493
02:09:38,514 --> 02:09:47,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully she gets approved this evening, and then they get to work on putting proposals together to give to us to decide whether or not they're things that we feel as though should be funded.

1494
02:09:48,416 --> 02:09:56,457
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that being said, it's with great pleasure that I wholeheartedly endorse Roberta's candidacy and move for approval on the paper number one.

1495
02:09:56,830 --> 02:10:03,035
[SPEAKER_19]: And number two, it's with great excitement that I'm glad to see the commission finally together, up, and hopefully soon to be running.

1496
02:10:03,716 --> 02:10:06,138
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to point out, your colleagues waited as long as they could for you.

1497
02:10:06,899 --> 02:10:08,760
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm on the committee, and they had to leave.

1498
02:10:09,341 --> 02:10:13,624
[SPEAKER_19]: But I will, for one, Mr. President, have no problem supporting Roberta Cameron for an appointment this evening.

1499
02:10:14,165 --> 02:10:14,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1500
02:10:14,465 --> 02:10:15,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1501
02:10:15,366 --> 02:10:16,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Del Rosso.

1502
02:10:16,146 --> 02:10:20,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I, too, endorse the candidacy of Roberta.

1503
02:10:21,551 --> 02:10:23,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I laud her for her leadership in this matter.

1504
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:27,141
[SPEAKER_16]: and her commitment to our community and other matters.

1505
02:10:27,922 --> 02:10:37,766
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also particularly point out her patience and willingness to work with people who might not see things the way that she does.

1506
02:10:38,487 --> 02:10:42,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's offered great leadership, and I'd like to second her approval.

1507
02:10:42,809 --> 02:10:43,389
[SPEAKER_16]: The President Thank you.

1508
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:44,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1509
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco Thank you, Mr. President.

1510
02:10:46,410 --> 02:10:49,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to also endorse Roberta Cameron tonight.

1511
02:10:50,992 --> 02:10:53,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on the ad hoc subcommittee with Roberta.

1512
02:10:53,454 --> 02:10:54,234
[SPEAKER_03]: She was absolutely

1513
02:10:54,627 --> 02:10:56,388
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumental in developing the ordinance.

1514
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:57,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're a hard worker.

1515
02:10:57,629 --> 02:10:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're going to do a great job, so I just want to say good luck.

1516
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1517
02:11:00,051 --> 02:11:01,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1518
02:11:01,612 --> 02:11:02,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1519
02:11:03,393 --> 02:11:04,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1520
02:11:04,714 --> 02:11:07,296
[SPEAKER_11]: As Roberta mentioned, she's well known in the community.

1521
02:11:08,236 --> 02:11:15,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta has been an advocate for a lot of different issues, in particular our shade trees and our trees throughout the community.

1522
02:11:15,761 --> 02:11:18,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta has been a real strong advocate.

1523
02:11:18,763 --> 02:11:24,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, based on the makeup of this committee,

1524
02:11:24,763 --> 02:11:42,437
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a project manager, we have someone that works in real estate, we have someone that has a particular interest in historic preservation, and with Roberta's credentials, this is going to be a very dynamic committee, and I look forward to their eventual recommendations, Mr. President.

1525
02:11:42,977 --> 02:11:43,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1526
02:11:44,278 --> 02:11:45,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Longo-Kern.

1527
02:11:45,919 --> 02:11:47,321
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Caviello.

1528
02:11:47,341 --> 02:11:49,682
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

1529
02:11:49,762 --> 02:11:51,684
[SPEAKER_30]: I've known Roberta for a long time, and she's

1530
02:11:52,435 --> 02:11:55,657
[SPEAKER_30]: pushed for a lot of good things in this city, and I know she's going to do a great job.

1531
02:11:55,757 --> 02:11:57,318
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for your willingness to serve.

1532
02:11:58,118 --> 02:11:59,339
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's just important.

1533
02:11:59,819 --> 02:12:04,382
[SPEAKER_30]: I pushed my button because I think it was important to point out what Council Marks did and your background.

1534
02:12:04,402 --> 02:12:09,645
[SPEAKER_30]: You have a planning background, which is extremely important and going to be instrumental on this committee.

1535
02:12:10,386 --> 02:12:19,331
[SPEAKER_30]: I did ask the other committee members if you could just keep us in the loop and obviously maybe forward us minutes of meetings, just so we know what's going on and what's coming down the line.

1536
02:12:19,371 --> 02:12:20,212
[SPEAKER_30]: That would be appreciated.

1537
02:12:20,232 --> 02:12:21,112
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a good idea.

1538
02:12:21,633 --> 02:12:21,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1539
02:12:22,773 --> 02:12:23,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1540
02:12:24,274 --> 02:12:25,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'm sure I've apologized.

1541
02:12:25,695 --> 02:12:26,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to step out for a moment.

1542
02:12:26,735 --> 02:12:32,379
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know how tenacious Roberta was to have this issue come to fruition.

1543
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:41,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And with your background and your expertise, I know how vital you were as we put the program in place.

1544
02:12:41,764 --> 02:12:45,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So I echo my colleagues' comments.

1545
02:12:45,407 --> 02:12:51,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very excited to see you as part of this program, to see where we're going to go with this great initiative.

1546
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:52,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1547
02:12:52,962 --> 02:12:53,302
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1548
02:12:55,543 --> 02:12:55,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1549
02:12:56,043 --> 02:13:00,984
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, too, wanted to thank Roberta for being up front on many issues in this community.

1550
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:05,645
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for all the work you do here.

1551
02:13:06,805 --> 02:13:10,126
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

1552
02:13:10,846 --> 02:13:13,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1553
02:13:14,707 --> 02:13:15,067
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry?

1554
02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:17,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the gentleman back who would like to speak.

1555
02:13:18,008 --> 02:13:19,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record.

1556
02:13:19,848 --> 02:13:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1557
02:13:21,089 --> 02:13:22,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street,

1558
02:13:23,952 --> 02:13:30,916
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, through the Chair, I understand this is, she's part of the Community Preservation Commission.

1559
02:13:31,057 --> 02:13:34,399
[SPEAKER_13]: We are approving her nomination by the, yes.

1560
02:13:35,059 --> 02:13:42,584
[SPEAKER_04]: In vetting her out, I think it would be prudent to ask the question, exactly how does this commission work?

1561
02:13:42,664 --> 02:13:53,210
[SPEAKER_04]: From my understanding in reading the law is that they get to decide how the funds are spent, but people from the citizenry can also solicit

1562
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:56,710
[SPEAKER_04]: the Community Preservation Commission for funds.

1563
02:13:56,771 --> 02:13:59,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Councilor Knight, you will help me.

1564
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:09,973
[SPEAKER_19]: The city's ordinance is rather specific and detailed in terms of the procedure and the processes that take place and how an applicant can move forward and request whether or not they have a funding opportunity.

1565
02:14:09,993 --> 02:14:13,573
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are also certain restrictions that are placed around who would be a qualified and eligible applicant.

1566
02:14:13,893 --> 02:14:14,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1567
02:14:14,294 --> 02:14:14,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1568
02:14:15,394 --> 02:14:17,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure Roberta is very open to anything.

1569
02:14:17,594 --> 02:14:21,595
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have an idea, give her a call and she'd be happy to listen.

1570
02:14:22,215 --> 02:14:22,695
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion.

1571
02:14:25,515 --> 02:14:28,196
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Layton, seconded by Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1572
02:14:28,256 --> 02:14:28,816
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1573
02:14:28,836 --> 02:14:29,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1574
02:14:29,976 --> 02:14:30,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, thank you very much.

1575
02:14:36,818 --> 02:14:37,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1576
02:14:37,998 --> 02:14:53,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, while we're on to suspension, I respectfully request that we take out of order paper 17-374, communications from the mayor regarding the expenditure of monies from free cash

1577
02:14:54,516 --> 02:14:56,457
[SPEAKER_16]: for the updating of our election equipment.

1578
02:14:56,917 --> 02:15:06,481
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso to take paper 17-374 out of order under suspension, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1579
02:15:06,822 --> 02:15:07,442
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1580
02:15:07,462 --> 02:15:07,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1581
02:15:08,362 --> 02:15:08,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1582
02:15:09,043 --> 02:15:14,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if I could speak on your behalf, we met in committee of the whole.

1583
02:15:14,185 --> 02:15:15,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1584
02:15:16,286 --> 02:15:20,788
[SPEAKER_16]: To have a presentation from the city clerk

1585
02:15:21,452 --> 02:15:27,534
[SPEAKER_16]: regarding the condition of some of our election equipment and our need to replace it.

1586
02:15:28,014 --> 02:15:33,275
[SPEAKER_16]: That the equipment has become rather old, over 20 years old.

1587
02:15:34,075 --> 02:15:42,658
[SPEAKER_16]: It's difficult to find replacement parts and backup support for the machines, which were once cutting edge.

1588
02:15:44,423 --> 02:16:01,593
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're on the verge of the clerk, with approval of this, and the commitment to free cash, will assist the process of sending out an RFP and the purchase and examination of some options.

1589
02:16:02,173 --> 02:16:08,817
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we had a detailed discussion in the Committee of the Whole, and it was reported out favorably.

1590
02:16:09,177 --> 02:16:11,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

1591
02:16:12,982 --> 02:16:13,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1592
02:16:13,382 --> 02:16:17,626
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1593
02:16:18,887 --> 02:16:19,888
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1594
02:16:21,469 --> 02:16:22,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox.

1595
02:16:24,472 --> 02:16:25,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1596
02:16:25,953 --> 02:16:28,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not opposed to this particular paper.

1597
02:16:29,036 --> 02:16:40,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's long overdue to have equipment in the Registrar of Voters Office as well on Election Day that properly reflects the will of the people

1598
02:16:41,424 --> 02:16:42,985
[SPEAKER_11]: and I think equipment is needed.

1599
02:16:43,585 --> 02:17:07,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, Mr. President, have to say that this council has voted unanimously on at least three different occasions requesting that our brave men and women of the fire department receive the two extractors, which are washing machines on steroids, Mr. President, and two dryers to clean their turnout gear.

1600
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:34,847
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned several weeks ago when I made a presentation before this council that was unanimously supported, I requested that the administration look into buying two more washes because currently right now, many of the brave men and women of our fire department are using turnout gear that is potentially in a fire and contaminates on the turnout gear that's leeching into our firefighters' skins, Mr. President.

1601
02:17:35,463 --> 02:17:40,228
[SPEAKER_11]: and could be causing risk of cancer.

1602
02:17:40,888 --> 02:17:43,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've asked this on several occasions.

1603
02:17:43,691 --> 02:17:46,353
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration said that they were looking into grants.

1604
02:17:46,894 --> 02:17:53,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I did talk to Bill O'Brien, the union president, and he mentioned they are pursuing a grant.

1605
02:17:53,667 --> 02:18:02,472
[SPEAKER_11]: right now for two washes and two dries that will be located at the firefighter headquarters on Main Street.

1606
02:18:03,732 --> 02:18:06,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the grant comes through, fine, Mr. President.

1607
02:18:07,654 --> 02:18:11,196
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing that precludes this council from allotting $29,700.

1608
02:18:11,496 --> 02:18:22,182
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it's going to take to assure our men and women in the fire department have the proper equipment to wash their gear, Mr. President.

1609
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:24,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it's gonna take, $29,700.

1610
02:18:25,344 --> 02:18:33,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the grant comes through, Mr. President, that grant will pay back the money that was taken out of the free cash.

1611
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:50,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, as part of this paper, there'd be a B paper requesting that the mayor appropriate $29,700 to pay for two washing machines, which are two extractors and two dryers, Mr. President.

1612
02:18:51,602 --> 02:18:56,485
[SPEAKER_11]: for the fire department, which has been unanimously supported by this council.

1613
02:18:57,646 --> 02:19:09,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that as a big paper, as part of this paper, Mr. President may also point out that it was, uh, uh, reported to us that these new

1614
02:19:09,813 --> 02:19:11,374
[SPEAKER_16]: polling machines, Mr. President.

1615
02:19:11,434 --> 02:19:24,761
[SPEAKER_16]: These new election machines will not be subject to undue interference from foreign powers, whether they be Eastern European or Asian or anywhere else.

1616
02:19:25,662 --> 02:19:27,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

1617
02:19:29,844 --> 02:19:37,789
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, as amended by Councilor Max,

1618
02:19:40,445 --> 02:19:49,409
[SPEAKER_13]: The $29,700 be appropriated from free cash for the purpose of two washes and two dryers.

1619
02:19:49,929 --> 02:19:51,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1620
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:55,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1621
02:19:55,332 --> 02:19:57,053
[SPEAKER_23]: I commend Councilor Marks.

1622
02:19:57,233 --> 02:19:57,613
[SPEAKER_23]: Excellent.

1623
02:19:57,753 --> 02:20:02,615
[SPEAKER_23]: I love seeing good, important, tangible items brought to the table.

1624
02:20:03,375 --> 02:20:07,857
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight in Georgia, there's an election and four of the machines, four of the machines are down.

1625
02:20:07,878 --> 02:20:08,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Now the good guy's winning.

1626
02:20:09,443 --> 02:20:16,791
[SPEAKER_23]: The Democrat, that's my political speech there, but he's winning by a huge margin, but there's four machines and that really concerns me.

1627
02:20:16,851 --> 02:20:20,295
[SPEAKER_23]: So new election machines, yes, we need them.

1628
02:20:20,796 --> 02:20:24,560
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we need an outside agency to come in.

1629
02:20:25,056 --> 02:20:28,858
[SPEAKER_23]: and look at this, because the citizens don't know what we're doing when we vote.

1630
02:20:29,338 --> 02:20:30,259
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't know where it goes.

1631
02:20:30,279 --> 02:20:31,299
[SPEAKER_23]: It can go into the ether.

1632
02:20:31,379 --> 02:20:37,782
[SPEAKER_23]: So I know there's partisan people here in city government, and we want to make sure that everything's done correctly.

1633
02:20:38,222 --> 02:20:40,924
[SPEAKER_23]: So there was a lot of questions about the last election.

1634
02:20:41,724 --> 02:20:44,225
[SPEAKER_23]: The citizens need to know which kind of machines are coming in.

1635
02:20:44,625 --> 02:20:49,088
[SPEAKER_23]: We need an outside agency looking at them so that every citizen knows that their vote counts.

1636
02:20:49,628 --> 02:20:50,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1637
02:20:50,948 --> 02:20:51,289
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1638
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:53,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Nice.

1639
02:20:54,957 --> 02:20:57,218
[SPEAKER_19]: On that note, Mr. President, I would like to commend the work that Ms.

1640
02:20:57,258 --> 02:21:00,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Murray, Mr. Lasky, and Mr. Wade do, our elections commissioners.

1641
02:21:00,998 --> 02:21:02,219
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they're doing a great job.

1642
02:21:02,319 --> 02:21:03,099
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great to see them.

1643
02:21:03,119 --> 02:21:04,259
[SPEAKER_13]: They were very good outside boarding.

1644
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,420
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great to see them before the council this evening.

1645
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:10,600
[SPEAKER_19]: It's something that we haven't seen too much of in the past, the full boarding, the full board coming before us this evening.

1646
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:12,701
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to thank them for the work that they do.

1647
02:21:12,741 --> 02:21:14,221
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulate them and move approval on the paper.

1648
02:21:14,621 --> 02:21:15,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Outstanding boarding.

1649
02:21:16,522 --> 02:21:22,223
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, as amended by Councilor Marks,

1650
02:21:23,905 --> 02:21:27,028
[SPEAKER_13]: seconded by Councilor Knight.

1651
02:21:29,050 --> 02:21:30,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1652
02:21:32,874 --> 02:21:33,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRosso?

1653
02:21:34,115 --> 02:21:34,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1654
02:21:35,076 --> 02:21:35,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco?

1655
02:21:35,997 --> 02:21:36,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1656
02:21:36,918 --> 02:21:37,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Night?

1657
02:21:37,558 --> 02:21:37,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1658
02:21:38,519 --> 02:21:39,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Long-Term?

1659
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:39,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1660
02:21:40,661 --> 02:21:41,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Marks?

1661
02:21:41,582 --> 02:21:42,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1662
02:21:42,864 --> 02:21:43,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1663
02:21:43,784 --> 02:21:44,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1664
02:21:45,702 --> 02:21:47,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1665
02:21:48,483 --> 02:21:49,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1666
02:21:50,023 --> 02:21:54,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Donnarusso to revert back to regular business.

1667
02:21:55,305 --> 02:21:56,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1668
02:21:57,365 --> 02:22:01,046
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1669
02:22:01,066 --> 02:22:13,530
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-367, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the new bimonthly fixed charge, also known as connectivity charge, for Memphis water and sewer rates

1670
02:22:15,273 --> 02:22:16,354
[SPEAKER_13]: be discussed.

1671
02:22:17,114 --> 02:22:18,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks.

1672
02:22:18,835 --> 02:22:19,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1673
02:22:20,315 --> 02:22:24,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke about this issue, I believe it was last week or the week?

1674
02:22:25,197 --> 02:22:25,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week.

1675
02:22:25,558 --> 02:22:25,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week.

1676
02:22:25,758 --> 02:22:26,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1677
02:22:27,278 --> 02:22:31,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And this council voted to set up a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1678
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:32,501
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

1679
02:22:32,541 --> 02:22:34,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I believe is going to take place May 2nd.

1680
02:22:34,741 --> 02:22:35,242
[SPEAKER_11]: May 2nd.

1681
02:22:35,562 --> 02:22:36,102
[SPEAKER_11]: May 2nd.

1682
02:22:36,142 --> 02:22:38,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank you for your quick response on that.

1683
02:22:38,733 --> 02:22:48,038
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a really important issue that's impacting every resident in this community that pays a water and sewer bill.

1684
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:53,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I received additional information, and that's why I'm bringing it up tonight.

1685
02:22:53,621 --> 02:23:01,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I received a letter dated November 17, 2015, regarding Meffitt Water and Sewer Commissioners.

1686
02:23:02,025 --> 02:23:07,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And the letter goes on to state, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commissioners

1687
02:23:08,578 --> 02:23:16,740
[SPEAKER_11]: voted to create what they refer to as a baseline charge on everyone's water and sewer bill.

1688
02:23:17,521 --> 02:23:23,622
[SPEAKER_11]: When I read on, Mr. President, they refer to it as, which I referred to it last week, as a connectivity charge.

1689
02:23:24,563 --> 02:23:33,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way I understand it is every resident will receive this additional charge on a bimonthly basis starting in August 1st, 2018.

1690
02:23:37,672 --> 02:23:50,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason that I got for the implementation of this connectivity charge is that it will pay for infrastructure improvements and other water and sewer necessities.

1691
02:23:51,728 --> 02:23:57,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know right now there's over $8 million in the water and sewer enterprise account in surplus funds.

1692
02:23:58,516 --> 02:24:07,541
[SPEAKER_11]: And that money, by state law, is earmarked to not only reduce the rate, if need be, but also for infrastructure improvements.

1693
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:15,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can only be spent on infrastructure improvements or reduction in water and sewer rates.

1694
02:24:15,845 --> 02:24:23,369
[SPEAKER_11]: And this particular charge, in my opinion, is nothing more than an additional surcharge on the ratepayers of this community.

1695
02:24:23,989 --> 02:24:25,990
[SPEAKER_11]: And the additional information I did receive

1696
02:24:26,738 --> 02:24:40,639
[SPEAKER_11]: and I can let my colleagues see it or I can make a copy for May 2nd, is that they actually went as far as breaking down the additional charge by the size of the water pipe that comes into your house.

1697
02:24:41,702 --> 02:24:50,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And most people in this community, in the residential areas, have a five-eighths pipe that comes into the house.

1698
02:24:50,588 --> 02:25:03,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And that additional connectivity charge will be $9.47 bi-monthly, which is six times, so it's roughly $60 additional a year.

1699
02:25:03,638 --> 02:25:09,982
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not sound like a lot, but you know what, when you have an $8 million surplus of ratepayer money,

1700
02:25:10,466 --> 02:25:17,237
[SPEAKER_11]: sitting in an account, that's a lot of money to additionally request, Mr. President, and also requested based on...

1701
02:25:19,144 --> 02:25:25,748
[SPEAKER_11]: based on the fact that it's for infrastructure improvements, and that's the money we're already collecting, and we already have a surplus.

1702
02:25:26,228 --> 02:25:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: As part of the bill we currently pay right now, it goes to your water, it goes to delivery, it goes for the maintenance of the pipes, it goes for the workers within the city of Meffitt that are in the water and sewer department.

1703
02:25:38,895 --> 02:25:41,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's already built into the rate structure.

1704
02:25:41,577 --> 02:25:46,560
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an added cost that I am adamantly opposed to, Mr. President.

1705
02:25:47,841 --> 02:26:14,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to say, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commission would take a vote or be presented with a proposal in November of 2015, and then the city administration sit on it, not till last year when we had a mayor race, they didn't touch it then, not this year,

1706
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:19,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, last year was an off year.

1707
02:26:20,182 --> 02:26:28,725
[SPEAKER_11]: To not sit on it during the mayor race, which was in 2015, sit on it in 2016, the first term of the new mayor.

1708
02:26:29,225 --> 02:26:30,766
[SPEAKER_11]: No, didn't want any increases then. 2017,

1709
02:26:33,555 --> 02:26:36,236
[SPEAKER_11]: New May is up for reelection, let's sit on it again.

1710
02:26:36,256 --> 02:26:39,477
[SPEAKER_11]: 2018 sounds like a great time.

1711
02:26:39,777 --> 02:26:45,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it in August of 2018 when everyone's vacationing and not paying attention.

1712
02:26:45,379 --> 02:26:51,861
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a great time to implement something almost three years after the fact, Mr. President.

1713
02:26:52,541 --> 02:26:58,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I really would like to hear from the administration to explain why this is being rolled out in August of 2018.

1714
02:27:00,143 --> 02:27:01,464
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the reasoning behind it?

1715
02:27:02,144 --> 02:27:08,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Mr. President, you know, I mentioned $60, and people at home may say, ah, $60, that's not too much.

1716
02:27:09,667 --> 02:27:15,989
[SPEAKER_11]: That's $1.5 million they're going to raise from roughly a $60 surcharge.

1717
02:27:16,589 --> 02:27:20,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, not everyone has a 5-8 pipe coming into their home.

1718
02:27:20,831 --> 02:27:25,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We have condos associations that may have an inch pipe, a two-inch pipe.

1719
02:27:25,993 --> 02:27:27,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Their bill will be $75 bimonthly.

1720
02:27:31,714 --> 02:27:37,257
[SPEAKER_11]: You go up further to some of the larger corporations in our city that may have a six or 10-inch pipe.

1721
02:27:37,837 --> 02:27:43,639
[SPEAKER_11]: A 10-inch pipe, Mr. President, coming in, that's $1,087 bimonthly.

1722
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:47,421
[SPEAKER_11]: That's $6,000 additional charge.

1723
02:27:48,162 --> 02:27:51,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I don't know what businesses or how many have a 10-inch pipe.

1724
02:27:52,145 --> 02:27:55,007
[SPEAKER_11]: or a six-inch water pipe, which is $472.

1725
02:27:56,107 --> 02:28:00,570
[SPEAKER_11]: But all I can tell you, Mr. President, there's nothing worse than a hidden charge.

1726
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:08,494
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've been paying for the last three or four years a franchise fee to get local access cable.

1727
02:28:09,475 --> 02:28:16,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Local access cable, Mr. President, we've all been paying, and we haven't received local access cable in almost four years.

1728
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:20,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And I stand to be corrected, it may even be longer than that.

1729
02:28:21,853 --> 02:28:26,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So all these little additional fees that are out there, Mr. President, do add up.

1730
02:28:26,876 --> 02:28:36,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Do add up to the senior citizens on a fixed income that can't afford an additional penny on their bill, let alone another $60 for a charge, Mr. President.

1731
02:28:36,962 --> 02:28:38,063
[SPEAKER_11]: They're already charging us.

1732
02:28:38,783 --> 02:28:43,826
[SPEAKER_11]: You already have $8 million of the taxpayers' money, Mr. President, in an account.

1733
02:28:44,387 --> 02:28:45,387
[SPEAKER_11]: What more do you want?

1734
02:28:46,188 --> 02:28:47,849
[SPEAKER_11]: What more do you want from the ratepayers?

1735
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:49,854
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy picking.

1736
02:28:50,235 --> 02:28:50,837
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

1737
02:28:50,917 --> 02:28:52,644
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy picking, Mr. President.

1738
02:28:53,567 --> 02:29:08,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that when we meet with the Water and Sewer Commission on May 2nd, that the administration is also represented, and also that Ron Baker, which I mentioned, I'm not sure if you added him to the list.

1739
02:29:09,091 --> 02:29:09,631
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on the list.

1740
02:29:09,971 --> 02:29:23,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Is on the list, so we can have a thorough explanation on, not only from the Water and Sewer Commission, it's from the city administration, who's been sitting on this for several years now, for the opportune time to present it when no one's paying attention.

1741
02:29:23,834 --> 02:29:24,994
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what this boils down to.

1742
02:29:25,334 --> 02:29:28,695
[SPEAKER_13]: We can put that question forward so we'll have that information for that meeting.

1743
02:29:28,755 --> 02:29:31,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to hear it from the Hoss's mouth, instead of from the other end.

1744
02:29:32,776 --> 02:29:33,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to hear it from the Hoss's mouth.

1745
02:29:33,917 --> 02:29:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: We will invite the administration to the meeting.

1746
02:29:35,737 --> 02:29:37,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'd appreciate that, Mr. President.

1747
02:29:37,177 --> 02:29:37,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1748
02:29:37,657 --> 02:29:37,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1749
02:29:39,078 --> 02:29:39,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Del Rosso.

1750
02:29:40,398 --> 02:29:52,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I, too, look forward to hearing more about this from the city administration, members of the Water and Sewer Commission, and the appropriate parties.

1751
02:29:52,742 --> 02:30:01,870
[SPEAKER_16]: who are able to present to us factual information, which I look forward to, and I thank you in advance for your leadership in the matter, Mr. President.

1752
02:30:01,890 --> 02:30:03,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

1753
02:30:03,811 --> 02:30:04,652
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Lococo.

1754
02:30:05,193 --> 02:30:06,734
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carvillo.

1755
02:30:06,754 --> 02:30:09,196
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

1756
02:30:09,256 --> 02:30:11,598
[SPEAKER_30]: I was unaware.

1757
02:30:11,618 --> 02:30:13,440
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know how you got the information.

1758
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:17,003
[SPEAKER_30]: If you could provide us with that information, maybe by email before the meeting.

1759
02:30:17,023 --> 02:30:19,545
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1760
02:30:20,045 --> 02:30:20,245
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

1761
02:30:21,443 --> 02:30:26,205
[SPEAKER_30]: Just glad it's been brought to our attention before they roll it out come August 2018.

1762
02:30:26,305 --> 02:30:30,047
[SPEAKER_30]: I definitely am in agreement with Councilor Marks.

1763
02:30:30,547 --> 02:30:37,149
[SPEAKER_30]: We already overtaxed the taxpayer, the ratepayers, and now, you know, any additional fees or charges.

1764
02:30:37,950 --> 02:30:39,330
[SPEAKER_30]: It does hurt a lot of people.

1765
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:41,911
[SPEAKER_30]: Some people can afford it, but a lot of people can't.

1766
02:30:41,951 --> 02:30:43,432
[SPEAKER_30]: And those are the people that we hear from.

1767
02:30:43,452 --> 02:30:44,612
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm glad.

1768
02:30:44,753 --> 02:30:47,033
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for setting up a meeting, President Carviello.

1769
02:30:47,114 --> 02:30:50,655
[SPEAKER_30]: And I look forward to getting some answers and hopefully making some

1770
02:30:51,163 --> 02:30:53,284
[SPEAKER_30]: changes to the potential possibility.

1771
02:30:53,344 --> 02:30:53,724
[SPEAKER_13]: A second.

1772
02:30:53,744 --> 02:30:55,004
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole six o'clock p.m.

1773
02:30:55,944 --> 02:30:57,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

1774
02:30:57,865 --> 02:30:58,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1775
02:30:59,105 --> 02:31:01,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1776
02:31:01,846 --> 02:31:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the chair, I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and bringing this information forward.

1777
02:31:07,047 --> 02:31:13,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, on two separate other debating topics tonight, the vetting of the new

1778
02:31:13,492 --> 02:31:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Community Preservation Commission, a new shadow government in Medford, and on Councilor Longo Kern's resolution about the demolition.

1779
02:31:21,801 --> 02:31:29,189
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of talk was generated on affordable housing and preserving historic landmarks.

1780
02:31:29,770 --> 02:31:35,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a great opportunity to give a little bit more affordable housing to the residents of Medford.

1781
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:46,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as historical landmarks go, how about our senior citizens, like my mother, who's 78 years old, who is a historic person as far as I'm concerned here in Medford.

1782
02:31:47,099 --> 02:31:55,746
[SPEAKER_04]: This charge, Mr. President, and I'm a little passionate about this, is outrageous, especially when Councillor Marks refers to the fact that there's $8 million

1783
02:31:57,347 --> 02:31:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: in an overtaxed account.

1784
02:31:59,208 --> 02:32:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a great opportunity to provide a little bit more affordable housing to the citizens of Medford.

1785
02:32:04,652 --> 02:32:05,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And we shouldn't wait until 2018.

1786
02:32:06,793 --> 02:32:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The power of this body should somehow find a way to kill this now, not wait.

1787
02:32:12,276 --> 02:32:13,837
[SPEAKER_04]: May 2nd will be the Council meeting.

1788
02:32:14,077 --> 02:32:25,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that point, because this is such an important matter, perhaps that Committee of the Whole meeting should be in this chamber, under the TV, so people at home can watch this, Mr. President.

1789
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:34,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate that that meeting is not available to the whole public through technology in some fashion.

1790
02:32:36,577 --> 02:32:40,639
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I'm sorry, this is really outrageous.

1791
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:42,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Something should be done.

1792
02:32:43,421 --> 02:32:54,749
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of talking about affordability for the residents of Medford, another speaker spoke earlier tonight about how the rents are going way up.

1793
02:32:55,109 --> 02:32:55,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think that is?

1794
02:32:57,185 --> 02:33:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: When the property taxes are always going up, our sales taxes, excise taxes, excess in taxes, a cash account with another $10 million into it.

1795
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff trickles downhill, Mr. President, in the lower income, in the middle income, and the poor people are the ones who end up paying all of these excessive costs for living in the city of Medford, especially when there's a surplus.

1796
02:33:22,107 --> 02:33:24,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President... May 2nd, voice your concerns that night.

1797
02:33:25,189 --> 02:33:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm voicing them here and now, too, Mr. President.

1798
02:33:27,070 --> 02:33:27,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1799
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:28,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outrageous.

1800
02:33:28,310 --> 02:33:28,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1801
02:33:28,531 --> 02:33:29,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1802
02:33:29,231 --> 02:33:31,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1803
02:33:31,292 --> 02:33:32,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Max.

1804
02:33:33,213 --> 02:33:35,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I can also amend the paper.

1805
02:33:35,774 --> 02:33:46,921
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can also, before the May 2nd meeting, get a copy of the minutes which the vote of the Water and Sewer Commission took place that voted on this connectivity charge.

1806
02:33:47,501 --> 02:33:49,322
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can have a copy of the minutes for that.

1807
02:33:49,522 --> 02:33:51,243
[SPEAKER_13]: A copy of the minutes be provided also.

1808
02:33:52,438 --> 02:33:56,020
[SPEAKER_11]: of the meeting where the vote was taken for this connectivity charge.

1809
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:57,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1810
02:33:58,341 --> 02:33:59,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1811
02:34:01,022 --> 02:34:02,963
[SPEAKER_10]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1812
02:34:04,043 --> 02:34:05,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I live up in an area called the Heights.

1813
02:34:06,144 --> 02:34:07,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure most people are familiar with it.

1814
02:34:07,945 --> 02:34:12,167
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things about the Heights that's very unique is our water pressure.

1815
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:25,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the rare opportunity of sitting across at one of the Mayor's meet and greets, the Commissioner of the Water and Sewer, and asked him, has that area of Medford ever been reviewed?

1816
02:34:25,776 --> 02:34:27,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the water pressure is

1817
02:34:27,708 --> 02:34:37,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sometimes so horrific that if I'm taking a shower and my neighbor waters their lawn, I guess I'm taking a cold shower or a very little one or a very fast one.

1818
02:34:38,472 --> 02:34:42,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And his response to me was, oh yeah, it's reviewed all the time and it's in a very costly

1819
02:34:44,133 --> 02:34:45,854
[SPEAKER_10]: reviewed it to process.

1820
02:34:45,934 --> 02:34:49,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And how long ago, my question was, was that reviewed?

1821
02:34:49,356 --> 02:34:51,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, many, many years ago, but we look at it all the time.

1822
02:34:52,217 --> 02:35:04,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So my question is, how can we have an $8 million surplus and have areas of the city that have a deficit when it comes to things that need to be looked at, repaired, fixed, replaced, changed?

1823
02:35:05,063 --> 02:35:08,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm on a five-eighths piping.

1824
02:35:08,925 --> 02:35:11,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of that is so the pressure can kind of maintain a certain level.

1825
02:35:12,702 --> 02:35:22,944
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, seriously, it's just ironic that we would ask for an additional $1.45 million a year to add what, to the surplus?

1826
02:35:23,184 --> 02:35:23,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm confused.

1827
02:35:24,425 --> 02:35:35,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other thing I really kind of, me being mathematical, I take $8 million and $9 million and that's $17 million and isn't that pretty close to what we need for a police department, fire department?

1828
02:35:36,487 --> 02:35:37,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Just throwing it out there.

1829
02:35:37,808 --> 02:35:38,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1830
02:35:41,312 --> 02:35:42,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

1831
02:35:43,094 --> 02:35:46,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.

1832
02:35:46,557 --> 02:35:52,843
[SPEAKER_07]: The part that's kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%.

1833
02:35:55,366 --> 02:36:02,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer,

1834
02:36:03,317 --> 02:36:11,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you said, Councilor Marks, if they're sitting on $8.5 million in a surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis?

1835
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:19,783
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it.

1836
02:36:20,504 --> 02:36:29,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the Town Administrator, if you are a present homeowner, landowner, and you need to be reconnected,

1837
02:36:29,706 --> 02:36:30,826
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no charge.

1838
02:36:31,026 --> 02:36:38,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house, first time around, $50, one-time fee, usually anyone.

1839
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:42,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1840
02:36:42,271 --> 02:36:44,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that May 2nd, the committee of the whole meeting?

1841
02:36:44,371 --> 02:36:46,552
[SPEAKER_16]: May 2nd is the meeting.

1842
02:36:46,792 --> 02:36:47,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1843
02:36:48,293 --> 02:36:48,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1844
02:36:48,893 --> 02:36:50,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for interrupting me, Councilor DelaRusso.

1845
02:36:51,194 --> 02:36:51,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

1846
02:36:51,954 --> 02:36:54,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else you want to do before I finish?

1847
02:36:55,244 --> 02:36:56,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you smile on your face?

1848
02:36:56,385 --> 02:36:58,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, let me tell you something.

1849
02:36:58,946 --> 02:37:02,749
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when somebody's speaking up here, I don't need to be interrupted rudely.

1850
02:37:02,829 --> 02:37:03,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1851
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:04,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1852
02:37:05,111 --> 02:37:05,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1853
02:37:05,631 --> 02:37:13,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the problem when people view something like this on the council floor and they watch it on television, that doesn't bode very well for you folks sitting here.

1854
02:37:13,556 --> 02:37:15,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1855
02:37:15,517 --> 02:37:16,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's a shame.

1856
02:37:16,958 --> 02:37:17,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of order.

1857
02:37:17,939 --> 02:37:18,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of order.

1858
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Stick to the subject matter on the agenda, please.

1859
02:37:20,801 --> 02:37:21,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1860
02:37:22,176 --> 02:37:26,113
[SPEAKER_07]: The point of order is talking about how this council is going to react.

1861
02:37:27,182 --> 02:37:33,246
[SPEAKER_07]: with the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you.

1862
02:37:33,606 --> 02:37:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you need to wait until May 2nd.

1863
02:37:35,727 --> 02:37:40,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your vote should take place here tonight, that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it.

1864
02:37:41,711 --> 02:37:49,676
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have an $8.5 million, Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate.

1865
02:37:50,096 --> 02:37:52,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you go out and explain that to the right pair of this community.

1866
02:37:53,058 --> 02:37:53,639
[SPEAKER_13]: May 2nd.

1867
02:37:53,719 --> 02:37:54,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

1868
02:37:54,219 --> 02:37:55,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Please answer me.

1869
02:37:55,600 --> 02:38:01,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain to me or anyone on the... How do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase?

1870
02:38:02,385 --> 02:38:02,966
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the CPA.

1871
02:38:02,986 --> 02:38:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be explained on May 2nd.

1872
02:38:04,087 --> 02:38:05,048
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the CPA.

1873
02:38:05,068 --> 02:38:06,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the CPA as a corollary tax.

1874
02:38:06,909 --> 02:38:07,429
[SPEAKER_07]: On May 2nd.

1875
02:38:07,970 --> 02:38:08,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

1876
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:10,312
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a corollary tax, the CPA.

1877
02:38:10,652 --> 02:38:13,474
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it.

1878
02:38:13,674 --> 02:38:16,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not... You should not be charging the taxpayers that money.

1879
02:38:16,637 --> 02:38:21,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It was voted on by the citizens of the... And the citizens and you guys can make a representative... You can...

1880
02:38:22,281 --> 02:38:23,462
[SPEAKER_07]: We have order here.

1881
02:38:24,062 --> 02:38:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what the order was when you and Councilor DelaRusso ran around when the people were talking?

1882
02:38:28,165 --> 02:38:29,205
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about the water.

1883
02:38:29,285 --> 02:38:31,246
[SPEAKER_07]: You know something, Mr. President?

1884
02:38:32,047 --> 02:38:40,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally... They have no sense of respect.

1885
02:38:40,532 --> 02:38:41,452
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about the water.

1886
02:38:41,512 --> 02:38:43,533
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no respect for people at the podium.

1887
02:38:43,553 --> 02:38:48,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say.

1888
02:38:49,917 --> 02:38:51,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I'm sticking to the subject matter.

1889
02:38:51,578 --> 02:38:53,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And the subject matter is the water, okay?

1890
02:38:53,579 --> 02:39:00,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying to you as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it.

1891
02:39:00,523 --> 02:39:07,127
[SPEAKER_07]: When Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks.

1892
02:39:07,467 --> 02:39:08,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Your election is coming up this year.

1893
02:39:09,268 --> 02:39:10,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to be paying for it.

1894
02:39:11,249 --> 02:39:15,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, May 2nd, all your questions can be answered then.

1895
02:39:16,072 --> 02:39:16,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1896
02:39:17,801 --> 02:39:18,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1897
02:39:18,901 --> 02:39:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, Mr. President Caviello.

1898
02:39:22,162 --> 02:39:26,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1899
02:39:27,084 --> 02:39:28,024
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I start?

1900
02:39:28,805 --> 02:39:30,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make it very- We're talking about the water.

1901
02:39:31,245 --> 02:39:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm talking about water.

1902
02:39:33,186 --> 02:39:33,926
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where we're starting.

1903
02:39:34,006 --> 02:39:35,607
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not talking about the water, don't start anything.

1904
02:39:35,627 --> 02:39:36,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it free water?

1905
02:39:37,747 --> 02:39:39,368
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something in the water, 02155.

1906
02:39:39,948 --> 02:39:41,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my T-shirt.

1907
02:39:41,869 --> 02:39:42,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the water.

1908
02:39:43,369 --> 02:39:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, Richard.

1909
02:39:45,470 --> 02:39:45,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1910
02:39:47,737 --> 02:39:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: This connectivity fee, it's all new to me, Councilor Marks.

1911
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:55,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd ask you to explain it, but it's kind of late, and some people want to go watch that basketball game.

1912
02:39:56,604 --> 02:39:59,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the only last two minutes is what really counts, in my opinion.

1913
02:40:00,006 --> 02:40:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this connectivity fee might be something that might, how you say it, the straw that breaks the tax man's back, or the taxpayer's back.

1914
02:40:11,955 --> 02:40:16,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed seeing Councilor Brianna and some other politicians

1915
02:40:16,776 --> 02:40:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, first time that I recollect ever going to see front of Captain Isaac Hall's house and celebrating our first revolution.

1916
02:40:27,119 --> 02:40:27,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1917
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the Beatles would say, if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the taxpayer.

1918
02:40:36,582 --> 02:40:37,462
[SPEAKER_02]: When does this end?

1919
02:40:38,382 --> 02:40:40,943
[SPEAKER_02]: At Dela Rousseau's or Chinkardi's?

1920
02:40:42,130 --> 02:40:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: or a cremation of some sort.

1921
02:40:44,192 --> 02:40:47,714
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're going to talk about the water, we're talking about the water.

1922
02:40:47,734 --> 02:40:49,715
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to talk about anybody's business.

1923
02:40:49,735 --> 02:40:51,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Who polluted the harbor talking about water?

1924
02:40:52,357 --> 02:40:52,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Me?

1925
02:40:52,757 --> 02:40:52,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You?

1926
02:40:53,297 --> 02:40:53,478
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1927
02:40:53,718 --> 02:40:57,560
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mills and Lawrence, the GE, the corporations in Woburn.

1928
02:40:58,381 --> 02:40:59,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's cleaning it up?

1929
02:41:00,602 --> 02:41:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower middle class.

1930
02:41:02,083 --> 02:41:02,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's paid for.

1931
02:41:02,844 --> 02:41:03,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.

1932
02:41:03,924 --> 02:41:04,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we still paying?

1933
02:41:06,462 --> 02:41:09,843
[SPEAKER_13]: May 2nd, you can ask all the questions you want of the Water and Soil Commission.

1934
02:41:09,943 --> 02:41:11,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Ask all the questions we want.

1935
02:41:11,264 --> 02:41:13,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Ask me questions, I'll tell you no lies.

1936
02:41:13,645 --> 02:41:14,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

1937
02:41:14,225 --> 02:41:14,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1938
02:41:16,186 --> 02:41:27,791
[SPEAKER_13]: On to question by Councilor Marks, as amended by... Do you have any more amendments you want to add on to that?

1939
02:41:30,962 --> 02:41:36,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So a copy of the minutes will be there, Ron Baker will be there, and we'll have someone from the administration also be there.

1940
02:41:37,908 --> 02:41:38,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

1941
02:41:38,428 --> 02:41:39,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1942
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else?

1943
02:41:40,610 --> 02:41:52,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just, I don't know if we want to get them to answer it ahead of time, or rather... If they want to answer ahead of time, they can answer, but May 2nd, hopefully we can get all those questions answered.

1944
02:41:53,401 --> 02:41:54,682
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

1945
02:41:54,822 --> 02:41:55,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

1946
02:41:56,083 --> 02:41:59,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, it'd be nice if we could get those answers ahead of time.

1947
02:41:59,845 --> 02:42:01,567
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice to go into the meeting prepared.

1948
02:42:02,007 --> 02:42:02,667
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do our best.

1949
02:42:02,687 --> 02:42:03,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1950
02:42:03,368 --> 02:42:06,671
[SPEAKER_13]: We will request, hopefully they will come before the meeting.

1951
02:42:06,691 --> 02:42:10,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst is when you get information tonight and you're trying to digest it during the meeting.

1952
02:42:10,534 --> 02:42:11,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're all in agreement with that.

1953
02:42:11,575 --> 02:42:13,717
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get it before the meeting, it'd be greatly appreciated.

1954
02:42:13,737 --> 02:42:14,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1955
02:42:14,138 --> 02:42:14,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1956
02:42:16,139 --> 02:42:21,044
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1957
02:42:21,104 --> 02:42:21,764
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1958
02:42:23,326 --> 02:42:24,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes. 17.

1959
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:29,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Three, six, eight, offered by Councilor Nyth.

1960
02:42:30,861 --> 02:42:44,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and Epi training to the city's first responders.

1961
02:42:44,968 --> 02:42:45,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Nyth.

1962
02:42:46,248 --> 02:42:47,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1963
02:42:48,209 --> 02:42:54,812
[SPEAKER_19]: Being a father of children with allergies and understanding the severity thereof in looking at

1964
02:42:55,758 --> 02:42:58,521
[SPEAKER_19]: the past few weeks what's going on in the community.

1965
02:42:58,621 --> 02:43:04,028
[SPEAKER_19]: We have our first responders whose job is to save people's lives, carrying Narcan.

1966
02:43:05,089 --> 02:43:15,962
[SPEAKER_19]: We have our first responders right now reviewing a request that this council made to have defibrillators as part of their first response package.

1967
02:43:16,722 --> 02:43:25,785
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is an effort to build upon that, Mr. President, and to ask the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and EpiPen training for our first responders.

1968
02:43:25,845 --> 02:43:29,987
[SPEAKER_19]: As we all know, when you come into a situation related to allergies, every second counts.

1969
02:43:30,587 --> 02:43:33,628
[SPEAKER_19]: And most times, the police cars get there before the ambulances do.

1970
02:43:34,249 --> 02:43:40,331
[SPEAKER_19]: And if, in fact, there's a feasible way to provide this training and this product to our

1971
02:43:40,872 --> 02:43:43,573
[SPEAKER_19]: First responders, I think, will be making Medford a safer place.

1972
02:43:43,793 --> 02:43:49,955
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think there's anybody behind this rail that can argue that our first job isn't to have a focus on public safety, Mr. President.

1973
02:43:49,995 --> 02:43:51,996
[SPEAKER_19]: We're making great strides in that regard.

1974
02:43:52,937 --> 02:43:57,398
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that this is just an opportunity for us to expand upon the services that we provide our citizenry.

1975
02:43:57,458 --> 02:43:59,979
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd ask that my colleagues behind the rail support this measure.

1976
02:44:00,279 --> 02:44:00,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1977
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:02,560
[SPEAKER_30]: Counselor Lingo-Curran.

1978
02:44:03,701 --> 02:44:05,061
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1979
02:44:05,081 --> 02:44:07,402
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to thank Counselor

1980
02:44:08,289 --> 02:44:10,870
[SPEAKER_30]: Knight, for bringing this forward, I actually saw it on the news.

1981
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:15,632
[SPEAKER_30]: A young child from Walpole was being rushed to the hospital.

1982
02:44:15,652 --> 02:44:19,673
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, no, actually, maybe that's where you got it.

1983
02:44:20,634 --> 02:44:23,015
[SPEAKER_30]: EMT came and saved his life with an EpiPen.

1984
02:44:23,135 --> 02:44:26,956
[SPEAKER_30]: And they said, thank God the EMTs got there, were the first responders.

1985
02:44:27,136 --> 02:44:29,857
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's a big push by a woman in Walpole.

1986
02:44:29,897 --> 02:44:36,520
[SPEAKER_30]: I think she's getting help by a couple of state representatives in that area to change the law of the state.

1987
02:44:36,985 --> 02:44:43,550
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think this is a great resolve put forward by Councilor Knight to implement it in Medford sooner than later.

1988
02:44:44,891 --> 02:44:54,358
[SPEAKER_30]: So many children and adults and anybody any age have these allergies where EpiPens are being more and more administered and needed.

1989
02:44:54,578 --> 02:44:59,942
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think if somebody can save a life of somebody who's going into anaphylactic shock,

1990
02:45:02,594 --> 02:45:07,418
[SPEAKER_30]: I know there's going to have to be training that's going to need to be need to take place, but it's going to be worth it.

1991
02:45:07,798 --> 02:45:09,280
[SPEAKER_30]: So I second the resolve.

1992
02:45:09,480 --> 02:45:11,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1993
02:45:11,541 --> 02:45:25,693
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, Mr. President, I know we've all seen in the news the drastic price increases of EpiPens and individuals that are on fixed incomes may have a little bit of a difficult time purchasing these materials, especially if they're without insurance.

1994
02:45:26,594 --> 02:45:30,237
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of my fears is that individuals that

1995
02:45:30,823 --> 02:45:34,645
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I have allergies that require an EpiPen when they have a reaction.

1996
02:45:35,126 --> 02:45:37,727
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to use that as an area to save costs.

1997
02:45:38,267 --> 02:45:45,411
[SPEAKER_19]: And if someone's trying to trim their budget and they haven't used their EpiPen in two or three years and it's expired, they might say, well, I'm pretty good at watching the nuts.

1998
02:45:45,431 --> 02:45:49,414
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I need it, which is going to create a worse situation, Mr. President.

1999
02:45:49,454 --> 02:45:53,956
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, again, thank Councilor Longo for her kind words and move for approval.

2000
02:45:54,317 --> 02:45:55,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2001
02:45:56,098 --> 02:45:58,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a grandson that has an allergy and

2002
02:45:59,061 --> 02:46:02,464
[SPEAKER_13]: EpiPens are $600 a piece and not covered by insurance.

2003
02:46:03,244 --> 02:46:11,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And he takes one to school, we have one at home, and my daughter is out $1,800 on three EpiPens that you only get a year on.

2004
02:46:11,651 --> 02:46:17,075
[SPEAKER_13]: So, again, they are quite expensive and insurance should cover them, but they don't.

2005
02:46:17,675 --> 02:46:22,018
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococourne.

2006
02:46:22,499 --> 02:46:23,319
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2007
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:25,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2008
02:46:27,469 --> 02:46:44,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Petitions, excuse me, one more, 17369, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved, the Board of Health examine the feasibility of establishing a grading system for establishments licensed to sell food products.

2009
02:46:45,132 --> 02:46:45,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2010
02:46:46,252 --> 02:46:47,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2011
02:46:48,193 --> 02:46:54,354
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a program or a process or a policy that's in place in many communities around the United States of America.

2012
02:46:55,144 --> 02:47:02,466
[SPEAKER_19]: think about the first time I saw it, I think I was in California when I saw this establishment has been rated a B plus by the Board of Health and its inspection.

2013
02:47:03,266 --> 02:47:06,647
[SPEAKER_19]: There are other establishments that were C's and other establishments that were A's.

2014
02:47:06,847 --> 02:47:19,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And what the Board of Health is doing is conducting their food inspections and then making an assessment based upon a certain policy or protocol they put in place to give a grade to that establishment with the hopes that it produces corrective action, Mr. President.

2015
02:47:19,650 --> 02:47:25,091
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to have every food establishment here in the city of Medford meeting every requirement that the Board of Health puts forward.

2016
02:47:25,822 --> 02:47:37,298
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll see cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and most recently I believe the city of Boston adopted a system where they're grading establishments based upon the results of their food inspections.

2017
02:47:37,338 --> 02:47:41,163
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that this is really a great act to protect the consumer.

2018
02:47:42,322 --> 02:48:02,055
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want the policy to create an increased burden on operators or business owners here in the community, but I think that if we sell good products and the city is behind the fact that a business is selling a good product, that we'll have more customers in that business because the city and the government entity has made an effort to further regulate it and to make sure that they're complying by all the rules.

2019
02:48:02,075 --> 02:48:03,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're telling people they're complying by the rules.

2020
02:48:03,777 --> 02:48:07,339
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know we have Mr. Pinter at the rail here.

2021
02:48:07,419 --> 02:48:11,342
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought Mr. McKillop was going to get up because he's a business owner and a restaurant owner.

2022
02:48:11,985 --> 02:48:20,812
[SPEAKER_19]: However, this is a measure that I'd like to get a report back from the Board of Health on as to whether or not this is something that they find feasible and find out if it'll work in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

2023
02:48:20,852 --> 02:48:22,513
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd ask my colleagues to support it and move approval.

2024
02:48:23,073 --> 02:48:24,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2025
02:48:24,394 --> 02:48:26,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2026
02:48:26,696 --> 02:48:33,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail because, number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system.

2027
02:48:33,901 --> 02:48:35,422
[SPEAKER_07]: The Board of Health has a job to do.

2028
02:48:35,642 --> 02:48:40,425
[SPEAKER_07]: They go out there, they review the product of the restaurant or whatever it might be.

2029
02:48:40,485 --> 02:48:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That's their job.

2030
02:48:41,705 --> 02:48:49,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing an A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they?

2031
02:48:49,895 --> 02:48:51,056
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't frequent that business.

2032
02:48:51,096 --> 02:48:54,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it would lead a very, it would skew.

2033
02:48:55,938 --> 02:49:00,021
[SPEAKER_07]: the public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another.

2034
02:49:00,722 --> 02:49:03,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation.

2035
02:49:04,445 --> 02:49:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a point of no business.

2036
02:49:14,073 --> 02:49:19,097
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposal that's before us is for the Board of Health to examine whether or not this would be a feasible approach.

2037
02:49:19,668 --> 02:49:28,752
[SPEAKER_19]: And what it is is not to have the Board of Health get involved into the business operations of a business, but to report to the general public that the facility that they're going to eat and purchase food from is clean.

2038
02:49:29,412 --> 02:49:29,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2039
02:49:30,513 --> 02:49:44,659
[SPEAKER_07]: When they go and do their job, and they review a restaurant, and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common virtues license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test.

2040
02:49:44,940 --> 02:49:47,101
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to have a rating system.

2041
02:49:48,061 --> 02:49:56,366
[SPEAKER_07]: When you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, okay?

2042
02:49:56,406 --> 02:49:58,908
[SPEAKER_07]: You're really crossing over the line on something like this.

2043
02:49:59,508 --> 02:50:07,833
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a department that does its job, and its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in the business is safe, it's good to eat,

2044
02:50:09,905 --> 02:50:10,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And so be it.

2045
02:50:11,007 --> 02:50:14,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And now if you're gonna start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line.

2046
02:50:15,092 --> 02:50:19,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people spend hundreds and thousands of dollars to go into a food business.

2047
02:50:20,379 --> 02:50:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't,

2048
02:50:25,686 --> 02:50:28,590
[SPEAKER_07]: They might pass the test, but they may not like the person.

2049
02:50:28,810 --> 02:50:30,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting into a personality conflict.

2050
02:50:30,833 --> 02:50:40,125
[SPEAKER_07]: How many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time?

2051
02:50:40,445 --> 02:50:41,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a personality conflict.

2052
02:50:42,107 --> 02:50:43,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got nothing to do with the business.

2053
02:50:44,130 --> 02:50:53,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license.

2054
02:50:53,472 --> 02:50:57,193
[SPEAKER_07]: However it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself.

2055
02:50:57,553 --> 02:51:00,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Their product sold to the public will take care of itself.

2056
02:51:00,674 --> 02:51:07,056
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.

2057
02:51:07,236 --> 02:51:07,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2058
02:51:08,316 --> 02:51:08,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2059
02:51:10,956 --> 02:51:12,597
[SPEAKER_19]: We all do things a certain way.

2060
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,381
[SPEAKER_19]: And we could all do things better, Mr. President.

2061
02:51:15,621 --> 02:51:24,747
[SPEAKER_19]: And all this is is an opportunity for us to ask the Board of Health whether or not we're doing things the right way, and if it's feasible to do it a different way, and if that different way is going to be better.

2062
02:51:25,107 --> 02:51:26,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's something we need to yell and scream about.

2063
02:51:27,068 --> 02:51:27,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2064
02:51:28,469 --> 02:51:29,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

2065
02:51:31,067 --> 02:51:36,031
[SPEAKER_10]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road, and I do own a restaurant, and I was hesitant to come up.

2066
02:51:36,231 --> 02:51:37,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to lie.

2067
02:51:37,052 --> 02:51:38,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you did.

2068
02:51:39,634 --> 02:51:42,036
[SPEAKER_10]: There's two rules of thought here.

2069
02:51:43,217 --> 02:51:50,563
[SPEAKER_10]: The city that I work in, I have an incredible rapport with the department and Larry, the head of the department.

2070
02:51:51,764 --> 02:51:53,305
[SPEAKER_10]: So we work in tandem.

2071
02:51:54,166 --> 02:51:54,746
[SPEAKER_10]: He comes in.

2072
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:55,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a surprise.

2073
02:51:55,887 --> 02:51:57,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I never know when they're coming.

2074
02:51:57,428 --> 02:52:09,753
[SPEAKER_10]: There are things that, totally honestly, that they will find that are incredible, and then there are things that they will find that might have slipped through the cracks, whether it's a thermometer that isn't working or something that isn't quite shelved properly.

2075
02:52:10,593 --> 02:52:14,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But they work really, really hard with us as a community.

2076
02:52:14,975 --> 02:52:17,616
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you work really, really hard with the Board of Health,

2077
02:52:18,622 --> 02:52:21,666
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a respect level there that carries very well.

2078
02:52:22,207 --> 02:52:29,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I can't speak for what goes on in Medford as far as the rapport between the Board of Health and Medford and the restaurant tours.

2079
02:52:30,318 --> 02:52:31,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only tell you that that's something that

2080
02:52:32,407 --> 02:52:41,051
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, as a whole, you would look at and see the reports and evaluate the situation and make a decision as to does this make sense for us?

2081
02:52:41,091 --> 02:52:47,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we step up to the plate and do something a little bit different because it's not quite working the way we'd like to based off of the information we have?

2082
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:51,616
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of the way I personally would approach it.

2083
02:52:51,937 --> 02:52:58,040
[SPEAKER_10]: If I remember correctly, the grading method was based or actually came about

2084
02:52:59,073 --> 02:53:02,496
[SPEAKER_10]: do specifically because of the chain businesses.

2085
02:53:03,317 --> 02:53:07,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the chain businesses were the ones that were having a real difficult time staying on top of things.

2086
02:53:08,562 --> 02:53:14,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you go to franchises or you go to district managers, regional managers, then store managers, then assistant managers,

2087
02:53:15,166 --> 02:53:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, very difficult to kind of maintain a certain level of control.

2088
02:53:18,388 --> 02:53:20,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of where that kind of came from and morphed out of.

2089
02:53:21,331 --> 02:53:24,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it blanketed across and kind of kept going further.

2090
02:53:24,433 --> 02:53:35,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest with you, to Mr. Penta's point, there are some areas that it does not work well, that it is kind of a negative kind of

2091
02:53:36,377 --> 02:53:43,244
[SPEAKER_10]: reciprocation on the behalf of someone that may not appreciate someone else and, you know, gives them a bad score just simply because they can.

2092
02:53:43,784 --> 02:53:59,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a double-edged, it can be a double-edged sword, but I think that any community that works with the Board of Health, the restaurateurs, they recognize how important it is and the Board of Health, if they do it well, and I know in my community they do it very well,

2093
02:53:59,859 --> 02:54:03,802
[SPEAKER_10]: They work in tandem and they work really, really hard together to make sure that everything is the way it's supposed to be.

2094
02:54:04,402 --> 02:54:06,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the only input I can give on that.

2095
02:54:06,243 --> 02:54:10,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have an opinion one way or the other as to which direction.

2096
02:54:10,886 --> 02:54:13,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I just say, basically, collect all your data.

2097
02:54:14,188 --> 02:54:15,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a look at your Board of Health.

2098
02:54:15,389 --> 02:54:22,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, if I'm not mistaken, the Board of Health is really, it is a department within the city, but it's underneath the umbrella of the state.

2099
02:54:22,934 --> 02:54:23,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I right or wrong?

2100
02:54:24,655 --> 02:54:27,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in the city of Salem, that's the way that they present it.

2101
02:54:30,019 --> 02:54:41,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, just for clarification, because I wasn't quite sure, because I know that in the City of Salem, they kind of make it as the Board of Health is kind of their own entity within the city working underneath the state, no?

2102
02:54:41,385 --> 02:54:43,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so maybe that's not the one.

2103
02:54:46,488 --> 02:54:49,930
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of things that are governed through state legislation that

2104
02:54:50,718 --> 02:54:51,779
[SPEAKER_18]: eliminates local control.

2105
02:54:52,139 --> 02:54:55,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So the answer to that is yes and no, I guess.

2106
02:54:55,541 --> 02:54:57,082
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of the way, the approach I would make.

2107
02:54:57,402 --> 02:55:01,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And you do have to be careful when anything, anything has to do with something like that.

2108
02:55:01,064 --> 02:55:01,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

2109
02:55:02,024 --> 02:55:02,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your retreat.

2110
02:55:02,765 --> 02:55:03,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Coats.

2111
02:55:03,946 --> 02:55:04,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to.

2112
02:55:05,086 --> 02:55:06,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Council, Vice President Marks.

2113
02:55:07,548 --> 02:55:08,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2114
02:55:08,948 --> 02:55:20,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was about six months ago, uh, during the council meeting, uh, we had the new border health inspector, uh, before us and I asked the new health director,

2115
02:55:22,064 --> 02:55:26,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do we stand with border health inspections?

2116
02:55:26,845 --> 02:55:29,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe they were seven or eight months behind.

2117
02:55:30,867 --> 02:55:35,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why I knew that is because I had a number of businesses that said, what do I do?

2118
02:55:37,270 --> 02:55:39,951
[SPEAKER_11]: My health inspection ran out six months ago.

2119
02:55:40,271 --> 02:55:41,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I still operate my business?

2120
02:55:42,452 --> 02:55:44,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why I asked the question, Mr. President.

2121
02:55:45,213 --> 02:55:45,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know,

2122
02:55:46,393 --> 02:55:49,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the larger question is, what are we doing right now?

2123
02:55:49,854 --> 02:55:52,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we up to date with our health inspections?

2124
02:55:52,655 --> 02:55:54,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we need more staff in the office?

2125
02:55:55,176 --> 02:55:56,856
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that's the larger question.

2126
02:55:57,317 --> 02:56:08,080
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to create a rating system, which I'll be quite honest with you, I don't know if I'm opposed or not to it, but if we want to create a rating system, that's to make sure at least we're doing our due diligence.

2127
02:56:08,478 --> 02:56:21,604
[SPEAKER_11]: and making sure we have the appropriate staff, and making sure our business has their inspections in a timely fashion, so they don't have to wonder whether or not they have to close their door because they don't have a border health inspection.

2128
02:56:22,064 --> 02:56:24,545
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think that's the larger issue, Mr. President.

2129
02:56:25,148 --> 02:56:45,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not willing to vote on any paper tonight to move any issue forward, Mr. President, until we find out where we stand with the Board of Health, where we stand on with the inspections, and why is it taking so long for our health department to inspect these businesses in the community, because as we all know, as Councilor Penta mentioned,

2130
02:56:45,670 --> 02:56:53,992
[SPEAKER_11]: that the Board of Health goes out there and makes sure that the businesses are adhering to code, state and city safety codes.

2131
02:56:54,452 --> 02:56:55,533
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what their business is.

2132
02:56:55,793 --> 02:56:59,034
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you get your inspection sticker, that means you're up to par.

2133
02:56:59,314 --> 02:57:14,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And that means the resident that's going into your restaurant knows your food is prepared in the right way, know that your preparation is right, know the heating requirements and refrigeration requirements are right, and all the cleanliness stuff that goes with

2134
02:57:14,652 --> 02:57:15,892
[SPEAKER_11]: a border health inspection.

2135
02:57:17,133 --> 02:57:19,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is important, Mr. President.

2136
02:57:20,294 --> 02:57:33,058
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point, grading a business, I think we've got to go back to fundamentals in this city and making sure we provide the basics, which is a timely border health inspection for all our businesses.

2137
02:57:33,578 --> 02:57:38,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to see that happen first, Mr. President, before I vote on- Would you like to amend the paper to-

2138
02:57:40,670 --> 02:57:45,872
[SPEAKER_13]: get a report from the Board of Health on where we stand with all the inspections in the city?

2139
02:57:46,692 --> 02:58:02,017
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for it, and I believe she gave us a verbal at the podium, and honestly, I don't remember the exacts, but I want to say that 30 or 40% of our businesses back some six months ago didn't receive their Board of Health inspection, and they were in the process of doing so.

2140
02:58:02,597 --> 02:58:04,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could get an update, that'd be helpful.

2141
02:58:04,238 --> 02:58:08,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please put down that if the Board of Health can give us an update

2142
02:58:09,033 --> 02:58:13,014
[SPEAKER_13]: on where we stand with businesses getting their license renewals.

2143
02:58:15,275 --> 02:58:22,597
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.

2144
02:58:22,617 --> 02:58:24,498
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carriello.

2145
02:58:24,518 --> 02:58:30,280
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's a good discussion maybe we should have with the Board of Health, maybe we can do that.

2146
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:30,980
[SPEAKER_30]: Through a proposal.

2147
02:58:31,780 --> 02:58:36,842
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, through a proposal, or we could just talk to the Board of Health at budget time, see where they're at,

2148
02:58:37,394 --> 02:58:43,277
[SPEAKER_30]: kind of talk about everything at the same time, give it a little extra time with the Board of Health before we move on anything tonight.

2149
02:58:44,178 --> 02:58:46,099
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, I see both sides.

2150
02:58:46,239 --> 02:58:49,501
[SPEAKER_30]: I agree with Councilor Marks, but I understand the point of it.

2151
02:58:49,601 --> 02:58:59,906
[SPEAKER_30]: So maybe just have a discussion about it rather than, or definitely get some more clarity of what we're actually asking the Board of Health to report back to us on.

2152
02:59:01,867 --> 02:59:02,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2153
02:59:05,289 --> 02:59:06,690
[SPEAKER_17]: The Board of Health could very simply say,

2154
02:59:07,053 --> 02:59:08,453
[SPEAKER_17]: it's not feasible, we don't wanna do it.

2155
02:59:08,473 --> 02:59:10,554
[SPEAKER_17]: If it is feasible, we can do it.

2156
02:59:10,994 --> 02:59:12,234
[SPEAKER_17]: All we're doing is asking them a question.

2157
02:59:12,594 --> 02:59:13,194
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see the harm.

2158
02:59:14,274 --> 02:59:17,095
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Marks.

2159
02:59:17,115 --> 02:59:18,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if I could.

2160
02:59:24,456 --> 02:59:29,857
[SPEAKER_11]: If the Board of Health's gonna put that little thought into it, then I don't even think it's worth asking the question.

2161
02:59:30,657 --> 02:59:33,057
[SPEAKER_11]: If they sit back and say, well, we can't do it.

2162
02:59:33,518 --> 02:59:35,238
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not even worth asking the question.

2163
02:59:35,258 --> 02:59:36,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if they sit back and say,

2164
02:59:36,564 --> 02:59:37,224
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do it.

2165
02:59:37,644 --> 02:59:38,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to know why they can do it.

2166
02:59:38,945 --> 02:59:40,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to know if they have the personnel.

2167
02:59:40,766 --> 02:59:47,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing the fact that they can't get to their regularly scheduled health visits now, how are they going to be able to take this on?

2168
02:59:48,088 --> 02:59:49,869
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in a depleted staff up there.

2169
02:59:50,609 --> 02:59:51,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there's more to this.

2170
02:59:51,990 --> 02:59:55,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying it's not a bad idea, but I just think there's more to it.

2171
02:59:55,911 --> 02:59:57,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if it comes from the council,

2172
02:59:57,908 --> 03:00:01,909
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're saying, well, you look into this, then it may mushroom into something else.

2173
03:00:02,489 --> 03:00:06,030
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're gonna be sitting there saying, well, we didn't want you to go that far with it.

2174
03:00:07,131 --> 03:00:14,413
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't want you to move that, because as far as I'm concerned, once this takes place, this will be an administrative policy.

2175
03:00:15,173 --> 03:00:18,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see this as a city ordinance, unless Councilor Knight sees it differently.

2176
03:00:19,194 --> 03:00:23,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I see this as an administrative policy, and that's not under our purview.

2177
03:00:23,596 --> 03:00:27,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So we may initiate the ball rolling and not be able to stop that ball.

2178
03:00:27,948 --> 03:00:43,677
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not prepared to do that at this point, not knowing where we stand with the Board of Health presence in our community, the staffing, and the fact that they're not fully equipped to get out in a timely fashion for inspections.

2179
03:00:44,818 --> 03:00:45,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2180
03:00:45,258 --> 03:00:45,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Nice.

2181
03:00:47,019 --> 03:00:49,020
[SPEAKER_19]: There are two ways to look at every issue, Mr. President.

2182
03:00:49,060 --> 03:00:52,482
[SPEAKER_19]: We can look at issues as to why we can't do things, and we can look at issues as to why we can't.

2183
03:00:53,463 --> 03:00:55,044
[SPEAKER_19]: And all I'm doing is asking a question.

2184
03:00:55,144 --> 03:00:56,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like the support of my council colleagues,

2185
03:00:57,627 --> 03:00:58,948
[SPEAKER_19]: and that's all I have to say about it.

2186
03:00:58,968 --> 03:00:59,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2187
03:01:00,489 --> 03:01:05,912
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2188
03:01:07,072 --> 03:01:07,913
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2189
03:01:08,713 --> 03:01:09,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

2190
03:01:11,074 --> 03:01:13,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2191
03:01:16,537 --> 03:01:17,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRusso?

2192
03:01:17,638 --> 03:01:17,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2193
03:01:18,618 --> 03:01:19,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falcone?

2194
03:01:19,659 --> 03:01:19,879
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2195
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:21,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

2196
03:01:21,340 --> 03:01:21,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2197
03:01:22,920 --> 03:01:23,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor O'Connor?

2198
03:01:25,925 --> 03:01:26,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Marks?

2199
03:01:26,706 --> 03:01:27,126
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2200
03:01:27,847 --> 03:01:28,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2201
03:01:28,787 --> 03:01:28,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2202
03:01:29,928 --> 03:01:30,629
[SPEAKER_15]: President Calviano?

2203
03:01:30,729 --> 03:01:30,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2204
03:01:31,850 --> 03:01:32,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Four in the affirmative.

2205
03:01:32,790 --> 03:01:37,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative.

2206
03:01:37,995 --> 03:01:39,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Five, I'm sorry.

2207
03:01:39,296 --> 03:01:39,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Two.

2208
03:01:41,217 --> 03:01:42,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2209
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:44,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2210
03:01:45,541 --> 03:01:46,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Petitions.

2211
03:01:46,181 --> 03:01:46,982
[SPEAKER_13]: As amended, Mr. President.

2212
03:01:48,543 --> 03:01:49,123
[SPEAKER_13]: As amended.

2213
03:01:50,545 --> 03:01:53,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

2214
03:01:54,737 --> 03:02:07,166
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-373, petition by Robert L. Cappucci Jr., 71 Evans Street, Medford, to address the council concerning municipal aggregation.

2215
03:02:08,127 --> 03:02:09,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2216
03:02:10,089 --> 03:02:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2217
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:14,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Robert Cappucci Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford.

2218
03:02:14,752 --> 03:02:16,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to be brief at this late hour.

2219
03:02:17,934 --> 03:02:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Last summer, it was proposed that the city move towards

2220
03:02:23,498 --> 03:02:31,379
[SPEAKER_04]: municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money.

2221
03:02:33,220 --> 03:02:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It went away.

2222
03:02:34,380 --> 03:02:44,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow it came back last Tuesday in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, go green.

2223
03:02:45,262 --> 03:02:50,043
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired.

2224
03:02:52,229 --> 03:03:00,133
[SPEAKER_04]: by Alicia Hunt, the Director of Energy and Environment here in Medford, the Chairman of the Go Green Medford Community.

2225
03:03:00,914 --> 03:03:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, for the citizens that are watching at home, it's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out.

2226
03:03:21,413 --> 03:03:25,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandably, what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time.

2227
03:03:26,254 --> 03:03:30,875
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also a 30-day opt-out clause in there.

2228
03:03:31,375 --> 03:03:39,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But Councillor Marks at the Committee of the Whole meeting brought up the state law, which is after 180 days, you cannot opt out.

2229
03:03:40,256 --> 03:03:48,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And getting into these government contracts, doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time,

2230
03:03:49,799 --> 03:03:51,360
[SPEAKER_04]: But the state law says something else.

2231
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:55,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little bit skeptical of the whole process.

2232
03:03:56,282 --> 03:04:08,287
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is really such a good thing, they should present it and market it to the people as an opt-in if they want to, not force everybody all at once to be a part of this system.

2233
03:04:08,387 --> 03:04:10,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a slippery slope.

2234
03:04:10,168 --> 03:04:10,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does it end?

2235
03:04:10,968 --> 03:04:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the city council going to vote?

2236
03:04:14,997 --> 03:04:22,701
[SPEAKER_04]: another company buys all my clothes for me, all my groceries, it's a dangerous precedent that we're setting.

2237
03:04:23,281 --> 03:04:23,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

2238
03:04:24,262 --> 03:04:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to be fair to the other side.

2239
03:04:28,364 --> 03:04:34,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor De La Russo at the Committee of the Whole meeting was very astute in bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this.

2240
03:04:34,888 --> 03:04:40,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So I emailed everybody on this council, the Citizens Against Municipal Aggregation website.

2241
03:04:41,371 --> 03:04:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I also included the mayor and

2242
03:04:43,792 --> 03:04:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia hunt the director of environment and engineer.

2243
03:04:47,117 --> 03:04:53,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also going to reach out to them if this ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard.

2244
03:04:53,885 --> 03:05:00,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I just find it just comforting that the city would entertain a notion

2245
03:05:01,482 --> 03:05:04,584
[SPEAKER_04]: of doing something on behalf of every resident.

2246
03:05:05,384 --> 03:05:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: From reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work.

2247
03:05:10,347 --> 03:05:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are locked into it and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day you do try to get out, for some reason you can't, and a lower rate comes, I mean, you can go to

2248
03:05:21,053 --> 03:05:24,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The two sources now, it's an Eversource and National Grid.

2249
03:05:24,534 --> 03:05:25,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can click on them now.

2250
03:05:26,295 --> 03:05:29,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And under those, a ton of other options come up.

2251
03:05:29,956 --> 03:05:32,677
[SPEAKER_04]: There are choices for citizens to make right now.

2252
03:05:32,717 --> 03:05:38,319
[SPEAKER_04]: They can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99.

2253
03:05:39,119 --> 03:05:46,221
[SPEAKER_04]: That choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away.

2254
03:05:46,422 --> 03:05:47,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2255
03:05:50,568 --> 03:05:55,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place it on file.

2256
03:05:56,312 --> 03:05:57,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox.

2257
03:05:58,513 --> 03:05:59,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2258
03:06:00,235 --> 03:06:03,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank Mr. Capucci for getting up on this subject.

2259
03:06:03,317 --> 03:06:06,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he hit the nail on the head when it comes to this issue.

2260
03:06:07,379 --> 03:06:19,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know, the issue was referred to the Energy Subcommittee of the Council, and we plan on having a meeting very shortly regarding this paper.

2261
03:06:20,778 --> 03:06:32,489
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to let it be known, Mr. President, that the city has been going out on its own on the school side for a number of years doing municipal aggregation on the school side.

2262
03:06:33,090 --> 03:06:44,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And back in 2014, it was reported in the Meffitt transcript that, and the article reads, Meffitt unplugs on electricity contract cost schools more than $100,000, Mr. President.

2263
03:06:47,076 --> 03:07:03,950
[SPEAKER_11]: The city, when they went in and purchased on behalf of the schools, failed to renew the contract and had to go back out on the open market and wasn't able to obtain a rate like they had when they had a contract.

2264
03:07:04,310 --> 03:07:10,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And it ended up costing the schools, which is you and I the rate payer, $100,000 because they failed to do their job.

2265
03:07:13,558 --> 03:07:17,401
[SPEAKER_11]: So after that glowing recommendation, now they say, you know what?

2266
03:07:17,681 --> 03:07:20,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it on behalf of every resident in this community.

2267
03:07:20,904 --> 03:07:22,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at our track record.

2268
03:07:22,305 --> 03:07:26,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we want to bring in every resident, and we'll go out on your behalf.

2269
03:07:26,769 --> 03:07:31,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime the government wants to get involved in your business, Mr. President, as far as I'm concerned,

2270
03:07:32,133 --> 03:07:33,054
[SPEAKER_11]: is not a win-win.

2271
03:07:33,574 --> 03:07:42,941
[SPEAKER_11]: When the government says, we want to save you money, that should be the biggest red flag, because the government is not in business to save you or I money.

2272
03:07:43,542 --> 03:07:45,443
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not in that business, Mr. President.

2273
03:07:45,884 --> 03:07:51,248
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, this will get its proper hearing in the Energy Subcommittee, Mr. President.

2274
03:07:51,728 --> 03:07:53,930
[SPEAKER_11]: But as far as I'm concerned, I agree with the Speaker.

2275
03:07:54,770 --> 03:07:56,712
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when the state legislature created this,

2276
03:07:57,380 --> 03:08:02,142
[SPEAKER_11]: They created a clause where it says it's voluntary in the law.

2277
03:08:02,562 --> 03:08:03,702
[SPEAKER_11]: This is voluntary.

2278
03:08:04,043 --> 03:08:09,105
[SPEAKER_11]: However, once your city council votes for it, it's no longer voluntary.

2279
03:08:09,605 --> 03:08:12,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone is subjected to this new municipal aggregation.

2280
03:08:13,646 --> 03:08:15,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you have the ability to opt out.

2281
03:08:16,588 --> 03:08:25,311
[SPEAKER_11]: And we all know when we changed our meters over, it took us several years just to change our meters over in this city because people weren't properly informed.

2282
03:08:26,392 --> 03:08:32,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And to say that there'll be community outreach and so forth, they made a big mistake with the legislation.

2283
03:08:32,975 --> 03:08:34,375
[SPEAKER_11]: They should have had it as an opt-in.

2284
03:08:34,775 --> 03:08:42,218
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're interested, you want to go green, you want to reduce your carbon footprint, and you want to belong to this municipal aggregation, so be it.

2285
03:08:42,538 --> 03:08:44,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the city should offer it.

2286
03:08:45,015 --> 03:08:48,596
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't include me in something, Mr. President, and say I have to opt out.

2287
03:08:49,116 --> 03:08:54,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And then don't say, well, you know, we're gonna decide how much green energy you purchase.

2288
03:08:55,178 --> 03:08:57,699
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't like that, you can opt out of that too.

2289
03:08:58,579 --> 03:09:00,320
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the big opt out program.

2290
03:09:00,640 --> 03:09:02,400
[SPEAKER_11]: You can opt out of that too, Mr. President.

2291
03:09:03,321 --> 03:09:06,242
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not fully sold on this, Mr. President.

2292
03:09:06,562 --> 03:09:08,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Mr. Capucci coming up here.

2293
03:09:08,922 --> 03:09:14,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, this will definitely get its fair share of a hearing within

2294
03:09:14,516 --> 03:09:19,518
[SPEAKER_11]: the Energy Committee, and it will be reported back out to this council to make a full decision.

2295
03:09:19,918 --> 03:09:21,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2296
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:27,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

2297
03:09:29,382 --> 03:09:29,462
Aye.

2298
03:09:30,602 --> 03:09:31,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

2299
03:09:33,543 --> 03:09:35,464
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2300
03:09:35,484 --> 03:09:35,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2301
03:09:35,604 --> 03:09:42,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk be offered by Councilor Scapelli.

2302
03:09:42,812 --> 03:09:50,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city council get a report from the DOT regarding the T bus stop at Main and High Street.

2303
03:09:51,575 --> 03:09:52,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Pellick.

2304
03:09:52,816 --> 03:09:55,777
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, I did receive a few phone calls.

2305
03:09:56,932 --> 03:09:59,694
[SPEAKER_09]: obviously that I've been championing this issue.

2306
03:10:01,256 --> 03:10:18,790
[SPEAKER_09]: The last meeting we had with the Department of Transportation, they put on the full court press and the T had supervisors, enforcement, making sure that the bus stops were safe in front of Main Street and High Street.

2307
03:10:19,491 --> 03:10:24,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been contacting recently that, and,

2308
03:10:25,592 --> 03:10:30,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made it a conscious effort to drive there and witness what's happening.

2309
03:10:30,293 --> 03:10:40,635
[SPEAKER_09]: There's construction now being done further out so the buses again cannot take that turn.

2310
03:10:40,795 --> 03:10:45,156
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, waiting and pulling out off the sidewalk.

2311
03:10:45,196 --> 03:10:50,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can get a report back, because I'd like to, you know,

2312
03:10:50,965 --> 03:11:02,391
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly move on this and, uh, and, and get the final word on, um, eliminating that bus stop until the construction is done before somebody gets, uh, seriously injured.

2313
03:11:02,471 --> 03:11:03,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

2314
03:11:03,272 --> 03:11:03,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2315
03:11:04,252 --> 03:11:08,455
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

2316
03:11:08,475 --> 03:11:12,117
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2317
03:11:12,217 --> 03:11:12,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2318
03:11:12,757 --> 03:11:14,398
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-375 offered by President Caraviglia.

2319
03:11:15,058 --> 03:11:20,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offers its condolences to the family of Giovanni

2320
03:11:20,578 --> 03:11:23,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Gio Maggiore, who passed away this last week.

2321
03:11:24,219 --> 03:11:36,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Gio was the son of Medford School teacher, Maya Maggiore, and it's a lot more tragic when it's a little small child that passes away, and it seems to hit home a little bit more.

2322
03:11:37,322 --> 03:11:38,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could stand for a moment of silence.

2323
03:11:48,665 --> 03:11:48,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2324
03:11:51,406 --> 03:11:51,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Records.

2325
03:11:53,027 --> 03:11:53,828
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll pass the council.

2326
03:11:54,748 --> 03:11:55,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lockhart.

2327
03:11:56,430 --> 03:11:57,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lockhart.

2328
03:11:57,290 --> 03:11:58,371
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, President Carvalho.

2329
03:11:58,431 --> 03:12:11,600
[SPEAKER_30]: Just before we adjourn, I just want to congratulate all those who ran the Boston Marathon, especially Medford residents, including our colleague, George Scarpelli's wife, Dina, Kelly, and Chris Shields.

2330
03:12:11,720 --> 03:12:18,445
[SPEAKER_30]: There were a number of Medford residents, and we were tracking them with our phones, so they did amazing, and it was a great, beautiful day.

2331
03:12:18,838 --> 03:12:19,579
[SPEAKER_30]: Congratulations.

2332
03:12:19,679 --> 03:12:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, if I could, it wasn't me that was running.

2333
03:12:23,262 --> 03:12:24,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just tracking it.

2334
03:12:24,663 --> 03:12:25,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, it was my wife.

2335
03:12:26,064 --> 03:12:26,845
[SPEAKER_09]: She did a great job.

2336
03:12:26,885 --> 03:12:27,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Very proud of her.

2337
03:12:28,146 --> 03:12:31,129
[SPEAKER_09]: She was exhausting, but she did a heck of a job.

2338
03:12:31,309 --> 03:12:31,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Proud of her.

2339
03:12:34,672 --> 03:12:42,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out what a great job long-time Medford resident David McGillivray, Boston Marathon race director, has been doing.

2340
03:12:42,098 --> 03:12:42,659
[SPEAKER_19]: My classmate.

2341
03:12:42,799 --> 03:12:44,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and he's been involved.

2342
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:44,220
1972.

2343
03:12:44,740 --> 03:12:48,583
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been involved in this race now, I think it's for the last 40 or so years.

2344
03:12:49,204 --> 03:12:56,009
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that I heard on the radio today that was amazing to me, Mr. President, was that he's at the starting line at Hopkington when the gun goes off.

2345
03:12:56,329 --> 03:12:59,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Then he's at the finish line on Boylston Street when the first wave comes through.

2346
03:12:59,845 --> 03:13:03,427
[SPEAKER_19]: And then at eight o'clock at night, he's back in Hopkinton running the race himself.

2347
03:13:04,127 --> 03:13:11,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so it just shows what a commitment and what a love he has for the sport and how, uh, he's been able to turn this passion into a career and it really is inspiring.

2348
03:13:11,590 --> 03:13:13,351
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to thank Dave for all his work as well.

2349
03:13:13,991 --> 03:13:16,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to congratulate Dina for finishing the race.

2350
03:13:16,813 --> 03:13:17,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

2351
03:13:17,633 --> 03:13:23,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, also to, uh, Medford resident, uh, who actually grew up here, uh, Joe LeBlanc.

2352
03:13:23,496 --> 03:13:28,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he actually, uh, lives in Malden, but he grew up here in Medford and he actually ran for charity as well.

2353
03:13:28,458 --> 03:13:28,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

2354
03:13:29,153 --> 03:13:30,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to him as well.

2355
03:13:30,473 --> 03:13:30,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2356
03:13:33,694 --> 03:13:35,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Records, we'll pass to Councilor Knight.

2357
03:13:35,135 --> 03:13:41,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

2358
03:13:42,037 --> 03:13:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Ricky Cormier, 115 Middlesex Ave.

2359
03:13:43,697 --> 03:13:45,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to congratulate my sister, Julianne Cormier.

2360
03:13:46,138 --> 03:13:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: She ran for Camp Shriver, and she finished the race in just over five hours, so she did a great job.

2361
03:13:51,840 --> 03:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

2362
03:13:52,660 --> 03:13:52,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2363
03:13:54,580 --> 03:13:57,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Records were passed to Councilor Knight.

2364
03:13:57,321 --> 03:13:59,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

2365
03:14:03,743 --> 03:14:09,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight has asked the records be tabled for one week so he can perform an extensive review.

2366
03:14:10,945 --> 03:14:14,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2367
03:14:14,967 --> 03:14:15,607
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2368
03:14:15,627 --> 03:14:18,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Meeting adjourned.
