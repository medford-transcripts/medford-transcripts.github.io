    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=27.058s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=28.219s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=31.2s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=37.425s">stands</a>  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=49.698s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to take the paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=54.704s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=55.485s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=56.626s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=57.767s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=60.467s">Mr.</a>  President, I move to take paper 1771, the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance, from the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=66.011s">It</a>  is eligible this evening for its third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=68.552s">This</a>  is a paper that has gone through the subcommittee process and through the committee of the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=72.395s">And</a>  what it is, Mr. President, is it's a proposal to ensure that people that are bidding on public contracts here in the city of Medford comply with the wage and hour laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=81.521s">It</a>  requires that a series of certifications are made <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=84.408s">and</a>  a series of statements of credibility I made to the administration so that when they're awarding a contract, the individuals that are awarded the contract have not been found in violation of any wage and hour laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=95.53s">Wage</a>  theft is a problem across the country, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=98.19s">It's</a>  something that we see here in Massachusetts a lot of times with contracts like cleaning contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=103.171s">For</a>  example, the high school has a cleaning contract, and they may bring people in to clean the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=108.812s">And</a>  the prevailing wage rate, which they are supposed to be paid by law, is $26 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=113.552s">But</a>  these employees are hourly workers that make $18 an hour when not working on the prevailing wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=118.134s">And</a>  their employer will withhold those funds, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=120.435s">So</a>  they're actually employers that are stealing money from their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=123.576s">So</a>  this ordinance requires that people that are bidding on public projects that are covered under the prevailing wage laws and other state and federal hour and wage laws, Mr. President, are in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=133.521s">They</a>  inform the city whether or not they've been found in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=137.042s">And</a>  they take out certain bonds if they have been found in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=141.238s">With</a>  us here this evening, we have some individuals that were instrumental in putting this work, this ordinance together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=146.985s">This</a>  is a paper that was originated through a group called Community Labor United. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=151.39s">It's</a>  been a matter that's been endorsed and supported by the Greater Boston Labor Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=155.134s">And</a>  here this evening with us from the Greater Boston Labor Council, we have Rich Rogers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=159.2s">We</a>  also have representing Sean O'Brien from Local 25, James Donovan, political director. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=164.681s">We</a>  have from Local 537, Bill Young here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=168.562s">I'd</a>  be remiss not to mention Louie Mandarini from Local 22, a long-time Medford resident, Mr. President, who was instrumental in crafting this language and also helped with some technical assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=178.604s">And</a>  also with us we have Phil Reason from the Painters Union here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=181.785s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a paper that Mayor Burke and I worked on in concert with the individuals that have been forementioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=187.39s">It's</a>  something that I wholeheartedly support and I'd ask my colleagues this evening to vote in favor of it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=192.712s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=195.152s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=196.473s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=198.733s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=222.864s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=223.124s">17</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=227.826s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=228.626s">While</a>  we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=246.055s">Petition</a>  for sign denial reversal by Jason Perillo of BAC may sign for George's Bakery, 25 Hall Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=255.443s">OCD</a>  application 2017-3 exceeds allowable size 94-307-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=259.286s">Vice</a>  President Marks is chairman of the sign committee.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=272.803s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, we have the petition in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=274.964s">If</a>  you can just give us a brief synopsis on the sign itself.</p>

    <p>[Jason Perullo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=280.686s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=282.967s">I'm</a>  Jason Perillo with Back Bay sign company. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=285.728s">Um,</a>  our petition to hear tonight is to ask petition to ask for permission to install a wall sign for George's bakery products incorporated over at 25 hall street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=297.142s">The</a>  sign that we propose this evening is 35 square feet over what the ordinance allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=302.504s">The</a>  building is 111 feet wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=305.565s">Um,</a>  the sign is designed to fit the architecture of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=309.506s">Um,</a>  the sign is not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=311.727s">There</a>  are no residences that can see the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=314.808s">And,</a>  um, if you, uh, George is also here this evening, if you have any questions for the business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=319.39s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=319.91s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=324.252s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=326.68s">I</a>  see no reason to object to this request for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=333.702s">This</a>  gentleman brings business and good commerce to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=339.884s">It's</a>  a decent family business, and we wish them all the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=346.366s">And</a>  I have no objection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=347.567s">Motion</a>  for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=348.947s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=349.887s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=351.028s">Mr.</a>  President, George's Bakery has been in this community for a very long time without incident, without <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=355.785s">issue.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=356.465s">Um,</a>  I get some bread from there every once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=358.306s">I'm</a>  not going to lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=359.426s">And,</a>  um, I certainly think that, uh, this proposal that's before us this evening is within reason and, um, meets the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance, uh, relative to signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=367.97s">And</a>  I too move for approval with a second to councilor Dello Russo's motion.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=372.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=373.192s">Vice-president</a>  Moxley. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=374.212s">Do</a>  you motion for motion for approval?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=376.433s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=377.693s">Uh,</a>  based on the paperwork submitted, uh, and the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=383.261s">rendering</a>  of the sign itself and the location of the sign, I, too, see no concern with the size of the sign, even though it's nonconforming to existing zoning sign ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=401.07s">And</a>  at this point, Mr. President, it's not internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=408.194s">And</a>  at this point, I would move approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=411.355s">On</a>  the motion by vice president marks, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=416.077s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=417.337s">Oh,</a>  I have, I have, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=420.319s">Um,</a>  Councilor Marks is the sign a committee chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=423.7s">Right?</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=424.62s">Motion</a>  comes from the sign chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=426.141s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=428.182s">And</a>  seconded by councilor Donald Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=429.742s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=431.843s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=433.744s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=434.444s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=435.525s">So</a>  George, good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=438.226s">Um,</a>  if we could also take, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=443.033s">17352,</a>  the nominees while they're here, that were appointed last week that are coming here to be vetted this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=457.041s">Mr.</a>  Scott, would you second that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=458.462s">I</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=459.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=461.224s">This</a>  evening, we have some people that were selected to be on the Community Preservation Committee, and under the rule of transparency, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=471.676s">We</a>  feel that it's good to vet all these candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=475.599s">So</a>  at this point, while they're here, when we ask your name, if you could please come to the podium and give us a little brief resume. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=486.388s">Is</a>  Jones here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=487.309s">Jones</a>  here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=492.193s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=493.834s">Jones</a>  here, 40 Cedar Road North, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=497.485s">So</a>  I sent an application in to the mayor for a seat on the Community Preservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=503.847s">As</a>  many of you know, I'm a resident of Medford, 17 years, was part of the Preserve Medford campaign committee a couple years ago to collect signatures to get the CPA on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=513.969s">And</a>  when it did pass, I was a member of the ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=517.287s">that</a>  was assembled to draft the ordinance and to usher it to completion to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=523.694s">In</a>  the application, it stated, you know, that an applicant should be a resident who has expertise or demonstrated interest in open space, recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=536.266s">And</a>  that's what I sort of applied for because <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=540.39s">improving</a>  these things in the city of Medford is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=543.254s">I</a>  know that these are the things that are usually on the bottom of the list when it comes to budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=547.099s">Of</a>  course, police, fire, safety, those kinds of things are much more important and usually get the dollars, and these ones don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=553.908s">So</a>  this is one of the reasons why <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=555.697s">I</a>  really felt that we could bring some good dollars to Medford, that we could improve the city and bring money into Medford by improving the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=562.539s">So</a>  my certification as a project manager, one of the things that I do is I help the others that are in the room kind of use their expertise and bring it to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=572.622s">So</a>  I'm the one who sort of helps people remove roadblocks, bring people together, open communication, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=578.784s">And</a>  that is the expertise that I could bring to this committee to kind of help the process move along and keep in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=584.58s">That's</a>  why I applied, and I would appreciate your support, and I really do hope to help Medford become a more inviting city.</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=927.256s">I</a>  mean, it's concerning that it's dwindling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=930.576s">I</a>  hope that positive projects and positive success of the initiative will give reason <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=940.225s">that</a>  are matching in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=944.269s">So</a>  hopefully the success of the initiative will continue its longevity.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=977.795s">Joseph</a>  Pecora, 25 Adams Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=981.477s">You</a>  want to give a little brief synopsis of yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=984.359s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=985.34s">I've</a>  been living in Medford for about five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=988.662s">And</a>  I work as a real estate agent out of Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=993.665s">I've</a>  been practicing as a real estate agent for about 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=997.388s">I</a>  come from the trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=999.75s">My</a>  family's involved with development in the suburbs, in the metro Boston region. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1005.974s">And</a>  I think I bring the experience both as <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1011.241s">real</a>  estate agent and as a contractor to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1015.023s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to working on the committee.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1040.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1041.613s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1043.374s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1044.734s">And</a>  this may be a good opportunity for members of the committee to meet each other also, which is a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1054.177s">Joe,</a>  knowing that you're in the field of real estate, what are your thoughts about what this community needs in regards to affordable housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1064.74s">Do</a>  you think we're where we should be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1066.88s">Do</a>  you think that there's a need for additional <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1070.412s">affordable</a>  housing?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1071.213s">I</a>  don't know what the numbers are, what the stats reflect, but I know that's a concern as prices continue to soar. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1078.459s">I</a>  know in other areas closer to, you know, Cambridge, Somerville and those markets, Somerville's been seeing real new price points, a million dollar condos left and right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1088.287s">I</a>  know Medford's been <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1089.639s">moving</a>  up as well in terms of price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1091.159s">And</a>  I think it's a pretty big concern for the community, pushing people out and not having a fairly decent mix of people from all walks of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1100.422s">And</a>  I think it's important to consider and to work toward making sure that we create opportunities that are affordable for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1109.245s">I</a>  would imagine that Medford is feeling a pinch as well, rents as well as sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1116.125s">I</a>  know just recently, the other day on North Street, there were a couple of condos that sold for a million dollars, almost a million in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1124.967s">So</a>  people are talking about price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1126.707s">Rents</a>  are high. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1127.547s">And,</a>  yeah, I think it's a pretty significant question or point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1133.388s">We</a>  ought to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1135.269s">Mr.</a>  President, so far, we've seen three candidates, and they all have their own expertise and style. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1143.455s">And</a>  it's refreshing to hear Joe just mention the fact that with the housing market, as we know, in Cambridge, Somerville, and Method is experiencing right now, that there is a lack of affordability in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1156.32s">And</a>  I know with my children and other children in the community, that's a big concern that eventually someday they may not be able to afford to live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1165.264s">And</a>  when you hear Joe mention that, that is something that's on his radar, and he's well aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1171.366s">It</a>  makes me feel comfortable as one member <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1173.474s">Although</a>  a million dollars every year may not go far to adding a lot of additional affordable housing, but it's something that this committee will be responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1183.659s">So,</a>  I also, Mr. President, move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1186.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1188.181s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1193.243s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1193.963s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1195.084s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1195.824s">Congratulations</a>  and thank you for your time and volunteers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1204.892s">Heidi</a>  Davis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1208.993s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1214.234s">Just</a>  those four, we're not gonna do the other ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1217.675s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1226.137s">And</a>  we're just waiting for Roberta to come, she'll be in later and we'll do her when she gets here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1234.025s">We'll</a>  table this until Roberta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1235.507s">Yeah,</a>  table the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1237.749s">On</a>  the motion to table by Councilor Lungo-Koehn and seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1244.196s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1246.779s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1249.703s">Councilor</a>  Knight has requested a brief recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1253.487s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1431.54s">Motion</a>  to return back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1434.281s">While</a>  we're under suspension, 17370, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council vote to support the establishment of a local historic district at 21 Toro Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1450.548s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1452.149s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1455.01s">There</a>  was a number of meetings and a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1458.482s">neighbors</a>  that were concerned about the property at 21 Toro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1465.784s">It</a>  was purchased about a year ago and the neighborhood really worked with the Medford Historical Commission to create a local historic district for 21 Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1480.668s">It's</a>  something that the neighborhood is extremely excited about and it was quite refreshing having attended those meetings with <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1488.027s">a</a>  few of my colleagues, refreshing to have the owners of 21 Toro Ave be on board and almost excited about this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1496.614s">So</a>  it's something that's long overdue for the council approval, and I would like to vote on that tonight, that we make 21 Toro Ave a local historic district to preserve the history of the property and into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1511.928s">This</a>  will <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1512.864s">be</a>  recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and it's something that is long overdue to be voted by the Council, and hopefully we can all support this and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1520.467s">And</a>  I believe we're the last step in getting this push forward, so I think it's something that we need to act on sooner than later.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1529.43s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locren.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1531.291s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1532.751s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1533.651s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locren, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1537.853s">I,</a>  too, went to those meetings, and I think it's so important <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1541.048s">I</a>  think we also visited that whole neighborhood and visiting <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1544.578s">And</a>  looking into that, I believe that we also voted during budget time to approve some funding to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1551.682s">That</a>  would be something that, if we can, to maybe help us where we are with those monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1557.165s">Have</a>  they been expended? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1560.086s">I</a>  believe that we were putting the, not the monuments, but there was the plaques at historical locations.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1571.562s">I</a>  know that we were looking to... Typically, we have not provided plaques, but we can certainly... Excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1577.146s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1577.567s">Let</a>  me introduce myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1579.468s">My</a>  name is Chris Bader. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1580.589s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1582.83s">298</a>  High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1585.272s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Historic District Commission, and we're in charge of creating new historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1592.277s">Sorry,</a>  Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1592.558s">And</a>  as you say, we should absolutely put a plaque indicating this is the King House <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1600.02s">with</a>  its construction date, approximate construction date of the 1840s. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1604.424s">It's</a>  part of the historic, it's an important historic building in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1613.112s">And</a>  let me just give you a brief summary of the events that led to this becoming <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1625.114s">a</a>  candidate for her local historic district, which is that it was owned by Tufts University, and they kind of pulled a fast one on the grandfather's house, where they subdivided it with no public input, and then sold the entire property to a contractor who immediately sold off grandfather's house itself, and built a <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1651.239s">prefab</a>  house on the remaining property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1655.08s">And</a>  everyone was upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1657.421s">Then</a>  they wanted to do exactly the same thing on 21 Turo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1662.002s">They</a>  had no intention of destroying the historic house, but they had their eye on that very juicy piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1669.104s">The</a>  neighbors were outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1672.005s">It</a>  was really a grassroots uprising, you might even say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1679.114s">And</a>  finally, the Tufts and the new perspective owner backed down and agreed to sell it to someone who agreed not to subdivide the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1692.399s">I</a>  think historic districts, part of our job is not just to preserve historic buildings, but to preserve open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1700.681s">And</a>  a lot of these historic houses are on big lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1704.863s">And</a>  the neighbors want to keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1709.747s">It</a>  was tentatively resolved with the new owners that they would put a historic preservation restriction on the deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1717.954s">Now,</a>  the problem is this is a historic preservation deed of preservation restriction of limited duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1726.88s">And</a>  moreover, the building department does not have easy access to preservation restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1733.105s">It's</a>  there at the registry of deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1735.88s">But</a>  it's not something there that a building inspector is going to be able to look at in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1743.563s">So</a>  we decided we would, in addition to the historic preservation restriction, we would seek local historical status. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1753.687s">We</a>  sent out, there's an elaborate process spelled out by the Mass Historical Commission, which we followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1760.39s">It</a>  took about a year to actually get it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1764.031s">We</a>  held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1766.549s">We</a>  were actually amazed to find that no one opposed it, including the owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1771.532s">In</a>  fact, they really were delighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1774.474s">We</a>  held this public hearing after a 60-day waiting period and blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1781.538s">And</a>  really, the last step is now for you guys to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1785.981s">It</a>  requires per Massachusetts General Laws 40C, it requires a 2 3rds vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1795.508s">of</a>  the City Council, that means five of you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1801.45s">And</a>  we would appreciate your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1804.771s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1806.512s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1819.596s">Define</a>  21 Toro Ave.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1821.596s">It</a>  is the current, it is the house <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1824.17s">And</a>  the current property that is registered at the Registry of Deeds as 21 Turo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1832.271s">So</a>  it is both, this is not something that can be subdivided or built on without the permission of the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1841.973s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1859.85s">Have</a>  we received any communique on this from the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1863.953s">We</a>  have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1864.813s">The</a>  city solicitor has the habit of speaking for himself.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1870.758s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1875.341s">Basically,</a>  there was very basic language added to the existing bylaws of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1882.66s">in</a>  accordance with Master Nolan's 40C, and the city solicitor approved that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1890.324s">Basically,</a>  there's nothing in there besides adding the King House to the list of the other two historic districts in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1901.968s">Otherwise,</a>  no changes whatsoever to the Medford bylaws.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1918.948s">And</a>  right now, um, this would bring this, if we take this to a vote this evening, it would bring this issue of 21 to wrap the finality and it would have its single home historic district classification.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1927.991s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1941.643s">That</a>  are in immediate danger of subdivision As the reason for the developer buying them not that I'm aware of no There are of course historic houses all over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1953.611s">They</a>  need protection and we're working on a plan to a general plan to protect these houses particularly those <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1965.752s">in</a>  close to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1969.573s">For</a>  example, the Andrew House, the David Osgood House, which is owned by the Unitarian Church but is in very poor condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1979.156s">And</a>  we don't think Grandfather's House is in any danger at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1983.138s">The</a>  damage has already been done with the construction of the prefab house that was built next to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1992.801s">So</a>  we're focusing <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=1994.641s">at</a>  the moment houses near, uh, uh, uh, square.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2000.265s">And</a>  if the council were to vote on this tonight, do you know when it would become effective?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2005.469s">Is</a>  it something that, uh, you would have to talk to the city solicitor about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2009.832s">But,</a>  but I would believe it would be effective immediately.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2012.794s">Effective</a>  immediately.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2130.358s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2134.619s">I</a>  know that the demo delay, Chapter 48, isn't <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2140.59s">subcommittee,</a>  so I'm not sure what councils have been able to read it, but I believe the commission and myself or whoever will be able to get a copy to anybody that hasn't, um, this proposal was voted in favor by the Medford historical commission and it is outlined in yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2159.688s">Um,</a>  the version I have outlined in yellow with the potential changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2165.998s">And</a>  obviously, one of the biggest changes is we currently have a six-month demo delay that has been around for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2175.165s">But</a>  times are changing, and a number of different communities are moving towards extending their demo delay or already have a 12-, 18-, or 24-month demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2186.094s">I</a>  know that, I believe, Winchester's working on pushing it to a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2193.219s">Watertown</a>  has 24 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2195.877s">has</a>  an extended demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2197.998s">Lexington,</a>  Concord, they're at Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2201.38s">There</a>  are a number of cities and towns around us that do have a demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2208.444s">The</a>  commission in their annual report, Medford Historical Commission in their annual report, it shows 2016, the amount of demo delays is up, I don't know, would you say 90%? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2226.407s">The</a>  norm was about one to two requests for a demolition of a historical property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2232.168s">This</a>  current ordinance we have is anything 1900 or above, built in 1900 or above. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2240.369s">In</a>  2016, not only were there 17 applications for demo delays, but the historic commission found that 17 properties were historically significant and preferably preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2256.191s">So</a>  I think that's an important factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2257.812s">It</a>  goes to show that times really are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2261.174s">We've</a>  had uproar in the city over a number of different parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2266.436s">Walnut</a>  Street brings to mind what's been, as of recent, you have 18 Walnut Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2273.34s">You</a>  have the property across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2275.481s">You</a>  also have a property that was listed, and I'm not going to name the address, but listed, and I believe it was listed on MLS, because I do have access to MLS. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2285.435s">did</a>  read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2285.995s">I</a>  don't have it in front of me, but it was advertised as a single-family home that could be turned into four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2294.082s">So</a>  that's a problem to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2296.164s">It's</a>  a problem to our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2297.625s">The</a>  residents in the community are not happy with the current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2302.729s">And</a>  the six-month delay is not deterring what it used to deter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2309.454s">You</a>  can go over the Walnut Street property and what's going on there, and that gives you significant proof of <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2314.508s">you</a>  know, what I just stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2317.049s">So</a>  why is the delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2318.889s">And</a>  this is put, this is question and answers that have been put out by the historical commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2323.51s">Why</a>  is the delay being changed from six months to 24 months or potentially why are we requesting that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2329.091s">Why</a>  am I asking the council to support this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2331.652s">Um,</a>  primarily because the commission has found that the present six month delay is not effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2336.693s">The</a>  commission has seen numerous cases where owners or developers have showed no interest in working with either the commission <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2343.002s">or</a>  the neighborhood to look at alternatives to demolition and simply waited out the six-month demo delay time frame and demolished the property anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2352.608s">A</a>  larger potential demo delay time frame of up to 24 months is generally too long a time frame for a project to become dormant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2360.513s">And</a>  the commission feels that the extra time will give the demo delay some teeth and leverage that will serve Medford and our neighborhoods better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2369.054s">and</a>  why the changes are being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2371.496s">And</a>  I just stated already over the last five minutes, there are several significant historic buildings that have been demoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2381.162s">Residents</a>  have been upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2382.703s">And</a>  as the real estate market continues to improve, no more vacant land exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2386.705s">The</a>  threat of Medford's historic buildings is ever increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2390.368s">The</a>  proposed bylaws tries to address these concerns by providing time to research alternatives to demo before any more historic buildings are lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2399.22s">It</a>  also clarifies previously undefined terms and creates a standard set of mandates for applicants to complete in order for the commission to lift the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2407.602s">I</a>  know we have a number of residents, and we have Ryan Haywood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2411.703s">I</a>  reached out to him last week after I got emails and phone calls from concerned residents on the Walnut Street property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2420.085s">And</a>  you see Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2422.166s">There's</a>  a number of people that are interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2424.446s">And</a>  I believe the time is now, whether we have a Committee of the Whole meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2428.572s">or</a>  we decide to move forward with this tonight, I think it's something that we need to move on quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2435.974s">Ryan</a>  was gracious enough to meet with me, and I know he'll meet with or has met with other Councilors as well to explain in depth what the ordinance entails, the proposed changes to it, how they will affect in more detail than I can give the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2451.298s">And</a>  I think it's a win-win, and I think it's something that we need to discuss and move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2457.695s">leave</a>  it to the residents who thankfully came tonight to support the paper.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2461.676s">Councilor</a>  Scott Beally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2462.876s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2463.676s">Again,</a>  I thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2468.117s">This</a>  issue is greater than what it reads itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2472.098s">I</a>  think that what we're seeing in our community with our questions in zoning and lack of true development plan, I think it <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2480.888s">This</a>  one key issue really sums up what we're seeing as probably the number one now major issue and concern in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2491.792s">I</a>  too was part of the subcommittee that saw this as an issue and moved it forward for 12 months with a possible another six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2502.049s">So</a>  looking at that 18 months, that's something we wholeheartedly supported in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2506.752s">I</a>  think that it is still was brought back and then put to the city solicitor for final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2516.499s">I</a>  think that bringing this forward kind of gives you that kickstart that we need to get a final answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2524.024s">And</a>  whether it's in committee of the whole or in the open meetings to get this <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2531.405s">get</a>  this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2532.046s">I</a>  think it's very important because what we are seeing is free reign throughout our community and making sure right now, looking at a historical community and tying that <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2545.067s">and</a>  holding that off where we have that control right now, I think is vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2549.708s">So</a>  I appreciate my fellow council bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2553.549s">I</a>  appreciate all the hard work and the emails that I did receive from multiple community members and concerns that were brought forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2562.01s">I</a>  know that one member came behind this reel last week and we had a depth conversation because you can hear it in their voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2568.791s">And</a>  when people seeing communities that <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2573.171s">that</a>  we know as of Medford changing right in front of your eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2576.933s">And</a>  it looks like we have no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2578.394s">So</a>  I think this is a great resolution to at least put a stop to this right now and give us a little bit more control as we look into the zoning and development concerns that we do have for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2591.401s">So</a>  I wholeheartedly second this motion and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2596.103s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2599.452s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2601.553s">By</a>  way of history, I'd like to just give a brief breakdown as to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2606.836s">In</a>  June of 2016, the historical commission came before the council during budget hearings and expressed some concern about the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2616.32s">At</a>  that point in time, in June of 2016, I was working on a proposal with Mr. Haywood based upon some recommendations that he had. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2623.29s">and</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn put forward a resolution requesting that the demolition delay be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2628.514s">In</a>  June of 2016, that paper was referred to the Zoning and Ordinance Committee, and it was introduced by way of a subcommittee hearing language. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2636.621s">Language</a>  was put together, and in August of 2016, the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee reported the following changes to 48-78B out of committee favorably for full review and vetting from the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2651.589s">The</a>  first recommendation that the subcommittee made was to strike the figure 1900 and replace that with homes built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2658.632s">Presently,</a>  homes subject to demolition delay have to have been built before the year 1900, and the recommendation of the subcommittee was to strike that and replace it with homes built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2671.356s">Also,</a>  the subcommittee agreed in their committee report, which was reported out favorably, underneath 48-78B, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2679.675s">subsection</a>  H to strike the figure six months and replace it with the figure 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2685.117s">And,</a>  uh, that would be the amount of time for which the demolition delay can take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2688.998s">Um,</a>  also under section I two, um, would be strike six months and replaced with 12 months again, uh, housekeeping to ensure that, uh, the ordinance would reflect that demolition delay would be 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2699.882s">Um,</a>  the subcommittee also recommended that a new section <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2702.552s">be</a>  added to 48-78, which would allow for the historical commission to petition the city council for an additional six months of demolition delay if they felt certain requirements and criterias weren't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2716.281s">This</a>  was reported out of the committee in August of 2016 and set for a committee of the whole hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2725.348s">The</a>  matter was being scheduled for a committee of the whole hearing when the commission asked to hold off and presented us with <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2732.677s">a</a>  revamped ordinance that they wrote that was a little bit more than just increasing the number of years that it takes to make a house eligible for demolition delay and also increasing the amount of time for which they have to delay demolition of a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2750.688s">So</a>  in October of 2016, the historical commission presented those changes to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2755.898s">And</a>  in October of 2016, the subcommittee requested some technical assistance relative to some questions that were raised relative to legalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2764.264s">Those</a>  were sent to the Office of Community Development and the legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2768.686s">Those</a>  questions weren't answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2770.327s">And</a>  in January 2017, there were some subcommittee changes with the change of the leadership to the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2775.531s">So</a>  Councilor Dela Rousseff, Councilor Falco, and Councilor Me, and I now make up the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2782.73s">In</a>  February of 2017, a meeting notice was posted to reconvene and discuss this matter where we had not received any response from the administration, at which time a snowstorm struck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2793.355s">And</a>  the meeting was canceled because City Hall was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2795.375s">So</a>  that brings us to February 2017, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2798.097s">So</a>  it appears that as of August 2016, the subcommittee had reported out a paper favorably to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2808.441s">And</a>  there is a paper that is now at the Committee of the Whole that would address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2812.093s">The</a>  recommendations were to increase the number of years for which a home would be eligible for a demolition delay to be built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2819.4s">It</a>  would also give a 12-month automatic demolition delay with the ability for the commission to petition this council for an opportunity for an additional six months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2830.872s">Recommendations</a>  still remain on the table and can be brought up at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2833.614s">We</a>  can move forward on those tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2835.875s">The</a>  proposed ordinance that the commission put together was a little bit more inclusive than just addressing issues of time and of delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2848.004s">And</a>  there was a number of concerns that were raised by the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2850.125s">The</a>  subcommittee was waiting to get some answers back from the administration's legal team and community development team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2855.449s">That</a>  hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2856.289s">And</a>  we share the frustration that the individuals behind the rail share <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2859.384s">However,</a>  if the matter is just as simple as increasing the number of years to look at a house and the amount of time to delay demolition, there's a paper that's sitting right in our Committee of the Whole right now that we can act on, Mr. President, and that will address that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2871.311s">And</a>  then we can go and continue to properly vet the proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2874.073s">And</a>  that's the course of action that I would recommend.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2876.214s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2877.795s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2879.836s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2881.137s">And,</a>  you know, this is such an important ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2887.198s">And</a>  in my opinion, waiting for a legal opinion, waiting for the administration to move on something is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2898.248s">And</a>  I'd rather see something put forward and have us worry about maybe some ramifications down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2906.696s">I'd</a>  rather see some protections in place right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2911.48s">And</a>  what makes this community so unique <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2914.73s">is</a>  the, and you hear it over and over again, is the very uniqueness of every neighborhood, Mr. President, and every style of home in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2925.256s">And</a>  slowly but surely, we're losing the style of this community to these large salt box type homes and condominium projects, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2937.937s">all</a>  for the sake of adding additional units and additional money for the developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2945.861s">And</a>  as was mentioned earlier, many of these older homes are on larger properties, like on Walnut, that have additional space. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2956.186s">And</a>  the developers see this nothing more than a way of making additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2961.288s">And</a>  we as a community have to safeguard ourselves <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2964.033s">And</a>  I think this is a great step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2967.915s">I'd</a>  rather see the 75 years extended to 100 years and beyond, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2975.779s">And</a>  the 12 month, in my opinion, is not long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2981.261s">I</a>  think what was offered as 18 month for demolition delay, or even 24 month, at least provides this community with ample opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2991.57s">to</a>  safeguard its historic homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2994.391s">So</a>  I personally would like to see us take a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=2998.333s">I</a>  think that's what Councilor Lungo-Koehn has requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3001.654s">The</a>  resolve says from six months to 18 or 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3005.516s">I</a>  think we have to narrow it down naturally before we vote on it, because you can't have 18 or 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3010.898s">It</a>  has to be one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3012.879s">But</a>  I definitely think, and I'm prepared tonight to move this forward, Mr. President, because I've been around a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3022.045s">and</a>  I'm not gonna wait to hear with an opinion that may be rendered down the line that we've been waiting on already for six months, because I'd rather move forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3033.847s">This</a>  is long overdue, and I would support the resolution tonight, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3041.568s">Thank</a>  you, I wanna get to allow the speakers to speak, but I too would be agreeable to even if we vote for a demo delay, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3051.293s">tonight,</a>  whether it be the 12 months that the committee discussed with an extension of six months or an 18 month demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3057.255s">I</a>  think we should move forward on a vote like that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3060.935s">And</a>  then we do have a number of other changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3063.456s">Maybe</a>  we can meet in committee of the whole to discuss changing the ordinance completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3067.917s">But</a>  I think we need to move forward on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3069.798s">And</a>  I think the votes may be here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3071.658s">So</a>  I'd like to hear from the speakers and I'm agreeable to my colleagues.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3076.919s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3077.7s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3079.498s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, ask Councilor Knight again to restate his recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3084.763s">I</a>  believe that he was suggesting that we had something in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3090.608s">We</a>  have two contrasting things, so I just want some clarity, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3094.912s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3096.413s">The</a>  recommendation of the subcommittee coming out of the August subcommittee report, which was favorable and unanimous, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3103.974s">would</a>  be to strike the figure 1900. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3106.036s">Right</a>  now it said any home built before 1900 was subject to a demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3110.079s">We</a>  wanted to reduce that figure to any home built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3113.362s">That</a>  was the recommendation of the committee that was reported out favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3117.005s">That's</a>  subsection B under ordinance 48-78. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3122.249s">We</a>  also have the opportunity to strike the figure six months and replace it with 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3127.494s">And</a>  that was a reference to the amount of time for which the demolition delay would be in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3131.545s">That's</a>  under 48-78H. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3135.166s">And</a>  we also have a reference to six months in 48-78I, subsection 2, which also made a reference to a six-month demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3144.068s">And</a>  the recommendation of the committee was to strike that and replace it with 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3148.108s">So</a>  the committee made an initial recommendation to change the purview of homes that are subject to a demolition delay from houses that were built before 1900 to houses that were built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3158.891s">So</a>  that would be a rolling scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3161.722s">Um,</a>  we also agreed to give a 12 month demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3165.505s">And</a>  then there was new language that was reported out favorably, which said that, um, the commission would have the right to petition the city council for a delay of an additional six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3174.292s">So</a>  that would give us 18 months of demolition delay if they could show that certain criteria weren't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3178.936s">And</a>  that was the recommendation that was reported out of the subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3181.518s">And</a>  that, uh, if I could, again, through the chair, that was all agreed to or arrived at with input from the commission and also, uh, the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3191.193s">At</a>  Alia?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3193.054s">That</a>  is correct, Mr. President, Councilor de la Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3195.696s">The</a>  commission and the council met on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3198.799s">The</a>  language changes were minor in nature and didn't raise any question or concern about legality. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3204.763s">When</a>  we started getting into a two-year demolition delay and some of the changes that were in place, some concerns came up relative to whether or not there would be legal standing as to whether or not that was a land-taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3216.292s">Some</a>  questions and concerns about financing of projects and stuff, stuff that really <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3221.154s">I</a>  think warranted concern, but not stuff that should be a deal breaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3225.237s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3225.597s">Number</a>  two, I think that, you know, moving forward, we have some recommendations from the subcommittee that met that are sitting on the table at the committee of the whole that will address the issues in the ordinance that are brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3235.184s">They</a>  will extend the demolition delay period of time from six months to 18 months or a year guaranteed and potentially 18 months if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3244.711s">And</a>  it will also change the type of home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3247.631s">that</a>  is subject to a demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3249.172s">And</a>  that's something that I could support this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3251.334s">I</a>  have the subsections and the languages, the language before me this evening and I'm writing it up right now for the city clerk and I'll present that by way of a motion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3258.979s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3259.319s">And</a>  so if I could, so then if I remember correctly, we were prepared to have a committee of the whole meeting on those proposals, yet we were asked not to by the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3271.607s">So</a>  they had additional additional items that they wanted to put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3276.515s">And</a>  then once we got those, the sequence events happened that we haven't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3284.937s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3288.559s">I</a>  think we need to sort out what has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3292.0s">Do</a>  that in the Committee of the Whole, at your discretion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3297.061s">And</a>  also have the assistance, the paper was reported out to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3301.282s">And</a>  I have the assistance of the city solicitor present with us to lend his expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3310.429s">I'm</a>  not at this point asking to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3314.972s">I</a>  will not support the motion that's before us to vote and approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3319.615s">I'm</a>  not going to support an ordinance change without three readings until we have clear language and the opportunity to come to clarity on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3331.348s">with</a>  papers before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3332.549s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3392.442s">Are</a>  you good, Council Member? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3394.063s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3395.404s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3396.705s">It's</a>  Ryan Hayward, 40 Sheridan Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3400.647s">Councilors</a>  and friends of Medford history, I promise to be succinct tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3405.11s">Tonight,</a>  I stand before you as the chairman of the Medford Historical Commission, where the official municipal bodies charged with the preservation, promotion, and development of historical assets of our hometown. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3417.403s">One</a>  of the many ways we accomplish our mission is by administering the demo delay, which is before you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3423.006s">And</a>  it was adopted in 1994 by this very board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3427.229s">It</a>  was established for protecting the city's significant historical, cultural, and architectural buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3432.172s">And</a>  if invoked, the delay period is a maximum currently of six months and only applicable to buildings built before 1900. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3439.336s">The</a>  intent of this pause is so that the applicant can make reasonable, continued, and bona fide efforts to save the irreplaceable asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3447.982s">In</a>  most cases, however, the commission has found that the existing bylaw is ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3455.827s">And</a>  the commission has found that we have little influence over the course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3460.971s">Scores</a>  of developers, absentee landlords, neglectful property owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3465.957s">and</a>  profit-seekers have chosen to wait out that short timeline and even build it into their schedules at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3473.001s">We</a>  have found that there is an unsettling trend towards demolition rather than renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3478.363s">Applications</a>  have tripled in the last three years alone, and many of these were notable landmarks that we knew and loved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3486.297s">The</a>  time now is to overhaul this bylaw and make it an effective preservation tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3491.598s">Through</a>  Councilor Knight and now through Councilor Longo-Cohen, I respectfully request that the City Council immediately move forward with the demolition delay revision of Chapter 48, Article 4, as presented in subcommittee to the demo delay subcommittee last September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3507.202s">This</a>  is not the original bylaw that was proposed before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3510.87s">I</a>  respectfully disagree with Councilor Knight that the commission had no input on that and that unfortunately we got word after the fact that that subcommittee did vote and so we put forth our own proposal which went to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3525.67s">Highlights</a>  of these changes include much needed revisions to the definitions, changes to the reviews and timeline, including buildings that are 50 years old to be in compliance with our certified local government status and the National Park Service, including language to discourage demolition by neglect, and most importantly, changing the timeline from six months to two years to give this board the leverage it needs to influence projects involving our historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3553.588s">By</a>  extending the demo delay, we will join scores of other communities that have said yes to better projects, yes to preservation, and yes to ensuring that we have something to leave behind for the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3565.073s">I</a>  look to you all for your support, as it should be clear that you have our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3570.836s">And</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have on this as you guys move forward in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3577.284s">Just</a>  to be clear, too, the question was raised about properties that were up for demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3582.306s">I</a>  mentioned in my annual report that I will have sent to the mayor tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3588.208s">There</a>  were 18 properties that came under review last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3591.729s">Only</a>  six of them fell under the demolition delay, but we reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3596.74s">I</a>  reviewed personally, at least double that amount that were not applicable to the review, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3602.505s">So</a>  we're losing buildings on a month-to-month basis, and sometimes more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3607.47s">There</a>  are six buildings that have already come up, two of which are currently going through the process of demo delay review, one on Codding Street, one on Walnut Street, which is just coming up for the first leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3620.855s">And</a>  then there is, I've heard, gotten word that there's another building just down the street from the other Codding Street building, which is currently under review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3628.02s">So</a>  there are several buildings which are coming up and just being bought, all of which have been owned by longtime owners, absentee landlords at this point, or have approached owners to sell their historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3639.427s">So</a>  this is an ever-increasing problem that I see will not be going away in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3644.43s">So</a>  by changing this bylaw and doing it right now and doing it once, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3649.273s">And</a>  being all-inclusive, it will afford us some time to be able to continue to influence projects in lieu of zoning until you guys are ready to change zoning.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3660.197s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3661.138s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3662.658s">Thank</a>  you for coming tonight and explaining that to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3666.54s">If</a>  I could ask you a question with regards to reviewing the entire ordinance and committee of the whole within the next month or two, if we wait, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3674.481s">to</a>  put a demo delay and we don't vote on it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3677.344s">What</a>  does that mean if it's postponed one, two, three, four months? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3680.969s">There's</a>  going to be additional... <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3683.617s">demo</a>  requests that are going to get grandfathered in, and we're not going to be able to stop it.</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3688.241s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3688.641s">I</a>  think you're going to find that there's going to be one of these huge rushes on demolition that anybody who might be even whispering or thinking demolition will put forth an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3697.648s">Long-time</a>  owners who might be thinking of selling will probably put forth an application just so that they can clear the table and clear the hurdle long before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3704.814s">Because</a>  right now, there is no limit on the timeline of determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3709.077s">So</a>  once we make a determination on whether a building is or isn't, unless there's <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3713.05s">significant</a>  reason to change that finding, it's a forever decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3717.312s">So</a>  people can wait out the six-month delay the moment that they have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3721.573s">And</a>  even if they're not selling, then sell the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3723.834s">It's</a>  a vacant lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3725.175s">So</a>  there is no recourse.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3727.155s">And</a>  just to make it clear, you don't have a developer <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3731.538s">doesn't</a>  have to own the property to put in a demo delay, they just have to get approval and signature by the current owner, isn't that correct?</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3737.88s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3738.86s">In</a>  the current case of 18 Walnut, which is coming up for review, the developer is acting as the owner's representative, and I have received a letter of approval from the current building owner, giving him permission to apply for demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3754.505s">So</a>  even before he owns the property, an applicant can <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3758.434s">you</a>  know, apply for the demolition and then just wait it out and have an active purchase and sales agreement and then move forward with a vacant lot as soon as they're ready.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3767.359s">As</a>  one, one Councilor to the chair, I don't see any reason why we can't vote to increase the demo delay tonight, especially where committees reviewed it and move forward with recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3779.045s">Um,</a>  as well as in addition, I'd like to amend my resolve to include that any property 75 years or older be, um, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3788.819s">75</a>  years or older, as the committee discussed and reviewed and put forward, that that be reviewable by the historic commission.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3799.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3802.522s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3802.922s">I</a>  missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3803.782s">Are</a>  you asking me if it's reviewable?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3805.182s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3805.362s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3805.922s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3806.263s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3806.683s">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3807.183s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3808.343s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3808.783s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3811.964s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3813.544s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3814.104s">Doug</a>  Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Biffod. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3816.605s">I</a>  serve and have served with Ryan <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3819.042s">on</a>  the historic commission for the past four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3821.964s">I</a>  want to echo what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3822.985s">It's</a>  been really a snowballing effect in the city of Medford in the last couple of years as these properties have come one after another. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3832.711s">And</a>  it's been a challenge for us because we haven't had the tools we need to protect the resources that we know we want to preserve for the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3841.717s">And</a>  I would recommend that 12 months is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3844.939s">18</a>  is a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3846.019s">24</a>  is preferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3847.79s">Keep</a>  in mind that the commission, at any time during that period, can reduce that if they're getting cooperation with the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3855.372s">It's</a>  not all inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3856.952s">If</a>  they decide to save the building, we can immediately end it or amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3859.712s">Or</a>  if they decide to renovate or add on to the building, there's ways that we can reduce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3864.113s">But</a>  it gives us that leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3866.034s">The</a>  leverage is the key with this thing, because we have virtually no leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3869.034s">If</a>  somebody comes in on September, the demo delay <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3872.9s">All</a>  they're doing is waiting out the winter, which they're not going to build anyway most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3875.802s">So</a>  it really is meaningless for a lot of developers if they time it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3879.844s">So</a>  I think that's really important that it's truly a minimum of 18, preferably 24, and that we execute this as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3888.648s">I</a>  would like to echo something that one of the councilors said earlier, that we're really missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3894.031s">This</a>  is a first piece of several pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3896.612s">You're</a>  missing a lot of pieces when it comes to planning in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3900.741s">You</a>  don't have any design review in Medford for any building under 10,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3905.686s">So</a>  you can't control anything about a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3909.929s">You</a>  have no tools in which to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3911.731s">And</a>  this has been brought before the council many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3914.554s">It</a>  didn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3915.855s">But</a>  I think the effort needs to be revived because design review is something that a lot of cities and towns have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3921.74s">It</a>  gets a higher quality development. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3924.477s">It</a>  forces developers who would put cookie cutter buildings to not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3928.638s">And</a>  one of our developers who's put up a building, they're just taking a building they built anywhere and plopping it down in every neighborhood they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3937.061s">It</a>  has nothing to do with the character, context, or anything about the quality of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3943.443s">We</a>  can't prevent that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3944.743s">So</a>  you need to look at demo, not only demo delay, but design review as well, which has been long overdue in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3951.446s">Another</a>  thing that's missing here, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3954.042s">is</a>  planning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3955.442s">We</a>  don't have enough planning capacity in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3959.163s">I</a>  know Lauren and Claude upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3960.344s">I've</a>  known them for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3961.264s">They</a>  do wonderful work, but they do not have enough people to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3966.265s">We</a>  need a complete rewrite of zoning right now in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3969.066s">That's</a>  why every project in the city needs multiple variances, because we have zoning that has frozen in time in 1960. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3976.148s">You</a>  need 2.1 cars, whether you're 100 feet from a T station or two miles from a T station. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3982.132s">So</a>  the planning aspect of the city is just completely outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3986.093s">And</a>  I know the council has voted monies to increase the staff in last year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3990.634s">But</a>  as of right now, that hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3992.794s">So</a>  the planning capacity of Medford is critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=3995.535s">And</a>  I found it, frankly, embarrassing that the master plan for the city of Medford, which is now 12 years old and largely unexecuted, we still can't get to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4006.177s">We're</a>  executing little pieces of it here and there with grants rather than with in-house planning and expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4011.92s">So</a>  planning is the umbrella, and zoning, demo delay is one of these components, but there are two or three other legs of the stool that will help Medford get a higher quality built environment, preserve our historic architecture, and give us a better quality of new construction across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4029.725s">So</a>  I urge you all to pass this as quickly as possible, 18 or 24 months, but then start addressing the other concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4036.647s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4037.727s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4044.809s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4046.729s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4047.409s">I</a>  have a bit of a cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4050.11s">So</a>  being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4057.833s">And</a>  I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4067.036s">Currently,</a>  today, the city of Medford has 13 properties <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4072.338s">listed</a>  for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4073.901s">Thirteen,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4076.326s">Of</a>  those thirteen, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4084.51s">Four</a>  are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized, and the remaining eight are listed single or two-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4096.001s">Of</a>  those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4104.412s">So</a>  that's what's going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4106.574s">It</a>  is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4124.687s">That's</a>  what's happening in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4128.141s">Another</a>  pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4135.906s">Well,</a>  what's a price-to-rent ratio? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4138.327s">It's</a>  where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4151.017s">The</a>  city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4153.94s">There</a>  are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4161.287s">Beacon</a>  Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4166.352s">Cambridge</a>  and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4170.676s">This</a>  is a measure of gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4173.319s">What</a>  is gentrification? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4175.421s">It</a>  is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4185.43s">That</a>  mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4208.816s">So</a>  this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4213.841s">Back</a>  Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4217.484s">Those</a>  are some pretty significant price point opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4221.888s">And</a>  I don't discourage those types of price points. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4224.491s">I</a>  think in the nature of real estate, they're critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4227.814s">But</a>  we're getting a false inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4230.416s">that's</a>  happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4245.27s">What's</a>  critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4259.581s">And</a>  because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4265.485s">So</a>  they're making all profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4267.606s">So</a>  there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4280.193s">It's</a>  simply not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for non-conforming units to put in another two-family or three-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4293.34s">Because</a>  those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4297.104s">That's</a>  not what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4298.445s">That's</a>  not what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4300.668s">Not</a>  unless we make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4303.29s">We</a>  as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking as part of their process to preserve <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4314.562s">both</a>  building and green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4317.043s">And</a>  yet, we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put up these fast, prefabbed, fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick-built construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4337.695s">They're</a>  not bringing jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4339.316s">They're</a>  simply lining their pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4341.417s">in</a>  my opinion and my observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4344.28s">So</a>  I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4349.104s">And</a>  the message is, the line is drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4352.307s">We</a>  welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4357.112s">that</a>  come with a desire to collaborate and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4364.676s">And</a>  I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4370.8s">Now</a>  it's 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4371.34s">It's</a>  18. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4371.661s">It's</a>  24. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4372.021s">It's</a>  12 with two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4375.923s">whatever,</a>  but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4383.307s">That</a>  we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4397.314s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4483.337s">Give</a>  the gentleman his due respect at the podium, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4486.078s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4486.759s">That</a>  every building deserves to be saved, but certainly there needs to be a process where we can have careful consideration, use some creativity, encourage outside money or inside money and developers to do the <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4501.933s">the</a>  right thing for neighborhoods and for our heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4505.835s">It's</a>  always true that once you lose an old building, it's not coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4511.839s">So</a>  I commend the council for bringing up this issue for the various boards that have advanced this cause and hope that you will extend the demolition delay period and provide other <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4529.678s">means</a>  for advancing this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4533.299s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4534.699s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4719.995s">That's</a>  probably the best thing because he's not the real person that should be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4723.956s">And</a>  isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4728.807s">You've</a>  got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer for which finally found itself before your body and you folks likewise challenged the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4743.026s">The</a>  neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4748.809s">The</a>  neighborhood people had to bring it together, not the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4752.791s">I</a>  don't know of any more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4758.534s">But</a>  you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4769.62s">Do</a>  the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4771.882s">Vote</a>  for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4777.726s">But</a>  at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing on behalf of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4788.633s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4957.94s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4959.721s">August</a>  2016 was when the Zoning Subcommittee issued its report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4963.664s">September</a>  2016 was when the, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4967.693s">the</a>  commission presented their changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4969.914s">So</a>  there was a month break between when the council was moving forward and when the commission came before the council and then we asked those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4978.917s">But</a>  the questions got asked after August, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4982.278s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4983.762s">Well,</a>  September, that's a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4986.142s">That</a>  30 days, I mean, keep waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4988.403s">What</a>  are we on, seven months now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4991.023s">I</a>  feel like this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4992.564s">Every</a>  time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo, demo permit, demo permit, demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5000.365s">This</a>  needs to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5002.425s">We</a>  don't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5003.226s">If</a>  you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5008.907s">I</a>  waited, was at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5011.307s">for</a>  your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5014.049s">These</a>  things are happening and they're happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5016.97s">And</a>  once these houses are knocked down, they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5019.311s">You</a>  can't rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5020.372s">You</a>  can't, oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5022.733s">We</a>  never should have knocked it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5024.174s">It's</a>  gonna be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5025.495s">So</a>  we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab condos that are going up that cost more than a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5032.278s">And</a>  single family houses, people are desperate to get those in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5035.64s">So</a>  I don't know why we wanna knock them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5038.781s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5047.625s">Sharon</a>  Guzik, 10 Manning Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5051.446s">Unfortunately,</a>  I'm just going to repeat a lot of what everybody else said, but I'll try to make that fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5057.728s">And</a>  I'm going to try to add some color. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5060.889s">I</a>  happen to live in the neighborhood that Bob Penta mentioned, which has had developers, a specific developer that has come in and discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5075.635s">The</a>  neighborhood's ripe for the picking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5077.657s">And</a>  the points that were being made about losing open space because you can build more than one house on that lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5090.655s">and</a>  losing historic trees, which I'm sure you're all familiar with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5096.82s">Those</a>  pieces don't actually speak to the resolution that Brianna put forward, but they are important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5106.268s">And</a>  as you heard with 21 Turro Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5112.909s">You</a>  know, by making it a historic district, we have, as a city, have some control over what happens to that whole piece of property, the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5124.052s">We</a>  can't do that for every house, obviously, but we can tighten the demolition regulations, ordinances, and give the Medford Historical Commission the tools it needs, tools with teeth, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5143.172s">And</a>  I would strongly suggest that you go for the 24-month delay, because you have to give people pause, or they are going to come in and just wait out the six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5157.596s">Even</a>  if you make it 12 months, they'll wait out the 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5161.016s">It</a>  has to be long enough that somebody that's coming in and looking to, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5169.285s">I</a>  think it was Jean said that she calls it flipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5173.471s">They're</a>  looking to get a property, demolish what's on it, subdivide it, and build whatever they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5181.583s">In</a>  my neighborhood, as I said, the character has been changed by one developer single-handedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5189.546s">We've</a>  gotten a prefab duplex next to grandfather's house on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5195.929s">A</a>  large tree that had to be 150 years old was cut <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5202.992s">down</a>  to make way for another Prefab 2 family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5207.955s">A</a>  house on Summer Street and another large beech tree were demolished and cut down to make way for yet another Prefab 2 family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5217.981s">duplex,</a>  and now there's another house being threatened with demolition, a gorgeous, well, it could use a little TLC on the outside, but you can see it has great bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5232.111s">It's</a>  a gorgeous, large, Queen Anne-style house, probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know, but from the 1890s era. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5243.62s">It</a>  has a large lot, and it's very tempting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5249.751s">We</a>  could lose this house in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5256.517s">As</a>  you heard, the developer's already applied for a demo permit, even though he doesn't technically own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5265.967s">So</a>  he's already got the process started. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5269.87s">I</a>  don't know if there's any way we can impose a moratorium on these things happening at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5276.994s">Well,</a>  you guys sort out whether you're going to vote for 18 or 24 months for the demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5286.863s">It</a>  just breaks my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5288.224s">I'm</a>  just seeing the character of my neighborhood with all its, I call them historic houses because they're older than 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5298.329s">It</a>  being, you know, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5302.711s">I</a>  get too emotional about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5304.052s">And</a>  as somebody else pointed out, it's fallen to the citizens, the neighbors on those streets to organize and try to fight for keeping those houses, keeping that green space open. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5317.229s">And</a>  in most cases, it's unsuccessful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5325.092s">The</a>  one good spot was 21 Turo, where Tufts wanted to do the right thing by the neighborhood and found a couple that wanted to live in a historic house and bring it back, restore it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5339.543s">It's</a>  former glory, and they've done a very nice job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5344.387s">So</a>  I just wanted to emphasize that time is of utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5350.611s">We</a>  have to get this done if we're going to save the character of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5355.234s">Right</a>  now, we're allowing developers to come in and decide what we want our neighborhoods to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5365.092s">We</a>  have no, as citizens, we have no recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5367.774s">We</a>  need to give the tools to the Historical Commission to save our historic houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5375.1s">And,</a>  you know, and Doug mentioned the other pieces that need to also be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5381.346s">I</a>  know that's not before you now, but you should keep it in your head and, you know, work on those things as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5392.855s">Yeah,</a>  I made so many notes, I don't know what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5399.179s">Anyway,</a>  I'll just stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5401.06s">And</a>  thank you so much for listening to me ramble.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5528.699s">Mr.</a>  McKillop, the council doesn't make the determination as to whether or not the home is historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5532.482s">The</a>  commission does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5533.663s">So</a>  all we're doing is giving them the right development.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5535.184s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5535.424s">But</a>  if we put it to the point at the hands of the commission, how many homes in the city after 75, 90 years, how many homes become historical homes?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5543.808s">A</a>  very good portion.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5545.609s">That's</a>  the point I'm trying to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5546.709s">At</a>  one point, the entire city becomes locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5550.451s">And</a>  that's what we have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5552.112s">So</a>  again, painting a clear kind of balanced picture, I think that going in the direction of trying to preserve historical homes 100 years past is an incredibly important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5563.685s">Excuse</a>  me, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5564.625s">Could</a>  we have quiet in the back there? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5565.806s">Respect</a>  the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5567.766s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5568.146s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5570.647s">That's</a>  quite all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5571.287s">I</a>  mean, opinions are very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5573.788s">But</a>  we have to consider every aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5575.429s">And</a>  I think that going through this process and finding the right way to make this work for everyone is the best way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5581.591s">Because</a>  again, let's take a look at another example. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5584.531s">A</a>  family has a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5586.552s">passed</a>  down generation after generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5588.473s">The</a>  family has increased in size. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5590.054s">The</a>  family is no longer in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5592.076s">And</a>  the last remaining people in that home have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5595.939s">Now</a>  the family wants to sell that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5598.48s">A</a>  developer happens to come in and wants to purchase that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5602.163s">Are</a>  you saying to that family they cannot maximize their potential because it is a historical home? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5608.827s">What</a>  is it we're trying to tell the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5612.01s">So</a>  there's two sides to the coin that have to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5615.932s">And</a>  not that I'm against everything that's been spoken about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5619.074s">I'm</a>  100% for it because I think there's some incredibly beautiful homes in this town that have to be preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5625.899s">But</a>  there are two sides to the coin that have to be looked at and that's the obligation of everyone to look at that and protect everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5633.565s">So</a>  it's going to be a challenge to find the best way to come across with this and to find the best rules to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5640.129s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5640.77s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5940.999s">Mr.</a>  President, after listening to the residents in the audience come up and speak and discussing at sidebar with some of my colleagues, I'd like to propose an 18-month demolition delay for all homes within the last 75 years by amending 48-78B, by striking 1900 and replacing that with the language within the past 75 years, by amending 48-78H, by striking <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5967.608s">the</a>  figure six months and replacing that with 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5970.59s">And</a>  I'd like to amend 48-78I2 by striking the figure six months and replacing that with the figure 18 months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5978.494s">The</a>  proposal that came out of the subcommittee gave the commission an opportunity to petition the council for an additional six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5986.519s">I</a>  think that this is a paper based upon the sidebar conversations that I've had with my colleagues this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5990.641s">This</a>  is something we can support this evening and that we can pass this evening and we can put it through a first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5994.905s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect such.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5998.728s">Are</a>  you making that motion, Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6000.489s">I</a>  just did.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6000.97s">Do</a>  we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6004.312s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6006.734s">Second</a>  on Councilor Knight's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6010.076s">Councilor</a>  Mungo-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6011.537s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6013.138s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight and the rest of my colleagues for moving forward on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6018.022s">I</a>  heard loud and clear that the commission wants the 24 months <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6022.913s">I</a>  understand maybe the votes aren't there, so I'm happy with the 18 months, but I do want to go on record as supporting the 24-month demo delay, as I think that is something that is going to give teeth to changing the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6035.82s">I</a>  think 18 months is great, but I think 24 months would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6039.502s">I</a>  just wanted to go on record.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6041.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6044.365s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6045.725s">Andrew</a>  Cast and Eddie Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6050.728s">I'm</a>  for historical preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6053.988s">As</a>  a matter of fact, if I may tell you a short story, you might find it interesting, although most of the people behind me I'm sure know this story already. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6061.429s">I</a>  lived in 41 Mystic Avenue for 25 years in a three family, which was originally a single family, that was originally next to Gaffey's, Captain Isaac Hall's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6080.132s">And</a>  they moved that house, I have no idea when, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6083.789s">before</a>  I was born, where Governor Zav is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6089.134s">They</a>  moved it, instead of destroying it, over 100 years ago, in order to make Governor Zav and you a reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6101.646s">How</a>  they got it across the Karate Bridge, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6105.569s">That</a>  probably explains why those <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6109.884s">200-year-old</a>  floors were sagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6112.245s">The</a>  house was built in the 1750s, before Paul Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6117.046s">Paul</a>  Revere went right by it before they broke up and that's where the house was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6121.087s">Captain</a>  Isaac Hall had three sons, if I understand correctly, and I was the first of three sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6127.748s">I</a>  won't get into the fact that they married three sisters from Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6131.849s">However,</a>  by the way, historical designation can be complicated, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6138.99s">I'm</a>  sure there's different entities that classify it, whatever strength of power they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6143.111s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6143.911s">You</a>  have the federal, you have state, city, and I presume there's others, including possibly Middlesex County that I'm not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6152.734s">But</a>  you should also consider the new growth as not anti-American, especially if we can fix up some blighted properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6169.6s">And</a>  as far as gentrification, as the lady had spoken earlier, I don't believe we would have much gentrification, even if real estate taxes, the real estate values, the prices, valuations went up drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6184.627s">But</a>  if you don't use that new growth from the new development to offset Prop 2.5 increases, then we will be pushed out, especially seniors on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6199.092s">or</a>  zero income for the last 29 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6202.754s">Just</a>  wanted to volunteer a story from my childhood.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6205.595s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6206.216s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6206.796s">And</a>  I saw you applauding here the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6210.077s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6211.358s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6212.959s">I'd</a>  like to move approval as amended, strike me 24, and added 18 month demo delay, if that's what the council so chooses, and move approval, roll call vote is requested.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6223.884s">Yeah,</a>  seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6226.463s">And</a>  this will take its first reading this evening, where it is a noted exchange. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6229.186s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6238.314s">Procedurally,</a>  should we take the paper that's before the Committee of the Whole and report it out of Committee of the Whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6246.042s">I</a>  mean, it's a paper of similar subject matter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6251.083s">Also</a>  nice, the council rules state that paper that met in subcommittee cannot be reported out of subcommittee until the committee of the whole meets and it's presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6258.029s">So</a>  that paper would have to be presented to the committee of the whole in order to be reported out of the committee of the whole and reach the floor pursuant to our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6264.634s">But</a>  we have Councilman Lungo's paper that's in front of us that we can amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6267.457s">That</a>  was the theory that I was going with when I made the amendment to the piece of paper.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6275.472s">What</a>  information, Councilor Dela Rosa?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6277.194s">My</a>  assent to the paper before us was under the impression that it was a amendation of the original paper that was in subcommittee as presented and refined by Councilor Knight and presented to us at the sidebar tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6296.522s">which</a>  then I hope has taken over the substance in form of the resolution 17-371. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6304.689s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6307.751s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6308.712s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6311.094s">If</a>  the council's fine with that, I'm fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6313.035s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6316.578s">Mr.</a>  Clegg, if you'd like to read it back so everybody understands what they're voting on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6325.334s">put</a>  us, Michael, put us, Michael.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6374.87s">That's</a>  what I have.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6384.848s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6387.849s">It</a>  should be 75 years or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6389.849s">Right,</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6392.59s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6392.77s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6394.09s">75</a>  years or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6396.471s">If</a>  it says within, that means within now to 75 years.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6405.332s">So</a>  it would just be 75 years or older, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6408.493s">75</a>  years or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6408.913s">75</a>  years or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6409.433s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=6409.613s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

and will do so again tonight, that the city embark upon creating permanent signage indicating the date and time of sweeping on every road in the city, Mr. President, which provides residents with notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7046.923s">It</a>  allows residents to know of a recurring patent of when streets will be swept, and it allows residents to plan ahead <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7056.737s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7058.079s">So</a>  permanent signage will accomplish the notification and the planning ahead of residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7064.89s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, as I've offered in the past, staggering parking on streets, whether it's odd or even parking during street sweeping, allows residents in those areas that are congested to, that don't have access to a driveway or to put their car somewhere, it'll allow them to park on one side of the street, similar to what we do in snow emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7088.42s">And</a>  then we can sweep on one side and then on the other side, Mr. President, allowing residents <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7095.321s">ample</a>  opportunity to park their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7098.63s">on</a>  either the odd or even side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7100.471s">I</a>  would ask that this recommendation or these recommendations be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee for full recommendations on the creation of a street sweeping program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7112.975s">This</a>  is not the first time I've asked that we take a long and hard look at how we operate and do business in this community, in particular regarding street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7123.399s">The</a>  fact we only sweep our streets twice a year <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7128.401s">You</a>  know, street sweeping accomplishes a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7131.403s">It</a>  keeps our roads clean, but it also keeps the debris and clutter from going into our catch basins, which create flooding if they get filled up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7142.232s">So</a>  this is a very important initiative that, for some reason, this city has been lax on creating an effective policy of notification and permanent signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7153.962s">And</a>  I think it's long overdue, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7156.858s">If</a>  need be, if the city administration feels to act upon these recommendations, like they've done in the past, I would recommend that the city council, and in particular the Public Works Committee, create a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7170.323s">Because</a>  it seems to me that the policy of street sweeping, which is created by the administration, is no longer effective in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7178.465s">When</a>  you see cars that are being tagged and towed, you know, and many of which do not receive <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7186.788s">the</a>  notification from the reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7189.15s">I</a>  think it's a shame, Mr. President, in this day and age, to hit residents up with a $175 bill before they even start their day off, if they're able to start their day off after their car gets towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7205.359s">So</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee to review permanent signage with dates and times and a recurring <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7216.611s">patent</a>  on when our streets will be swept, and also to stagger the parking by aught even, allowing residents in congested areas to park on the streets during street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7229.354s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7244.053s">Councilor</a>  Scott Pelham. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7245.414s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7246.295s">Thank</a>  my colleague for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7248.596s">Just</a>  for clarity, Council Marks, we're looking to put an eight to 10 month program like neighbor communities have, a street sweeping program that runs daily.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7267.85s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7269.031s">Councilor</a>  Scott probably brings up a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7271.233s">I</a>  would envision something starting in April, ending the end of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7275.876s">I</a>  know our business districts probably should be swept probably on a daily basis, maybe the neighborhoods streets once a month based on the permanent signage, giving dates and times and so forth, and maybe, you know, staggering odd even, but definitely at least once a month from April to December in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7295.692s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7296.253s">If</a>  I could, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7297.128s">If</a>  I could, if you could allow me to make amendment to that paper and looking to ask the city administration for feasibility study, whether it's outsourcing or with hopes to provide what I would hope our DPW with the crew and machinery needed to perform that such act on that type of a basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7320.955s">So</a>  I'd love to see more in depth numbers and <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7326.395s">It's</a>  something that I would love to see in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7328.796s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7330.636s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7332.517s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7333.517s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7334.297s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Lomax for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7336.158s">I</a>  think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7338.178s">I</a>  think it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7341.179s">I</a>  know that I've received many phone calls when I bump into people in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7345.4s">A</a>  lot of people will talk about the cleanliness of the roads in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7350.241s">And</a>  this is something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7353.213s">But</a>  I, you know, Councilor Marks, you do bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7355.514s">I</a>  think that this is something that should probably be in a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7358.936s">I</a>  mean, this does, I think, hold the city's feet to the fire and says, hey, you know what, this needs to be done X amount of times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7366.079s">I</a>  mean, two times a year right now to me is just not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7369.76s">I</a>  mean, people pay their taxes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7371.681s">They</a>  deserve to have clean streets and a clean city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7374.742s">And</a>  I think right now, you know, you go, you drive down many of the streets and, you know, there's debris all over the place, you know, with regard to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7381.132s">sand,</a>  salt, rocks from the road being torn up after the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7386.434s">And</a>  basically, these things need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7392.857s">And</a>  it wasn't even a bad winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7394.657s">So</a>  when you have a really bad winter, the street can be a real mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7398.559s">So</a>  I mean, I think I definitely would favor this to be in a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7406.422s">I</a>  think that's the way we need to go long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7410.401s">DPW</a>  subcommittee, I think that's fine, but I think we need to also look at this, you know, on the ordinance subcommittee as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7419.445s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Fasco.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7420.945s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7422.046s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7423.286s">This</a>  is a topic that's not new to anybody behind this rail, especially during this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7428.268s">And</a>  one of the items that I see in terms of street sweeping in general that's lacking in the community is our public utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7434.931s">And</a>  when we issue permits to our public utilities to tear up our streets and they do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7439.235s">And</a>  then they decide to come back whenever they feel like coming back to repair our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7442.916s">And</a>  then they leave the streets still looking in an awful situation, an awful mess with sand, with gravel, with dirt all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7449.759s">I</a>  don't believe that public utilities are required as part of the permitting process when they open up our streets to perform a sweep when they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7456.902s">And</a>  I think that that's something that we should also look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7458.842s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7461.897s">I'd</a>  also, as the chairman of the DPW subcommittee, would request that any of my colleagues behind this rail send out an email to the members of the subcommittee with any suggestions that they'd like to see, and we can get to the table and discuss these issues.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7473.161s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7520.151s">Many</a>  of the main streets are done on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7522.834s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7524.236s">So</a>  we can continue to work on this and I think the idea of an ordinance is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7529.361s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7530.322s">I</a>  think it's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7535.97s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7537.131s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7538.592s">My</a>  street is designated as a main artery. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7541.595s">So</a>  I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7549.922s">I</a>  hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries, because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7556.408s">I,</a>  like Councilor Dela Rousseau, get the <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7559.838s">1</a>  to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7560.579s">wake-up</a>  call, now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7564.622s">But</a>  I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7571.488s">So</a>  if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned, and my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7579.534s">broken</a>  glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7584.976s">So</a>  that's important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7586.876s">Also,</a>  when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7597.88s">And</a>  the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7600.642s">So</a>  if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7604.305s">I</a>  know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7609.049s">Because</a>  even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says, move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7618.457s">The</a>  street cleaners are just going around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7620.539s">So</a>  that's not really useful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7623.401s">I</a>  do hope that it will do more street cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7625.263s">My</a>  father lives on Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7627.045s">and</a>  he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7631.047s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
