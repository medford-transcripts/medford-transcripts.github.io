    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=491.598s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=493.9s">I</a>  read through it and I was comfortable with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=496.943s">I</a>  wanted to make sure that our administrative people also thought that it was workable.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=507.679s">Yes,</a>  we were at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=509.6s">We</a>  worked collaboratively in subcommittee to come up with those guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=515.522s">I</a>  feel that it's reasonable and it will allow us to be able to pace ourselves and manage the workload for specific reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=526.425s">So</a>  I want to thank Paul for his leadership in helping to put that kind of a system and structure in place so that we're able to have more realistic expectations.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=540.035s">Thank</a>  you to the subcommittee, and I'd like to make a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=646.624s">Motion</a>  for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=676.203s">The</a>  parent is just concerned that it's going to be counted as a not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=682.147s">I</a>  just want to get that on the record that it's not a requirement and if they don't want to go on the Zoom call, it's not going to hurt their grade for pass or fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=694.255s">So</a>  could somebody please clarify that for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=696.636s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=697.337s">Yes,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=698.978s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=700.319s">Yes,</a>  I queried all of our schools to see what <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=704.9s">how</a>  many teachers were using Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=707.583s">And</a>  most of our schools and teachers are using it on some level, but it's not a requirement for a pass or fail for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=718.072s">So</a>  you can reassure parents that it will not be part of the requirements.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=724.498s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=725.182s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=726.343s">Um,</a>  and I just wanted to share, um, or, you know, my concern regarding, and I know you don't have the numbers just yet, but, um, in terms of how many families haven't been connected with, and, um, last week I had a conversation with, uh, Dr. Cushing, um, and I shared an idea that I had, um, that maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=748.772s">If</a>  we're still having trouble reaching out to these families, we could have the school resource officer, or maybe the police department, do a wellness check with these families. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=759.978s">Because</a>  you know, how do we know they even have any of the communication that we're giving to everybody I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=766.181s">you</a>  know, I'm a little concerned and worried for those families because if we haven't heard from them, we don't know what they know and what they don't know regarding the distance learning and what we're doing regarding the pass or fail or just any of the communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=779.649s">So,</a>  you know, I just wanted to just share my idea and, you know, just put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=784.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=802.665s">When</a>  I give my remarks during in the next portion of the agenda, that I will say some of the things that we are doing in order to try to reach out to families that we're not hearing from.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=837.457s">Motion</a>  to accept the minutes from 30-30-2020? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=839.318s">Motion</a>  to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=843.62s">Motion</a>  to accept by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=846.761s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=847.561s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=848.861s">Minutes</a>  passed, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=850.582s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=853.223s">Questions,</a>  again, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=862.667s">Those</a>  submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=866.735s">your</a>  Medford Street address and your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=869.079s">member</a>  Ruseau, are there any questions for this portion to date?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=874.681s">There</a>  was a question that came in earlier today, but I answered it based on our earlier conversations about how we would do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=882.004s">If</a>  the answer was already known and decided, I would just reply rather than putting it through the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=887.506s">There</a>  was a question about whether or not the New York trip was going to be canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=891.688s">Of</a>  course, I replied that it had been canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=895.089s">But</a>  I can't remember the detail on <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=898.29s">The</a>  processing for reimbursements will take, I said, will take quite some time because City Hall has to do it and everything's not really operating normally. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=906.077s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=907.591s">So</a>  the reimbursements, I don't believe it will actually go through City Hall, but it goes to the student activities accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=914.074s">And</a>  so each school has its own student activities account. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=917.455s">And</a>  the checks need to be processed and actually written back to the original check writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=923.598s">And</a>  so just each individual check <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=928.22s">needs</a>  to be rewritten back, per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=932.082s">I'm</a>  sure that we could tally up if someone had made four payments and write them into one check. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=937.924s">But</a>  in essence, all those checks need to be written back to the individuals, which could be a couple hundred checks.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=949.329s">And</a>  do you think that that will take not until we get back to school kind of thing?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=955.091s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=955.972s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=956.906s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=957.786s">If</a>  it can be done sooner, it will, but I don't see how we'll be able to make that a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=964.768s">Right,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=967.609s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=969.89s">If</a>  there's no other community participation, we'll go to number seven, which is report of the superintendent, Dr. Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=977.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=979.492s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=982.133s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools continues to be a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=987.139s">Again,</a>  I realize that this is a hard time for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=991.285s">So</a>  much uncertainty surrounds us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=994.53s">We</a>  are here for parents, caregivers, guardians, as well as our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1000.822s">If</a>  you feel your child is struggling with anxiety issues over a particular situation, please contact their school principal who will put you in touch with their guidance or adjustment counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1014.079s">They</a>  will be very happy to assist you and provide you with helpful information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1020.697s">With</a>  the way the crisis is going, our administrators are already discussing how to handle when students do report back to school, whether it is this year or in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1032.768s">Either</a>  way, we know that our teachers will be planning to revisit instruction from when it ended on March 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1040.052s">This</a>  will allow our students to get back into the educational loop and will help to eliminate any apprehension or concerns about returning to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1049.518s">So</a>  this is a high priority for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1053.401s">However,</a>  before I continue with my report, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1057.065s">I</a>  wanted to take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to Assistant Superintendent of Finance, Christine Patterson, who will be leaving us at the end of this school year to take on a new position with Lincoln-Sudbury School District. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1077.009s">This</a>  move will allow her additional time <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1080.58s">to</a>  be closer to home and spend more family time with her daughter, Addie, who's growing up and becoming very involved in many other extracurricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1092.225s">And</a>  understandably, Christine does want to be there for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1097.028s">During</a>  her four-year tenure with the Medford Public Schools, Christine professionalized the business office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1105.14s">She</a>  helped to streamline the budget process and highlighted the financial ramifications of the charter school reimbursements. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1114.47s">A</a>  Navy veteran, Christine served our country and this district with dedication and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1122.947s">Personally,</a>  Christine welcomed me aboard and walked me through the ins and outs of the involved budget process here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1132.254s">Her</a>  guidance and support will be greatly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1136.136s">We</a>  wish her much luck and happiness in her new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1140.54s">And</a>  we thank you, Christine, for your years of service to the Medford Public Schools and the community.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1149.206s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1151.616s">Thank</a>  you, Christine, for all your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1155.337s">Member</a>  van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1160.198s">Oh,</a>  wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1160.778s">Member</a>  van de Kloot, if you could press unmute.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1164.419s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1166.1s">I</a>  wanted to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1168.44s">Patterson</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1169.601s">Christine's</a>  worked very difficult and in a very demanding job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1175.362s">I</a>  would like to say almost a thankless job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1178.423s">So</a>  I would like to thank her for her work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1182.024s">dedication</a>  to her position, and I'd like to wish her well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1185.265s">I</a>  think it's certainly understandable that not driving quite as far as she drives, which is way too long, and being close to her daughter, even though it's going to be difficult to find someone in this very difficult position. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1200.609s">But</a>  thank you, Kirsteen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1202.89s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1205.911s">I</a>  want to say a couple of words. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.633s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.874s">Patterson,</a>  I want to say thank you very much for your service over the last couple of years in such a short amount of time you have accomplished so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1218.958s">You</a>  were a great help to me when I was signing the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1221.98s">In</a>  fact, you came down and met me at city hall and showed me what to do and answered any questions I had about the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1230.805s">You've</a>  just done an incredible job balancing the budget and beginning the process to change the scheduling of the budget, which we started last year, which was extremely efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1244.769s">And</a>  we were able to have the meetings more regularly to discuss them in smaller group sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1250.47s">And</a>  I just really appreciate everything you've done and I wish you well in your new endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1254.531s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1259.192s">Thank</a>  you, member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1264.154s">Number</a>  two under... I do have additional updates, but I didn't know if other members had wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1272.077s">I</a>  wanted to say some of the social emotional offerings that we're going to be providing to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1280.38s">So</a>  I'm gonna go back to the report of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1283.582s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1283.862s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1284.902s">It</a>  looks like Mia has her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1286.343s">Mia,</a>  is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1289.226s">I</a>  think she's frozen again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1297.83s">Mia?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1308.055s">Can</a>  everybody hear Mia or am I the only one? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1310.556s">Okay,</a>  Mia.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1311.917s">This</a>  is where there's eight people all on the internet at once.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1317.389s">Mia,</a>  we're not able to hear you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1318.71s">Can</a>  you just try to turn off your video, Mia? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1322.051s">We</a>  may have a better chance of hearing you that way.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1326.492s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1327.413s">Better,</a>  better. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1328.673s">Sorry,</a>  Mia.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1347.95s">Hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1349.771s">I</a>  think she said she was gonna get the kids off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1352.092s">Can</a>  you hear me now?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1366.097s">You</a>  still kind of sound like a Martian.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1369.619s">Mia,</a>  can you dial in from a phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1372.34s">I</a>  can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1377.259s">No,</a>  Mia, we can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1383.724s">How</a>  about, Mia, can you dial in on a regular phone?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1392.791s">Can</a>  you hear us, Mia?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1396.794s">Mia,</a>  we're going to let the superintendent finish with her report and then <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1407.116s">you</a>  can maybe try to use a phone to call in and we can always go back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1411.163s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1411.544s">That's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1415.892s">Thank</a>  you, member Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1418.712s">Okay,</a>  I want to give some important cell updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1423.457s">Miss</a>  Stacy Shulman, the supervisor of clinical and behavioral services, sent an email to our teaching staff, informing them that many of our students are experiencing an extensive amount of personal turmoil right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1440.234s">Beyond</a>  this situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1442.346s">Students</a>  could also be experiencing financial challenges, family conflict, food insecurities, barriers to accessing or completing schoolwork, and last but not least, health challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1459.755s">We</a>  have also heard from students that they are feeling an increase in discrimination based on their race, particularly from our Asian American students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1471.98s">I</a>  just want to restate that MPS Medford Public Schools does not tolerate or endorse discrimination of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1479.407s">And</a>  we are closely monitoring that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1481.81s">So</a>  we are, again, urging families to reach out to school, the school leaders, school principals, who will be able to direct you to Stacey Shulman, who is our supervisor of clinical and behavioral services. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1496.969s">After</a>  working for many years with students and educators, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1500.772s">Stacey</a>  Shulman has found that the impact that teachers have on their students is quite profound. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1508.137s">Many</a>  students are grieving the loss of contact with the faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1513.181s">They</a>  see every school day and the sense of security that has been provided that they're normally accustomed to, that that is now gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1523.008s">They</a>  have come to rely on their classroom routines <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1526.502s">and</a>  what to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1529.384s">Stacey</a>  is urging teachers in her email to take a look and take a moment and check in with their students and ask them how they are doing and to acknowledge that this is hard, very hard for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1543.735s">If</a>  any teacher feels a student is making comments relating to possibly hurting themselves or others, the teacher should call 911 <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1555.285s">and</a>  call the student's principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1558.206s">Additionally,</a>  Stacy is preparing counseling staff with additional professional development around trauma, creating resources for students, families, and staff, assembling a professional development series for staff to support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1575.99s">And</a>  this will be advertised soon on our virtual support group for parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1583.26s">So</a>  on Wednesday at four o'clock, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1586.842s">Stacey</a>  Shulman will be hosting a support group Zoom meeting for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1593.365s">Interested</a>  faculty should email her to be included in that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1601.275s">Um,</a>  moving away from social emotional learning and moving on to MCAS, uh, we are still waiting to hear an official word from Desi. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1611.557s">Um,</a>  just wanted to keep you informed that Desi has not given an official, um, response yet, uh, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1623.4s">As</a>  of this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1625.857s">uh,</a>  all schools have been making a concerted effort to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1630.84s">And</a>  so right now we have posted many, many positive videos of teachers and staff saying hello and checking in with their, uh, with their students and also just resurfacing some very, um, happy videos that were taking place at other times when school was fully functioning so that people have positive things to look at and memories to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1655.011s">These</a>  videos have been posted on our blog and website and our PTO Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1661.593s">Additionally,</a>  as what was just mentioned in our budget committee of the whole meeting prior to this meeting, our director of library media and technology, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1671.28s">Molly</a>  Layden, we've given out over 650 Chromebooks and we're going to see, you know, continue to monitor and see how that goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1682.629s">We</a>  know that we haven't reached everyone, but we're really pleased that we were able to make a significant dent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1689.453s">We</a>  want to also note that all students in K, kindergarten through second grade, that Gmail accounts have been created for those students, which normally does not take place because they're not yet really able to type, but Google accounts, Gmail accounts were sent out so that <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1708.49s">teachers</a>  can communicate with students using the Google Classroom platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1713.355s">And</a>  so we thank families that are really taking on a heavy lift to support our youngest learners in those grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1722.704s">We</a>  continue to have updated information being posted <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1726.588s">on</a>  our remote learning website, and that will be giving additional Google Classroom information for teachers by school, and information will also be available for parents and caregivers to support them with navigating this new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1745.583s">So</a>  if people do need support with technology questions about their Chromebooks, they can email tech support, one word, T-E-C-H-S-U-P-P-O-R-T at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1763.735s">We're</a>  also going to be having an additional site, which will be specific to training resources using the Google site. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1774.029s">And</a>  that will be posted, again, on our blog and on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1781.88s">With</a>  regards to library services, there is a new Medford Public Schools Pre-K to 8 virtual library site for parents and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1792.608s">And</a>  the link has been posted to the website and the blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1796.171s">So</a>  again, I urge you to go and look for up-to-date information at our website and blog sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1805.138s">The</a>  site brings together resources and links to help our Pre-K to 8 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1810.842s">to</a>  continue reading and exploring different topics of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1816.667s">The</a>  site's goal is to provide students and families with a central place to find well-curated resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1825.494s">This</a>  site is being updated regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1829.409s">at</a>  the high school level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1831.751s">We've</a>  posted a distance learning guide for our high school students on the high school library guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1838.235s">And</a>  that is on our website, medfordpublicschools.libguides.com slash home. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1846.32s">So</a>  we wanna thank Molly Layden and her entire technology team who have really been working tirelessly during the school closure time to make as much information available <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1860.173s">online</a>  for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1861.621s">So</a>  we thank you sincerely for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1864.74s">Uh,</a>  we've had a lot of fun different types of activities that are also taking place We have schools that are trying to think of activities that aren't just strictly Academic but things that are getting kids to go outside and I want to just share a few at the columbus school for example Students were encouraged to get outside and just decorate their sidewalk with chalk <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1890.746s">and</a>  to decorate their home with messages of positivity and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1895.911s">They</a>  took photos and they posted it to the Columbus School website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1900.435s">Likewise,</a>  at the McGlynn Elementary School, they asked their students to display a kindness heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1908.45s">which</a>  they have decorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1910.051s">And</a>  students are placing those kindness hearts on their doors or windows at their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1916.937s">And</a>  that heart means that there's solidarity and that we're all in this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1923.101s">So</a>  these are just some types of activities that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1928.005s">Um</a>  tomorrow at 10 o'clock the roberts school is going to be hosting a parade uh, the roberts staff are going to Be in a caravan of cars and they're going to drive around the roberts neighborhood waving. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1944.552s">Hello</a>  to their students so um for the roberts community you should have received communication about that at 10 o'clock, um, there will be a parade just <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1955.296s">letting</a>  you know that we are thinking about you and we care about all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1962.188s">I</a>  also wanna just share some important information that Medford Mustang alumni are doing in this special school closure time, but supporting COVID-19, supporting hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1976.72s">So</a>  Mustang alumni have stepped up to the plate to support our medical professionals during this crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1984.486s">The</a>  1984 graduates, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1987.188s">Hank</a>  Morris, Hank Morse and Tracy Hollander. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1991.313s">They</a>  issued a Facebook challenge to all Medford High School graduating classes to come together and possibly make donations to the hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2001.016s">Since</a>  that pledge, that challenge, seven different graduating classes have stepped up, and they have made either food donations or mask donations to Boston Medical Center, Leahy Hospital, and Mass General Hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2017.749s">So</a>  the health care professionals are incredibly grateful, and I want to just continue to thank our Mustang community for going that extra mile and helping our medical professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2031.033s">Additionally,</a>  1988 graduate Peter Akala, owner of Numaj DJ and entertainment services, took his DJ equipment outside and entertained his entire neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2045.499s">His</a>  neighbors came out to their yards to dance and enjoyed the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2050.261s">All</a>  of these actions embody the Mustang way. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2053.982s">the</a>  blue and white continues to flow through these mustang veins and that makes us all so proud so i want to just thank them and say go mustangs additionally on the community engagement side our ccsr students have also been uh creating challenges and encouraging <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2073.477s">Our</a>  mustang community to get outside in a positive way They had a video hashtag six feet together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2081.542s">They</a>  were working collaboratively with our mayor And saturday they hosted the porch jam Urging citizens to come out onto their porches or decks and sing the john lennon song imagine <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2095.6s">I</a>  want to highlight our Medford High School sophomores, Lily Began and Caden Golisano, members of CCSR, who realized that during the hashtag stay home order to stop the spread of COVID-19, local nursing homes were no longer allowed to have visitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2115.038s">They</a>  knew the residents probably felt extremely lonely, so they began designing and sending uplifting cards to them at the Medford Rehabilitation Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2125.602s">Additionally,</a>  CCSR students at the McGlynn Middle School, sixth graders, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2131.804s">Lila</a>  Armit, Mia Armit, and Caroline Gomez decided to begin painting rocks around their neighborhood with inspiring messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2141.828s">These</a>  students continue to impress all of us every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2147.011s">Lastly,</a>  or getting close to lastly I should say, Medford Family Network is continuing to support our families <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2156.223s">They</a>  are still hosting story time with Miss Andrea and indoor play with Miss Cindy virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2164.067s">They</a>  plan to host the parent cafe virtually on April 15th. <a

Marie Cassidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2184.79s">That's</a>  mcassidy at medford.k12.ma.us for assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2192.839s">Also,</a>  another

distance learning plan work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2236.156s">It</a>  is not perfect by any means, and each day does bring a new question, but every member of the Mustang community has come together and tried their very best <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2247.719s">to</a>  continue as many programs as possible, as well as providing much needed outreach to our students.

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2608.807s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2610.087s">So</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2610.687s">Nyland</a>  and I are here tonight to provide you information on the reimbursement for the costs involved in the student trip to France. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2621.19s">So</a>  on March 2020, just under a month ago, we appeared at the school committee meeting and we recommended to the Medford School Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2631.093s">of</a>  the cancelling of the April 2020 student trip to France because at that time it was a growing coronavirus, COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2641.584s">And</a>  at that time, we referenced a cover for any reason insurance policy, also known as a CFR policy, which the parents did provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2652.327s">And</a>  at that time, the amount that we were estimate, or the families were estimated to be paid back was $1,050. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2660.23s">So</a>  that meant there would have been a loss of $2,100 per family. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2668.297s">So</a>  we understood how the parents felt, we understood how the committee felt, and we did pursue a full reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2675.923s">So</a>  we reached out to the company, and I think they've been responsive, and I do think that they're trying the best they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2683.349s">We</a>  also reached out to the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, who not only was dealing with Medford's reimbursement issue, but trying to help out with reimbursements across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2698.294s">So</a>  there were dozens, if not a hundred schools across the state who were dealing with the same type of an issue, not with the same company. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2707.536s">Most</a>  had different companies, but a similar issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2710.897s">So</a>  they advocated on Medford's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2715.878s">So</a>  we did get a response from the travel company and they've responded with the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2723.44s">So</a>  they will refund <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2726.312s">the</a>  $1,100 flight fee that was charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2731.334s">They</a>  will refund $1,400 of the land portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2735.695s">And</a>  they will refund $100 of the insurance premium that was paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2742.757s">Under</a>  this offer, the company, the travel company, it's not even the insurance company as I understand, but the travel company directly will be refunding the parents a total of $2,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2756.519s">That</a>  means $500 is non-refundable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2761.778s">So</a>  we do recommend accepting this offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2766.46s">And</a>  we did look at what other districts across the state, we try to get as much information as possible on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2773.103s">And</a>  what we were able to find out was with one of the largest travel companies in the state, they are reimbursing their families all of the costs except for $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2783.908s">So</a>  in other words, in many districts, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2787.21s">Travel</a>  companies are holding families responsible for $1,000 under this plan with our travel company Families are being held responsible for $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2797.555s">It's</a>  certainly it would be better if it was a full refund However, given given the circumstances of the massive losses that everyone has <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2811.161s">is</a>  experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2812.922s">And</a>  what I would consider due diligence on the part of the insurance company, the administration is recommending this offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2825.067s">So</a>  again, families would be reimbursed for everything except for $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2832.53s">So</a>  again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2833.291s">Nyland</a>  is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2834.171s">So</a>  between the two of us, if you have any questions, we can certainly try to answer those questions.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2843.533s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2846.034s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2847.434s">Thank</a>  you for the report, Bernadette and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2850.535s">Nyland,</a>  and thank you for your hard work on this for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2853.737s">I'm</a>  wondering how have you informed families of this and how they've responded? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2858.198s">I</a>  think this is great news when we thought we weren't getting anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2860.979s">Of</a>  course, getting this good portion of it back is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2867.621s">It's</a>  unfortunate that families have to lose $500 at all, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2872.733s">Under</a>  the circumstances, I think it's pretty remarkable that you guys were able to do what you did and the insurance company was able to do what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2879.585s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2880.928s">And</a>  I'm just wondering if you've had any response or feedback from families.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2886.641s">So</a>  actually, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2888.142s">Nyland</a>  could speak in a moment because she has been talking to families, but our feeling was we did want to report this out to school committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2895.245s">So</a>  obviously the superintendent, the assistant superintendents are aware, but we did want this to come out to school committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2903.149s">So</a>  we have not shared any details. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2906.791s">We</a>  have shared, even last week, the superintendent did share that an offer was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2914.929s">although</a>  new details were provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2916.89s">So</a>  again, we just didn't, in deference to the school committee, we were waiting for this time to do that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2924.593s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2926.694s">Any</a>  motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2928.135s">Any</a>  other questions?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2957.257s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2959.238s">So</a>  we had a meeting, a subcommittee meeting on the health education curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2963.98s">And</a>  when I came before school committee last time, you didn't have the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2967.341s">So</a>  you should have all received the documents for the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2971.096s">curriculum</a>  as well as the sexuality standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2974.858s">We</a>  have been using the Michigan model health curriculum at the middle school, with the exception of the unit called growing up and staying healthy which does include some sexuality education lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2986.667s">Um,</a>  my staff, uh, since we took over this department, my staff from working very hard to look at what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2992.93s">Um,</a>  as a curriculum and looking at the state national standards and aligning our curriculum to the state and national standards, and then figuring out where our gaps are for middle school health, our gaps are in sexuality education more specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3009.205s">If</a>  you looked at the document, I sent an anatomy and physiology, puberty and adolescent development, identity, pregnancy and reproduction, and sexually transmitted infections and HIV standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3024.295s">The</a>  sexuality education standards that I did provide for you just included middle school, just so you're aware that document does go K to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3031.516s">And</a>  we've looked at the high school piece already, which we are covering all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3035.257s">Our</a>  next step was to look at the middle school piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3039.018s">So</a>  I'm just looking for direction from school committee to see if we can either push this forward or have a conversation about what we want to add.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3050.173s">We</a>  do have questions may I ask I did email you this morning miss Perry We got two attachments from you back at the end of March or mid-march One was about six pages one was 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3060.722s">Is</a>  there was there more that we were supposed to get? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3063.805s">I</a>  remember something mentioned in 600 pages of something.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3067.348s">Oh,</a>  that's the full curriculum Okay, with all of the lessons in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3073.614s">That's</a>  a huge document, which I can't provide if you want to I just have to scan it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3077.377s">Okay</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3079.093s">member</a>  van de Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3080.974s">Yes,</a>  this was discussed at the curriculum subcommittee and the subcommittee voted to bring it forth with a positive endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3091.08s">However,</a>  we didn't have the paperwork at the time, so that was given to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3095.482s">So</a>  at this point, I'd like to make a motion that we go ahead with the adoption of the new curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3100.866s">Just</a>  as a reminder, if any parents have concerns, they can opt their students out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3106.39s">But</a>  from what I hear, most more people are interested in making sure that their children have this valuable information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3113.736s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3114.237s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3115.898s">Sorry,</a>  Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3116.959s">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3118.76s">I</a>  don't care who seconds it.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3124.365s">You're</a>  on mute, Brianna.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3125.626s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3127.912s">Then</a>  from what I was able to review, can you just tell me what page eight and nine of 13, which grade that relates to? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3136.739s">That</a>  has to do with the describing the signs and symptoms of a pregnancy, divine emergency contraception and its use. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3151.583s">Defining</a>  STDs, including HIV, and how they are and are not transmitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3157.044s">Analyzing</a>  the impact of drugs on safer sex. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3161.805s">Identifying</a>  medically accurate information about STDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3166.126s">So</a>  those two pages, do those relate to one specific grade?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3170.687s">So</a>  the standards just signify through grades six to eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3174.687s">I</a>  will have to take a look at it and kind of separate it, which my thought process would be to <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3179.454s">have</a>  anatomy and physiology and puberty in grade six, healthy relationship piece in grade seven, and that piece more at the grade eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3189.398s">That</a>  would make the most sense.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3194.92s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3195.44s">And</a>  do you know if this is, if other districts are accepting this model and this curriculum in grade eight?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3205.097s">So</a>  yeah, these are national standards and that's what's recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3209.038s">So</a>  the school districts that are doing it are using these standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3212.879s">I</a>  will also let you know the state standards are in the process of being released and there was a major upgrade in the sex education piece to follow more of the national standards for the state of Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3226.362s">So</a>  what other surrounding cities or towns use page eight and nine in the eighth grade curriculum?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3234.053s">I</a>  don't know if it's definitely in the eighth grade curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3235.894s">I'd</a>  have to get that information from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3237.615s">I</a>  know I taught at Newton Public Schools and they were following the national standards.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3246.58s">Are</a>  there any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3254.345s">I'd</a>  just like to make an amendment, just amend the paper or do a side paper just to make sure that if you <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3264.338s">If</a>  you add page eight or nine to any other grade other than eight through 12, that the school committee be, that it be discussed with the school committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3276.34s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3276.56s">I'm</a>  not saying for or against it being discussed in sixth or seventh, but I just feel that I would like to have that discussion before anything like that is taught to a sixth or seventh grader.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3289.082s">Can</a>  I also ask just one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3291.023s">It's</a>  Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3293.376s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3293.576s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3295.297s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3295.858s">I'm</a>  also just wondering how are, um, I know that parents have the opt out, um, option and how are they given the scope and scale of what will actually be taught? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3305.524s">Like,</a>  are they given the same information that were given, um, for the grades?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3311.508s">So</a>  I will be posting that to the physical education, health education website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3315.831s">So</a>  all of our scope and sequence will be posted there and that will include all of that information.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3320.666s">And</a>  is it automatic to opt in unless you opt out? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3324.228s">Is</a>  that how it works? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3325.329s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3326.97s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3327.87s">I'd</a>  like to point out a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3330.852s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3332.393s">On</a>  page eight, it has gender identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3334.975s">We</a>  explicitly talked about that in our subcommittee meeting, and that is not appropriate to wait till eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3340.578s">It's</a>  really appropriate in third and fourth grade, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3343.4s">So</a>  I would not be okay with that amendment.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3349.162s">Yes,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3350.483s">That</a>  specific one, we can exclude from the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3356.748s">It's</a>  just the ones that I read out loud, I just feel like I think I would need more discussion or actually read the curriculum, the 600 page document before I want my sixth grader to learn about STDs and how to put a condom on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3372.979s">I</a>  think that deserves much more discussion and a committee of the whole meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3377.489s">versus</a>  all the hard work that you did in your subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3384.972s">I</a>  was also, how will parents be led to the website when this is brought up initially as far as how will they know they have the opportunity to research it, review, and then opt in or out? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3398.997s">And</a>  will it be provided in other languages as well?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3402.822s">We</a>  can add that to the opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3405.443s">We</a>  generally, at the high school, we put that in the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3408.984s">So</a>  I can work with the middle school principals to make sure that's added to the middle school handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3414.246s">And</a>  then we can direct them to the website from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3417.147s">And</a>  I can also have my contact information if there's any specific questions.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3422.608s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3423.169s">Yeah,</a>  I'd like to, as part of the B paper, make sure that that information's in the handbook and that we do provide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3431.38s">different</a>  languages like we do for all other communications.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3435.062s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3476.256s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3477.297s">So</a>  in your packet, I just provided a brief synopsis on the rationale for the reasoning to go into negotiations with our yellow bus company. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3490.18s">The</a>  main factors are we are getting a lot of concerns from the bus companies themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3499.083s">They</a>  are having difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3502.064s">There</a>  is a stimulus package that's from the federal government that is going to be providing what they call a transportation stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3511.746s">The</a>  only way to access those funds is to continue a payment of some form. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3518.834s">for</a>  the vendors and or contractors that are continuing service. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3524.677s">Now,</a>  again, we have not gotten complete authority to pay without services conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3534.322s">However,</a>  we are being given guidance from the Department of Ed now in terms of negotiating a pro rata amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3543.286s">So</a>  identifying a per diem rate <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3547.489s">would</a>  be a percentage of the bus bid, the regular runs, not the additional athletic runs, not the overtime runs or field trip runs, just the basic daily runs for the transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3563.98s">And</a>  there are the groups in the Commonwealth that have <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3570.37s">the</a>  same bus contractor, we are all being advised to work collectively or a pseudo agreement, a side agreement, in order to facilitate the continuation of bus transportation when schools resume. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3589.204s">And</a>  the concern is that these drivers, if they are not maintained in a payroll status, that they will be looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3599.406s">going</a>  to alternate employers, such as an Amazon, where they can drive with their CDL license and not have any interruption of payroll during the course of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3613.269s">We</a>  want to maintain those drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3616.43s">There</a>  was a shortage of drivers prior to this closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3620.371s">And</a>  additionally, we are in the process of the main bus bid being <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3628.456s">out</a>  there for the public to bid on the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3631.319s">And</a>  I'm trying to avoid a very bloated contract for the next three to five years with the concern of having to pad their number in an effort to cover any such closure and or the loss of their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3650.836s">So</a>  we have 21 bus drivers that are associated with the Medford runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3655.579s">We</a>  have 18 regular runs, but 21 drivers that are on schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3660.561s">So</a>  that's what we would be negotiating with Eastern bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3667.265s">The</a>  current rate that they are discussing with the other schools <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3673.491s">Um,</a>  is in the range of 70 to 75% of a daily contract amount for the regular runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3682.337s">So</a>  that is what we would be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3685.478s">And</a>  I would bring a calculation back to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3689.521s">No</a>  decision would be made, but I think it's important that it is reviewed and the implications are understood by everyone that if we do not maintain some. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3702.054s">goodwill</a>  in this group that we will be at a loss of bus drivers going forward.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3709.238s">Member</a>  van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3711.258s">Kirsteen,</a>  I just wanted to make sure, is the bus company presently and continuing to pay their employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3719.843s">They</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3721.181s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3722.082s">And</a>  at the same time, the bus company, like all of those athletic trips that we would be taking now, we are not paying for, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3732.53s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3733.391s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3734.492s">I</a>  would like to make a motion that we authorize you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3738.375s">Patterson,</a>  to negotiate on our behalf as long as the bus company is committed to paying their employees.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3752.6s">Any</a>  other questions?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3754.922s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3756.944s">Kirsten,</a>  can you just give us an update on the timeline of the larger negotiation that you're referring to?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3765.09s">So</a>  this has been happening since the closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3768.789s">So</a>  working with the other school business officials in the Department of Education, we have been doing Zoom conferences, meetings, we've been getting guidance from the federal government as they've provided them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3784.302s">And</a>  so these have been ongoing discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3787.405s">So</a>  just today, we had another session. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3790.648s">At</a>  noontime, I have a sample contract that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3794.913s">Um,</a>  look at, and once I communicate with the. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3799.556s">Um,</a>  owner of Eastern bus, I can bring back what, um, a potential cost would be for that, uh, extension or a side agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3808.922s">It</a>  would no longer be payment on the regular bus contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3811.884s">It</a>  would be a memo of understanding a separate contract just for the purpose of this emergency situation.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3821.508s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, I was talking about our upcoming contract that's out to bid.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3827.311s">So</a>  the upcoming contract is has been posted accordingly with the procurement office at City Hall that is scheduled for bid opening April 15.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3846.317s">And</a>  I think we talked about sharing a copy with the committee in one of our initial budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3853.441s">If</a>  you could send a copy of the bid or give us a link or something, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3859.403s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3860.744s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3863.245s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3863.645s">A</a>  motion by member Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Member Rousseau to allow Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3871.009s">Patterson</a>  to negotiate accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3876.323s">Do</a>  you want to still take a vote on that in two weeks before it's approved, or is this just given full allowance? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3883.786s">Member</a>  van de Kloot, that was your motion.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3886.507s">I</a>  defer to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3887.908s">Patterson</a>  to find out which way would she bring it back to us?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3892.61s">Yes,</a>  so I can provide you an update now that you're providing the authorization for me to communicate, and I will give you an update as to what <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3905.031s">the</a>  Department of Ed, and the further guidance has been described, and also share a sample side agreement document with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3914.274s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3915.954s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3916.335s">OK,</a>  so motion by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Rousseau to allow Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3921.056s">Patterson</a>  to enter discussions and negotiations to then give us an update in two weeks for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3928.438s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3929.099s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3929.919s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3930.579s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3932.059s">Paper</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3933.06s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3933.42s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3935.302s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3935.602s">Um,</a>  number eight old business number one school safety procedural update, which was tabled on 39 2020.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3956.41s">Motion</a>  by <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3963.806s">Member</a>  Kreatz, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3965.566s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3966.047s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3966.567s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3968.507s">Could</a>  I just ask that, because this is now so long ago, even though I'm sure I knew what it was then, if you could just send me an email, Mr. McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3977.83s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3979.01s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3979.39s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3980.79s">Number</a>  two, so motion approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3983.851s">Number</a>  two, status of outstanding reports tabled on 3-9-2020.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3988.972s">This</a>  was also me, Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3991.755s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3992.695s">And</a>  so, again, I would also request, especially with the proposed reports, that this be moved to the policy and rules subcommittee, of which I'm also a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4004.861s">But</a>  the idea would be that we would review what the requests were and see if there's any that we need to, you know, that if we can't find the institutional knowledge around, that we need to come back to the committee and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4020.582s">I</a>  have a motion to move to the rules and policy subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4023.823s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4025.103s">Motion</a>  by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4028.744s">I'm</a>  sure you will communicate about that one, too, through e-mail.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4031.885s">I</a>  have a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4033.706s">Yes,</a>  member Vanden Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4042.408s">the</a>  number of potential subcommittees we might be having. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4046.369s">I</a>  think at this time, while we're under crisis, that we need to not have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4052.571s">And</a>  I don't know how many requests people have put in to have them, but I am concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4056.952s">I</a>  think we do need to limit the amount we're asking of our administrators until we get back to normal.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4071.778s">In</a>  general, I agree, but I think that for at least certainly the outstanding reports, well, what I'm trying to say is that I have talked to the superintendent about when a subcommittee doesn't really actually need any administrative <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4089.312s">people</a>  there that we should – that they should get comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4093.855s">If</a>  we're going to go through the existing outstanding reports, for instance, I mean, the school committee voted to have these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4101.319s">We</a>  can look at them again and decide whether we really want them or not without anybody from central office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4107.142s">I</a>  mean, that might not be the best example, but I think having our meetings anyways and then trying to be a little more cautious and careful about how much time <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4118.442s">they're</a>  going to have to put in is a better option than just not doing them, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4124.412s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4128.607s">Yes,</a>  and I would just add that, you know, I appreciated the superintendent reaching out to us in the last meeting asking this subcommittee folks to get in touch with her to schedule the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4140.631s">We're</a>  really trying to limit the meeting times. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4143.632s">I</a>  know for our subcommittee for special education was actually joined with another entire huge topic, which is behavioral health. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4152.754s">We</a>  haven't even had the opportunity to meet yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4155.335s">We</a>  do need to at least bring those people to the tables to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4158.834s">goals</a>  and strategy for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4160.815s">So</a>  again, but we're trying very much to limit those meetings in the one that I scheduled to one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4167.037s">And</a>  I wouldn't expect that would have an additional one necessarily by the end of the year, unless something substantial changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4177.241s">But</a>  in any case, I would say that we still need to have the subcommittee meetings, especially since we didn't get to have one before all of this stuff happened.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.595s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.895s">So</a>  I think my concern is the number of subcommittee meetings, and I have no idea how many requests there were. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4197.081s">And</a>  so maybe I can just ask if the superintendent keep us abreast at how many are being asked for, because I just want to keep it real and appropriate for this particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4213.732s">Obviously,</a>  you guys know I love going to subcommittee meetings, but it depends on, this is an unusual time and I think people are already taxed, so I want to make sure we're being smart about it.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4226.175s">Yes,</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4227.496s">Thank</a>  you, Member Van Der Kool. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4229.318s">And</a>  I do have a special education subcommittee meeting that will be scheduled for the 14th, I believe, next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4237.804s">And</a>  I will continue to monitor the subcommittee activity, and I will communicate that more widely to the entire body. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4248.053s">But</a>  I am also trying to be cognizant of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4252.896s">So</a>  thank you for putting that out there, and we will make it work.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4257.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4258.679s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4259.519s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4266.122s">All</a>  those in favor of those proposed papers move to rules and policy subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4272.304s">The</a>  function of the Medford School Committee 2020 to 2022 document update <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4277.927s">offered</a>  by Mr. Rousseau, tabled on 3-9-2020.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4283.111s">May</a>  I suggest that really the point of having this at the meeting is so we could all physically sign it, which isn't really an option right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4289.815s">So</a>  perhaps we should leave it tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4292.357s">I</a>  think that we've already discussed the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4296.44s">So</a>  that's just my thought.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4300.683s">Motion</a>  to table, undebatable, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4303.885s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4304.546s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4306.827s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4308.439s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4309.16s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4310.3s">Paper</a>  is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4311.962s">Number</a>  four, be it resolved that a playground advisory committee shall be created to oversee the completion of work associated with three CPC grants related to the Columbus and Brooks Playground Repair and Resurfacing and the McGlynn School Design Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4326.912s">The</a>  work will include collaboration and review of the RFP for the McGlynn Design Study and the execution of the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4334.261s">The</a>  advisory committee will also view all four school playgrounds and make recommendations regarding increased accessibility of playgrounds to all our students to be completed within the existing scope of funding or provided to the school committee as additional recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4348.768s">The</a>  advisory committee shall provide a preliminary update to the school committee no later than June 1st and then quarterly thereafter for up to one year from the date of creation or sooner if work is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4361.109s">Dr.</a>  Cushing will issue a call for interested applicants and recommend members for the playground advisory committee to the school committee no later than, we can change these dates, April 6th, school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4374.579s">The</a>  playground advisory committee will include school administrators, at least one parent from each elementary school and individuals with expertise in inclusive play and play spaces offered by member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4386.368s">So</a>  mayor, this was approved in our, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4390.538s">meeting</a>  whenever that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4395.301s">But</a>  we do need to change the date to give Peter some runway to get this off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4401.445s">Peter,</a>  I was thinking May 4th, but you tell me if that's okay, thumbs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4408.99s">So</a>  I'd make a motion to amend this approved motion to change the timeline to our May 4th school meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4420.14s">school</a>  committee meeting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4421.882s">It</a>  was till May 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4422.923s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4424.746s">Motion</a>  to table by member Graham seconded by member. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4427.609s">Would</a>  you like to speak member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4430.312s">Yes,</a>  I actually had a motion to withdraw your motion to table member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4435.378s">I</a>  wasn't tabling it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4436.6s">Oh,</a>  I was just amending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4439.042s">Amending</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4440.164s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4440.819s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4442.4s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4443.481s">So</a>  I also just wanted to ask, and I'm not sure if this is amendment or what, but asking that the call for members is inclusive and that we are respectful of diversity as we're approaching that call for the advisory, because I'm sure that we are, Dr. Cushing, but I just like to put it out there to make sure that we are soliciting <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4468.646s">I</a>  would defer to folks from all members of our community for those respective positions, and we can talk more about what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4479.17s">I</a>  would defer to folks in the mayor's office as well about how we're actually reaching the constituents for that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4492.112s">Mr.</a>  Cushing, we'll work with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4493.753s">The</a>  mayor's office has been in touch with the NAACP and they're helping us a great deal to get diverse members of a number of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4502.598s">So</a>  I will definitely have Neil Osborne, our human diversity director work alongside Mr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4510.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4513.304s">So</a>  motion as amended by member Graham, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4518.947s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4520.007s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4522.29s">Motion</a>  has passed as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4525.753s">Communications,</a>  new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4528.735s">Given</a>  the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting state of emergency, I move that we defer the Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee until the fall of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4538.882s">Further</a>  recruitment of membership in the advisory committee begin anew at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4543.486s">Further</a>  that this vision committee shall follow the format of the advisory committee as laid out in the Medford School Committee policy <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4551.155s">BDF</a>  advisory committees to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4557.153s">I</a>  believe that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4558.585s">I</a>  offered that with member Graham and member Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4563.048s">So</a>  I just, I talked to the superintendent and I was just thinking that this didn't feel like the right time for us to all be getting together and traveling to the school and inspecting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4577.597s">It</a>  just felt like that this particular committee really needed to be in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4582.921s">And</a>  so I had suggested that maybe we move it to the spring <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4588.164s">Superintendent</a>  felt we should start it in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4590.265s">And</a>  so that's why I put this out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4593.247s">So</a>  we could just kind of reset in the fall after we've had a chance to get through this.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4601.531s">I</a>  think the fall is fine for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4604.153s">I</a>  would just ask, I did spend a lot of time trying to get the group together and I did email 15 participants that are excited to be on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4614.956s">The</a>  NAACP and Neil Osborne, again, are working to find one to two additional members for this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4621.42s">So</a>  just ask them to continue their work, and they have the spring and summer to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4627.744s">Mr.</a>  Osborne did write something up today letting us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4635.95s">He</a>  has reached out to the NAACP branch to explore finding a representative with the time, energy, and interest in joining the High School Vision Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4644.69s">We</a>  had planned a meeting with the leadership of the branch, but the current circumstances required rescheduling that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4653.213s">As</a>  always, found the branch a supportive partner with the city to find local persons who want to serve on our boards, commissions, and committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4660.156s">I'm</a>  confident before the end of the summer, we can identify a branch member that we can add to the Medford High School Vision Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4666.759s">So</a>  positive news, and I thank Mr. Osborne for helping out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4670.901s">And</a>  I will, as long as- <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4674.83s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4675.891s">I</a>  just would add that, you know, in the fall, you know, the people that we have already identified, we may need to reopen it a little bit because some of those people might not be available, life circumstances for some of, who knows how many of us could have changed dramatically by the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4693.202s">So</a>  I just think, you know, we may need to do more recruitment in the fall in addition to trying to find a more representative group of people.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4703.055s">That's</a>  understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4703.976s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4704.817s">We</a>  may, but I just want to make sure we, I didn't know what you meant by begin anew.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4711.296s">I</a>  mostly was interested in the policy that indicates that the slate of people that we choose for the advisory committee has to come to the school committee for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4726.38s">The</a>  policy has a set of steps that we're supposed to follow that honestly, until January, I didn't even know existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4734.442s">And</a>  I just thought, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4736.65s">There's</a>  nothing wrong with the people we've already recruited, but we should be including them in section six of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4742.375s">We're</a>  supposed to tell them how long they have to be on this advisory committee, what is the language that the school committee is saying is their charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4755.427s">I</a>  know we actually had talked about in our last regular meeting about having a committee of the whole to sit down and talk about what is their charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4764.366s">Of</a>  course, all of that is out the window because we aren't having that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4769.689s">So</a>  that beginning of just meeting will make sure all the I's are dotted and the T's are crossed and that we have officially approved charge of this vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4781.613s">because</a>  I feel like I've heard and seen, like I've seen a city council meeting where it was described and I've described it myself numerous times in email and in school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4792.577s">And</a>  I feel like every time somebody describes it, we all put our own little spin on what it is we think that this committee is going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4799.259s">And</a>  I think that the explicit language of what they're supposed to do should be approved by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4805.962s">And</a>  then that's the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4808.763s">I</a>  think that is the end of the conversation about what it is we have asked them to do.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4817.199s">I</a>  think all of this certainly speaks to starting at the beginning of the process instead of at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4825.405s">I</a>  think if we sit down and we talk about a clear set of goals, we can mitigate against differing opinions about what the committee is supposed to do or wants to do or thinks they should do or thinks they can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4838.715s">We</a>  also would have an opportunity then to outline and lay out <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4842.558s">what</a>  the real expectations are for the kind of work that we're doing, how much time we think it's going to take, as well as what's the right number of people on the committee to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4854.224s">So</a>  because we never outline what the work is, we have no idea if we have the right number of people to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4861.027s">I</a>  think there's a lot of different schools of thoughts that we need to entertain as we put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4865.189s">So</a>  if we start there with the beginning of the process, we can have a clear picture of the number and types of folks that we want to represent our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4875.752s">Then</a>  we can put out a call that is clear and unambiguous, solicit people, bring them back and allow this committee to <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4886.1s">help</a>  put that committee together so that it can be positioned to move forward as quickly as possible, given our already delay.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4897.529s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4897.949s">I</a>  would just like to amend the motion to allow the 15 that were notified and asked and were responsive and accepted the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4911.963s">the</a>  offer that we make sure those 15, whether we have a committee of 17, 19 or 21, I just want to make sure those 15 that are very excited to serve in this committee that have already been given the offer are extended that offer in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4926.476s">So</a>  I'd just like to make that as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4929.979s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4930.4s">Okay,</a>  motion for approval as amended by member, as amended by myself, but motion for approval.</p>
