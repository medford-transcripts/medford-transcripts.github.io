00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,111
I called her.

00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,152
Sorry, I think it didn't come through.

45
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:13,953
Got it.

46
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,314
If we all may salute the flag.

47
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:31,065
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

48
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:40,071

All those opposed?

63
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,475
We need to call the roll.

64
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:11,816
Roll call vote.

65
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,476
Yep.

66
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:14,197
Member Graham?

67
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:14,878

Member McStone?

73
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,239
Member McStone?

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
I don't think Mia's hearing me.

75
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,301
Member Rousseau?

76
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,121
It's almost like our screen's frozen.

77
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:30,701
I don't know.

78
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,442
Mia, are you there?

79
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,502
I'll message her.

80
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:34,423
OK.

81
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,243
Member Rousseau?

82
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:36,043
Yes.

83
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:40,364
Member Vanderkloof?

84
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:40,604
Yes.

85
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:41,745
Yes, I'm here.

86
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:43,959
Okay, Mia, I got you.

87
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,660
Mayor Luongo Kern.

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,901
Luongo Kern, I'm here.

89
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:49,602
All present.

90
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:52,364
Reports of secretary.

91
00:04:52,384 --> 00:05:01,190
I just wanted to let everybody know that I was in on Wednesday to sign the bills.

92
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:11,396
Right now I'm signing the bills on a bi-weekly basis, so I go in every other week until I hear any, until I'm given any other instructions.

93
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:21,103
I am proceeding with and very thankful for our great people who are coming in to work to get the bills ready for me.

94
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:26,666
Great.

95
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:31,709
Reports of committees, rules, policy and equity subcommittee 3-3-20.

96
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,939
That would be me.

97
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,819
Thank you.

98
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:47,103
So I can barely remember it, but on March 3rd, the rules policy and equity subcommittee met.

99
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:51,125
There were three recommendations that were all approved by the subcommittee.

100
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,967
We already took up one of those in the last meeting.

101
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,329
regular school committee meeting, we tabled two items.

102
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,472
I'm going to leave one of those items tabled for now, which is the policy review policy.

103
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:14,638
But the one I'm going to bring up now is the, sorry, too many documents to switch between.

104
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,061
It is the, where is it?

105
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,782
There it is.

106
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:23,184
The ad hoc report request procedure.

107
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:28,749
It's a pretty technical document, but I'll just read the purpose statement.

108
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:37,958
The purpose of this procedure is to provide member of public school committee members, especially new members, with the knowledge of how to request an ad hoc report.

109
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:39,499
created.

110
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,023
Ad hoc reports can require substantial work by the district staff that will create the report.

111
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:53,649
This procedure is in place to ensure that when the school committee agrees to the creation of such a report that we are able to understand the following.

112
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:57,151
One, how much work is required to create the report.

113
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,314
Two, the questions and the purpose the report is aiming to answer.

114
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,948
Three, any specific information that is required in the report.

115
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:14,950
And four, determine if there is an existing report, ad hoc or periodic, that provides the answers to the questions being asked.

116
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:22,012
It is the responsibility of all school committee members to understand this procedure and members should help each other to ensure compliance.

117
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:30,203
On February 3rd, 2020, the school committee approved the following motion, which has led to the creation of this rule.

118
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:51,274
Given that creation of ad hoc reports at the behest of the school committee can require substantial effort on the part of the office of the superintendent and district staff, and that the school committee often depends on ad hoc reports to assist in deliberations, the rules policy and equity subcommittee shall generate a new rule for the school committee to guide how ad hoc reports

119
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:52,875
requests are generated.

120
00:07:53,416 --> 00:08:00,643
I won't read the rest of this, but are there any members who have any specific questions or thoughts?

121
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,700
Member Van de Kloot.

122
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,202
I read through it and I was comfortable with it.

123
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:23,529
I wanted to make sure that our administrative people also thought that it was workable.

124
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,560
Yes, we were at the meeting.

125
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,462
We worked collaboratively in subcommittee to come up with those guidelines.

126
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:45,285
I feel that it's reasonable and it will allow us to be able to pace ourselves and manage the workload for specific reports.

127
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:58,794
So I want to thank Paul for his leadership in helping to put that kind of a system and structure in place so that we're able to have more realistic expectations.

128
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:03,578
Thank you to the subcommittee, and I'd like to make a motion to approve.

129
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,141
Motion to approve by member van de Kloot, seconded by?

130
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,923
Seconded.

131
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,405
Member Graham, all those in favor?

132
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:13,485
Aye.

133
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:16,114
Motion passes.

134
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,979
Committee of the Whole, March 9th, 2020.

135
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,664
The Committee of the Whole was our first budget hearing, I believe.

136
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,647
I don't have that, I'm sorry, I don't have that paper before me.

137
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,669
Motion to approve?

138
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,112
Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member Kratz.

139
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:41,913
All those in favor?

140
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:44,992
Motion is passed.

141
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:54,220
Our next minutes to approve the emergency meeting we had on March 12th, 2020.

142
00:09:56,322 --> 00:10:07,272
At that time, we discussed closure of schools, questions and answers were had after a update from the mayor's office and the superintendent.

143
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,214
Is there a motion for approval?

144
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:09,995
Approval?

145
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:10,355
Motion?

146
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:15,540
Motion for approval by member Kretz, seconded by member Van De Kloot.

147
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,761
All in favor?

148
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:17,802
Paper passes.

149
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:24,488
And then last was our meeting last Monday on March 30, 2020, to review the crisis that we're currently going through.

150
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:45,543
We had three or four agenda items that were discussed as it relates to schooling of our children and how the teachers union and, and our superintendent and assistant superintendents are working with the unions to get our kids educated, as well as Chromebooks, I don't know if anything

151
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:46,584
have anything to add?

152
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:47,504
Motion for approval.

153
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:21,607
The parent is just concerned that it's going to be counted as a not pass.

154
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:33,895
I just want to get that on the record that it's not a requirement and if they don't want to go on the Zoom call, it's not going to hurt their grade for pass or fail.

155
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:36,376
So could somebody please clarify that for me?

156
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:36,956
Thank you.

157
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,958
Yes, Ms.

158
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:39,398
Caldwell.

159
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:43,901
Yes, I queried all of our schools to see what

160
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,822
how many teachers were using Zoom.

161
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:57,732
And most of our schools and teachers are using it on some level, but it's not a requirement for a pass or fail for our students.

162
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:03,477
So you can reassure parents that it will not be part of the requirements.

163
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:04,718
Okay.

164
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:05,642
Thank you.

165
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:27,592
Um, and I just wanted to share, um, or, you know, my concern regarding, and I know you don't have the numbers just yet, but, um, in terms of how many families haven't been connected with, and, um, last week I had a conversation with, uh, Dr. Cushing, um, and I shared an idea that I had, um, that maybe,

166
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:39,178
If we're still having trouble reaching out to these families, we could have the school resource officer, or maybe the police department, do a wellness check with these families.

167
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:45,761
Because you know, how do we know they even have any of the communication that we're giving to everybody I guess.

168
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:59,589
you know, I'm a little concerned and worried for those families because if we haven't heard from them, we don't know what they know and what they don't know regarding the distance learning and what we're doing regarding the pass or fail or just any of the communication.

169
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,652
So, you know, I just wanted to just share my idea and, you know, just put it out there.

170
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:07,494
Thank you.

171
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:36,683
When I give my remarks during in the next portion of the agenda, that I will say some of the things that we are doing in order to try to reach out to families that we're not hearing from.

172
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,038
Motion to accept the minutes from 30-30-2020?

173
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:02,359
Motion to accept.

174
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,421
Motion to accept by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

175
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,541
All those in favor?

176
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:07,621
Aye.

177
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:09,842
Minutes passed, thank you.

178
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,023
Community participation.

179
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:22,026
Questions, again, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

180
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:26,208
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name,

181
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,582
your Medford Street address and your question.

182
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,821
member Russo, are there any questions for this portion to date?

183
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:41,524
There was a question that came in earlier today, but I answered it based on our earlier conversations about how we would do this.

184
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:46,966
If the answer was already known and decided, I would just reply rather than putting it through the meeting.

185
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:51,608
There was a question about whether or not the New York trip was going to be canceled.

186
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:54,489
Of course, I replied that it had been canceled.

187
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,070
But I can't remember the detail on

188
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:06,037
The processing for reimbursements will take, I said, will take quite some time because City Hall has to do it and everything's not really operating normally.

189
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:06,578
Is that correct?

190
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:13,534
So the reimbursements, I don't believe it will actually go through City Hall, but it goes to the student activities accounts.

191
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,875
And so each school has its own student activities account.

192
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:22,458
And the checks need to be processed and actually written back to the original check writer.

193
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:27,460
And so just each individual check

194
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,922
needs to be rewritten back, per se.

195
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:37,764
I'm sure that we could tally up if someone had made four payments and write them into one check.

196
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:47,368
But in essence, all those checks need to be written back to the individuals, which could be a couple hundred checks.

197
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,411
And do you think that that will take not until we get back to school kind of thing?

198
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:55,311
Yes.

199
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:56,152
Yes.

200
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:57,166
Thank you.

201
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:04,068
If it can be done sooner, it will, but I don't see how we'll be able to make that a reality.

202
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:05,488
Right, thank you.

203
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:08,049
Thank you.

204
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:16,951
If there's no other community participation, we'll go to number seven, which is report of the superintendent, Dr. Vincent.

205
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:17,992
Thank you.

206
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,032
Good evening.

207
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,894
The Medford Public Schools continues to be a work in progress.

208
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,064
Again, I realize that this is a hard time for all.

209
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,649
So much uncertainty surrounds us.

210
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,658
We are here for parents, caregivers, guardians, as well as our students.

211
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:53,318
If you feel your child is struggling with anxiety issues over a particular situation, please contact their school principal who will put you in touch with their guidance or adjustment counselor.

212
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,066
They will be very happy to assist you and provide you with helpful information.

213
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:11,727
With the way the crisis is going, our administrators are already discussing how to handle when students do report back to school, whether it is this year or in the fall.

214
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:19,252
Either way, we know that our teachers will be planning to revisit instruction from when it ended on March 12th.

215
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:29,038
This will allow our students to get back into the educational loop and will help to eliminate any apprehension or concerns about returning to school.

216
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,439
So this is a high priority for us.

217
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,662
However, before I continue with my report,

218
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:55,429
I wanted to take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to Assistant Superintendent of Finance, Christine Patterson, who will be leaving us at the end of this school year to take on a new position with Lincoln-Sudbury School District.

219
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,590
This move will allow her additional time

220
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:10,745
to be closer to home and spend more family time with her daughter, Addie, who's growing up and becoming very involved in many other extracurricular activities.

221
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,427
And understandably, Christine does want to be there for her.

222
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:23,951
During her four-year tenure with the Medford Public Schools, Christine professionalized the business office.

223
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:33,289
She helped to streamline the budget process and highlighted the financial ramifications of the charter school reimbursements.

224
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,037
A Navy veteran, Christine served our country and this district with dedication and pride.

225
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:51,253
Personally, Christine welcomed me aboard and walked me through the ins and outs of the involved budget process here in Medford.

226
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:55,096
Her guidance and support will be greatly missed.

227
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,959
We wish her much luck and happiness in her new position.

228
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,843
And we thank you, Christine, for your years of service to the Medford Public Schools and the community.

229
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,747
Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

230
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,757
Thank you, Christine, for all your service.

231
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,057
Member van de Kloot.

232
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:20,578
Oh, wait.

233
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:22,799
Member van de Kloot, if you could press unmute.

234
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,960
There we go.

235
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
I wanted to say thank you to Ms.

236
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,441
Patterson as well.

237
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,862
Christine's worked very difficult and in a very demanding job.

238
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,483
I would like to say almost a thankless job.

239
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,724
So I would like to thank her for her work.

240
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:45,125
dedication to her position, and I'd like to wish her well.

241
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:59,929
I think it's certainly understandable that not driving quite as far as she drives, which is way too long, and being close to her daughter, even though it's going to be difficult to find someone in this very difficult position.

242
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:01,570
But thank you, Kirsteen.

243
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,170
Thank you.

244
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:09,973
I want to say a couple of words.

245
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:10,834
Ms.

246
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:18,178
Patterson, I want to say thank you very much for your service over the last couple of years in such a short amount of time you have accomplished so much.

247
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,520
You were a great help to me when I was signing the bills.

248
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:29,605
In fact, you came down and met me at city hall and showed me what to do and answered any questions I had about the bills.

249
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:44,528
You've just done an incredible job balancing the budget and beginning the process to change the scheduling of the budget, which we started last year, which was extremely efficient.

250
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:50,330
And we were able to have the meetings more regularly to discuss them in smaller group sessions.

251
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,311
And I just really appreciate everything you've done and I wish you well in your new endeavors.

252
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:54,851
Thank you.

253
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,012
Thank you, member Kretz.

254
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:11,997
Number two under... I do have additional updates, but I didn't know if other members had wanted to speak.

255
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:18,540
I wanted to say some of the social emotional offerings that we're going to be providing to our students.

256
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,481
So I'm gonna go back to the report of the superintendent.

257
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:23,842
Thank you.

258
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:24,482
Okay, thank you.

259
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,323
It looks like Mia has her hand up.

260
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:27,003
Mia, is that right?

261
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:30,347
I think she's frozen again.

262
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:47,114
Mia?

263
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,056
Can everybody hear Mia or am I the only one?

264
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:51,356
Okay, Mia.

265
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:54,258
This is where there's eight people all on the internet at once.

266
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:58,690
Mia, we're not able to hear you.

267
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,611
Can you just try to turn off your video, Mia?

268
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,572
We may have a better chance of hearing you that way.

269
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,353
Can you hear me?

270
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,653
Better, better.

271
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:09,053
Sorry, Mia.

272
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,410
Hmm.

273
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:32,072
I think she said she was gonna get the kids off.

274
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:44,897
Can you hear me now?

275
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:47,658
You still kind of sound like a Martian.

276
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,260
Mia, can you dial in from a phone?

277
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,240
I can't hear you.

278
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,222
No, Mia, we can't hear you.

279
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:07,707
How about, Mia, can you dial in on a regular phone?

280
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,852
Can you hear us, Mia?

281
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:25,902
Mia, we're going to let the superintendent finish with her report and then

282
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:30,202
you can maybe try to use a phone to call in and we can always go back to that.

283
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:31,524
Sorry.

284
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,946
That's okay.

285
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,294
Thank you, member Stone.

286
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:43,377
Okay, I want to give some important cell updates.

287
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:58,793
Miss Stacy Shulman, the supervisor of clinical and behavioral services, sent an email to our teaching staff, informing them that many of our students are experiencing an extensive amount of personal turmoil right now.

288
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:01,475
Beyond this situation,

289
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:18,114
Students could also be experiencing financial challenges, family conflict, food insecurities, barriers to accessing or completing schoolwork, and last but not least, health challenges.

290
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:30,320
We have also heard from students that they are feeling an increase in discrimination based on their race, particularly from our Asian American students.

291
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,767
I just want to restate that MPS Medford Public Schools does not tolerate or endorse discrimination of any kind.

292
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:41,009
And we are closely monitoring that.

293
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:55,223
So we are, again, urging families to reach out to school, the school leaders, school principals, who will be able to direct you to Stacey Shulman, who is our supervisor of clinical and behavioral services.

294
00:24:56,969 --> 00:25:00,732
After working for many years with students and educators, Ms.

295
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:07,036
Stacey Shulman has found that the impact that teachers have on their students is quite profound.

296
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:12,260
Many students are grieving the loss of contact with the faculty.

297
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:21,127
They see every school day and the sense of security that has been provided that they're normally accustomed to, that that is now gone.

298
00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:25,690
They have come to rely on their classroom routines

299
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:27,503
and what to expect.

300
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:42,274
Stacey is urging teachers in her email to take a look and take a moment and check in with their students and ask them how they are doing and to acknowledge that this is hard, very hard for all of us.

301
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:53,262
If any teacher feels a student is making comments relating to possibly hurting themselves or others, the teacher should call 911

302
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:57,025
and call the student's principal.

303
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:15,049
Additionally, Stacy is preparing counseling staff with additional professional development around trauma, creating resources for students, families, and staff, assembling a professional development series for staff to support students.

304
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,311
And this will be advertised soon on our virtual support group for parents and caregivers.

305
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,822
So on Wednesday at four o'clock, Ms.

306
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:32,084
Stacey Shulman will be hosting a support group Zoom meeting for teachers.

307
00:26:33,365 --> 00:26:38,347
Interested faculty should email her to be included in that particular meeting.

308
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:50,657
Um, moving away from social emotional learning and moving on to MCAS, uh, we are still waiting to hear an official word from Desi.

309
00:26:51,557 --> 00:27:01,259
Um, just wanted to keep you informed that Desi has not given an official, um, response yet, uh, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

310
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,300
As of this time,

311
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:10,179
uh, all schools have been making a concerted effort to reach out.

312
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:33,511
And so right now we have posted many, many positive videos of teachers and staff saying hello and checking in with their, uh, with their students and also just resurfacing some very, um, happy videos that were taking place at other times when school was fully functioning so that people have positive things to look at and memories to think about.

313
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:40,330
These videos have been posted on our blog and website and our PTO Facebook pages.

314
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:51,240
Additionally, as what was just mentioned in our budget committee of the whole meeting prior to this meeting, our director of library media and technology, Ms.

315
00:27:51,280 --> 00:28:02,169
Molly Layden, we've given out over 650 Chromebooks and we're going to see, you know, continue to monitor and see how that goes.

316
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:07,553
We know that we haven't reached everyone, but we're really pleased that we were able to make a significant dent.

317
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:28,030
We want to also note that all students in K, kindergarten through second grade, that Gmail accounts have been created for those students, which normally does not take place because they're not yet really able to type, but Google accounts, Gmail accounts were sent out so that

318
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,975
teachers can communicate with students using the Google Classroom platform.

319
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:41,223
And so we thank families that are really taking on a heavy lift to support our youngest learners in those grade levels.

320
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:45,988
We continue to have updated information being posted

321
00:28:46,588 --> 00:29:04,617
on our remote learning website, and that will be giving additional Google Classroom information for teachers by school, and information will also be available for parents and caregivers to support them with navigating this new system.

322
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:19,922
So if people do need support with technology questions about their Chromebooks, they can email tech support, one word, T-E-C-H-S-U-P-P-O-R-T at medford.k12.ma.us.

323
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:33,929
We're also going to be having an additional site, which will be specific to training resources using the Google site.

324
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:40,378
And that will be posted, again, on our blog and on our website.

325
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:51,788
With regards to library services, there is a new Medford Public Schools Pre-K to 8 virtual library site for parents and students.

326
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:55,631
And the link has been posted to the website and the blog.

327
00:29:56,171 --> 00:30:04,457
So again, I urge you to go and look for up-to-date information at our website and blog sites.

328
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:10,102
The site brings together resources and links to help our Pre-K to 8 students.

329
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:15,246
to continue reading and exploring different topics of interest.

330
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:24,874
The site's goal is to provide students and families with a central place to find well-curated resources.

331
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,257
This site is being updated regularly.

332
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,870
at the high school level as well.

333
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:37,554
We've posted a distance learning guide for our high school students on the high school library guide.

334
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:46,220
And that is on our website, medfordpublicschools.libguides.com slash home.

335
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:58,929
So we wanna thank Molly Layden and her entire technology team who have really been working tirelessly during the school closure time to make as much information available

336
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:01,239
online for everyone.

337
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:03,390
So we thank you sincerely for that.

338
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:29,561
Uh, we've had a lot of fun different types of activities that are also taking place We have schools that are trying to think of activities that aren't just strictly Academic but things that are getting kids to go outside and I want to just share a few at the columbus school for example Students were encouraged to get outside and just decorate their sidewalk with chalk

339
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:35,250
and to decorate their home with messages of positivity and well-being.

340
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:39,314
They took photos and they posted it to the Columbus School website.

341
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:47,441
Likewise, at the McGlynn Elementary School, they asked their students to display a kindness heart.

342
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,631
which they have decorated.

343
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:55,956
And students are placing those kindness hearts on their doors or windows at their home.

344
00:31:56,937 --> 00:32:02,461
And that heart means that there's solidarity and that we're all in this together.

345
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:07,024
So these are just some types of activities that are taking place.

346
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:24,532
Um tomorrow at 10 o'clock the roberts school is going to be hosting a parade uh, the roberts staff are going to Be in a caravan of cars and they're going to drive around the roberts neighborhood waving.

347
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:34,616
Hello to their students so um for the roberts community you should have received communication about that at 10 o'clock, um, there will be a parade just

348
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:40,328
letting you know that we are thinking about you and we care about all of you.

349
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:55,919
I also wanna just share some important information that Medford Mustang alumni are doing in this special school closure time, but supporting COVID-19, supporting hospitals.

350
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,845
So Mustang alumni have stepped up to the plate to support our medical professionals during this crisis.

351
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:04,986
The 1984 graduates,

352
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:10,732
Hank Morris, Hank Morse and Tracy Hollander.

353
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:20,064
They issued a Facebook challenge to all Medford High School graduating classes to come together and possibly make donations to the hospitals.

354
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:36,968
Since that pledge, that challenge, seven different graduating classes have stepped up, and they have made either food donations or mask donations to Boston Medical Center, Leahy Hospital, and Mass General Hospitals.

355
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:49,438
So the health care professionals are incredibly grateful, and I want to just continue to thank our Mustang community for going that extra mile and helping our medical professionals.

356
00:33:51,033 --> 00:34:04,678
Additionally, 1988 graduate Peter Akala, owner of Numaj DJ and entertainment services, took his DJ equipment outside and entertained his entire neighborhood.

357
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:09,580
His neighbors came out to their yards to dance and enjoyed the music.

358
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:13,162
All of these actions embody the Mustang way.

359
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:32,416
the blue and white continues to flow through these mustang veins and that makes us all so proud so i want to just thank them and say go mustangs additionally on the community engagement side our ccsr students have also been uh creating challenges and encouraging

360
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:41,201
Our mustang community to get outside in a positive way They had a video hashtag six feet together.

361
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:54,509
They were working collaboratively with our mayor And saturday they hosted the porch jam Urging citizens to come out onto their porches or decks and sing the john lennon song imagine

362
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:14,037
I want to highlight our Medford High School sophomores, Lily Began and Caden Golisano, members of CCSR, who realized that during the hashtag stay home order to stop the spread of COVID-19, local nursing homes were no longer allowed to have visitors.

363
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:24,882
They knew the residents probably felt extremely lonely, so they began designing and sending uplifting cards to them at the Medford Rehabilitation Center.

364
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:30,924
Additionally, CCSR students at the McGlynn Middle School, sixth graders,

365
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:41,128
Lila Armit, Mia Armit, and Caroline Gomez decided to begin painting rocks around their neighborhood with inspiring messages.

366
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:45,590
These students continue to impress all of us every day.

367
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:54,894
Lastly, or getting close to lastly I should say, Medford Family Network is continuing to support our families

368
00:35:56,223 --> 00:36:03,266
They are still hosting story time with Miss Andrea and indoor play with Miss Cindy virtually.

369
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:09,329
They plan to host the parent cafe virtually on April 15th.

370
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:24,437
Also, if there are any families in need of some of the basic necessities, such as food, baby formula, clothing, or diapers, please reach out to Marie Cassidy.

371
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,497
That's mcassidy at medford.k12.ma.us for assistance.

372
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,425
Also, another resource for our military families this week from 10 a.m.

373
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:39,266
to 2 p.m.

374
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:40,827
at Gillette Stadium.

375
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:53,369
of the Massachusetts Military Support Foundation, Food for Vets, and the New England Patriots, families can pick up two weeks worth of groceries.

376
00:36:53,809 --> 00:37:00,977
So again, if you are a veteran, please take advantage of that great opportunity honoring our veterans at Gillette Stadium.

377
00:37:02,273 --> 00:37:15,416
I want to take this opportunity to thank our teachers, our staff, and administrators who have, without very much notice, stepped up and made this distance learning plan work.

378
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:27,179
It is not perfect by any means, and each day does bring a new question, but every member of the Mustang community has come together and tried their very best

379
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:34,344
to continue as many programs as possible, as well as providing much needed outreach to our students.

380
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:38,567
I am a very proud member of our Mustang team.

381
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:48,093
So this week, some of you who celebrate, yesterday was Palm Sunday, and this week,

382
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:53,286
Um, Passover and good Friday is taking place.

383
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:58,751
Please note that there is no school on Friday in observance of good Friday.

384
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:03,135
I think some families, um, we're not sure.

385
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:08,340
Um, but there will not be formalized instruction on Friday.

386
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,501
Good Friday of this week.

387
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:11,602
So I thank you all.

388
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:22,004
I want to wish all of our families a happy Passover, a happy Easter, or Resurrection Sunday, and enjoy the rest of this week.

389
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:23,984
And we look forward to serving you.

390
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:28,485
Hashtag stay home, hashtag alone together.

391
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:29,285
Thank you.

392
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:32,746
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

393
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,747
Moving on to number two, report on

394
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:41,006
COVID update, we have Tony Ray with us.

395
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:45,969
Tony, let me just unmute you.

396
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,830
Are you able to unmute yourself?

397
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:52,972
Oh, yes, I am.

398
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:53,932
Okay, great.

399
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:56,434
Thank you.

400
00:38:56,454 --> 00:39:02,317
So the data that the state reported yesterday, 76,500 people have been tested.

401
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,932
13,870 people have tested positive.

402
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:17,134
In Medford, we have, as of yesterday, 132 positive cases.

403
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:33,978
What is expected from the Department of Public Health is a surge in cases over the next couple weeks so that we still ask people to stay at home, maintain social distancing, wash your hands, wash your

404
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:42,082
things coming into your home, wash your countertops, just really be very careful about hygiene methods.

405
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:50,365
All of our buildings are presently closed, except for the custodial staff that is working diligently to clean them.

406
00:39:52,006 --> 00:40:02,349
Our school nurses have been participating with Board of Health activities, including contact tracing, meal distribution, elderly wellness checks,

407
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:08,211
and providing outreach to families and virtual student support groups.

408
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:10,651
Thank you.

409
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:12,852
Thank you, Ms.

410
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:13,172
Ray.

411
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:17,674
Marian O'Connor from the Board of Health was unable to join us.

412
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:21,955
We are up from yesterday to 145 cases.

413
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:29,417
And with that comes a lot of contact tracing and a number of cases she's dealing with.

414
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:30,778
So she's sorry she couldn't make it.

415
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:32,905
I'll just take the opportunity.

416
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:37,367
I know our schools are closed, but also our parks are closed, unfortunately.

417
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:42,990
And we have tied up the basketball hoops because we just could not keep group activity off of our parks.

418
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,111
As of the last few days, it's been very nice.

419
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:52,474
And we're also having an issue with tons of people in the fells, parking issues all over.

420
00:40:52,635 --> 00:41:01,079
So I know DCR is working hard to try to secure up some of our parking lots and make sure the Flynn Rink exercise

421
00:41:02,478 --> 00:41:07,061
little portion, area is being roped off.

422
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:19,571
I know people attending to take down some of the signage, but we're working really hard to keep people safe and off our, you know, out of our, out of the parks, unless it's for passive use.

423
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:25,235
So we just continue to stress, please use our parks passively or else we're going to really have to close them.

424
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,516
But we're

425
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:32,993
Mary Ann and Tony are doing a lot of work making sure, and I know a few of your nurses are stepping up, Ms.

426
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:43,979
Ray, to help with the contact tracing, but our health department's working really hard to try to keep people safe, working on the construction and the parks and non-essential services.

427
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,263
Something new is popping up every hour, so she's a little busy, but thank you.

428
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:51,464
Thank you.

429
00:41:53,207 --> 00:42:01,072
Number three, recommendation to approve the cancellation of McGlynn's seventh grade overnight trip to Elton Jones Environmental Park.

430
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:02,493
Mr. Nick Tucci.

431
00:42:02,513 --> 00:42:06,256
Good evening, Memphis School Committee.

432
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:19,664
In light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, school and district leaders unfortunately recommend the cancellation, the formal cancellation of the seventh grade Elton Jones environmental overnight field trip scheduled for May 4th and 5th of 2020.

433
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:22,306
Please note that Governor Baker,

434
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:25,945
has urged all schools to cancel upcoming organized trips.

435
00:42:26,365 --> 00:42:36,733
And we understand this is of great disappointment among our seventh graders, their chaperones, and their families, but nevertheless, the safety and wellness of our Medford school community is always our top priority.

436
00:42:37,574 --> 00:42:45,360
If formally canceled, we'll refund all payments made toward the trip back to the McGlynn Middle School families in the coming weeks.

437
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,223
And we'll do that, hopefully, I imagine, in the next two weeks.

438
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,225
Thank you very much, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.

439
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:52,779
Motion to approve.

440
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:53,880
Second.

441
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:04,824
I can't hear you.

442
00:43:07,806 --> 00:43:11,607
Motion to approve by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

443
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,208
All those in favor?

444
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:13,928
Aye.

445
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:15,789
All those opposed?

446
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,510
Paper passes.

447
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:26,746
Number four, report on reimbursement for France trip, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli and Marie Nyland.

448
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,427
Good evening.

449
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:30,667
So Ms.

450
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:40,650
Nyland and I are here tonight to provide you information on the reimbursement for the costs involved in the student trip to France.

451
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:49,932
So on March 2020, just under a month ago, we appeared at the school committee meeting and we recommended to the Medford School Committee

452
00:43:51,093 --> 00:44:00,224
of the cancelling of the April 2020 student trip to France because at that time it was a growing coronavirus, COVID-19 outbreak in Europe.

453
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:11,707
And at that time, we referenced a cover for any reason insurance policy, also known as a CFR policy, which the parents did provide.

454
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:20,190
And at that time, the amount that we were estimate, or the families were estimated to be paid back was $1,050.

455
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,351
So that meant there would have been a loss of $2,100 per family.

456
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:35,363
So we understood how the parents felt, we understood how the committee felt, and we did pursue a full reimbursement.

457
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:42,709
So we reached out to the company, and I think they've been responsive, and I do think that they're trying the best they can.

458
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:57,761
We also reached out to the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, who not only was dealing with Medford's reimbursement issue, but trying to help out with reimbursements across the state.

459
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:06,056
So there were dozens, if not a hundred schools across the state who were dealing with the same type of an issue, not with the same company.

460
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:10,577
Most had different companies, but a similar issue.

461
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:13,617
So they advocated on Medford's behalf.

462
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:22,659
So we did get a response from the travel company and they've responded with the following information.

463
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,060
So they will refund

464
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:30,673
the $1,100 flight fee that was charged.

465
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:35,215
They will refund $1,400 of the land portion.

466
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:41,076
And they will refund $100 of the insurance premium that was paid.

467
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:54,240
Under this offer, the company, the travel company, it's not even the insurance company as I understand, but the travel company directly will be refunding the parents a total of $2,600.

468
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:57,943
That means $500 is non-refundable.

469
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:05,300
So we do recommend accepting this offer.

470
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:12,603
And we did look at what other districts across the state, we try to get as much information as possible on this.

471
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:23,368
And what we were able to find out was with one of the largest travel companies in the state, they are reimbursing their families all of the costs except for $1,000.

472
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:26,430
So in other words, in many districts,

473
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:37,375
Travel companies are holding families responsible for $1,000 under this plan with our travel company Families are being held responsible for $500.

474
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:50,101
It's certainly it would be better if it was a full refund However, given given the circumstances of the massive losses that everyone has

475
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:52,902
is experienced.

476
00:46:52,922 --> 00:47:05,007
And what I would consider due diligence on the part of the insurance company, the administration is recommending this offer.

477
00:47:05,067 --> 00:47:10,189
So again, families would be reimbursed for everything except for $500.

478
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,251
So again, Ms.

479
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,151
Nyland is here.

480
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:20,594
So between the two of us, if you have any questions, we can certainly try to answer those questions.

481
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:24,433
Member McLaughlin.

482
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:26,714
Thank you.

483
00:47:27,434 --> 00:47:30,495
Thank you for the report, Bernadette and Ms.

484
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:33,497
Nyland, and thank you for your hard work on this for families.

485
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:38,178
I'm wondering how have you informed families of this and how they've responded?

486
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:40,939
I think this is great news when we thought we weren't getting anything back.

487
00:47:40,979 --> 00:47:47,001
Of course, getting this good portion of it back is great news.

488
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:50,342
It's unfortunate that families have to lose $500 at all, as we all know.

489
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:59,505
Under the circumstances, I think it's pretty remarkable that you guys were able to do what you did and the insurance company was able to do what they did.

490
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,848
So thank you.

491
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:04,555
And I'm just wondering if you've had any response or feedback from families.

492
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,102
So actually, Ms.

493
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:14,765
Nyland could speak in a moment because she has been talking to families, but our feeling was we did want to report this out to school committee first.

494
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:22,529
So obviously the superintendent, the assistant superintendents are aware, but we did want this to come out to school committee first.

495
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:25,350
So we have not shared any details.

496
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:33,755
We have shared, even last week, the superintendent did share that an offer was made.

497
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:36,810
although new details were provided.

498
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:41,912
So again, we just didn't, in deference to the school committee, we were waiting for this time to do that.

499
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:45,033
Thank you.

500
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:48,115
Any motion on the floor?

501
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,255
Any other questions?

502
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:52,137
Motion to approve.

503
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:54,378
Second.

504
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:57,619
Motion to approve, seconded by member Van de Kloot.

505
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:58,579
All those in favor?

506
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,641
All those opposed?

507
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:03,522
Paper passes.

508
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:03,962
Thank you.

509
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,154
Dr. Cadelli and Ms.

510
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:06,914
Nyland, thank you.

511
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:14,536
Recommendation to approve additions to the middle school health curriculum.

512
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:15,117
Ms.

513
00:49:15,157 --> 00:49:15,497
Perry.

514
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:18,138
Good evening, everyone.

515
00:49:19,238 --> 00:49:23,920
So we had a meeting, a subcommittee meeting on the health education curriculum.

516
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,301
And when I came before school committee last time, you didn't have the documents.

517
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,142
So you should have all received the documents for the Michigan model.

518
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,697
curriculum as well as the sexuality standards.

519
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:45,522
We have been using the Michigan model health curriculum at the middle school, with the exception of the unit called growing up and staying healthy which does include some sexuality education lessons.

520
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:52,210
Um, my staff, uh, since we took over this department, my staff from working very hard to look at what we're doing.

521
00:49:52,930 --> 00:50:08,557
Um, as a curriculum and looking at the state national standards and aligning our curriculum to the state and national standards, and then figuring out where our gaps are for middle school health, our gaps are in sexuality education more specifically.

522
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:21,501
If you looked at the document, I sent an anatomy and physiology, puberty and adolescent development, identity, pregnancy and reproduction, and sexually transmitted infections and HIV standards.

523
00:50:24,295 --> 00:50:31,456
The sexuality education standards that I did provide for you just included middle school, just so you're aware that document does go K to 12.

524
00:50:31,516 --> 00:50:34,837
And we've looked at the high school piece already, which we are covering all of that.

525
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:38,218
Our next step was to look at the middle school piece.

526
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:49,020
So I'm just looking for direction from school committee to see if we can either push this forward or have a conversation about what we want to add.

527
00:50:50,173 --> 00:51:00,642
We do have questions may I ask I did email you this morning miss Perry We got two attachments from you back at the end of March or mid-march One was about six pages one was 13.

528
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:03,785
Is there was there more that we were supposed to get?

529
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:07,328
I remember something mentioned in 600 pages of something.

530
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:13,033
Oh, that's the full curriculum Okay, with all of the lessons in detail.

531
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:17,357
That's a huge document, which I can't provide if you want to I just have to scan it.

532
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:17,497
Okay

533
00:51:19,093 --> 00:51:20,034
member van de Kloot.

534
00:51:20,974 --> 00:51:30,379
Yes, this was discussed at the curriculum subcommittee and the subcommittee voted to bring it forth with a positive endorsement.

535
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,782
However, we didn't have the paperwork at the time, so that was given to you.

536
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:40,105
So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that we go ahead with the adoption of the new curriculum.

537
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:45,269
Just as a reminder, if any parents have concerns, they can opt their students out.

538
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:52,695
But from what I hear, most more people are interested in making sure that their children have this valuable information.

539
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:54,217
Second.

540
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,057
Second.

541
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:56,398
Sorry, Jenny.

542
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:58,720
It's okay.

543
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,901
I don't care who seconds it.

544
00:52:04,365 --> 00:52:05,546
You're on mute, Brianna.

545
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:06,046
There you go.

546
00:52:07,912 --> 00:52:16,719
Then from what I was able to review, can you just tell me what page eight and nine of 13, which grade that relates to?

547
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:28,849
That has to do with the describing the signs and symptoms of a pregnancy, divine emergency contraception and its use.

548
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:37,024
Defining STDs, including HIV, and how they are and are not transmitted.

549
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:40,745
Analyzing the impact of drugs on safer sex.

550
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:45,126
Identifying medically accurate information about STDs.

551
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:49,626
So those two pages, do those relate to one specific grade?

552
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:53,887
So the standards just signify through grades six to eight.

553
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:58,888
I will have to take a look at it and kind of separate it, which my thought process would be to

554
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:07,677
have anatomy and physiology and puberty in grade six, healthy relationship piece in grade seven, and that piece more at the grade eight.

555
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:11,098
That would make the most sense.

556
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,160
Okay.

557
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:23,983
And do you know if this is, if other districts are accepting this model and this curriculum in grade eight?

558
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:28,418
So yeah, these are national standards and that's what's recommended.

559
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:32,339
So the school districts that are doing it are using these standards.

560
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:45,802
I will also let you know the state standards are in the process of being released and there was a major upgrade in the sex education piece to follow more of the national standards for the state of Massachusetts.

561
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:52,744
So what other surrounding cities or towns use page eight and nine in the eighth grade curriculum?

562
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:55,874
I don't know if it's definitely in the eighth grade curriculum.

563
00:53:55,894 --> 00:53:57,575
I'd have to get that information from them.

564
00:53:57,615 --> 00:54:02,778
I know I taught at Newton Public Schools and they were following the national standards.

565
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,661
Are there any other questions?

566
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:21,869
I'd just like to make an amendment, just amend the paper or do a side paper just to make sure that if you

567
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:35,460
If you add page eight or nine to any other grade other than eight through 12, that the school committee be, that it be discussed with the school committee first.

568
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:36,540
Sure.

569
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:47,922
I'm not saying for or against it being discussed in sixth or seventh, but I just feel that I would like to have that discussion before anything like that is taught to a sixth or seventh grader.

570
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:51,003
Can I also ask just one question?

571
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:52,963
It's Melanie McLaughlin.

572
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:53,496
Yep.

573
00:54:53,576 --> 00:54:54,357
Member McLaughlin.

574
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:55,718
Thank you.

575
00:54:55,858 --> 00:55:05,504
I'm also just wondering how are, um, I know that parents have the opt out, um, option and how are they given the scope and scale of what will actually be taught?

576
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:10,367
Like, are they given the same information that were given, um, for the grades?

577
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:15,811
So I will be posting that to the physical education, health education website.

578
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:19,954
So all of our scope and sequence will be posted there and that will include all of that information.

579
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,948
And is it automatic to opt in unless you opt out?

580
00:55:24,228 --> 00:55:24,869
Is that how it works?

581
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:25,529
Yes.

582
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,290
Thank you.

583
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,411
I'd like to point out a clarification.

584
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:31,673
Member Russo?

585
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:34,955
On page eight, it has gender identity.

586
00:55:34,975 --> 00:55:40,198
We explicitly talked about that in our subcommittee meeting, and that is not appropriate to wait till eighth grade.

587
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:43,380
It's really appropriate in third and fourth grade, to be honest.

588
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,582
So I would not be okay with that amendment.

589
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:50,443
Yes, I agree.

590
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:56,507
That specific one, we can exclude from the amendment.

591
00:55:56,748 --> 00:56:12,959
It's just the ones that I read out loud, I just feel like I think I would need more discussion or actually read the curriculum, the 600 page document before I want my sixth grader to learn about STDs and how to put a condom on.

592
00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:16,862
I think that deserves much more discussion and a committee of the whole meeting

593
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:21,050
versus all the hard work that you did in your subcommittee meeting.

594
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:38,877
I was also, how will parents be led to the website when this is brought up initially as far as how will they know they have the opportunity to research it, review, and then opt in or out?

595
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:41,358
And will it be provided in other languages as well?

596
00:56:42,822 --> 00:56:45,123
We can add that to the opt out.

597
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,544
We generally, at the high school, we put that in the handbook.

598
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:53,485
So I can work with the middle school principals to make sure that's added to the middle school handbook.

599
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:56,807
And then we can direct them to the website from there.

600
00:56:57,147 --> 00:57:00,608
And I can also have my contact information if there's any specific questions.

601
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:03,089
Thank you.

602
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:09,891
Yeah, I'd like to, as part of the B paper, make sure that that information's in the handbook and that we do provide it.

603
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,121
different languages like we do for all other communications.

604
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:15,662
Absolutely.

605
00:57:19,043 --> 00:57:28,347
Any other further questions or motion by member Van de Kloet to approve seconded by member Graham as amended?

606
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:30,788
All those in favor?

607
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,530
All those opposed?

608
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:35,530
Paper passes.

609
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:37,031
Thank you.

610
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:38,932
Thank you.

611
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:49,893
Number six, recommendation to negotiate prorated yellow school bus transportation service contract with Eastern Bus Company during school closure.

612
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:50,794
Ms.

613
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:51,674
Christine Patterson.

614
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:56,757
Thank you.

615
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:08,483
So in your packet, I just provided a brief synopsis on the rationale for the reasoning to go into negotiations with our yellow bus company.

616
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:18,783
The main factors are we are getting a lot of concerns from the bus companies themselves.

617
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,483
They are having difficulties.

618
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:31,006
There is a stimulus package that's from the federal government that is going to be providing what they call a transportation stabilization fund.

619
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:37,988
The only way to access those funds is to continue a payment of some form.

620
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:43,816
for the vendors and or contractors that are continuing service.

621
00:58:44,677 --> 00:58:53,761
Now, again, we have not gotten complete authority to pay without services conducted.

622
00:58:54,322 --> 00:59:02,686
However, we are being given guidance from the Department of Ed now in terms of negotiating a pro rata amount.

623
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:06,948
So identifying a per diem rate

624
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:23,640
would be a percentage of the bus bid, the regular runs, not the additional athletic runs, not the overtime runs or field trip runs, just the basic daily runs for the transportation.

625
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,584
And there are the groups in the Commonwealth that have

626
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:48,643
the same bus contractor, we are all being advised to work collectively or a pseudo agreement, a side agreement, in order to facilitate the continuation of bus transportation when schools resume.

627
00:59:49,204 --> 00:59:58,711
And the concern is that these drivers, if they are not maintained in a payroll status, that they will be looking at

628
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:12,569
going to alternate employers, such as an Amazon, where they can drive with their CDL license and not have any interruption of payroll during the course of a year.

629
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:16,410
We want to maintain those drivers.

630
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,290
There was a shortage of drivers prior to this closure.

631
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:26,372
And additionally, we are in the process of the main bus bid being

632
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:30,999
out there for the public to bid on the service.

633
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:50,258
And I'm trying to avoid a very bloated contract for the next three to five years with the concern of having to pad their number in an effort to cover any such closure and or the loss of their employees.

634
01:00:50,836 --> 01:00:55,439
So we have 21 bus drivers that are associated with the Medford runs.

635
01:00:55,579 --> 01:01:00,501
We have 18 regular runs, but 21 drivers that are on schedule.

636
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:06,705
So that's what we would be negotiating with Eastern bus.

637
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:12,388
The current rate that they are discussing with the other schools

638
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:21,456
Um, is in the range of 70 to 75% of a daily contract amount for the regular runs.

639
01:01:22,337 --> 01:01:25,298
So that is what we would be looking at.

640
01:01:25,478 --> 01:01:28,840
And I would bring a calculation back to the committee.

641
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:41,088
No decision would be made, but I think it's important that it is reviewed and the implications are understood by everyone that if we do not maintain some.

642
01:01:42,054 --> 01:01:46,856
goodwill in this group that we will be at a loss of bus drivers going forward.

643
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,018
Member van de Kloot.

644
01:01:51,258 --> 01:01:58,502
Kirsteen, I just wanted to make sure, is the bus company presently and continuing to pay their employees?

645
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:00,303
They are.

646
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:01,461
Okay.

647
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:12,110
And at the same time, the bus company, like all of those athletic trips that we would be taking now, we are not paying for, is that correct?

648
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:12,971
Correct.

649
01:02:13,391 --> 01:02:13,671
Okay.

650
01:02:14,492 --> 01:02:18,355
I would like to make a motion that we authorize you, Ms.

651
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:27,803
Patterson, to negotiate on our behalf as long as the bus company is committed to paying their employees.

652
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,481
Any other questions?

653
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:35,482
Member Graham.

654
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:42,808
Kirsten, can you just give us an update on the timeline of the larger negotiation that you're referring to?

655
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,213
So this has been happening since the closure.

656
01:02:48,789 --> 01:03:03,602
So working with the other school business officials in the Department of Education, we have been doing Zoom conferences, meetings, we've been getting guidance from the federal government as they've provided them.

657
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,945
And so these have been ongoing discussions.

658
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:10,087
So just today, we had another session.

659
01:03:10,648 --> 01:03:14,171
At noontime, I have a sample contract that we can

660
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:18,595
Um, look at, and once I communicate with the.

661
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:28,522
Um, owner of Eastern bus, I can bring back what, um, a potential cost would be for that, uh, extension or a side agreement.

662
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:31,824
It would no longer be payment on the regular bus contract.

663
01:03:31,884 --> 01:03:39,909
It would be a memo of understanding a separate contract just for the purpose of this emergency situation.

664
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:46,211
Oh, I'm sorry, I was talking about our upcoming contract that's out to bid.

665
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:59,798
So the upcoming contract is has been posted accordingly with the procurement office at City Hall that is scheduled for bid opening April 15.

666
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:13,360
And I think we talked about sharing a copy with the committee in one of our initial budget meetings.

667
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:18,883
If you could send a copy of the bid or give us a link or something, that would be great.

668
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:19,944
Absolutely.

669
01:04:20,744 --> 01:04:21,104
Thank you.

670
01:04:23,245 --> 01:04:23,625
Thank you.

671
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:30,969
A motion by member Van de Kloet, seconded by Mr. Member Rousseau to allow Ms.

672
01:04:31,009 --> 01:04:33,770
Patterson to negotiate accordingly.

673
01:04:36,323 --> 01:04:43,406
Do you want to still take a vote on that in two weeks before it's approved, or is this just given full allowance?

674
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:45,367
Member van de Kloot, that was your motion.

675
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,888
I defer to Ms.

676
01:04:47,908 --> 01:04:51,269
Patterson to find out which way would she bring it back to us?

677
01:04:52,610 --> 01:05:03,955
Yes, so I can provide you an update now that you're providing the authorization for me to communicate, and I will give you an update as to what

678
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:14,254
the Department of Ed, and the further guidance has been described, and also share a sample side agreement document with you.

679
01:05:14,274 --> 01:05:14,314
OK.

680
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:16,255
Oh, great.

681
01:05:16,335 --> 01:05:21,016
OK, so motion by member Van de Kloet, seconded by member Rousseau to allow Ms.

682
01:05:21,056 --> 01:05:27,458
Patterson to enter discussions and negotiations to then give us an update in two weeks for approval.

683
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:29,079
All those in favor?

684
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:29,799
Aye.

685
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:30,039
Aye.

686
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:31,179
All those opposed?

687
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:32,700
Paper passes.

688
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:33,400
Thank you, Ms.

689
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:33,700
Patterson.

690
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:35,582
I'm sorry.

691
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:42,725
Um, number eight old business number one school safety procedural update, which was tabled on 39 2020.

692
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:46,766
America learn longer current.

693
01:05:47,086 --> 01:05:55,410
Yes So that was something I had on and I am gonna make a motion that that be moved to the rules and policy subcommittee.

694
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:56,850
Motion by

695
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,546
Member Kretz, all those in favor?

696
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:05,626
Aye.

697
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:06,207
Aye.

698
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:07,907
All those opposed?

699
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:17,810
Could I just ask that, because this is now so long ago, even though I'm sure I knew what it was then, if you could just send me an email, Mr. McLaughlin.

700
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:18,530
Member McLaughlin, yep.

701
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:19,350
Thank you.

702
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,150
You're welcome.

703
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,571
Number two, so motion approved.

704
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:28,132
Number two, status of outstanding reports tabled on 3-9-2020.

705
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:31,333
This was also me, Mayor Longo Kern.

706
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:32,575
Yes.

707
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:44,021
And so, again, I would also request, especially with the proposed reports, that this be moved to the policy and rules subcommittee, of which I'm also a member.

708
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:58,467
But the idea would be that we would review what the requests were and see if there's any that we need to, you know, that if we can't find the institutional knowledge around, that we need to come back to the committee and ask.

709
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:03,363
I have a motion to move to the rules and policy subcommittee.

710
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:04,143
Second.

711
01:07:05,103 --> 01:07:08,224
Motion by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Russo.

712
01:07:08,744 --> 01:07:11,465
I'm sure you will communicate about that one, too, through e-mail.

713
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:13,226
I have a comment.

714
01:07:13,706 --> 01:07:15,126
Yes, member Vanden Heuvel.

715
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:26,269
the number of potential subcommittees we might be having.

716
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:32,451
I think at this time, while we're under crisis, that we need to not have them.

717
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:36,912
And I don't know how many requests people have put in to have them, but I am concerned.

718
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:45,654
I think we do need to limit the amount we're asking of our administrators until we get back to normal.

719
01:07:51,778 --> 01:08:08,443
In general, I agree, but I think that for at least certainly the outstanding reports, well, what I'm trying to say is that I have talked to the superintendent about when a subcommittee doesn't really actually need any administrative

720
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:13,514
people there that we should – that they should get comfortable with that.

721
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:20,318
If we're going to go through the existing outstanding reports, for instance, I mean, the school committee voted to have these reports.

722
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:27,022
We can look at them again and decide whether we really want them or not without anybody from central office.

723
01:08:27,142 --> 01:08:37,968
I mean, that might not be the best example, but I think having our meetings anyways and then trying to be a little more cautious and careful about how much time

724
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:44,392
they're going to have to put in is a better option than just not doing them, in my opinion.

725
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,236
Member McLaughlin.

726
01:08:48,607 --> 01:09:00,611
Yes, and I would just add that, you know, I appreciated the superintendent reaching out to us in the last meeting asking this subcommittee folks to get in touch with her to schedule the meetings.

727
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:02,671
We're really trying to limit the meeting times.

728
01:09:03,632 --> 01:09:12,334
I know for our subcommittee for special education was actually joined with another entire huge topic, which is behavioral health.

729
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,555
We haven't even had the opportunity to meet yet.

730
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:18,296
We do need to at least bring those people to the tables to identify

731
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:20,735
goals and strategy for next year.

732
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:26,777
So again, but we're trying very much to limit those meetings in the one that I scheduled to one hour.

733
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:37,161
And I wouldn't expect that would have an additional one necessarily by the end of the year, unless something substantial changes.

734
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:46,225
But in any case, I would say that we still need to have the subcommittee meetings, especially since we didn't get to have one before all of this stuff happened.

735
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:48,835
Yes.

736
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:55,460
So I think my concern is the number of subcommittee meetings, and I have no idea how many requests there were.

737
01:09:57,081 --> 01:10:13,032
And so maybe I can just ask if the superintendent keep us abreast at how many are being asked for, because I just want to keep it real and appropriate for this particular time.

738
01:10:13,732 --> 01:10:24,956
Obviously, you guys know I love going to subcommittee meetings, but it depends on, this is an unusual time and I think people are already taxed, so I want to make sure we're being smart about it.

739
01:10:26,175 --> 01:10:26,976
Yes, I will.

740
01:10:27,496 --> 01:10:28,697
Thank you, Member Van Der Kool.

741
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:37,024
And I do have a special education subcommittee meeting that will be scheduled for the 14th, I believe, next Tuesday.

742
01:10:37,804 --> 01:10:47,312
And I will continue to monitor the subcommittee activity, and I will communicate that more widely to the entire body.

743
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:51,596
But I am also trying to be cognizant of that as well.

744
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:56,478
So thank you for putting that out there, and we will make it work.

745
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:58,158
Thank you.

746
01:10:58,679 --> 01:10:59,099
Thank you.

747
01:10:59,519 --> 01:11:05,661
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

748
01:11:06,122 --> 01:11:10,683
All those in favor of those proposed papers move to rules and policy subcommittee.

749
01:11:12,304 --> 01:11:14,885
The function of the Medford School Committee 2020 to 2022 document update

750
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:22,350
offered by Mr. Rousseau, tabled on 3-9-2020.

751
01:11:23,111 --> 01:11:29,715
May I suggest that really the point of having this at the meeting is so we could all physically sign it, which isn't really an option right now.

752
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:32,217
So perhaps we should leave it tabled.

753
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:34,899
I think that we've already discussed the content.

754
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,322
So that's just my thought.

755
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:43,485
Motion to table, undebatable, seconded by?

756
01:11:43,885 --> 01:11:44,206
Second.

757
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:45,507
Member McLaughlin.

758
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:47,428
All those in favor?

759
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:48,559
Aye.

760
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:49,640
Opposed?

761
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,081
Paper is tabled.

762
01:11:51,962 --> 01:12:06,432
Number four, be it resolved that a playground advisory committee shall be created to oversee the completion of work associated with three CPC grants related to the Columbus and Brooks Playground Repair and Resurfacing and the McGlynn School Design Study.

763
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:13,717
The work will include collaboration and review of the RFP for the McGlynn Design Study and the execution of the study.

764
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:28,087
The advisory committee will also view all four school playgrounds and make recommendations regarding increased accessibility of playgrounds to all our students to be completed within the existing scope of funding or provided to the school committee as additional recommendations.

765
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:40,133
The advisory committee shall provide a preliminary update to the school committee no later than June 1st and then quarterly thereafter for up to one year from the date of creation or sooner if work is completed.

766
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:54,539
Dr. Cushing will issue a call for interested applicants and recommend members for the playground advisory committee to the school committee no later than, we can change these dates, April 6th, school committee meeting.

767
01:12:54,579 --> 01:13:05,067
The playground advisory committee will include school administrators, at least one parent from each elementary school and individuals with expertise in inclusive play and play spaces offered by member Graham.

768
01:13:06,368 --> 01:13:09,230
So mayor, this was approved in our,

769
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:13,160
meeting whenever that was.

770
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:20,785
But we do need to change the date to give Peter some runway to get this off the ground.

771
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:28,450
Peter, I was thinking May 4th, but you tell me if that's okay, thumbs up.

772
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:39,457
So I'd make a motion to amend this approved motion to change the timeline to our May 4th school meeting.

773
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,721
school committee meeting.

774
01:13:41,882 --> 01:13:42,863
It was till May 4th.

775
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:43,104
Yep.

776
01:13:44,746 --> 01:13:47,389
Motion to table by member Graham seconded by member.

777
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:49,351
Would you like to speak member McLaughlin?

778
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:54,497
Yes, I actually had a motion to withdraw your motion to table member Graham.

779
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:56,219
I wasn't tabling it.

780
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,362
Oh, I was just amending it.

781
01:13:59,042 --> 01:13:59,483
Amending it.

782
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:00,344
Okay.

783
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:01,760
Yes.

784
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,821
Thank you.

785
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:28,241
So I also just wanted to ask, and I'm not sure if this is amendment or what, but asking that the call for members is inclusive and that we are respectful of diversity as we're approaching that call for the advisory, because I'm sure that we are, Dr. Cushing, but I just like to put it out there to make sure that we are soliciting

786
01:14:28,646 --> 01:14:38,469
I would defer to folks from all members of our community for those respective positions, and we can talk more about what that looks like.

787
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:48,493
I would defer to folks in the mayor's office as well about how we're actually reaching the constituents for that.

788
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,733
Mr. Cushing, we'll work with you.

789
01:14:53,753 --> 01:15:02,498
The mayor's office has been in touch with the NAACP and they're helping us a great deal to get diverse members of a number of committees.

790
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:09,261
So I will definitely have Neil Osborne, our human diversity director work alongside Mr. Cushing.

791
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:10,662
Thank you.

792
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:18,927
So motion as amended by member Graham, all those in favor?

793
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:19,007
Aye.

794
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:21,048
All those opposed?

795
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,452
Motion has passed as amended.

796
01:15:25,753 --> 01:15:27,494
Communications, new business.

797
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:37,481
Given the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting state of emergency, I move that we defer the Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee until the fall of 2020.

798
01:15:38,882 --> 01:15:42,985
Further recruitment of membership in the advisory committee begin anew at that time.

799
01:15:43,486 --> 01:15:50,571
Further that this vision committee shall follow the format of the advisory committee as laid out in the Medford School Committee policy

800
01:15:51,155 --> 01:15:54,064
BDF advisory committees to the school committee.

801
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:57,774
I believe that was.

802
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:02,308
I offered that with member Graham and member Stone.

803
01:16:03,048 --> 01:16:17,497
So I just, I talked to the superintendent and I was just thinking that this didn't feel like the right time for us to all be getting together and traveling to the school and inspecting it.

804
01:16:17,597 --> 01:16:21,520
It just felt like that this particular committee really needed to be in the building.

805
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:27,744
And so I had suggested that maybe we move it to the spring

806
01:16:28,164 --> 01:16:29,965
Superintendent felt we should start it in the fall.

807
01:16:30,265 --> 01:16:32,306
And so that's why I put this out there.

808
01:16:33,247 --> 01:16:38,290
So we could just kind of reset in the fall after we've had a chance to get through this.

809
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:44,133
I think the fall is fine for the committee.

810
01:16:44,153 --> 01:16:54,158
I would just ask, I did spend a lot of time trying to get the group together and I did email 15 participants that are excited to be on this committee.

811
01:16:54,956 --> 01:17:01,340
The NAACP and Neil Osborne, again, are working to find one to two additional members for this committee.

812
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,964
So just ask them to continue their work, and they have the spring and summer to do that.

813
01:17:07,744 --> 01:17:11,967
Mr. Osborne did write something up today letting us know.

814
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:24,015
He has reached out to the NAACP branch to explore finding a representative with the time, energy, and interest in joining the High School Vision Committee

815
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:31,293
We had planned a meeting with the leadership of the branch, but the current circumstances required rescheduling that.

816
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:39,996
As always, found the branch a supportive partner with the city to find local persons who want to serve on our boards, commissions, and committees.

817
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:46,659
I'm confident before the end of the summer, we can identify a branch member that we can add to the Medford High School Vision Committee.

818
01:17:46,759 --> 01:17:50,140
So positive news, and I thank Mr. Osborne for helping out.

819
01:17:50,901 --> 01:17:52,941
And I will, as long as-

820
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:55,010
Yes.

821
01:17:55,891 --> 01:18:13,122
I just would add that, you know, in the fall, you know, the people that we have already identified, we may need to reopen it a little bit because some of those people might not be available, life circumstances for some of, who knows how many of us could have changed dramatically by the fall.

822
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:20,927
So I just think, you know, we may need to do more recruitment in the fall in addition to trying to find a more representative group of people.

823
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:23,956
That's understandable.

824
01:18:23,976 --> 01:18:24,737
I agree with that.

825
01:18:24,817 --> 01:18:29,123
We may, but I just want to make sure we, I didn't know what you meant by begin anew.

826
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:44,479
I mostly was interested in the policy that indicates that the slate of people that we choose for the advisory committee has to come to the school committee for approval.

827
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:52,941
The policy has a set of steps that we're supposed to follow that honestly, until January, I didn't even know existed.

828
01:18:54,442 --> 01:18:55,442
And I just thought,

829
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:02,355
There's nothing wrong with the people we've already recruited, but we should be including them in section six of the policy.

830
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:14,045
We're supposed to tell them how long they have to be on this advisory committee, what is the language that the school committee is saying is their charge.

831
01:19:15,427 --> 01:19:23,674
I know we actually had talked about in our last regular meeting about having a committee of the whole to sit down and talk about what is their charge.

832
01:19:24,366 --> 01:19:28,928
Of course, all of that is out the window because we aren't having that meeting.

833
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:40,654
So that beginning of just meeting will make sure all the I's are dotted and the T's are crossed and that we have officially approved charge of this vision committee.

834
01:19:41,613 --> 01:19:51,937
because I feel like I've heard and seen, like I've seen a city council meeting where it was described and I've described it myself numerous times in email and in school committee meetings.

835
01:19:52,577 --> 01:19:59,239
And I feel like every time somebody describes it, we all put our own little spin on what it is we think that this committee is going to do.

836
01:19:59,259 --> 01:20:05,802
And I think that the explicit language of what they're supposed to do should be approved by the school committee.

837
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:08,023
And then that's the, you know,

838
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:11,505
I think that is the end of the conversation about what it is we have asked them to do.

839
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:24,525
I think all of this certainly speaks to starting at the beginning of the process instead of at the end.

840
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:37,434
I think if we sit down and we talk about a clear set of goals, we can mitigate against differing opinions about what the committee is supposed to do or wants to do or thinks they should do or thinks they can't do.

841
01:20:38,715 --> 01:20:41,858
We also would have an opportunity then to outline and lay out

842
01:20:42,558 --> 01:20:54,124
what the real expectations are for the kind of work that we're doing, how much time we think it's going to take, as well as what's the right number of people on the committee to do that work.

843
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:59,747
So because we never outline what the work is, we have no idea if we have the right number of people to do the work.

844
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:05,089
I think there's a lot of different schools of thoughts that we need to entertain as we put that together.

845
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:14,952
So if we start there with the beginning of the process, we can have a clear picture of the number and types of folks that we want to represent our city.

846
01:21:15,752 --> 01:21:24,335
Then we can put out a call that is clear and unambiguous, solicit people, bring them back and allow this committee to

847
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:33,786
help put that committee together so that it can be positioned to move forward as quickly as possible, given our already delay.

848
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:37,929
Thank you.

849
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:51,120
I would just like to amend the motion to allow the 15 that were notified and asked and were responsive and accepted the, um,

850
01:21:51,963 --> 01:22:06,356
the offer that we make sure those 15, whether we have a committee of 17, 19 or 21, I just want to make sure those 15 that are very excited to serve in this committee that have already been given the offer are extended that offer in the fall.

851
01:22:06,476 --> 01:22:09,799
So I'd just like to make that as an amendment.

852
01:22:09,979 --> 01:22:10,380
Thank you.

853
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:18,247
Okay, motion for approval as amended by member, as amended by myself, but motion for approval.

854
01:22:20,077 --> 01:22:20,657
Motion to approve.

855
01:22:21,558 --> 01:22:24,660
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Russo.

856
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,501
All those in favor?

857
01:22:25,521 --> 01:22:26,261
Aye.

858
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:27,502
All those opposed?

859
01:22:28,483 --> 01:22:31,025
The motion is approved as amended.

860
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:38,530
We have four resolutions that I will read out and then we will take a moment of silence.

861
01:22:40,612 --> 01:22:48,137
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Roy Stephen McDonald,

862
01:22:48,595 --> 01:22:53,037
brother-in-law of Medford Public Schools District Data Manager, Kim Miles.

863
01:22:54,918 --> 01:23:04,482
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express sincere condolences to the family of Paula Farnham, mother of Medford High School teacher, Holly Farnham Cassabon.

864
01:23:05,882 --> 01:23:17,747
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Lawrence Lepore, uncle to Medford High School world language teacher, Nalita Lepore.

865
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:23,837
be it resolved that the Memphis School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Burke.

866
01:23:24,317 --> 01:23:29,321
Mary Burke was a second grade teacher for over 40 years at the old Forest Park School.

867
01:23:29,901 --> 01:23:32,123
If we all may take a moment of silence.

868
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:42,911
Thank you.

869
01:23:43,831 --> 01:23:48,615
And while we're on a moment of silence, if we could maybe take one more moment of just

870
01:23:49,659 --> 01:24:12,874
dedicate this meeting to all those who are fighting the virus and who, whether it be in Medford, our region, or the country and the world, if we can just take a moment of just to really pray for everybody's health and safety at this time.

871
01:24:14,535 --> 01:24:17,137
Including our grocery store workers.

872
01:24:17,879 --> 01:24:23,564
and our healthcare workers and our emergency people, all of those people who need our support.

873
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,266
Yes, thank you, Paulette.

874
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:27,267
Appreciate that.

875
01:24:32,052 --> 01:24:37,156
And we have number 11, negotiations and legal matters.

876
01:24:37,456 --> 01:24:43,502
We are going to the school committee as well as our superintendent and

877
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:51,099
Our school attorney, Mr. Howard Greenspan, will be entering executive session.

878
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:53,501
A motion to go to executive session?

879
01:24:53,901 --> 01:25:02,405
Yes, to discuss collective bargaining, unit A, unit B, unit C, secretaries, local 25, SEIU, non-union contracts.

880
01:25:03,546 --> 01:25:05,147
Motion to go into executive session.

881
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,648
Should I call the roll?

882
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,329
Member Van de Kloet, you may call the roll.

883
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:09,790
Yes, please.

884
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:10,770
Member Graham?

885
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,330
Yes.

886
01:25:11,931 --> 01:25:12,511
Member Kritz?

887
01:25:13,852 --> 01:25:14,172
Kathy?

888
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:16,125
Yes.

889
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:16,746
Yes.

890
01:25:17,406 --> 01:25:18,286
Member McLaughlin?

891
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:19,207
Yes.

892
01:25:19,807 --> 01:25:20,768
Member McStone?

893
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:21,788
Yes.

894
01:25:22,669 --> 01:25:23,429
Member Rousseau?

895
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:24,070
Yes.

896
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,791
Member Vander Kloot?

897
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:26,091
Yes.

898
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:27,752
Mayor Lungo Kern?

899
01:25:28,072 --> 01:25:28,432
Thank you.

900
01:25:28,472 --> 01:25:28,752
Yes.

901
01:25:29,032 --> 01:25:29,973
All those in favor?

902
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:30,913
All those opposed?

903
01:25:30,953 --> 01:25:32,554
We are going to head to executive session.

904
01:25:32,614 --> 01:25:37,177
We will then reconvene into this meeting to report out and adjourn.

905
01:25:45,134 --> 01:25:46,335
back from the breakout room.

906
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:47,435
Sorry it took so long.

907
01:25:49,396 --> 01:25:52,837
Madam Secretary, would you like to report out the motion?

908
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:56,239
Sure.

909
01:25:57,019 --> 01:26:03,902
So the school committee made a motion that everybody, all of our employees would be paid until May 4th.

910
01:26:05,863 --> 01:26:09,285
And at that time we will revisit this decision.

911
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:10,585
Yes.

912
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:11,826
Okay.

913
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:16,214
Motion for approval of the executive committee report.

914
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:19,975
I think we have to vote it again in public.

915
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:21,675
Member Graham.

916
01:26:26,616 --> 01:26:33,238
On that motion, by the way, it was made by Paul Rousseau and seconded by?

917
01:26:36,414 --> 01:26:36,975
Member Graham.

918
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:39,659
Okay, so Member Graham?

919
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:40,680
Yes.

920
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:41,482
Kretz?

921
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:42,904
Abstain.

922
01:26:42,924 --> 01:26:43,965
McLaughlin?

923
01:26:44,005 --> 01:26:44,065
Yes.

924
01:26:53,217 --> 01:26:55,920
I think I just have Russo anything.

925
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,502
Got it.

926
01:26:57,542 --> 01:26:57,762
Got it.

927
01:26:57,802 --> 01:26:58,022
Mia.

928
01:26:58,042 --> 01:26:58,423
Thank you.

929
01:26:58,943 --> 01:26:59,544
Vander Kloot.

930
01:26:59,604 --> 01:26:59,924
Yes.

931
01:27:00,906 --> 01:27:01,606
Longo Kern.

932
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,168
Yes.

933
01:27:03,188 --> 01:27:12,660
716 affirmative one abstains all base all base hourly salary paid weekly or bi weekly will be paid through May 4.

934
01:27:14,674 --> 01:27:17,517
Motion to adjourn the regular meeting.

935
01:27:18,418 --> 01:27:19,419
Yes motion.

936
01:27:19,459 --> 01:27:24,564
Yes by member Rousseau seconded by member Kratz all those in favor.

937
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:25,325
Aye.

938
01:27:25,405 --> 01:27:26,346
Aye.

939
01:27:26,647 --> 01:27:27,187
Have a good night.

940
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,189
Everybody stay healthy.

941
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:29,970
Bye guys.
