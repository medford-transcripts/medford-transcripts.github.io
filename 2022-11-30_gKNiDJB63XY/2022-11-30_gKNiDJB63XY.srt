1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:02,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:07,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're just giving it one more minute.

3
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:17,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

4
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so it's 6.03 right now.

5
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:55,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're just about ready to start with this.

6
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So good evening, everybody.

7
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:03,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

8
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:08,680
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that this time of the year is really busy, and there are lots of competing things to do.

9
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really appreciate you putting in the time.

10
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: going through this information with us.

11
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've tried to do in this presentation is to be brief, but at the same time, be informative.

12
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:30,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the presentation, there certainly will be time for questions and answers.

13
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Bernadette Riccadeli.

14
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment.

15
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:36,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And with me,

16
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction.

17
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.

18
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.

19
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:54,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited to provide some further information on our district NWEA map growth assessment tool.

20
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So NWEA map.

21
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people probably, many in the district, many of us just, you know, we use the term NWEA MAP.

22
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we just want to let you know what that means.

23
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: NWEA stands for the Northwest Evaluation Association.

24
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:20,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the group back 40 plus years ago that developed this assessment.

25
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:25,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were several districts up in the Pacific Northwest that saw the need for an assessment.

26
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:31,789
[SPEAKER_02]: for students that was norm-based, meaning it was measured across large groups of students.

27
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:41,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And they developed this and over 40 years, it's kind of changed and morphed its way into this very popular test called MAP, the MAP growth.

28
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:44,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And MAP stands for measures of academic progress.

29
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a widely used test that we're gonna go through tonight.

30
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:53,484
[SPEAKER_02]: So on tonight's agenda,

31
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,885
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through what MAP growth is, which I've just given you a very brief overview of.

32
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:02,927
[SPEAKER_02]: How do schools and teachers use MAP growth scores?

33
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are they useful to us?

34
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do we do with that data?

35
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:15,332
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a look at the timeline as far as when students in each of the three different grade levels are tested.

36
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, it's three times a year, but there is some variation between the elementary, the middle, and the high school level.

37
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:28,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go over the importance of having a growth mindset when looking at these tests.

38
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:38,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, in our instruction, in our teaching and learning in the Metro Public Schools, we're going to go over a sample family report.

39
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:50,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the report that you're going to receive in the next week or so, or maybe a little bit, maybe in the next 10 days when you meet with your child's teacher, if you're on the elementary level.

40
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:57,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, how do these tests lead us into you to support your child?

41
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:03,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the framework for tonight's presentation.

42
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:18,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So the MAP-Grove test, so that measure of academic progress test, is a computer adapted test that's created by the NWEA, the Northwest Evaluation Association.

43
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:22,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And most students take it three times per year.

44
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:34,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results of this test provide teachers with information that help them deliver appropriate content for each student and determine each student's academic growth over time.

45
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really look at it as a way to really hone in and where the student's strengths are, where the student could be stronger, and really target in once we take a look at that data.

46
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at it really as a

47
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:56,548
[SPEAKER_02]: a way to go in, to be surgical, to be very specific, to target those areas that are in need of some remediation.

48
00:04:56,568 --> 00:05:01,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Going on to the next slide.

49
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit more of what is MAP growth continued.

50
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does MAP measure?

51
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:13,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So it measures growth of what students know, regardless of their grade level.

52
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:18,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It also measures their growth over time because they're taking it three times a year.

53
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking it year over year.

54
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:27,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to track a student's progress throughout their school year and across multiple years.

55
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:35,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to go in and we're able to look to see what student A has done in the third grade the fourth grade the fifth grade.

56
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:42,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they has their trajectory been in a positive upward direction or do we see dips.

57
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we do, what is the reason for that?

58
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,828
[SPEAKER_02]: In that second column, what does it mean to be computer adaptive?

59
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of us have taken computer adaptive tests.

60
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us don't know we've taken computer adaptive tests.

61
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that means is that a student answers a question.

62
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:10,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on the answer that the student provides, if that answer is correct, the next question is more difficult.

63
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:19,068
[SPEAKER_02]: If the answer is incorrect, it adjusts down to a question that's of lesser difficulty.

64
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's meant by an adaptive test.

65
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not obvious to the student.

66
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,310
[SPEAKER_02]: The student has no idea this is happening.

67
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice.

68
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's discreet.

69
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's based on a growth mindset.

70
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We want the student to feel really positive about what they're doing.

71
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, they just keep going.

72
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also meant

73
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:43,328
[SPEAKER_02]: to meet them just above where they are at.

74
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:52,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So that comes, that zone of proximal development where it's, yes, hard enough, but not too difficult to make them frustrated.

75
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:53,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's key.

76
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:58,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that sweet spot in instruction that teachers are always so interested in honing in on.

77
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:04,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in your third column, what is a RIT score?

78
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So RIT is the way that the scores are measured.

79
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:18,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So, after each MAP growth test, results are delivered in the form of a RIT score that reflects the student's academic knowledge, their skills, and their ability.

80
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:23,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these scores are like, they're equal interval scores.

81
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:28,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're like marking height on a growth chart where you have inches that are equal intervals.

82
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:31,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the RIT scores are equal interval scores.

83
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,519
[SPEAKER_02]: They are norm referenced.

84
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can get the output and look to see where does this student fall in terms of a percentile.

85
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:50,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That last bullet there, you can tell how tall your child is at various points in time and how much they have grown between one stage and another.

86
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:56,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we can see when we look at a student scores over time.

87
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:59,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And RIT stands for the Roche

88
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:01,574
[SPEAKER_02]: the Roche unit.

89
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:07,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So the R is the Roche and the IT comes from the IT unit, so the Roche unit score.

90
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So I referenced that this test is taken for the most part three times a year.

91
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:21,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the fall, in the winter, and then in the spring.

92
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some variations.

93
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, in science,

94
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:29,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not taken three times a year across all grade levels.

95
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,583
[SPEAKER_02]: On the elementary level, it is taken twice a year.

96
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:38,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We have those, you'll see dates, which are date spans.

97
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:44,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we tell teachers to do is we want these tests administered during those time spans.

98
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:50,928
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand that not everyone can give it on, for example, January 9th, 2023.

99
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So we give them that week to do it.

100
00:08:54,671 --> 00:09:07,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important that those tests take place within that specific timeframe so that the measurement, we're measuring equally across the district with regard to the time that it's taken.

101
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:11,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

102
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:13,341
[SPEAKER_02]: The next slide.

103
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:17,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned the importance of having a growth mindset.

104
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times when people look at tests, they let that test be,

105
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:30,826
[SPEAKER_02]: define their ability, define where they are, what they can do.

106
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:34,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That's often referred to as a fixed mindset.

107
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:43,790
[SPEAKER_02]: This test and the output of this test is meant to serve in a growth mindset.

108
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:49,132
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we're looking at this test as a means for students to grow.

109
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:54,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the be all end all itself, but rather it's a way that we can

110
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:05,153
[SPEAKER_02]: propel the student forward specifically in looking at their their strengths and their their weaknesses.

111
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very positive way of looking at student learning and student growth.

112
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:17,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only is this the philosophy behind MAP growth but is the philosophy behind teaching and learning in the Medford Public Schools.

113
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:21,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We all believe that students can move forward that they can grow.

114
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:23,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So wherever they are.

115
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,052
[SPEAKER_02]: the belief is that they can move forward.

116
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,733
[SPEAKER_02]: These tests help us get there.

117
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:42,917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so there are various parent resources that are available for the MAP growth tests.

118
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:49,619
[SPEAKER_02]: There are sample tests, and I want to take a look at a couple of the sample tests.

119
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,660
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really easy to access.

120
00:10:52,388 --> 00:11:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can click on that link right there, it's going to bring us to the practice test page.

121
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:07,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So this presentation is going to be available for people to see.

122
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:12,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be able to access it on your own if you want to take a sample test.

123
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on this page, they give us the username and the password of GROW.

124
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's GROW and GROW.

125
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:26,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can just click on that practice.map, yes, that link right there, that is great.

126
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:40,154
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put grow and grow in, you make it nice and simple for us, and then click there, it brings us to a page in which we can select a grade level.

127
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:48,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try grade three, math, and then, yep, math K-12.

128
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it gives us the option of a language.

129
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go with English.

130
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:59,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And the test is the practice items math, the second one down.

131
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just click on the arrow.

132
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to give us a sample, a sample problem.

133
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a sample problem that a grade three student would see.

134
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:16,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is Manuel paid 34 cents for gum.

135
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave the clerk a dollar.

136
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,529
[SPEAKER_02]: which picture shows the correct change.

137
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously the answer needs to represent 66 cents.

138
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we would click on the letter, the circle, click on the circle that corresponds to the 66 cents, which is

139
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:52,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, Dr. Riccadeli, before I do that, I also wanna draw people's attention to the toolbar that students have access to so that up here, I'm gonna hover over it so you can see that this is a highlighter.

140
00:12:53,262 --> 00:13:02,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So if students feel that they wanna isolate some keywords or help them break down what the question's asking them, there's also an eraser part for the highlight.

141
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,047
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a line reader.

142
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially for math and science,

143
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:16,643
[SPEAKER_00]: If students click this, it will read the question to them because this is really assessing the math skills, not reading skills here.

144
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:27,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them a notepad so that if they want to do any calculations or need any place to take notes or do work, they could click on this and it would bring it up for them.

145
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:38,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a little cue here that if they'd like an answer eliminator, it would get rid of one of the choices for them to help them answer the question.

146
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:42,449
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you would like me to select, which one am I selecting?

147
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,791
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're going to do the 60B.

148
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:52,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be option B with 66 cents.

149
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:56,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, here it's not telling the student whether it's right or not.

150
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:01,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So that little arrow down at the bottom will bring them to the next question.

151
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So they click that and they bring them to the next question.

152
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:23,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So interestingly, it's an adaptive test, as I said, but in this sample, it does not appear to be adaptive because in looking at this question when I did it earlier, I clicked a different answer and it brought me to the same second question, which is interesting.

153
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:30,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the way that it works when the student takes it, again, if they answer it correctly, the next question is more difficult.

154
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,560
[SPEAKER_02]: If they answer it incorrectly, the next question is easier.

155
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:43,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to just give you a sample of what a question, and in this case, we picked grade three.

156
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,033
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to go through every grade.

157
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to do that.

158
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're the parent of a seventh grader and you want to go on and see what a seventh grade reading question looks like, you certainly can do that.

159
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can play with it.

160
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, the students can too.

161
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to give you just a very brief

162
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:12,166
[SPEAKER_02]: view of one of the practice tests that is available to parents and to students.

163
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:17,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not the greatest at this, and I'm trying to figure out why.

164
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:18,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one minute, please.

165
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:24,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I don't have this in present mode.

166
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone still see my tabs at the top?

167
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:29,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

168
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:32,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hold on, please.

169
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try this again.

170
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:40,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to really be able to see.

171
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,603
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, in the interest of time, I guess I'll keep going.

172
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:51,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that you have to look at my messy tabs.

173
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the next slide, Dr. Riccadeli?

174
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:55,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

175
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:56,809
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, yes.

176
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,132
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm going to take over from here a little bit to talk about the tests and the scores.

177
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:14,890
[SPEAKER_00]: As Dr. Riccadeli started this evening talking to you, the MAP growth family reports are sent home at the marking periods.

178
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,152
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have seen the assessment timeline.

179
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,893
[SPEAKER_00]: These are given three times a year.

180
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:26,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the elementary level, it pretty much corresponds with the report cards.

181
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:31,719
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quarters at the secondary level, but once the students take this, it's sent home.

182
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:40,681
[SPEAKER_00]: In school, teachers are using map growth to inform their teaching and personalize learning for students.

183
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:55,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to stress, I've said this several times, but I have to stress it at this call, that this is one data point that teachers are using to target and monitor their instruction with your children.

184
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:09,465
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using other forms of assessment, both informal and formal, but map growth is just one of those pieces that are used to give the complete picture for your student.

185
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:19,932
[SPEAKER_00]: And principals and administrators, curriculum directors, myself, Dr. Cadelli, we're using some of these scores to work with

186
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:43,209
[SPEAKER_00]: either building leadership, principals working with teachers, in department meetings, at grade level meetings, to talk about trends and data, to talk about student supports that are needed, that are currently in place, progress monitoring, map growth is a progress monitoring tool, so that because doing these assessments three times a year,

187
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:49,231
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to look at how students are progressing in each of those subject areas throughout the year.

188
00:17:49,651 --> 00:18:05,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives that progress data for principals and district administrators to have conversations with staff about the data, how students are doing and how we can target instruction moving forward.

189
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:10,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So can map growth tell me if my student is working at grade level?

190
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it can.

191
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:18,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's one data point, but we're going to show you this evening how the reports will give you that data.

192
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just urge the chain of command with any questions or concerns you have.

193
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:30,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start always with your child's teacher or teachers, and then

194
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:36,227
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel you need some more information, I would urge you to go to the building principal.

195
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:48,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's always, you know, Dr. Riccadeli and myself, but I would just urge first that chain of command, because a lot of your questions and concerns can be answered directly by the teacher.

196
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,528
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of covered some of this.

197
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:55,908
[SPEAKER_00]: How will I receive my child's MAP growth scores?

198
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know about that.

199
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:13,033
[SPEAKER_00]: We were strategic in picking this date because we know that this week it's conferences for high school, and we know that the week of December 12th, which is a little less than two weeks away, begins the report card conferences for elementary school.

200
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will post this

201
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:28,517
[SPEAKER_00]: recording on the district's website so that other families that were unable to come this evening can learn a little bit more information if they would like to and also have access to the embedded links.

202
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:35,907
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I use my students' MAP test results to improve my child's academic performance?

203
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:43,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great question that you can bring up at your child's conference or any conversation that you have with your child's teacher.

204
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:57,755
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk a little bit about the breakdown of how the scores are given to give you a rough estimate, but I would not either, you know, I really wouldn't sound the alarm depending on what the results are for your child's

205
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Scores, again, this is one data point.

206
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:06,638
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get a more complete picture from your child's teacher or teachers.

207
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:13,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, this is a sample of the family report.

208
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:19,862
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here on the left is the color-coded scale that coincides with the reports that come home.

209
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:27,265
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can kind of see the blue areas are children that are performing above the grade level norm.

210
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is students that are performing at the higher level of the grade level norm.

211
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,023
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the breakdown of numbers.

212
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,684
[SPEAKER_00]: So that green area means 61 to 80%.

213
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,306
[SPEAKER_00]: That's high.

214
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:49,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Average, which is like the sweet spot, that's students that are performing in the 41st to 60th percentile of the normed group.

215
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,385
[SPEAKER_00]: and then so on by the color coding.

216
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:54,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray means no score.

217
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,008
[SPEAKER_00]: That can happen for a couple reasons.

218
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,670
[SPEAKER_00]: A student may have been absent for medical reasons.

219
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,533
[SPEAKER_00]: A student may have transferred in.

220
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:14,784
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a gray score and you have a question about it, doesn't correlate for your family and child situation, just let the teacher know and we can troubleshoot that one.

221
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,445
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the report, it's going to give you some of the data that Dr. Riccadeli and I have covered this evening.

222
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically like, what is this report?

223
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:25,967
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the RIT score mean?

224
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is my child taking this?

225
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:35,350
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the purpose of this evening's presentation, but it's also helpful to just have that as a reference point.

226
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:44,673
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see for every subject test that your child takes, math reading for all students,

227
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:49,505
[SPEAKER_00]: but science starting in grade three, all the way up through high school.

228
00:21:50,386 --> 00:22:07,454
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see on the left by this plot graph here, that's tracking your student's achievement on the test in comparison to other students across the nation in their grade that are taking this test.

229
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:13,958
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, you're going to see your child's growth percentile.

230
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:19,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in that same group of grade level peers across the nation.

231
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:29,673
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to get a little narrative for each as well as the percentile so that you can see up top here, for example, for math.

232
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,354
[SPEAKER_00]: it was average achievement.

233
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:38,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here in the yellow and you can see that this child scored in the 47th percentile.

234
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:52,287
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see over time, if you have younger students that are still, you know, they've only taken this this year or maybe last year, you're not gonna have as much growth.

235
00:22:53,125 --> 00:23:00,937
[SPEAKER_00]: because as the children go up in the years, you're going to have more data to refer to in terms of their achievement and growth over time.

236
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,326
[SPEAKER_00]: This you can see started, this one just goes from like the fall.

237
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:08,867
[SPEAKER_00]: in one year.

238
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see their RIT score.

239
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:17,472
[SPEAKER_00]: These scores on the plot line are their RIT scores that Dr. Riccadeli spoke about.

240
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:28,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just telling you right here is the band of RIT scores for this grade level that the students should be performing in.

241
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,217
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 170 and 220.

242
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:38,439
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's giving you where your child has performed throughout the year.

243
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,139
[SPEAKER_00]: The solid line will be your child.

244
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,120
[SPEAKER_00]: The dotted line will be the normed national results.

245
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Below here, they're going to tell you what overall that means.

246
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:57,662
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece is that map growth can

247
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:05,656
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate to what their proposed MCAS performance would be.

248
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So many, you know, we click that piece off.

249
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:22,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your children, if it's an MCAS grade, it will tell them as of right now, for this time of year, your child would perform proficient or

250
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:26,557
[SPEAKER_00]: needs improvement or progressing towards.

251
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll give a little bit of an indicator as to where they are in relation to MCAS standards.

252
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:39,047
[SPEAKER_00]: For here, for the high growth, it's not a line plot.

253
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:43,350
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see the breakdown by color of their growth.

254
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see for this student, average achievement,

255
00:24:49,003 --> 00:25:01,909
[SPEAKER_00]: but really super high growth, so I want these are the conversations, we really want you to have with teachers, because oftentimes you may have.

256
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:12,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Students that have really high achievement but low growth, because their achievement is already at a point where.

257
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:16,222
[SPEAKER_00]: there may be above grade level standards.

258
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So their growth is not as big.

259
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:22,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you could have the opposite where

260
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:28,788
[SPEAKER_00]: the achievement is below grade level standards, but their growth is really high.

261
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:33,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay too, because they're making steady progress.

262
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:42,194
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have concerns, please, I know we can't say it enough, but have those conversations with your child's teacher.

263
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:48,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just move to the next slide, just so you can see what the science, it's the same setup.

264
00:25:50,586 --> 00:26:00,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the bottom, there are some questions if you want that can kind of guide you in that discussion with your child's teacher or teachers.

265
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:16,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've spoken about this already this evening, but resources for families, one which we've discussed is the map reports that you're gonna get at the beginning of the year during the report card conferences.

266
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:34,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the year, they'll be sent with the report card, and you'll have that information, and then you'll be able to not only be informed, but know what kind of follow-up questions or conversations you may want to have with your child's teacher or teachers.

267
00:26:35,956 --> 00:26:41,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we urge you to reach out to school staff if you have questions.

268
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is this MAP Parent Toolkit.

269
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:55,095
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we post this presentation on the Medford Public Schools website, this is another resource for families that's also a hyperlink.

270
00:26:55,675 --> 00:27:08,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring you not only to the practice tests, but it will also bring you to information that can be translated so families can select the language they need and learn a little bit more about.

271
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,380
[SPEAKER_00]: The map test platform.

272
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:13,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And.

273
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:29,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've hyperlinked in this parent toolkit here as well, so that we're giving it to you on three slides, so you have that resource readily available, and I believe that this is

274
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:32,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the last slide.

275
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:47,224
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to leave it on this slide so that at this point, if you have any questions that Dr. Riccidelli and I did not cover, if you could please put it in.

276
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I'll do is I'll

277
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:56,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop the screen share, but I can put it back up at any time if the questions correlate to something that we want to visually show you.

278
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,976
[SPEAKER_00]: But this way, we could kind of see faces.

279
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,159
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, you could just put it in the chat.

280
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:11,445
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when I'm not screen sharing, we can both monitor the chat or feel free to unmute yourself and ask any questions.

281
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:21,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah, did you want to ask a question?

282
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:29,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear you.

283
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

284
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you unmute?

285
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:35,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.

286
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pressing ask to unmute.

287
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if that works.

288
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on, let's see if I can change that.

289
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:53,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think you persistently asked me to unmute.

290
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it was?

291
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little message that said, host is asking you to unmute.

292
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:57,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

293
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:58,745
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

294
00:28:59,105 --> 00:28:59,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a question.

295
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say hi and to thank you for that information.

296
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:04,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.

297
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,652
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

298
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:07,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.

299
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:10,536
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see you.

300
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe there aren't any questions.

301
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good thing.

302
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:32,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We did such a thorough job, Dr. Riccidelli.

303
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:34,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

304
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:35,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what?

305
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when the parent reports come out, you may, at that point, you may have questions.

306
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:42,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know what to do, which is to reach out to the teacher.

307
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you might want to take a look at Ms.

308
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Galuzzi's very nice explanation of that family report again.

309
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:50,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you don't.

310
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:54,593
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, it's here if you want to.

311
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're thrilled that you were able to join us tonight.

312
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:04,276
[SPEAKER_01]: If no one does have a question, I had a minor one that wasn't going to be worth taking up the time for, but since there haven't been others.

313
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:16,740
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that there was some correlation offered about how their MAP score relates to their potential MCAS performance, but I didn't understand where we would find that.

314
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:21,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so let me put that back up.

315
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:25,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just that it wasn't, it didn't appear on the particular example?

316
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're not using, go ahead.

317
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just gonna say the example that we're projecting here is one that Matt put out that's universal to all 50 states.

318
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:44,297
[SPEAKER_02]: But on your child's test, as Mrs. Galuzzi said, it's gonna be clicked off.

319
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be a statement about that connection

320
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:52,726
[SPEAKER_02]: to MCAS and what the probability is of their score based on these scores.

321
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:58,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're right, you don't see it on this, but it will appear on the family report that you receive.

322
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:02,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just in the example that, sorry, go ahead.

323
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:03,108
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

324
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:06,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see my arrow or my cursor?

325
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:06,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

326
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:07,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can.

327
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see that paragraph.

328
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:09,829
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it will appear.

329
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:10,989
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be right below there.

330
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:11,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

331
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,450
[SPEAKER_01]: For every subject.

332
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:15,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

333
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:16,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

334
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a point of curiosity on my part.

335
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:19,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

336
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

337
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:23,399
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

338
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're doing that.

339
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:34,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume that there will be lots of people who kind of are interested in and watch it, the recording of it after the fact, you can certainly edit out the part that I'm in.

340
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:37,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that recording will not include this little.

341
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,187
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's helpful though.

342
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people would have that question.

343
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:45,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

344
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:46,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

345
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

346
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:47,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

347
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:48,816
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.

348
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Elia was here listening from the other room.

349
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,397
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, was that Mrs. Galussi?

350
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:55,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So she recognized me.

351
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:57,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell her I said hello.

352
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:57,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

353
00:31:58,198 --> 00:31:58,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

354
00:31:59,038 --> 00:31:59,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

355
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,179
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

356
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:00,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

357
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,059
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

358
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

359
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

360
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

361
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:19,491
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and for those people who are joining from home because we're still recorded, thank you so much for joining us and have a great evening or afternoon or morning.

362
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:21,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
