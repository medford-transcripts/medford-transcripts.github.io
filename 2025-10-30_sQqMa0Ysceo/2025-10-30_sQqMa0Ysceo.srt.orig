00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:48,665
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:57,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we want to welcome two former Method City Councilors, Mr. Bob Penta,

5
00:00:58,405 --> 00:00:59,745
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mr. Michael Motz.

6
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:06,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say this, they both serve the city of Medford very well.

7
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you both for joining us.

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Method Happenings.

9
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our pleasure.

10
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:15,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our honor to have you guys on.

11
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:15,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, John.

13
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, John.

14
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,932
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, gentlemen, we're going to get right into, you know, the purpose of the show.

15
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,592
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into some questions.

16
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:52,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the first question we're curious about, we wanna get started with, is we're gonna ask you both, if you can tell us what differences, okay, if any, do you see in this current council when comparing it to past city councilors?

17
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:57,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, what was different when you guys were counselors?

18
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,606
[SPEAKER_01]: You see any big differences?

19
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll start off with that.

20
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:06,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob, we'll start with you first, and then Michael, you can come in afterwards.

21
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:18,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing that I've seen over the past four years, especially with this particular council, is how they treat the people when they come to the podium.

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not very nice at times.

23
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've been a product of what they've done.

24
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not courteous.

25
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not willing to listen.

26
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:36,303
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an agenda sometimes, many times, has nothing to do with the city of Medford, and when you try to correct them on that, they don't want to listen to you.

27
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the fact that they cut down the speaking times at the podium, another act that just doesn't speak well for good government, because good government

28
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: as an elected official, you're supposed to just sit there, listen to what people have to say, and then get involved in your conversation.

29
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:59,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, can I just detour one thing real quick, because it has something to do with this.

30
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It has everything to do with what we just went through now,

31
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: to get onto your program, John.

32
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:14,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I was in the city council, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a class aid studio up in Method High School, okay?

33
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:21,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And to unfortunately have to do this late at night, not use that studio, that's there for the people for public access.

34
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was there for.

35
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:30,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city administration uncomfortably has made this very hard for people like you, who does a wonderful job in bringing both sides in,

36
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,124
[SPEAKER_02]: not to be up there.

37
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just upset, to be honest with you.

38
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're not at the studio, okay?

39
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,768
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I can appreciate that, Bob.

40
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:42,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, anything you want to add?

41
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:49,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, when I first got on the council, the council was known as the People's Forum.

42
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:57,775
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly was the only place in the city that residents can go up, and at the time it was once a week,

43
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:12,067
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think many people prefer that over every other week now, and residents could come up on a host of issues that impacted their daily life, and we as a council would open up, allow them to speak.

44
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:18,653
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had rules regarding time, but if someone took their time out of their schedule to come up there,

45
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:25,177
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very gracious with allowing people to speak, and we never shut off people.

46
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:26,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bob can attest to that.

47
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:35,142
[SPEAKER_00]: We let people vent, and sometimes they just wanted to come up and vent, but we gave them a forum, and I think that's what's lacking now.

48
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:41,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Residents are frustrated because they don't have a forum to speak, and when you get to speak,

49
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:42,887
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cut off.

50
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:43,928
[SPEAKER_00]: You're rude.

51
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Members of the council, certain members, are very rude and condescending.

52
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:54,096
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really make people feel like they don't want to hear what they have to say.

53
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:57,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get rid of the only forum in the city,

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that says a lot that people have nowhere else to go.

55
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:09,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, if I was back in the council, that would be the first thing I would fight for.

56
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:20,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase public participation, allowing residents to get up and vent any of their concerns, and make it truly the people's forum.

57
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:25,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, as you remember, Bob, Bob Mayorko used to say that all the time.

58
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,859
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the people's forum.

59
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always remember that.

60
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:39,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, this is the one place they get to come up and speak and be heard and, you know, by their elected officials and give them the opportunity.

61
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: As an addition to that, John, hopefully, if a majority of these new independent candidates get elected, one of the

62
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: The first few things that they do is they bring back the weekly meetings, number one.

63
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, they bring back the five-minute rule to let people speak.

64
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it means speaking more than once, so be it.

65
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:10,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, some of the issues that are going on right now in this city demands an awful lot of the people's input, because that, unfortunately, is what's causing this election to go forward.

66
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,182
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not being heard.

67
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:16,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have this group of people that are on the council right now that only think one way.

68
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:20,644
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not open up their brain to listen to an opposing opinion.

69
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:22,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

70
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate what you guys are saying.

71
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:33,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could just add, John, they're using the agenda against residents.

72
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:38,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say that, you could be on the agenda and not be heard for four or five hours.

73
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:51,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, if you have a group of residents that come up all on the same issue, there's no reason that would have never happened under our watch, myself or Bob Penter or the other members of the council.

74
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:57,640
[SPEAKER_00]: If we knew there was a group of people there, we would always suspend the rules and allow them to speak first.

75
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,442
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't waiting four or five hours to speak.

76
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:06,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's being used, the council agenda is being used as a tool to stifle people.

77
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And that again is not right.

78
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,552
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, these are the things that we have to look at.

79
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:21,120
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a host of changes that were made to the council rules, in my opinion, that do not benefit residents of this community.

80
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,801
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow for public input.

81
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:36,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new council that comes in, hopefully, will change a lot of those rules back to allow for more public participation, allow for people to get up there in a timely fashion and speak, and move the issues along.

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not happening right now.

83
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:40,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.

84
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:45,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that you guys hit some good issues.

85
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:48,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to agree with most of what you're saying.

86
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,024
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so, you know, we'd like to get, you know, we have you both here.

87
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:58,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we'd like to get your views on some current issues.

88
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:06,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the biggest issue that I see right now in this city, no matter where you go, people are talking about it.

89
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,995
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about it on a regular basis.

90
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:15,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Every candidate that we've had on, this is a very important question.

91
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:22,898
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people are very concerned, and that is, you know, this proposed zoning in Medford.

92
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:31,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you guys, you know, one at a time, you know, just give us an idea, where do you stand with this zoning?

93
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,943
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you feel about it?

94
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think it's going?

95
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:37,964
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with you, Michael, this time.

96
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,145
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think?

97
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:42,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going?

98
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:55,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major concern I hear right now, and there's a lot to zoning, if people don't know or not aware, zoning, in my opinion, is the lifeblood of a community.

99
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:59,936
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the backbone of a community, how it's zoned.

100
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's currently happening right now is

101
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:18,027
[SPEAKER_00]: The push from six members of the council, excluding George Scapelli, he's been very vocal about being opposed, not to zoning changes, but to the elimination of single family districts.

102
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:23,490
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have such a major impact on the neighborhoods.

103
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:42,903
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the Lawrence estates, if you look at North Method, if you look throughout the community that have single family neighborhoods, the Brooks estates, and all of a sudden now zoning for single families is going to be gone and you're going to allow up to three, four, five units in each lot.

104
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,125
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes for high density housing.

105
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for increased traffic, increased congestion, increased lack of parking.

106
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:59,217
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a host of concerns that everyone in this community should have.

107
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:05,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to say we don't need additional housing, and in particular affordable housing.

108
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:18,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Chapter 40B, which is the state law that provides for building with affordable housing, that does increase the stock of affordable housing in the community.

109
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:19,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it do enough?

110
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:21,285
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up for debate.

111
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:29,328
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, to change the fabric of this community, and let me just say, John, it doesn't just change single family areas.

112
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:34,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Wellington, and it changes two family areas as well.

113
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:45,553
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at South Method, if you look at Wellington, Haines Square that has a lot of two families, they're talking about changing a two family into a four to six family.

114
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:57,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about it, that just doesn't impact your neighborhood, that impacts infrastructure, water and sewer, that impacts school size, class size.

115
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:06,625
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ramifications right now that I think every, that's the most pressing issue, I think every resident in this community

116
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,111
[SPEAKER_00]: should be concerned and should really pay attention to what's going on.

117
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, I was elected 26 years.

118
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:22,055
[SPEAKER_00]: By far, this is probably the most important, crucial issue that faces this community right now.

119
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely agree.

120
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:27,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's talking about it.

121
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:29,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a great answer.

122
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob, you want to add something to that?

123
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:32,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, you know.

124
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:34,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

125
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:41,582
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is this whole issue had its initial beginning a couple of years ago on the Salem Street area.

126
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:45,824
[SPEAKER_02]: A lady by the name of Shoah Rodriguez, a great warrior for the neighborhood,

127
00:11:46,184 --> 00:12:04,842
[SPEAKER_02]: was out there and they came to they eventually came to an agreement between the neighbors and as to what was being proposed in the city and the city council this city council wanted to go against it and they did and that suddenly it was a pushback okay but what they're proposing they were proposing to put you into a 4,000 square foot lot

128
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,227
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're allowing you, if this goes through anywhere, some one to three additional units.

129
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:22,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also taking the 75-year-old homes that are in a particular district, and you'll be able to put two to three more in-house people in those 75-year-old homes.

130
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:29,202
[SPEAKER_02]: The setbacks from the street in the back, they're changing all of those.

131
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:31,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrapping up what Michael is saying,

132
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:44,454
[SPEAKER_02]: If even if a developer were to come in and this was going to take place, doesn't people realize that developers buying the property, so he's going to be paying a lot of money, then he's going to have to pay to develop the piece of property.

133
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:49,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think you're going to sell that to a low or moderate income person, no, because he's going to want to get his money back.

134
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

135
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And then add on to that, if it has an effect on the school system, for which it will,

136
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,266
[SPEAKER_02]: all these people coming in.

137
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's going to have kids.

138
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:01,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now the school system is at max of these elementary schools.

139
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:03,052
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing?

140
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So the planning here is absolutely ridiculous, okay?

141
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the mayor got a hold of it, I believe it was in August of this year, she sent a letter to the council and to the planning board to let's just push back

142
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:22,529
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't realize, I believe she said she didn't realize that the pushback was so strong on the neighbors.

143
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, you know, it hasn't gone anywhere.

144
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sad part is this, John, this is the sad part.

145
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:35,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got seven independent candidates that are running and hopefully they get in there, at least the majority.

146
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:47,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they don't get in there, the unfortunate part is if four out of the seven get in there of the present city council, which are OR revolutionary, they're just going to go forward with this change in zoning.

147
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:51,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to really send the city into a tailspin.

148
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't recognize Medford after this.

149
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:53,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

150
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:54,135
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

151
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,115
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good thing.

152
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:57,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you guys for the answer.

153
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:01,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just add one thing, John?

154
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:01,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Michael.

155
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:02,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

156
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:10,684
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it's important to know, I think, for the viewing audience, that this zoning initiative was on the fast track.

157
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were countless meetings and so forth.

158
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:25,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have spoken up that they were not just opposed to it, but they thought it required more investigation and more community input.

159
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:36,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't until the election started to approach that this current city council, six members, put it on hold temporarily.

160
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:41,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say temporarily, I mean temporarily, until after the election's over.

161
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, if we reelect six of those members,

162
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,358
[SPEAKER_00]: This zoning is going to fly through.

163
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:52,522
[SPEAKER_00]: The very fabric of the city is going to change a thousand percent.

164
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:59,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a unique opportunity to stand up and say, you know what, we don't support this current zoning change.

165
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:03,091
[SPEAKER_00]: We do support taking a look at zoning and how we can improve it.

166
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,351
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't support this current zoning.

167
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:14,773
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way I tell people all the time to send a message is to look at the candidates right now that are talking about, hey, let's take a step back.

168
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:18,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's carefully approach this zoning and see what we can do.

169
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:24,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at George Scarpelli, Rick Caviello, Patrick Lurken, Paul Donato Jr.

170
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:29,817
[SPEAKER_00]: has spoken about it, Melody Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick

171
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:48,608
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all spoken about it, saying that they're definitely going to review this and take a much longer approach to make sure every neighborhood's accounted for when any change, and every input is accounted for.

172
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:50,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's key.

173
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:56,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I tell people, because we still get calls, Bob Penter can attest to this, I get calls all the time.

174
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,294
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say what you probably do.

175
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:01,016
[SPEAKER_00]: If people say, Mike, what do you think?

176
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:04,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell them, I say, you get the government you deserve.

177
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:10,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to reelect the same people, you're going to get this, especially the zoning, jammed down your throat.

178
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:11,864
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.

179
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:12,905
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's going to happen.

180
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,866
[SPEAKER_02]: John, one step further to that.

181
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: One step further to that.

182
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:22,032
[SPEAKER_02]: If this were to go through, you could get a hodgepodge on the same street.

183
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,614
[SPEAKER_02]: One side of the street will be zoned one way.

184
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:28,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how the development is going to take place.

185
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,802
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't belong in Method right now.

186
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got 1,000 new units coming on board.

187
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:44,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the city was so concerned about affordable and low-income housing, they should be going out there and look at pieces of property.

188
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:52,340
[SPEAKER_02]: A classic piece for them to take would be the carbons on Salem Street, because they're getting that from nothing from the MBTA.

189
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that the MBTA cleans the land first, OK?

190
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, we could go on and on.

191
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Michael says, we could go on.

192
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,026
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many nuances, so many nuances to this here.

193
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:09,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, right now you're allowed to put an additional 900 square feet unit on your house.

194
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:18,236
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can go, the state allows you, you can go back to the city, get a special permit from the city and you could put two on on your present existing.

195
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is you've got to read what they're proposing.

196
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

197
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely.

198
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,801
[SPEAKER_00]: John, not to belabor it, but one other point because this is an important issue.

199
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Back several years ago when I was on the council, there was the housing production plan.

200
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:44,685
[SPEAKER_00]: This plan was commissioned by the city and we brought in a private consultant and they brought up creative ways in order for us to create more affordable housing.

201
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:53,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the major pieces was to look at, I believe at the time, there were some 300 and something odd lots in the city.

202
00:17:54,752 --> 00:18:00,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them were under the buildable size that you can do in the city.

203
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:13,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, the housing production plan was going to take these lots, either purchase the city or approach people that own these odd lots that can't build, and turn them into buildable lots.

204
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,131
[SPEAKER_00]: for affordable housing and give an incentive.

205
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:28,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're talking about a massive project, which would be another 300 or 400 additional affordable housing in the city on lots that are already there.

206
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:35,647
[SPEAKER_00]: People can actually sell their lot off if I had a little piece of lot and build affordable housing on it.

207
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,868
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been no consideration by this current council.

208
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:45,070
[SPEAKER_00]: They only want to come in and create high density housing and just jam things into people's neighborhoods.

209
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,351
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a way of doing it, John.

210
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

211
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:49,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you guys.

212
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:50,872
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

213
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:54,354
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to keep moving on here.

214
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:58,555
[SPEAKER_01]: We really probably we're trying to cover an awful lot.

215
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:07,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the next big thing, uh, it's also on the ballot that that's going to be on the ballot is the proposed charter.

216
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:11,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, basically I don't want to get into too much detail.

217
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:15,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, we've, we've talked about this quite a bit on this show.

218
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, bottom line, are you in favor?

219
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:19,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in favor.

220
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:33,249
[SPEAKER_01]: uh you know why or why not and you know just try and be brief about it um then we'll start with you michael uh fail or not and and why why not the charter correct yes

221
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,615
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand this is somewhat of a contentious issue.

222
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:51,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was on the council, I was the first member of the council to bring forth a petition to be sent to the state legislature for a charter review.

223
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,650
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, it passed four to three, I believe, at the time.

224
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,034
[SPEAKER_00]: It went up to the statehouse and sat in the, I think it was the home rule or local affairs committee.

225
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the local affairs committee and sat there.

226
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:16,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finally reached out after it was there for months and come to find out the chairman of the committee said he didn't think that the four to three vote was enough to move that forward.

227
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a majority of the council.

228
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:24,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We speak to the residents, you know, initiate this process.

229
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,685
[SPEAKER_00]: But needless to say, it died within the statehouse.

230
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:37,988
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I support the two years worth of work that was done by a lot of good people in this community that sat.

231
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,448
[SPEAKER_00]: They had countless hearings.

232
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:50,291
[SPEAKER_00]: They met with countless people, countless boards and commissions, and came out with what I think a good working document and something that, is it perfect?

233
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.

234
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,573
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

235
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have a decent document to work with.

236
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, WAD representation.

237
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:03,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always supported that.

238
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:12,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to make sure that every neighborhood, every ward has someone that you can say, hey, that's my city councilor.

239
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I see him three times a week.

240
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,121
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in my neighborhood.

241
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I see him at Stop and Shop.

242
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:23,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really bringing the city back to a real small neighborhood level.

243
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a good form of government.

244
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:30,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So I support most of what's in there right now.

245
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I happy with everything?

246
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:32,732
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

247
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:38,897
[SPEAKER_00]: But this also calls for a periodic review of the charter.

248
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:40,499
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been looked at in 39 years.

249
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,041
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think this is a good start and hopefully it is just the starting point.

250
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:54,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to support it and I'm telling people that I know to give it a shot and then we can always look to tweak and improve going forward.

251
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:56,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the answer, Michael.

252
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob, yourself, support it?

253
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, no?

254
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:01,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for anything.

255
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:06,647
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where Michael and I part ways because, you know,

256
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,362
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously, because I know a lot of work went into this, okay?

257
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:16,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And having served for many years in this council, I was never even asked for my opinion by the group of people.

258
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:17,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.

259
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, Michael's for what councils?

260
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:21,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not for what councils.

261
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any need to increase the annual budget by a minimum of $120,000 to add four more councils on there.

262
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:30,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time,

263
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:36,158
[SPEAKER_02]: make the financial corrections in the council chamber to put the people in there.

264
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information.

265
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information.

266
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:39,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

267
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that still work?

268
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:42,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information?

269
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:43,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it still works.

270
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,324
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how I got Bob to stop talking quick?

271
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,245
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but that's okay.

272
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:49,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away, it went in his head.

273
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,586
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, point of information.

274
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:52,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good memories, Michael.

275
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,568
[SPEAKER_01]: These are good memories.

276
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:58,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not advocating to increase the budget line for counselors.

277
00:22:59,431 --> 00:23:00,792
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be done very simply.

278
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, councils make, on an average, $30,000.

279
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,715
[SPEAKER_00]: The large councils make $30,000.

280
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,236
[SPEAKER_00]: The ward councils make $15,000, $17,000.

281
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:12,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not advocating to give them additional money.

282
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,340
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a better form of government.

283
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want people to believe I want to increase their salaries.

284
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:18,942
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I want.

285
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's put it this way.

286
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:25,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's $30,000 or $17,000, you're still going to be increasing the budget of the council.

287
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:26,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.

288
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:26,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two,

289
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a thing here on page eight of this new document, which is 54 pages long, that the city counselors can submit expenses and their costs for being a counselor during the course of the year.

290
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:43,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me remind everybody, including you, Michael, we were on the council.

291
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: The IRS came in and said you could not do that.

292
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:54,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you were going to be getting for your expenses would have to just go into your salary and that's how it was corrected.

293
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is included in this particular budget, excuse me, in this particular piece of legislation.

294
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:05,239
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor is serving for 16 years, but there's no term limits for the city council or the school committee.

295
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not right either.

296
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:19,655
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that the school committee would have two wards put together, why they couldn't agree to come to 11, I don't know, but two wards put together because in one of the two wards, there'll be a school.

297
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:22,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least there'll be a school for every two wards.

298
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:23,938
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make any sense.

299
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if another ward and the future years decide they want to have a school?

300
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to need a school because of the increase in the population?

301
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have just left the school committee alone

302
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:44,940
[SPEAKER_02]: seven members at large, and then they decided to take the mayor off the school committee as to being the chairperson, because now she is nothing more than a member.

303
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So think of this logically.

304
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:52,989
[SPEAKER_02]: If she sits on that school committee as a member, but he or she in the future is also a mayor,

305
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the money person in the city.

306
00:24:55,312 --> 00:25:02,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you're going to put a non-money person that's going to sit in the chair that's going to be arguing with the man who's going to be sitting on the floor?

307
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

308
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the fact, John, this has always been my belief.

309
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:10,448
[SPEAKER_02]: When I ran for office, I knew what my duty was.

310
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go out there and campaign.

311
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost 36 pounds my very first time out there, ringing the doorbells and having people meet me, passing out my literature and going forward.

312
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a firm believer, if you really want something that bad, then go for it.

313
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:29,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's how the city of Memphis has gone on for so many years, since 1939.

314
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,715
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had seven councils at large.

315
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:38,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So by just increasing them, the next argument would be, let's just say I'm coming from Ward 8.

316
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,844
[SPEAKER_02]: and watch two, three, and four don't like me, okay?

317
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:48,326
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever the reason is, they don't like me, my style, whatever I'm proposing, I'm not gonna get anywhere with them.

318
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:52,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was at large, it affects the entire community.

319
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see that through the years.

320
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:55,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you another thing.

321
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The camaraderie that existed with seven counselors in the past, even when Michael was there, at least we got along.

322
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We have differences of opinion.

323
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:10,805
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just going to open up a ball of wax that somebody in Ward 8 needs something that's more important, and they're going to consider it more important than another ward in this and that.

324
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to get into this political hangover.

325
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know.

326
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:20,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But no term limits for counselors, no term limits for school committee, but the mayor gets 14 years.

327
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that comes from or where the logic to that came from.

328
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:26,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I listen, I thank you.

329
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,895
[SPEAKER_01]: You both gave us honest answers.

330
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:37,188
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only thing I can add to it, you know, to me, it's a living document.

331
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:45,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a lot, I agree, there's good in there, and there's things I don't like, and I think everyone's gonna find that.

332
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just gotta balance it out, but it is a living- But one important thing, this is a document that got passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, okay?

333
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it right here, 50 some odd pages.

334
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:04,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The taxpayers of this community should have gotten a copy of this document, be made available to them so they can read it.

335
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,971
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't read it.

336
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:09,612
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in the city clerk's office and they think you're talking Chinese to them.

337
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get a copy of it?

338
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: The registrar voters should have a copy for anyone that would want it.

339
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody has a computer to go on and read it.

340
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:26,597
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's such a good document and if the city thought it was such a, what would it be to spend a few thousand dollars and mail it out to every registered voter?

341
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:27,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

342
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:30,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the answer for that.

343
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:32,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right, we're going to move on.

344
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:39,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice to see that people can disagree and still get along, still go for a cup of coffee together.

345
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he's on the other side of you right now.

346
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:50,362
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so, you know, this is sort of a two part question.

347
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,303
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already had an override passed.

348
00:27:54,443 --> 00:28:06,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, you know, how you guys felt about it, but, you know, there's talk now, I mean, new high school, okay?

349
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be refurbished, the costs?

350
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:13,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be override, debt exclusion?

351
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a whole lot more going on.

352
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:23,500
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think about, you know,

353
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:36,774
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were on the council right now or the school committee or you had some kind of a say in this, which way do you think you're gonna go as far as how do you get a new school?

354
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:38,294
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do it?

355
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:40,875
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the answer?

356
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:51,057
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, John, last year, when that override for $456 a year and keep going forward, the only way that's ever gonna come off is the council is gonna have to vote it out or put it on the ballot.

357
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the fact, plus the fact,

358
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:59,069
[SPEAKER_02]: that 456 has got nothing to do with the tax rate that's going to be set.

359
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be 456 over and beyond.

360
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:17,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact of the matter is, you keep talking about, you'll tell me why there is a need for a new high school, because number one, if the school had been maintained like it should have been, you know, we went through this with all the elementary schools after so many years,

361
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,371
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they didn't take care of the schools and they're in almost the same condition right now.

362
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:22,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the point.

363
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:24,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a new science lab in there.

364
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a new section over there where the pool is and stuff like that.

365
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:31,095
[SPEAKER_02]: The infrastructure of our city is in desperate need of help.

366
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:33,636
[SPEAKER_02]: The high school is not falling apart.

367
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:38,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a sense of priority of where you're going to go in the city and how you're going to spend your money.

368
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

369
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:52,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, I would hope that this new council, when they come in, they look at that override and just saying, hey, when that override was passed on, it was $28 million in city monies and free cash sitting there.

370
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:58,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And the override was only for $7.5 million worth of what was needed at the time.

371
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could have deducted that from the $28 million, but they didn't do it.

372
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:06,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And the unfortunate part is the at present city council doesn't think like this.

373
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:07,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

374
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: They have more on these national issues and more on these social issues and whatever it might be.

375
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:17,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know how to think about Medford and where it's going and how to spend the dollars.

376
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:18,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem.

377
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you're seeing, you're seeing seven new counselors running this year, you know, to get back and take a grip back of our city.

378
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got to do it because you just go up to keep, who do you think is going to keep paying for all these things?

379
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:33,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the taxpayer, right?

380
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:34,417
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about that.

381
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:35,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just it.

382
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Common sense, right?

383
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:40,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Common sense when you're going to spend the taxpayer's dollars.

384
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:43,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bob.

385
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, same question.

386
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:52,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's great to propose new things in the community, right?

387
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:56,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone would like a new high school, a new fire headquarters.

388
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:06,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Even our elementaries and middle schools now are 25 years old and they're getting up there to an age and doing a lot of work.

389
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you have to do is make a case for it, right?

390
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:15,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we need a new high school, you have to say, what is enrollment like?

391
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:17,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we anticipate enrollment increasing?

392
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:23,330
[SPEAKER_00]: That high school was built for, I think, 3,500 or 4,000 students, or maybe even more than that.

393
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,612
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at less than half capacity.

394
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.

395
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:38,277
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got a few years back school building assistance money, millions of dollars, like Councilor Penter said, to do science labs and so forth and rehab the high school pool.

396
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they put a new roof on it.

397
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got 90% on the dollar.

398
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:50,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the school committee when we actually proposed going from neighborhood schools to centralized schools.

399
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:56,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, that was a huge issue because people liked having the neighborhood feel, right?

400
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:59,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Your kids walk to school, everything's within the neighborhood.

401
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:06,493
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a tough decision, but it was one that I think was warranted at the time because of the age and condition of our schools.

402
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:11,717
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to give our kids state-of-the-art facilities in these schools now.

403
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:18,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, honestly, more due diligence needs to be had regarding the need for a new high school.

404
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:22,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Councilor Penta mentioned, there's a lot of needs out there.

405
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:29,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think looking at a new high school, you're talking anywhere from $200 million to maybe $300 million.

406
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:36,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And then displacing kids throughout the course of a whole school year and maybe even longer.

407
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to look at.

408
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,434
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds great, but I think, honestly, we need to see what type of reimbursement, if any.

409
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:56,483
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you work for the state, and Bedford just got $20 million from you, and then they're coming back saying, you know what, the $20 million you gave us, we're going to rip that down for the science labs.

410
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:03,206
[SPEAKER_00]: to build a brand new school and say, we just gave you 20 million 10 years ago.

411
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:04,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to rip it down?

412
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.

413
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:07,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot.

414
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:12,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to a new school, but I really think that we haven't done our homework.

415
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:17,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to jump in there because he brings up a good point, Councilor Marks.

416
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:30,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is every year the state auditor was supposed to have an audit of the expenditures of the new schools going forward until they were paid off, okay?

417
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And while that was supposed to be five percent of the budget of each school, five percent of the budget of each school, it never took place.

418
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:42,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it never took place, those schools just fell into disrepair.

419
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:45,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go into the Brooks School and you'll find, you know,

420
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to name any schools.

421
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned that.

422
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:49,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

423
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:49,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.

424
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact of the matter is this, John, OK?

425
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:54,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your elected people.

426
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:59,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they were doing their job, they would have realized that that money should have gone in there.

427
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,824
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be no reason to be spending hundreds and millions of dollars to refurbish new schools.

428
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

429
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:05,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

430
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:07,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you get to that,

431
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:11,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive down the streets, look at your potholes, look at your sidewalks.

432
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:17,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to talk about something crazy, talk about the crazy bump outs all over the city, OK?

433
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me what that's going to serve.

434
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:22,323
[SPEAKER_01]: You're jumping ahead to my next question, Bob.

435
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:23,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.

436
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:25,064
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys for that.

437
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:28,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let you answer this first, Bob, all right?

438
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:29,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, sure.

439
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:36,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is the next question, because I, oh my god, it's like unbelievable.

440
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:52,442
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, talk about bump outs, Salem Street, the traffic in Medford, all the safe street programs, congestion, the sidewalks, the bike lanes.

441
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:56,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We need street repairs, sidewalk repairs.

442
00:34:56,665 --> 00:35:00,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can go on and on and on.

443
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:03,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a lot to get done.

444
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:10,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it's just too many things all coming

445
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:14,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it has no rhyme or reason.

446
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,433
[SPEAKER_02]: There again, you say a lot of things need to be done.

447
00:35:17,673 --> 00:35:19,694
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back to maybe a year and a half ago.

448
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:25,937
[SPEAKER_02]: This all starts in West Method, coming from Winchester, not being able to take a right down Plaisted Road.

449
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,517
[SPEAKER_02]: They put those stupid cones there.

450
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:31,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of last, a few months ago, what did they do?

451
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,880
[SPEAKER_02]: By Osborne Road, they shut the street off.

452
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,560
[SPEAKER_02]: For what reason?

453
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,260
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?

454
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have Councilor Lazaro, Emily Lazaro, trying to take credit, trying to trade credit for the Salem Street Rotary.

455
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:46,192
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at that, the first snowstorm, that traffic is going to be backed up into 93.

456
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

457
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:54,520
[SPEAKER_02]: You go on Main Street by Stanley Road or Stanley Street, they're all over the place.

458
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Compare that to a legitimate

459
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:03,898
[SPEAKER_02]: street that needs to be, Riverside Ave, where Councilor Marks lives, that really needs to be rehabilitated.

460
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: High Street, going from the Winter Street Rotary up there, you wonder what the hell is going on.

461
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:10,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's running the city?

462
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:12,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know another stupid thing, John?

463
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:22,114
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drive on Mystic Ave, okay, next to the Great Beer Garden, you go a little bit further down, they have a bike lane in the middle of a highway, okay?

464
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:25,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

465
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:30,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever's running these things, department heads, you could go to, we won't get into it, but go ahead.

466
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:43,181
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I hear you and I see that on Mystic Ave and I just, you know, geez, I haven't plowed a street in about 40 years, Bob, but I see those plow trucks.

467
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I see these bump outs.

468
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I see these rotaries.

469
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, fire trucks.

470
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:51,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they're going to do it.

471
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:52,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.

472
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Look what they did in Haines Square, for God's sake.

473
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

474
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be extremely tough.

475
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:00,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

476
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And where were the counselors?

477
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one counselor speaking up, at least no matter how.

478
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:08,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you need a new direction.

479
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:11,918
[SPEAKER_02]: The direction should be Medford.

480
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a Medford direction.

481
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

482
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael.

483
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, same question.

484
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to repeat the whole question.

485
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:23,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you ride a bike, Michael.

486
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs tires.

487
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,589
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs tires, you're right, Bob.

488
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:28,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know Michael does.

489
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,951
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a bike rider.

490
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:32,532
[SPEAKER_01]: He rides that bike a lot.

491
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:37,057
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on what we're talking about, Michael?

492
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:37,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

493
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:38,898
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what?

494
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:44,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Traffic calming, when I was on the council, I'd probably say it was my number one issue.

495
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:59,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fought hard to make sure our crosswalks were relined every year and so forth, to use thermoplastic rather than paint, because it lasts five years and paint fades away after a year.

496
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,091
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a hard time on that.

497
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:16,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a lot of issues, but one issue, John, that no one talks about, and it has to do with roads and sidewalks, is right now we have roughly 730-odd streets in the community, of which more than half are private ways.

498
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:29,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a private way, the city will not typically get involved with the repair of a sidewalk, the cutting of a tree, the maintenance of a road, and you pay the same tax as everyone else.

499
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:39,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I happen to live on a private way, I don't get any of those services, but I pay the same tax as the next person.

500
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:50,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that has to be a number one priority that every street in this city is treated the same, whether you're private or not.

501
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:59,346
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city has to accept all the private ways as regular roads, they have to go through a process in order to do so.

502
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason when people would call me up and say, hey, you know what?

503
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:05,148
[SPEAKER_00]: How come they won't plow my street?

504
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:08,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how come they won't fix a pothole or cut this tree down?

505
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, well, you live on a private way.

506
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:13,251
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unacceptable.

507
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,831
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unacceptable.

508
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:19,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Bob with the bump outs and everything else that's going on.

509
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:30,274
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get federal and state money, Barbara will remember, when we did projects in the city and got federal and state money, which was good, it always came with string attached.

510
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:37,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like on High Street, when we had to do away with all the parking, when we did all the different

511
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:43,737
[SPEAKER_00]: road safety concerns, we went up to the Brooks School and they made us put a bike lane there.

512
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:48,118
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bike lane led to nowhere, which was one of my big gripes.

513
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:53,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden you have a bike lane and then it ends when you get to the Winthrop Street Rotary.

514
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,801
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on your bike and you're like, what do I do next?

515
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:58,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm mixed in with traffic.

516
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:06,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that we don't put an emphasis, there's zero dollars in our budget

517
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:08,345
[SPEAKER_00]: to repave streets.

518
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.

519
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:14,308
[SPEAKER_00]: All the money comes from whatever the state gives us.

520
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:16,669
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is zero money.

521
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:27,114
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted to get serious, there should be a line item to pave a certain number of our 730 streets every year in order to, you know, make the changes that we want.

522
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

523
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to just jump in real quick, when he talks about the Greek school, there's an island down there.

524
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:33,858
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go down High Street on the island,

525
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:47,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the wintertime, that sign that's in the middle gets knocked down two or three times by cars and trucks because they put the island in there, but they don't paint the cement, the borders in orange.

526
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,044
[SPEAKER_02]: They just leave it.

527
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can just drive into it.

528
00:40:51,785 --> 00:41:04,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple little things like safety, you know, I mean, paint, what's a little orange paint, a yellow iridescent paint, something, you know, it's just... One driver, one bike, people riding bikes too, it's the same.

529
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you talk about riding bikes.

530
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:10,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If the police department really wanted to make some money, they could do it with these bikes.

531
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,457
[SPEAKER_02]: These bikes should be registered and insured.

532
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys driving down the street and girls going to red lights, cutting people off and then giving you the finger after they do it, please, please.

533
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:23,847
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, it's not just bikes.

534
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:28,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I see every kind of electric scooter and wheels.

535
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:31,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm amazed at what's out there.

536
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:34,377
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it's amazing.

537
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:41,320
[SPEAKER_00]: John, the city implemented a pilot program probably 10 years ago for permit parking.

538
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,902
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, and we're still under the very same pilot program.

539
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:51,844
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the longest pilot program in the history of the United States.

540
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:59,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you that we, not even a crawl, we're at a snail's pace in this city to get anything done.

541
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,968
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really sad.

542
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:04,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

543
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:12,615
[SPEAKER_02]: John, this all reflects back on the council that is there right now, back to the days when Michael was there and I was serving.

544
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:16,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you would get a few things done in this.

545
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:23,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot, the last four years, you could not go before this council, express your opinion, especially if it was contrary to theirs.

546
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they cut everybody from five minutes down to three,

547
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:28,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.

548
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:28,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

549
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on, street sweeping.

550
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We do street sweeping twice a year in the neighborhoods.

551
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:38,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Surrounding communities do it weekly.

552
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:51,232
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why we do our thoroughfares, but the neighborhoods, I live near Wellington, the debris that flows up from Dunkin' Donuts and all the stores down there, it's incredible.

553
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:57,316
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why we can't have a street sweeping program, really.

554
00:42:57,996 --> 00:42:58,576
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be nice.

555
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:02,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm going to have, I got one last thing for you guys.

556
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:06,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, uh, you know, this is great.

557
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I, I've enjoyed this show.

558
00:43:09,305 --> 00:43:27,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, um, um, so, you know, I wanted to bring up, uh, you know, the police, the fire departments, uh, you know, we, we know, well, I don't know, but it seems to me, I mean, the fire department is like,

559
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:32,364
[SPEAKER_01]: for whatever reason, they've been put on a back burner in this city.

560
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,306
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they need a new building.

561
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:42,091
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things, but, you know, let's talk a little bit about that.

562
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:45,893
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire, the police, you know, what's going on.

563
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:48,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's got a contract, who doesn't anymore.

564
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot going on with them.

565
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,961
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Michael, you mentioned it earlier, so we'll go to you first.

566
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the fire department, I guess they, you know, they need a new building.

567
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,627
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve a new building.

568
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,328
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

569
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:13,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I was a member of the council, myself, Bob Penter and the rest of the councilors, we did a tour of all the fire stations.

570
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:14,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

571
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:23,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I would venture to say that there's not one council except for George Scott Pelley that's been in all our fire stations now.

572
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:26,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, many of them were in deplorable condition.

573
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:29,888
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 90, 100 years old, some of the buildings.

574
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:36,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, many of them lack just the basic amenities, like the showers and the bathrooms.

575
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:45,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are places where we're telling a brave man and woman that spent 24 hours a day, you know, back to back days.

576
00:44:46,904 --> 00:45:09,182
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you go in the kitchen, you know, is very close to the apparatus, which, you know, leads to a lot of different concerns, health concerns, fire safety equipment that they use, their coats and so forth, need the proper cleaning after a fire for the soot and everything else because of the carcinogens and so forth.

577
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of issues that really need to be addressed.

578
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes time

579
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:22,152
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always supported our brave men and women in the fire and the police, and they're out there.

580
00:45:22,172 --> 00:45:24,073
[SPEAKER_00]: When you need someone, they're there.

581
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,955
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a concern, the fire department's there.

582
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:29,237
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a concern, the police department's there.

583
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:32,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Our DPW, I mean, you could go through the list.

584
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,040
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our teachers.

585
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:40,885
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of good municipal employees, but unfortunately, I think, you know,

586
00:45:41,785 --> 00:45:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of their concerns are not heard.

587
00:45:45,490 --> 00:46:00,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when it comes to properly paying them, I think there's a lot that can be done to, sometimes you can't show it monetarily, but you show it in other ways that you're appreciative of what they do for our community.

588
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:04,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it is giving them a facility which they can be proud of.

589
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment, cars, trucks, everything they can be proud of.

590
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:11,976
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I stand.

591
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a big advocate.

592
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:16,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are difficult jobs.

593
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:19,782
[SPEAKER_00]: In this day and age, they're even more difficult.

594
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:23,365
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough thing.

595
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much more complicated job, too.

596
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:28,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob, anything you want to add?

597
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:37,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have your first responders in there, you know, and yeah, they do the first respond, they do just not a lot because he basically hit it.

598
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:42,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly, me if I were back in City Hall, my concern would be the contracts.

599
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:47,078
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to have contracts go over and beyond

600
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:50,245
[SPEAKER_02]: their due dates of when they should be renewed by.

601
00:46:50,265 --> 00:47:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: You negotiate a contract for four years, whatever it is, once it's done, you should just go right into it, not wait until maybe six months before.

602
00:47:00,812 --> 00:47:11,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go to these contracts and you go to these meetings and you hear both the fire and the police say, someone doesn't show up and that just pushes it back and pushes it back and for whatever it might be.

603
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:15,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there needs to be a new direction that's looked at

604
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:20,886
[SPEAKER_02]: personally with the council and the fire and the police and anything that does with public safety.

605
00:47:21,346 --> 00:47:23,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the mainstay.

606
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:26,708
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a safe city, what do you have?

607
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: You have nothing.

608
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:29,249
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say anything you want.

609
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,811
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW, do they have enough people?

610
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:33,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

611
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like they have enough equipment.

612
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:40,755
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the issues, the guys who turn around and say that they're being told to go here, there, and everywhere.

613
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know something, John, I'm just going to go back.

614
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:50,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I repeat myself and I apologize, but I don't apologize because I don't like to repeat myself.

615
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:52,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to say the same thing over and over.

616
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this administration, and I don't know how they're running it,

617
00:47:57,835 --> 00:48:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: would take more of an active position with the council and start to share what the needs are and what the concerns are and what the finances might be or has to be or what it should be.

618
00:48:09,526 --> 00:48:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that's one of the things they do address in the new charter.

619
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:13,169
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.

620
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:14,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they put it in there.

621
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to get corrected unless there's a meeting of the minds.

622
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:31,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we, sometimes when you are there, have somebody come in and they start talking about, you know, their concerns for the city, you know, and they'll turn around and say, well, we don't want to say anything in this and that.

623
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:36,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But it bothers them, you know, and that's just it.

624
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:40,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole idea of having communication and common sense.

625
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,170
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can afford it, we can afford it.

626
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:46,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The best example, am I going to spend almost $300 million for high school?

627
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:50,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Or am I going to look at these streets and these sidewalks and the public safety that's really needed?

628
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And the concern of the public safety of the elementary schools that are there right now.

629
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame that they're spending millions of dollars.

630
00:48:58,483 --> 00:49:02,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Caviello, when he first ran, I'll never forget in his first term,

631
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:12,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made the comment that the schools, and that's when he got elected some 12 years ago, the schools were at a million dollar a year repair rate.

632
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:14,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's even more than that.

633
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That absolutely should have never, never happened in a million years.

634
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:18,762
[SPEAKER_02]: That's management.

635
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's poor management.

636
00:49:21,884 --> 00:49:28,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I just look back, I mean, you know, to the days when, you know, everybody,

637
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:31,950
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to get along.

638
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:42,538
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can remember you guys in meetings, you guys, back in the day, councils, they'd have their arguments, you'd go back and forth.

639
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:53,627
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the difference is when I watched the council years ago, when you saw things happening, and working with all these different departments,

640
00:49:54,637 --> 00:49:58,059
[SPEAKER_01]: it was all for Medford, like you were fighting for Medford.

641
00:49:58,899 --> 00:50:00,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And that always impressed me.

642
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to be honest, I don't see that anymore.

643
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,764
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it seems like everything's fragmented.

644
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:12,326
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a divide in the city.

645
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the reasons are.

646
00:50:15,508 --> 00:50:17,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's just a lot of division.

647
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:17,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sad.

648
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you know,

649
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:36,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me disappointed sometimes that, you know, we talked about a lot tonight and, you know, there's a lot of good that's still going on in this city, but we definitely need some change.

650
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:37,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some good people.

651
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know something, John?

652
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You say there's a lot of good in the city and there is.

653
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: There's much more good.

654
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:44,974
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many more good people than there are

655
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:52,664
[SPEAKER_02]: But the unfortunate part is when you serve in politics, what you basically see most of the time is what needs to be corrected.

656
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great to go to a council meeting and just every, oh, wasn't this great?

657
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:58,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary's kid got a scholarship.

658
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:00,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great to do that, but it's not happening.

659
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:06,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be abdicating your responsibility because you're supposed to be looking out for the city as a whole, okay?

660
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:13,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care whether you're a ward council or a council at large, no matter what you vote for, it's going to affect the city as a whole.

661
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I looked at it.

662
00:51:15,192 --> 00:51:17,192
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I looked at it, and I still look at it that way.

663
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:18,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, Bob.

664
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:22,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said at the start of the show, you guys served this city well.

665
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:31,438
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can go on for, geez, I don't know, a couple more hours with you guys, but unfortunately... Go ahead.

666
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,358
[SPEAKER_00]: John, can I add one thing, John?

667
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:34,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

668
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:36,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add just one quick thing?

669
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,602
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we have to remember, we elect Congress people to go up and work on national issues for us.

670
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:44,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We elect our U.S.

671
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:46,746
[SPEAKER_00]: senator to go up and work on national issues.

672
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:51,591
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent our council to work on local issues.

673
00:51:52,151 --> 00:52:01,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I'm concerned right now, this present council is more concerned about working on national issues and has forgotten about local issues.

674
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, on November 4th,

675
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:22,156
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a council that's going to reunite and take back and work on local issues and make that a number one priority, you have to look at Melanie Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick Giurullo, George Scapelli, Rick Caviello, Patrick Clerkin, Paul Donato Jr.

676
00:52:22,637 --> 00:52:28,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that are going to protect our neighborhoods and put Method first and work on local issues.

677
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:33,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And just my last point, John, I really want to thank you

678
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:39,529
[SPEAKER_00]: and your team for providing one of the only local access programs.

679
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:47,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you work with Bruce Patterson, who's been awesome to work with, Paul Garrity, yourself, Marco Cronali.

680
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:53,118
[SPEAKER_00]: What you guys are doing, really, I can't thank you enough.

681
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:54,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a local paper.

682
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:56,420
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no other way.

683
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,581
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a council that doesn't work for the people.

684
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:03,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show is doing yeoman's work and just getting out.

685
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:07,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, this is a show for the city, for the people.

686
00:53:07,307 --> 00:53:08,528
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more to it.

687
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:10,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And you welcome everyone on it.

688
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:13,851
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't take advantage, that's their problem.

689
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,672
[SPEAKER_00]: You welcome everyone on your show.

690
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:16,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you.

691
00:53:17,313 --> 00:53:20,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you, Michael, because we really do appreciate it.

692
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:23,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to repeat what you just said.

693
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:26,559
[SPEAKER_01]: We have invited everybody on this show.

694
00:53:28,562 --> 00:53:37,026
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, counselor, everyone that has anything to do with Medford, you know, all the politicians, whatever.

695
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:42,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some people came on and we welcomed everybody and that's it.

696
00:53:42,649 --> 00:53:43,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say.

697
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I appreciate.

698
00:53:46,554 --> 00:53:47,695
[SPEAKER_02]: John, you know what y'all like?

699
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:51,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all like Medford's Joe Rogan, okay?

700
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:53,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You are his podcast, okay?

701
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:59,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that you are, your group of folks are the only ones that have done anything, okay?

702
00:53:59,684 --> 00:54:02,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, listen, you know, Michael forgot one thing.

703
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentioned the six people

704
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:08,539
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the six people, the names there that are running.

705
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:14,002
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to forget that the people that they're running against have thousands of dollars.

706
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They have thousands of dollars coming in from all over the place.

707
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:28,248
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the people of Medford, if you're really serious about wanting to save your city and elect people that are independent, okay, you've got to get out and vote and vote for these seven people, you know.

708
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,629
[SPEAKER_02]: The shame to the whole thing is

709
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:33,770
[SPEAKER_02]: These folks, they don't own businesses.

710
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no idea what it means to pay a more, I mean, not a more, I mean, to pay the rent, to pay taxes, to pay insurance.

711
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make any sense.

712
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to go back to what I originally said.

713
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:46,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this.

714
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: When somebody comes to the podium and they're mistreated rudely, OK?

715
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:54,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Michael earlier said, sometimes they're even condescended.

716
00:54:55,396 --> 00:54:58,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, being a former member of this board for many, many years,

717
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:05,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And at times, not only were they disrespected, wasn't even allowed to speak, okay?

718
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:06,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's wrong.

719
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:07,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's wrong.

720
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they should all go.

721
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's happened to quite a few people, including myself.

722
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:17,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, listen, thank you guys.

723
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:20,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on the Charter Review Committee.

724
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:29,649
[SPEAKER_00]: The Charter Review Committee, comprised of residents of this community, spent two years of their life working to put together the charter.

725
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:31,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you like it or not, it's different.

726
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:31,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years.

727
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:34,113
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally got all their recommendations.

728
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:48,083
[SPEAKER_00]: They went up to the council, and the president of the council told the two chairmen, when they were going to go up there and speak after countless meetings, two years worth of work, you have two minutes to sum up what you did in two years.

729
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:49,644
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a disgrace.

730
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:50,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.

731
00:55:51,425 --> 00:55:53,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was there for that meeting, yeah.

732
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, yeah.

733
00:55:55,606 --> 00:56:05,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And John, the bigger part of that, the bigger part of that disgrace, what Michael was talking about, how they made a last minute deal that nobody even knows what the deal was, which changed the vote.

734
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:06,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

735
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

736
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:11,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, listen, we got to... What, are you going to go?

737
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:13,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got to call it a night, Bob.

738
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:17,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we're going to have to have you guys come back on to finish this.

739
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:24,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, you know, we sort of have time restraints, you know, but, uh... Time restraints?

740
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:25,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're not even in the studio.

741
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:26,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you?

742
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:28,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I still have time restraints.

743
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:30,058
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have to edit the show.

744
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still things we have to do, so... I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but I'm a firm believer in that studio issue.

745
00:56:38,464 --> 00:56:45,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent many hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars for that studio not to be open at nighttime and do things like this.

746
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:46,929
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's all about.

747
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:47,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

748
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not a nine-to-five job.

749
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:55,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it isn't but uh, you know, well that'll be taken up another time.

750
00:56:55,093 --> 00:56:57,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you, Bob Penta.

751
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, thank you Michael Marks.

752
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:04,977
[SPEAKER_01]: We really really appreciate having you on the the show.

753
00:57:05,097 --> 00:57:09,059
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was actually it was great talking to you guys.

754
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:11,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So uh with that

755
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:13,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you both.

756
00:57:13,353 --> 00:57:16,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the way you serve the city for all those years.

757
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:19,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me ask you, the next time I come on, will I get a blue background?

758
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,544
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make sure you get a background.

759
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:28,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come to the house and bring you one, Bob.

760
00:57:29,808 --> 00:57:30,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.

761
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:31,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night.

762
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:32,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, John.

763
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:33,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

764
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:34,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

765
00:57:34,112 --> 00:57:36,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to, once again, thank Bob.

766
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:42,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Penter and Michael Marks, thank you guys for joining us on the show.

767
00:57:43,806 --> 00:57:49,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just got a couple of announcements we've been asked to make.

768
00:57:49,951 --> 00:58:01,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is we want to let the audience know that if you need a ride to your polling place in order to vote, you can call this number, 781-858-0222.

769
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,393
[SPEAKER_01]: 4-0 and you will get a ride to vote.

770
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:30,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you need a ride to the polls in order to vote, that number is 781-858-0240 and they will actually take you to the polling place.

771
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:33,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to add this to everyone

772
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:37,750
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hear people say they're not into politics.

773
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:42,952
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm going to ask is it is time to educate yourself.

774
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:47,735
[SPEAKER_01]: The future of Medford, it depends on it.

775
00:58:49,216 --> 00:58:52,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just hope you get out and vote.

776
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:58,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to end with it's your civic duty to vote.

777
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:02,383
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, your vote matters, your vote

778
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: counts.

779
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:08,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the two messages I want to get out there.

780
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:13,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to take a minute to thank everyone who has been watching our show.

781
00:59:14,856 --> 00:59:16,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your feedback.

782
00:59:17,738 --> 00:59:22,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can honestly say it's been 90% positive.

783
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:23,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing.

784
00:59:23,983 --> 00:59:29,287
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of negatives, but that's part of it.

785
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:32,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take the negative, too.

786
00:59:33,457 --> 00:59:44,122
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to share a comment, if you're opening a new business, you have a business now, you represent an organization, you have an upcoming event.
