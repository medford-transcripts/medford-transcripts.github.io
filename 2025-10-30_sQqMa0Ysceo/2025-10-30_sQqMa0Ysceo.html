    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=30.22s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=37.822s">I</a>  am John Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=40.543s">The</a>  purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=49.546s">Today,</a>  we want to welcome two former Method City Councilors, Mr. Bob Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=58.405s">and</a>  Mr. Michael Motz. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=60.946s">And</a>  I will say this, they both serve the city of Medford very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=66.707s">And</a>  I want to thank you both for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=69.888s">Welcome</a>  to Method Happenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=72.168s">It's</a>  our pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=73.249s">It's</a>  our honor to have you guys on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=75.269s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=77.47s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=78.79s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=79.95s">OK,</a>  gentlemen, we're going to get right into, you know, the purpose of the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=84.972s">We're</a>  going to get into some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=87.468s">And,</a>  you know, the first question we're curious about, we wanna get started with, is we're gonna ask you both, if you can tell us what differences, okay, if any, do you see in this current council when comparing it to past city councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=112.745s">So</a>  in other words, what was different when you guys were Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=117.946s">You</a>  see any big differences? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=121.327s">And</a>  we'll start off with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=122.847s">And</a>  Bob, we'll start with you first, and then Michael, you can come in afterwards.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=127.888s">Well,</a>  the first thing that I've seen over the past four years, especially with this particular council, is how they treat the people when they come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=138.91s">And</a>  it's not very nice at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=141.237s">and</a>  I've been a product of what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=145.559s">They're</a>  not courteous. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=146.939s">They're</a>  not willing to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=148.94s">They</a>  have an agenda sometimes, many times, has nothing to do with the city of Medford, and when you try to correct them on that, they don't want to listen to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=156.723s">Also,</a>  the fact that they cut down the speaking times at the podium, another act that just doesn't speak well for good government, because good government <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=166.717s">as</a>  an elected official, you're supposed to just sit there, listen to what people have to say, and then get involved in your conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=174.422s">And</a>  that's, can I just detour one thing real quick, because it has something to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=180.185s">It</a>  has everything to do with what we just went through now, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=183.603s">to</a>  get onto your program, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=185.745s">Because</a>  when I was in the city council, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a class aid studio up in Method High School, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=194.571s">And</a>  to unfortunately have to do this late at night, not use that studio, that's there for the people for public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=201.076s">That's</a>  what it was there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=202.958s">And</a>  the city administration uncomfortably has made this very hard for people like you, who does a wonderful job in bringing both sides in, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=211.244s">not</a>  to be up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=213.325s">I'm</a>  just upset, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=215.526s">That's</a>  why we're not at the studio, okay?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=217.307s">All</a>  right, I can appreciate that, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=220.508s">Michael,</a>  anything you want to add?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=222.128s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, when I first got on the council, the council was known as the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=230.512s">It</a>  truly was the only place in the city that residents can go up, and at the time it was once a week, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=238.575s">which</a>  I think many people prefer that over every other week now, and residents could come up on a host of issues that impacted their daily life, and we as a council would open up, allow them to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=253.068s">You</a>  know, we had rules regarding time, but if someone took their time out of their schedule to come up there, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=259.334s">We</a>  were very gracious with allowing people to speak, and we never shut off people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=265.337s">I</a>  think Bob can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=267.198s">We</a>  let people vent, and sometimes they just wanted to come up and vent, but we gave them a forum, and I think that's what's lacking now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=275.583s">Residents</a>  are frustrated because they don't have a forum to speak, and when you get to speak, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=282.106s">You're</a>  cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=283.067s">You're</a>  rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=284.868s">Members</a>  of the council, certain members, are very rude and condescending. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=289.793s">And</a>  they really make people feel like they don't want to hear what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=294.897s">And</a>  when you get rid of the only forum in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=298.38s">I</a>  think that says a lot that people have nowhere else to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=302.803s">And</a>  in my opinion, if I was back in the council, that would be the first thing I would fight for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=309.587s">Increase</a>  public participation, allowing residents to get up and vent any of their concerns, and make it truly the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=320.775s">And</a>  that was, as you remember, Bob, Bob Mayorko used to say that all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=325.458s">This</a>  is the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=327.439s">And,</a>  you know, I always remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=329.14s">And</a>  I said, you know what, this is the one place they get to come up and speak and be heard and, you know, by their elected officials and give them the opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=340.767s">As</a>  an addition to that, John, hopefully, if a majority of these new independent candidates get elected, one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=350.018s">The</a>  first few things that they do is they bring back the weekly meetings, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=354.023s">And</a>  number two, they bring back the five-minute rule to let people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=357.467s">And</a>  if it means speaking more than once, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=360.13s">Listen,</a>  some of the issues that are going on right now in this city demands an awful lot of the people's input, because that, unfortunately, is what's causing this election to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=370.061s">They're</a>  not being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=371.462s">And</a>  you have this group of people that are on the council right now that only think one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=376.483s">They</a>  will not open up their brain to listen to an opposing opinion.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=380.904s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=383.444s">I</a>  appreciate what you guys are saying.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=387.025s">And</a>  if I could just add, John, they're using the agenda against residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=393.426s">And</a>  when I say that, you could be on the agenda and not be heard for four or five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=399.827s">And</a>  to me, if you have a group of residents that come up all on the same issue, there's no reason that would have never happened under our watch, myself or Bob Penter or the other members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=411.616s">If</a>  we knew there was a group of people there, we would always suspend the rules and allow them to speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=418.08s">They</a>  weren't waiting four or five hours to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=420.983s">Now</a>  it's being used, the council agenda is being used as a tool to stifle people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=426.687s">And</a>  that again is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=429.27s">In</a>  my opinion, these are the things that we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=432.593s">There</a>  were a host of changes that were made to the council rules, in my opinion, that do not benefit residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=441.5s">and</a>  allow for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=443.381s">And</a>  the new council that comes in, hopefully, will change a lot of those rules back to allow for more public participation, allow for people to get up there in a timely fashion and speak, and move the issues along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=456.59s">And</a>  that's not happening right now.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=459.672s">And</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=460.873s">I</a>  mean, I think that you guys hit some good issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=465.276s">And</a>  I have to agree with most of what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=469.42s">All</a>  right, so, you know, we'd like to get, you know, we have you both here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=474.504s">So,</a>  you know, we'd like to get your views on some current issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=478.747s">And,</a>  you know, the biggest issue that I see right now in this city, no matter where you go, people are talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=486.653s">We've</a>  talked about it on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=490.076s">Every</a>  candidate that we've had on, this is a very important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=497.336s">a</a>  lot of people are very concerned, and that is, you know, this proposed zoning in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=504.779s">You</a>  know, what do you guys, you know, one at a time, you know, just give us an idea, where do you stand with this zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=513.382s">You</a>  know, how do you feel about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=515.063s">Where</a>  do you think it's going? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=516.163s">We'll</a>  start with you, Michael, this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=519.544s">You</a>  know, what do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=521.685s">Where</a>  are we going?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=524.465s">So</a>  the major concern I hear right now, and there's a lot to zoning, if people don't know or not aware, zoning, in my opinion, is the lifeblood of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=535.773s">That's</a>  the backbone of a community, how it's zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=540.536s">And</a>  I think what's currently happening right now is <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=543.358s">The</a>  push from six members of the council, excluding George Scapelli, he's been very vocal about being opposed, not to zoning changes, but to the elimination of single family districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=558.707s">That's</a>  going to have such a major impact on the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=563.85s">If</a>  you look at the Lawrence estates, if you look at North Method, if you look throughout the community that have single family neighborhoods, the Brooks estates, and all of a sudden now zoning for single families is going to be gone and you're going to allow up to three, four, five units in each lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=583.763s">That</a>  makes for high density housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=586.546s">It</a>  makes for increased traffic, increased congestion, increased lack of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=594.052s">There's</a>  a host of concerns that everyone in this community should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=599.737s">And</a>  that's not to say we don't need additional housing, and in particular affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=605.679s">I</a>  think Chapter 40B, which is the state law that provides for building with affordable housing, that does increase the stock of affordable housing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=618.904s">Does</a>  it do enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=620.365s">That's</a>  up for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=621.845s">But</a>  right now, to change the fabric of this community, and let me just say, John, it doesn't just change single family areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=629.408s">I</a>  live in Wellington, and it changes two family areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=634.489s">So</a>  if you look at South Method, if you look at Wellington, Haines Square that has a lot of two families, they're talking about changing a two family into a four to six family. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=646.233s">And</a>  think about it, that just doesn't impact your neighborhood, that impacts infrastructure, water and sewer, that impacts school size, class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=658.12s">There's</a>  a lot of ramifications right now that I think every, that's the most pressing issue, I think every resident in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=667.089s">should</a>  be concerned and should really pay attention to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=671.691s">And</a>  in my opinion, I was elected 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=675.452s">By</a>  far, this is probably the most important, crucial issue that faces this community right now.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=682.615s">Yeah,</a>  I definitely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=686.116s">Everyone's</a>  talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=688.194s">And</a>  that was a great answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=689.875s">Bob,</a>  you want to add something to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=692.376s">I</a>  would, you know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=693.497s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=694.858s">The</a>  fact of the matter is this whole issue had its initial beginning a couple of years ago on the Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=701.602s">A</a>  lady by the name of Shoah Rodriguez, a great warrior for the neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=706.184s">was</a>  out there and they came to they eventually came to an agreement between the neighbors and as to what was being proposed in the city and the city council this city council wanted to go against it and they did and that suddenly it was a pushback okay but what they're proposing they were proposing to put you into a 4,000 square foot lot <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=726.643s">and</a>  they're allowing you, if this goes through anywhere, some one to three additional units. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=731.588s">They're</a>  also taking the 75-year-old homes that are in a particular district, and you'll be able to put two to three more in-house people in those 75-year-old homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=743.578s">The</a>  setbacks from the street in the back, they're changing all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=750.143s">Wrapping</a>  up what Michael is saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=752.563s">If</a>  even if a developer were to come in and this was going to take place, doesn't people realize that developers buying the property, so he's going to be paying a lot of money, then he's going to have to pay to develop the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=764.875s">So</a>  if you think you're going to sell that to a low or moderate income person, no, because he's going to want to get his money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=770.14s">That's</a>  for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=771.2s">And</a>  then add on to that, if it has an effect on the school system, for which it will, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=776.185s">all</a>  these people coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=777.306s">Somebody's</a>  going to have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=778.628s">And</a>  right now the school system is at max of these elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=782.371s">What</a>  are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=783.432s">So</a>  the planning here is absolutely ridiculous, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=787.116s">And</a>  once the mayor got a hold of it, I believe it was in August of this year, she sent a letter to the council and to the planning board to let's just push back <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=797.225s">She</a>  didn't realize, I believe she said she didn't realize that the pushback was so strong on the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=802.589s">And</a>  as a result of that, you know, it hasn't gone anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=805.951s">But</a>  the sad part is this, John, this is the sad part. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=809.534s">You've</a>  got seven independent candidates that are running and hopefully they get in there, at least the majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=815.678s">Because</a>  if they don't get in there, the unfortunate part is if four out of the seven get in there of the present city council, which are OR revolutionary, they're just going to go forward with this change in zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=827.849s">And</a>  this is going to really send the city into a tailspin. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=831.412s">You</a>  won't recognize Medford after this.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=833.354s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=833.614s">No,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=834.175s">It's</a>  not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=835.236s">And</a>  thank you guys for the answer.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=838.418s">Can</a>  I just add one thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=841.261s">Sure,</a>  Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=841.942s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=842.622s">just</a>  because it's important to know, I think, for the viewing audience, that this zoning initiative was on the fast track. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=851.545s">And</a>  there were countless meetings and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=854.226s">And</a>  people have spoken up that they were not just opposed to it, but they thought it required more investigation and more community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=866.149s">And</a>  it wasn't until the election started to approach that this current city council, six members, put it on hold temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=876.613s">And</a>  when I say temporarily, I mean temporarily, until after the election's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=882.215s">And</a>  in my opinion, if we reelect six of those members, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=886.717s">This</a>  zoning is going to fly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=888.378s">The</a>  very fabric of the city is going to change a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=893.002s">So</a>  we have a unique opportunity to stand up and say, you know what, we don't support this current zoning change. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=899.868s">We</a>  do support taking a look at zoning and how we can improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=903.571s">But</a>  we don't support this current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=905.631s">And</a>  the only way I tell people all the time to send a message is to look at the candidates right now that are talking about, hey, let's take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=915.074s">Let's</a>  carefully approach this zoning and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=919.294s">And</a>  if you look at George Scarpelli, Rick Caraviello, Patrick Lurken, Paul Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=924.976s">has</a>  spoken about it, Melody Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=933.279s">They've</a>  all spoken about it, saying that they're definitely going to review this and take a much longer approach to make sure every neighborhood's accounted for when any change, and every input is accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=949.588s">So</a>  I think that's key. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=951.109s">And</a>  when I tell people, because we still get calls, Bob Penter can attest to this, I get calls all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=957.513s">And</a>  I'll say what you probably do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=959.655s">If</a>  people say, Mike, what do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=961.056s">And</a>  I tell them, I say, you get the government you deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=964.599s">So</a>  if you want to reelect the same people, you're going to get this, especially the zoning, jammed down your throat.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=970.743s">It's</a>  going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=971.884s">We</a>  know it's going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=973.305s">John,</a>  one step further to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=975.167s">One</a>  step further to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=976.548s">If</a>  this were to go through, you could get a hodgepodge on the same street. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=982.753s">One</a>  side of the street will be zoned one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=984.674s">It</a>  depends on how the development is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=990.539s">This</a>  doesn't belong in Method right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=994.022s">They've</a>  got 1,000 new units coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=998.275s">And</a>  if the city was so concerned about affordable and low-income housing, they should be going out there and look at pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1005.037s">A</a>  classic piece for them to take would be the carbons on Salem Street, because they're getting that from nothing from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1012.6s">And</a>  make sure that the MBTA cleans the land first, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1016.141s">Yeah,</a>  you know, we could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1018.202s">Like</a>  Michael says, we could go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1019.643s">There</a>  are so many nuances, so many nuances to this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1023.286s">You</a>  know, like I said, right now you're allowed to put an additional 900 square feet unit on your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1029.61s">But</a>  if you can go, the state allows you, you can go back to the city, get a special permit from the city and you could put two on on your present existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1038.877s">So</a>  this is you've got to read what they're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1041.719s">It's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1042.399s">It's</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1043.9s">John,</a>  not to belabor it, but one other point because this is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1050.082s">Back</a>  several years ago when I was on the council, there was the housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1055.303s">This</a>  plan was commissioned by the city and we brought in a private consultant and they brought up creative ways in order for us to create more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1065.405s">And</a>  one of the major pieces was to look at, I believe at the time, there were some 300 and something odd lots in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1074.752s">And</a>  most of them were under the buildable size that you can do in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1081.658s">And</a>  at the time, the housing production plan was going to take these lots, either purchase the city or approach people that own these odd lots that can't build, and turn them into buildable lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1094.508s">for</a>  affordable housing and give an incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1097.832s">And</a>  so you're talking about a massive project, which would be another 300 or 400 additional affordable housing in the city on lots that are already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1109.745s">People</a>  can actually sell their lot off if I had a little piece of lot and build affordable housing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1116.107s">And</a>  there's been no consideration by this current council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1119.408s">They</a>  only want to come in and create high density housing and just jam things into people's neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1125.49s">That's</a>  not a way of doing it, John.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1127.371s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1128.231s">I</a>  agree with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1130.512s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1130.952s">You</a>  know, I want to keep moving on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1135.914s">We</a>  really probably we're trying to cover an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1139.24s">Um,</a>  the next big thing, uh, it's also on the ballot that that's going to be on the ballot is the proposed charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1147.962s">Um,</a>  you know, basically I don't want to get into too much detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1152.043s">Uh,</a>  you know, we've, we've talked about this quite a bit on this show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1156.164s">Uh,</a>  bottom line, are you in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1158.805s">Not</a>  in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1160.803s">uh</a>  you know why or why not and you know just try and be brief about it um then we'll start with you michael uh fail or not and and why why not the charter correct yes</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1175.971s">So</a>  I understand this is somewhat of a contentious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1180.375s">And</a>  when I was on the council, I was the first member of the council to bring forth a petition to be sent to the state legislature for a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1192.488s">And</a>  believe it or not, it passed four to three, I believe, at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1196.33s">It</a>  went up to the statehouse and sat in the, I think it was the home rule or local affairs committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1203.054s">I</a>  think it was the local affairs committee and sat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1205.476s">And</a>  we finally reached out after it was there for months and come to find out the chairman of the committee said he didn't think that the four to three vote was enough to move that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1217.382s">And,</a>  you know, it's a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1219.863s">We</a>  speak to the residents, you know, initiate this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1224.724s">But</a>  needless to say, it died within the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1229.925s">You</a>  know, I support the two years worth of work that was done by a lot of good people in this community that sat. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1238.028s">They</a>  had countless hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1239.968s">They</a>  met with countless people, countless boards and commissions, and came out with what I think a good working document and something that, is it perfect? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1250.771s">Absolutely</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1252.352s">But</a>  at this point, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1256.053s">And</a>  I think we have a decent document to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1259.534s">And</a>  for instance, WAD representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1262.215s">I've</a>  always supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1264.236s">I</a>  think it's important to make sure that every neighborhood, every ward has someone that you can say, hey, that's my city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1273.02s">I</a>  see him three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1274.921s">He</a>  lives in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1276.742s">I</a>  see him at Stop and Shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1279.623s">It's</a>  really bringing the city back to a real small neighborhood level. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1284.465s">And</a>  I think it's a good form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1286.867s">So</a>  I support most of what's in there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1291.051s">Am</a>  I happy with everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1292.472s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1293.213s">But</a>  this also calls for a periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1299.138s">It</a>  hasn't been looked at in 39 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1302.14s">and</a>  I think this is a good start and hopefully it is just the starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1307.081s">So</a>  I'm going to support it and I'm telling people that I know to give it a shot and then we can always look to tweak and improve going forward.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1315.084s">Thank</a>  you for the answer, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1316.564s">Bob,</a>  yourself, support it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1319.285s">Yes,</a>  no?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1320.885s">Not</a>  for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1321.906s">This</a>  is where Michael and I part ways because, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1327.201s">seriously,</a>  because I know a lot of work went into this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1331.002s">And</a>  having served for many years in this council, I was never even asked for my opinion by the group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1336.463s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1337.523s">Number</a>  two, Michael's for what councils? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1340.764s">I'm</a>  not for what councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1341.904s">I</a>  don't see any need to increase the annual budget by a minimum of $120,000 to add four more councils on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1349.626s">And</a>  then at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1351.275s">make</a>  the financial corrections in the council chamber to put the people in there.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1356.638s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1357.939s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1359.56s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1360.28s">Does</a>  that still work? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1361.601s">Point</a>  of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1362.722s">Yeah,</a>  it still works. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1364.082s">You</a>  see how I got Bob to stop talking quick? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1366.704s">No,</a>  but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1368.345s">Right</a>  away, it went in his head. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1369.586s">He</a>  said, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1370.606s">Yeah,</a>  good memories, Michael.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1372.367s">These</a>  are good memories.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1373.848s">So</a>  I'm not advocating to increase the budget line for Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1379.431s">It</a>  could be done very simply. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1380.872s">Right</a>  now, councils make, on an average, $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1382.953s">The</a>  large councils make $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1385.775s">The</a>  ward councils make $15,000, $17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1389.997s">I'm</a>  not advocating to give them additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1392.599s">I</a>  just think it's a better form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1394.38s">So</a>  I don't want people to believe I want to increase their salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1398.062s">That's</a>  not what I want.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1398.962s">Well,</a>  let's put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1400.343s">Whether</a>  it's $30,000 or $17,000, you're still going to be increasing the budget of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1405.526s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1406.147s">Number</a>  two, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1407.067s">They</a>  have a thing here on page eight of this new document, which is 54 pages long, that the city Councilors can submit expenses and their costs for being a Councilor during the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1419.893s">So</a>  let me remind everybody, including you, Michael, we were on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1424.082s">The</a>  IRS came in and said you could not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1426.724s">So</a>  whatever you were going to be getting for your expenses would have to just go into your salary and that's how it was corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1434.27s">But</a>  this is included in this particular budget, excuse me, in this particular piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1440.235s">The</a>  mayor is serving for 16 years, but there's no term limits for the city council or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1446.119s">And</a>  that's not right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1448.468s">The</a>  idea that the school committee would have two wards put together, why they couldn't agree to come to 11, I don't know, but two wards put together because in one of the two wards, there'll be a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1459.995s">So</a>  at least there'll be a school for every two wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1462.777s">That</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1465.079s">What</a>  happens if another ward and the future years decide they want to have a school? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1469.201s">Are</a>  they going to need a school because of the increase in the population? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1472.744s">They</a>  should have just left the school committee alone <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1475.308s">seven</a>  members at large, and then they decided to take the mayor off the school committee as to being the chairperson, because now she is nothing more than a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1485.46s">So</a>  think of this logically. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1487.142s">If</a>  she sits on that school committee as a member, but he or she in the future is also a mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1493.69s">That's</a>  the money person in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1495.312s">Do</a>  you think you're going to put a non-money person that's going to sit in the chair that's going to be arguing with the man who's going to be sitting on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1502.5s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1503.741s">Plus</a>  the fact, John, this has always been my belief. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1506.784s">When</a>  I ran for office, I knew what my duty was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1510.508s">I</a>  had to go out there and campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1512.65s">And</a>  I lost 36 pounds my very first time out there, ringing the doorbells and having people meet me, passing out my literature and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1521.152s">I'm</a>  a firm believer, if you really want something that bad, then go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1525.474s">Because</a>  that's how the city of Medford has gone on for so many years, since 1939. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1529.555s">They've</a>  had seven councils at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1533.156s">So</a>  by just increasing them, the next argument would be, let's just say I'm coming from Ward 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1539.583s">and</a>  watch two, three, and four don't like me, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1542.884s">For</a>  whatever the reason is, they don't like me, my style, whatever I'm proposing, I'm not gonna get anywhere with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1548.866s">But</a>  if I was at large, it affects the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1552.567s">And</a>  you could see that through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1554.228s">And</a>  I'll tell you another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1555.679s">The</a>  camaraderie that existed with seven Councilors in the past, even when Michael was there, at least we got along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1561.081s">We</a>  have differences of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1562.302s">This</a>  is just going to open up a ball of wax that somebody in Ward 8 needs something that's more important, and they're going to consider it more important than another ward in this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1571.145s">And</a>  then you're going to get into this political hangover. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1573.246s">It's</a>  just, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1575.687s">But</a>  no term limits for Councilors, no term limits for school committee, but the mayor gets 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1580.949s">I</a>  don't know where that comes from or where the logic to that came from.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1584.425s">Yeah,</a>  I listen, I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1587.37s">You</a>  both gave us honest answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1590.295s">You</a>  know, the only thing I can add to it, you know, to me, it's a living document. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1597.917s">And</a>  I know there's a lot, I agree, there's good in there, and there's things I don't like, and I think everyone's gonna find that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1605.301s">And</a>  you just gotta balance it out, but it is a living- But one important thing, this is a document that got passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1615.427s">I've</a>  got it right here, 50 some odd pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1618.088s">The</a>  taxpayers of this community should have gotten a copy of this document, be made available to them so they can read it.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1624.83s">They</a>  can't read it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1626.011s">They're</a>  not in the city clerk's office and they think you're talking Chinese to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1629.872s">Can</a>  we get a copy of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1631.152s">The</a>  registrar voters should have a copy for anyone that would want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1635.774s">Not</a>  everybody has a computer to go on and read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1638.614s">If</a>  it's such a good document and if the city thought it was such a, what would it be to spend a few thousand dollars and mail it out to every registered voter?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1647.337s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1647.817s">I</a>  don't have the answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1650.338s">But</a>  all right, we're going to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1654.019s">And</a>  it's nice to see that people can disagree and still get along, still go for a cup of coffee together.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1659.64s">That's</a>  why he's on the other side of you right now.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1666.221s">OK,</a>  so, you know, this is sort of a two part question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1670.402s">We've</a>  already had an override passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1674.443s">I</a>  don't know, you know, how you guys felt about it, but, you know, there's talk now, I mean, new high school, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1686.85s">Is</a>  it gonna be refurbished, the costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1690.733s">Is</a>  it gonna be override, debt exclusion? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1694.175s">You</a>  know, there's a whole lot more going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1699.077s">You</a>  know, what do you think about, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1704.672s">If</a>  you were on the council right now or the school committee or you had some kind of a say in this, which way do you think you're gonna go as far as how do you get a new school? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1717.574s">How</a>  do you do it?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1719.174s">What's</a>  the answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1721.155s">First</a>  of all, John, last year, when that override for $456 a year and keep going forward, the only way that's ever gonna come off is the council is gonna have to vote it out or put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1731.497s">Plus</a>  the fact, plus the fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1735.027s">that</a>  456 has got nothing to do with the tax rate that's going to be set. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1739.309s">So</a>  that's going to be 456 over and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1743.331s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is, you keep talking about, you'll tell me why there is a need for a new high school, because number one, if the school had been maintained like it should have been, you know, we went through this with all the elementary schools after so many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1757.45s">You</a>  know, they didn't take care of the schools and they're in almost the same condition right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1761.652s">But</a>  that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1762.572s">They</a>  put a new science lab in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1764.212s">They</a>  did a new section over there where the pool is and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1767.674s">The</a>  infrastructure of our city is in desperate need of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1771.675s">The</a>  high school is not falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1774.216s">You</a>  have to have a sense of priority of where you're going to go in the city and how you're going to spend your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1779.458s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1780.531s">So</a>  therefore, I would hope that this new council, when they come in, they look at that override and just saying, hey, when that override was passed on, it was $28 million in city monies and free cash sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1793.605s">And</a>  the override was only for $7.5 million worth of what was needed at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1798.571s">So</a>  they could have deducted that from the $28 million, but they didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1802.535s">And</a>  the unfortunate part is the at present city council doesn't think like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1806.918s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1807.618s">They</a>  have more on these national issues and more on these social issues and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1813.102s">They</a>  don't know how to think about Medford and where it's going and how to spend the dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1817.805s">And</a>  that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1818.845s">And</a>  that's why you're seeing, you're seeing seven new Councilors running this year, you know, to get back and take a grip back of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1826.35s">And</a>  we've got to do it because you just go up to keep, who do you think is going to keep paying for all these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1831.693s">It's</a>  the taxpayer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1833.255s">There's</a>  no doubt about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1834.537s">And</a>  that's just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1836.079s">Common</a>  sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1837.521s">Common</a>  sense when you're going to spend the taxpayer's dollars.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1842.989s">Thank</a>  you, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1843.71s">Michael,</a>  same question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1845.687s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's great to propose new things in the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1852.551s">I</a>  think everyone would like a new high school, a new fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1858.415s">Even</a>  our elementaries and middle schools now are 25 years old and they're getting up there to an age and doing a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1867.24s">I</a>  think what you have to do is make a case for it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1870.862s">And</a>  if we need a new high school, you have to say, what is enrollment like? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1875.565s">Do</a>  we anticipate enrollment increasing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1878.387s">That</a>  high school was built for, I think, 3,500 or 4,000 students, or maybe even more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1883.771s">It's</a>  at less than half capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1886.012s">right</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1886.992s">We</a>  just got a few years back school building assistance money, millions of dollars, like Councilor Penter said, to do science labs and so forth and rehab the high school pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1898.357s">And</a>  I know they put a new roof on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1900.758s">And</a>  we got 90% on the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1904.199s">I</a>  was on the school committee when we actually proposed going from neighborhood schools to centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1911.062s">And</a>  at the time, that was a huge issue because people liked having the neighborhood feel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1916.346s">Your</a>  kids walk to school, everything's within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1920.049s">It</a>  was a tough decision, but it was one that I think was warranted at the time because of the age and condition of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1927.374s">We</a>  were able to give our kids state-of-the-art facilities in these schools now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1931.817s">So</a>  I think, honestly, more due diligence needs to be had regarding the need for a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1938.622s">And</a>  as Councilor Penta mentioned, there's a lot of needs out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1942.784s">And</a>  I think looking at a new high school, you're talking anywhere from $200 million to maybe $300 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1949.867s">And</a>  then displacing kids throughout the course of a whole school year and maybe even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1957.53s">So</a>  there's a lot to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1960.01s">It</a>  sounds great, but I think, honestly, we need to see what type of reimbursement, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1965.454s">You</a>  know, if you work for the state, and Bedford just got $20 million from you, and then they're coming back saying, you know what, the $20 million you gave us, we're going to rip that down for the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1978.224s">to</a>  build a brand new school and say, we just gave you 20 million 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1983.266s">Now</a>  you want to rip it down? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1984.866s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1986.207s">I</a>  think there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1987.767s">I'm</a>  not opposed to a new school, but I really think that we haven't done our homework.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1992.829s">I</a>  want to jump in there because he brings up a good point, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1997.85s">The</a>  fact of the matter is every year the state auditor was supposed to have an audit of the expenditures of the new schools going forward until they were paid off, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2010.521s">And</a>  while that was supposed to be five percent of the budget of each school, five percent of the budget of each school, it never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2018.167s">And</a>  because it never took place, those schools just fell into disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2022.571s">You</a>  could go into the Brooks School and you'll find, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2026.21s">I</a>  don't want to name any schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2027.511s">I</a>  mentioned that.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2028.472s">I</a>  hear you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2029.173s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2029.893s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is this, John, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2032.495s">It's</a>  your elected people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2034.697s">And</a>  if they were doing their job, they would have realized that that money should have gone in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2039.08s">There</a>  should be no reason to be spending hundreds and millions of dollars to refurbish new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2043.884s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2045.425s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2045.886s">So</a>  before you get to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2048.055s">Drive</a>  down the streets, look at your potholes, look at your sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2051.917s">And</a>  if you want to talk about something crazy, talk about the crazy bump outs all over the city, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2057.76s">You</a>  tell me what that's going to serve.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2060.122s">You're</a>  jumping ahead to my next question, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2062.403s">Oh,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2063.323s">So</a>  thank you guys for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2065.665s">And</a>  I'm going to let you answer this first, Bob, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2068.426s">Go</a>  ahead, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2069.187s">Because</a>  that is the next question, because I, oh my god, it's like unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2077.973s">You</a>  know, talk about bump outs, Salem Street, the traffic in Medford, all the safe street programs, congestion, the sidewalks, the bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2093.162s">We</a>  need street repairs, sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2096.665s">I</a>  mean, we can go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2100.827s">So,</a>  you know, it's a lot to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2104.543s">And</a>  it seems like it's just too many things all coming</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2111.851s">Some</a>  of it has no rhyme or reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2115.132s">There</a>  again, you say a lot of things need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2117.673s">You</a>  can go back to maybe a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2119.734s">This</a>  all starts in West Method, coming from Winchester, not being able to take a right down Plaisted Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2125.977s">They</a>  put those stupid cones there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2127.837s">And</a>  as of last, a few months ago, what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2131.659s">By</a>  Osborne Road, they shut the street off. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2133.9s">For</a>  what reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2134.94s">okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2135.501s">And</a>  then you have Councilor Lazzaro, Emily Lazzaro, trying to take credit, trying to trade credit for the Salem Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2142.368s">If</a>  you look at that, the first snowstorm, that traffic is going to be backed up into 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2146.312s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2148.894s">You</a>  go on Main Street by Stanley Road or Stanley Street, they're all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2155.021s">Compare</a>  that to a legitimate <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2157.973s">street</a>  that needs to be, Riverside Ave, where Councilor Marks lives, that really needs to be rehabilitated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2163.978s">High</a>  Street, going from the Winter Street Rotary up there, you wonder what the hell is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2169.903s">Who's</a>  running the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2171.264s">And</a>  you know another stupid thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2172.986s">If</a>  you drive on Mystic Ave, okay, next to the Great Beer Garden, you go a little bit further down, they have a bike lane in the middle of a highway, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2182.854s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2185.675s">Whoever's</a>  running these things, department heads, you could go to, we won't get into it, but go ahead.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2190.677s">No,</a>  I hear you and I see that on Mystic Ave and I just, you know, geez, I haven't plowed a street in about 40 years, Bob, but I see those plow trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2203.381s">I'm</a>  like, I see these bump outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2205.862s">I</a>  see these rotaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2207.582s">I</a>  mean, fire trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2210.362s">I</a>  don't know how they're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2211.964s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2212.364s">Look</a>  what they did in Haines Square, for God's sake. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2216.367s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2216.907s">It's</a>  going to be extremely tough.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2219.029s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2220.27s">And</a>  where were the Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2221.29s">Not</a>  one Councilor speaking up, at least no matter how. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2224.273s">That's</a>  why you need a new direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2230.137s">The</a>  direction should be Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2231.958s">Let's</a>  do a Medford direction.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2234.0s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2235.16s">Michael.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2237.101s">Same</a>  thing, same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2239.002s">I'm</a>  not going to repeat the whole question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2240.764s">And</a>  I know you ride a bike, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2243.206s">It</a>  needs tires. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2245.407s">It</a>  needs tires, you're right, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2247.629s">But</a>  I know Michael does. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2249.41s">He's</a>  a bike rider. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2251.011s">He</a>  rides that bike a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2253.935s">What</a>  are your thoughts on what we're talking about, Michael?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2257.637s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2257.918s">So</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2259.058s">Traffic</a>  calming, when I was on the council, I'd probably say it was my number one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2265.822s">And</a>  I fought hard to make sure our crosswalks were relined every year and so forth, to use thermoplastic rather than paint, because it lasts five years and paint fades away after a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2279.05s">So</a>  you had a hard time on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2280.611s">Yeah,</a>  there are a lot of issues, but one issue, John, that no one talks about, and it has to do with roads and sidewalks, is right now we have roughly 730-odd streets in the community, of which more than half are private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2297.672s">And</a>  on a private way, the city will not typically get involved with the repair of a sidewalk, the cutting of a tree, the maintenance of a road, and you pay the same tax as everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2310.095s">So</a>  if I happen to live on a private way, I don't get any of those services, but I pay the same tax as the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2321.458s">And</a>  to me, that has to be a number one priority that every street in this city is treated the same, whether you're private or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2331.242s">If</a>  the city has to accept all the private ways as regular roads, they have to go through a process in order to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2340.006s">And</a>  there's no reason when people would call me up and say, hey, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2343.328s">How</a>  come they won't plow my street? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2345.188s">Or</a>  how come they won't fix a pothole or cut this tree down? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2349.05s">And</a>  I say, well, you live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2352.011s">That's</a>  unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2353.651s">It's</a>  unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2356.191s">I</a>  agree with Bob with the bump outs and everything else that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2359.592s">In</a>  order to get federal and state money, Barbara will remember, when we did projects in the city and got federal and state money, which was good, it always came with string attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2371.214s">And</a>  it was like on High Street, when we had to do away with all the parking, when we did all the different <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2378.675s">road</a>  safety concerns, we went up to the Brooks School and they made us put a bike lane there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2384.257s">And</a>  the bike lane led to nowhere, which was one of my big gripes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2388.618s">So</a>  all of a sudden you have a bike lane and then it ends when you get to the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2394.92s">You're</a>  on your bike and you're like, what do I do next? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2397.381s">Now</a>  I'm mixed in with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2399.782s">So</a>  there's a lot of things that we don't put an emphasis, there's zero dollars in our budget <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2407.164s">to</a>  repave streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2408.845s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2410.226s">All</a>  the money comes from whatever the state gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2415.268s">So</a>  there is zero money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2416.989s">So</a>  if we wanted to get serious, there should be a line item to pave a certain number of our 730 streets every year in order to, you know, make the changes that we want.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2427.315s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2427.655s">If</a>  you want to just jump in real quick, when he talks about the Greek school, there's an island down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2432.437s">If</a>  you go down High Street on the island, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2434.259s">And</a>  then the wintertime, that sign that's in the middle gets knocked down two or three times by cars and trucks because they put the island in there, but they don't paint the cement, the borders in orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2447.844s">They</a>  just leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2449.104s">I</a>  mean, you can just drive into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2451.785s">Simple</a>  little things like safety, you know, I mean, paint, what's a little orange paint, a yellow iridescent paint, something, you know, it's just... One driver, one bike, people riding bikes too, it's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2464.853s">You</a>  know, you talk about riding bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2466.674s">If</a>  the police department really wanted to make some money, they could do it with these bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2470.676s">These</a>  bikes should be registered and insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2472.818s">These</a>  guys driving down the street and girls going to red lights, cutting people off and then giving you the finger after they do it, please, please.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2481.984s">By</a>  the way, it's not just bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2483.987s">I</a>  see every kind of electric scooter and wheels. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2489.214s">I'm</a>  amazed at what's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2492.976s">It</a>  is, it's amazing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2494.977s">John,</a>  the city implemented a pilot program probably 10 years ago for permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2502.44s">10</a>  years ago, and we're still under the very same pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2507.302s">It's</a>  the longest pilot program in the history of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2513.184s">It</a>  shows you that we, not even a crawl, we're at a snail's pace in this city to get anything done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2520.227s">You</a>  know, it's really sad.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2522.629s">It</a>  really is.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2524.73s">John,</a>  this all reflects back on the council that is there right now, back to the days when Michael was there and I was serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2532.975s">I</a>  mean, you would get a few things done in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2536.577s">You</a>  cannot, the last four years, you could not go before this council, express your opinion, especially if it was contrary to theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2544.021s">And</a>  when they cut everybody from five minutes down to three, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2547.018s">Yeah,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2548.226s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2550.86s">Go</a>  on, street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2553.021s">We</a>  do street sweeping twice a year in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2556.423s">Surrounding</a>  communities do it weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2558.845s">There's</a>  no reason why we do our thoroughfares, but the neighborhoods, I live near Wellington, the debris that flows up from Dunkin' Donuts and all the stores down there, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2573.493s">There's</a>  no reason why we can't have a street sweeping program, really.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2577.996s">It'd</a>  be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2579.941s">You</a>  know, I'm going to have, I got one last thing for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2583.062s">And,</a>  uh, uh, you know, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2586.984s">I,</a>  I, I, I've enjoyed this show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2589.305s">I</a>  have, um, um, so, you know, I wanted to bring up, uh, you know, the police, the fire departments, uh, you know, we, we know, well, I don't know, but it seems to me, I mean, the fire department is like, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2609.082s">for</a>  whatever reason, they've been put on a back burner in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2613.445s">You</a>  know, they need a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2616.587s">There's</a>  so many things, but, you know, let's talk a little bit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2622.171s">The</a>  fire, the police, you know, what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2625.994s">I</a>  don't know who's got a contract, who doesn't anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2630.416s">But</a>  there's a lot going on with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2633.839s">You</a>  know, Michael, you mentioned it earlier, so we'll go to you first. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2637.66s">I</a>  mean, you know, the fire department, I guess they, you know, they need a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2643.306s">They</a>  deserve a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2644.667s">What</a>  do you think?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2646.789s">Well,</a>  when I was a member of the council, myself, Bob Penter and the rest of the councilors, we did a tour of all the fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2654.537s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2655.852s">I</a>  would venture to say that there's not one council except for George Scarpelli that's been in all our fire stations now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2664.422s">And</a>  really, many of them were in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2666.984s">They're</a>  90, 100 years old, some of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2671.213s">And,</a>  you know, many of them lack just the basic amenities, like the showers and the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2676.977s">And</a>  these are places where we're telling a brave man and woman that spent 24 hours a day, you know, back to back days. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2686.904s">you</a>  know, when you go in the kitchen, you know, is very close to the apparatus, which, you know, leads to a lot of different concerns, health concerns, fire safety equipment that they use, their coats and so forth, need the proper cleaning after a fire for the soot and everything else because of the carcinogens and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2709.623s">So</a>  there's a lot of issues that really need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2713.046s">And</a>  when it comes time <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2716.148s">You</a>  know, I've always supported our brave men and women in the fire and the police, and they're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2722.172s">When</a>  you need someone, they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2724.474s">When</a>  you have a concern, the fire department's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2727.195s">When</a>  you have a concern, the police department's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2729.697s">Our</a>  DPW, I mean, you could go through the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2732.999s">You</a>  know, our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2735.161s">We</a>  have a lot of good municipal employees, but unfortunately, I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2741.785s">A</a>  lot of their concerns are not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2745.49s">And</a>  even when it comes to properly paying them, I think there's a lot that can be done to, sometimes you can't show it monetarily, but you show it in other ways that you're appreciative of what they do for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2761.627s">And</a>  part of it is giving them a facility which they can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2764.95s">Equipment,</a>  cars, trucks, everything they can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2769.974s">So</a>  that's where I stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2772.036s">I've</a>  always been a big advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2774.718s">Those</a>  are difficult jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2776.419s">In</a>  this day and age, they're even more difficult.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2781.924s">It's</a>  a tough thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2783.625s">It's</a>  a much more complicated job, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2786.928s">Bob,</a>  anything you want to add?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2789.072s">You</a>  also have your first responders in there, you know, and yeah, they do the first respond, they do just not a lot because he basically hit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2797.835s">Firstly,</a>  me if I were back in City Hall, my concern would be the contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2802.717s">There's</a>  no reason to have contracts go over and beyond <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2807.663s">their</a>  due dates of when they should be renewed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2810.265s">You</a>  negotiate a contract for four years, whatever it is, once it's done, you should just go right into it, not wait until maybe six months before. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2820.812s">And</a>  then when you go to these contracts and you go to these meetings and you hear both the fire and the police say, someone doesn't show up and that just pushes it back and pushes it back and for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2832.181s">I</a>  think there needs to be a new direction that's looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2835.543s">personally</a>  with the council and the fire and the police and anything that does with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2841.346s">Because</a>  that's the mainstay. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2843.827s">If</a>  you don't have a safe city, what do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2846.748s">You</a>  have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2847.789s">You</a>  can say anything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2851.01s">DPW,</a>  do they have enough people? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2853.211s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2853.912s">It</a>  seems like they have enough equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2856.093s">But</a>  if you look at the issues, the guys who turn around and say that they're being told to go here, there, and everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2862.088s">You</a>  know something, John, I'm just going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2864.49s">Sometimes</a>  I repeat myself and I apologize, but I don't apologize because I don't like to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2870.193s">I</a>  don't like to say the same thing over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2872.875s">And</a>  if this administration, and I don't know how they're running it, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2877.835s">would</a>  take more of an active position with the council and start to share what the needs are and what the concerns are and what the finances might be or has to be or what it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2889.526s">And</a>  yes, that's one of the things they do address in the new charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2892.528s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2893.229s">I'm</a>  glad they put it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2896.023s">It's</a>  not going to get corrected unless there's a meeting of the minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2900.044s">Why</a>  should we, sometimes when you are there, have somebody come in and they start talking about, you know, their concerns for the city, you know, and they'll turn around and say, well, we don't want to say anything in this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2912.227s">But</a>  it bothers them, you know, and that's just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2916.948s">It's</a>  the whole idea of having communication and common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2920.709s">If</a>  we can afford it, we can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2922.531s">The</a>  best example, am I going to spend almost $300 million for high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2926.454s">Or</a>  am I going to look at these streets and these sidewalks and the public safety that's really needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2931.197s">And</a>  the concern of the public safety of the elementary schools that are there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2935.601s">It's</a>  a shame that they're spending millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2938.483s">Rick</a>  Caraviello, when he first ran, I'll never forget in his first term, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2943.651s">And</a>  he made the comment that the schools, and that's when he got elected some 12 years ago, the schools were at a million dollar a year repair rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2952.177s">And</a>  now it's even more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2954.159s">That</a>  absolutely should have never, never happened in a million years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2957.901s">That's</a>  management. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2959.042s">That's</a>  poor management.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2961.884s">I</a>  just look back, I mean, you know, to the days when, you know, everybody, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2970.789s">seem</a>  to get along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2972.55s">You</a>  know, I can remember you guys in meetings, you guys, back in the day, councils, they'd have their arguments, you'd go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2983.639s">But,</a>  you know, the difference is when I watched the council years ago, when you saw things happening, and working with all these different departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2994.637s">it</a>  was all for Medford, like you were fighting for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2998.899s">And</a>  that always impressed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3001.02s">And</a>  I got to be honest, I don't see that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3004.702s">It's</a>  just, it seems like everything's fragmented. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3009.385s">You</a>  know, there's a divide in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3012.346s">I</a>  don't know what the reasons are. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3015.508s">But</a>  there's just a lot of division. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3017.209s">And</a>  it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3017.949s">It</a>  just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3020.378s">It</a>  makes me disappointed sometimes that, you know, we talked about a lot tonight and, you know, there's a lot of good that's still going on in this city, but we definitely need some change. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3036.729s">We</a>  need some good people.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3037.909s">Do</a>  you know something, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3039.45s">You</a>  say there's a lot of good in the city and there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3041.832s">There's</a>  much more good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3043.253s">There</a>  are many more good people than there are <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3045.381s">But</a>  the unfortunate part is when you serve in politics, what you basically see most of the time is what needs to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3052.684s">It</a>  would be great to go to a council meeting and just every, oh, wasn't this great? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3056.865s">Mary's</a>  kid got a scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3058.566s">It</a>  would be great to do that, but it's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3061.147s">And</a>  that would be abdicating your responsibility because you're supposed to be looking out for the city as a whole, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3066.969s">And</a>  I don't care whether you're a ward council or a council at large, no matter what you vote for, it's going to affect the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3073.951s">And</a>  that's how I looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3075.192s">That's</a>  how I looked at it, and I still look at it that way.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3077.212s">I</a>  know that, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3078.233s">Like</a>  I said at the start of the show, you guys served this city well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3084.635s">You</a>  know, I can go on for, geez, I don't know, a couple more hours with you guys, but unfortunately... Go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3091.658s">John,</a>  can I add one thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3093.618s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3094.679s">Can</a>  I add just one quick thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3096.64s">You</a>  know, I think we have to remember, we elect Congress people to go up and work on national issues for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3102.982s">We</a>  elect our U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3104.223s">senator</a>  to go up and work on national issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3107.226s">We</a>  represent our council to work on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3112.151s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned right now, this present council is more concerned about working on national issues and has forgotten about local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3121.701s">So</a>  in my opinion, on November 4th, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3124.243s">If</a>  you're looking for a council that's going to reunite and take back and work on local issues and make that a number one priority, you have to look at Melanie Tringali, Nate Merritt, Nick Giurullo, George Scapelli, Rick Caraviello, Patrick Clerkin, Paul Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3142.637s">Those</a>  are the people that are going to protect our neighborhoods and put Method first and work on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3149.302s">And</a>  just my last point, John, I really want to thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3154.165s">and</a>  your team for providing one of the only local access programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3160.009s">I</a>  know you work with Bruce Patterson, who's been awesome to work with, Paul Garrity, yourself, Marco Cronali. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3169.535s">What</a>  you guys are doing, really, I can't thank you enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3173.518s">We</a>  don't have a local paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3175.319s">We</a>  have no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3176.64s">We</a>  have a council that doesn't work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3179.762s">Your</a>  show is doing yeoman's work and just getting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3183.885s">Like</a>  you said, this is a show for the city, for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3187.307s">There's</a>  nothing more to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3189.388s">And</a>  you welcome everyone on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3190.909s">If</a>  they don't take advantage, that's their problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3193.891s">You</a>  welcome everyone on your show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3196.092s">And</a>  I want to thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3197.313s">I</a>  want to thank you, Michael, because we really do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3201.136s">And</a>  I do want to repeat what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3203.577s">We</a>  have invited everybody on this show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3208.562s">you</a>  know, Councilor, everyone that has anything to do with Medford, you know, all the politicians, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3217.046s">And,</a>  you know, some people came on and we welcomed everybody and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3222.649s">That's</a>  all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3223.77s">So,</a>  but I appreciate.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3226.554s">John,</a>  you know what y'all like? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3228.295s">Y'all</a>  like Medford's Joe Rogan, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3231.278s">You</a>  are his podcast, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3233.519s">Because</a>  that you are, your group of folks are the only ones that have done anything, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3239.684s">You</a>  know, listen, you know, Michael forgot one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3243.887s">He</a>  mentioned the six people <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3246.218s">you</a>  know, the six people, the names there that are running. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3249.319s">They</a>  seem to forget that the people that they're running against have thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3254.022s">They</a>  have thousands of dollars coming in from all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3258.023s">That's</a>  why the people of Medford, if you're really serious about wanting to save your city and elect people that are independent, okay, you've got to get out and vote and vote for these seven people, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3268.808s">The</a>  shame to the whole thing is <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3272.109s">These</a>  folks, they don't own businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3273.99s">They</a>  have no idea what it means to pay a more, I mean, not a more, I mean, to pay the rent, to pay taxes, to pay insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3283.052s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3284.733s">But</a>  I'm going to go back to what I originally said. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3286.553s">It's</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3287.574s">When</a>  somebody comes to the podium and they're mistreated rudely, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3292.295s">And</a>  as Michael earlier said, sometimes they're even condescended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3295.396s">And</a>  I, being a former member of this board for many, many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3299.491s">And</a>  at times, not only were they disrespected, wasn't even allowed to speak, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3305.756s">That's</a>  what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3306.917s">That's</a>  what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3307.937s">That's</a>  why they should all go.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3309.559s">Yeah,</a>  and that's happened to quite a few people, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3313.802s">But,</a>  you know, listen, thank you guys.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3317.405s">Go</a>  on the Charter Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3321.043s">The</a>  Charter Review Committee, comprised of residents of this community, spent two years of their life working to put together the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3329.729s">Whether</a>  you like it or not, it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3331.311s">Two</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3332.171s">They</a>  finally got all their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3334.433s">They</a>  went up to the council, and the president of the council told the two chairmen, when they were going to go up there and speak after countless meetings, two years worth of work, you have two minutes to sum up what you did in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3348.583s">That's</a>  a disgrace.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3349.944s">Yeah,</a>  it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3351.425s">And</a>  I was there for that meeting, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3353.625s">I,</a>  you know, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3355.606s">And</a>  John, the bigger part of that, the bigger part of that disgrace, what Michael was talking about, how they made a last minute deal that nobody even knows what the deal was, which changed the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3366.05s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3367.03s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3367.991s">Hey,</a>  listen, we got to... What, are you going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3371.852s">Yeah,</a>  we got to call it a night, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3373.593s">Like</a>  I said, we're going to have to have you guys come back on to finish this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3379.411s">Yeah,</a>  we, you know, we sort of have time restraints, you know, but, uh... Time restraints?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3384.074s">Well,</a>  you're not even in the studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3385.575s">Where</a>  are you?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3386.196s">I</a>  know, but I still have time restraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3388.457s">We</a>  still have to edit the show.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3390.258s">There's</a>  still things we have to do, so... I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but I'm a firm believer in that studio issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3398.464s">We</a>  spent many hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars for that studio not to be open at nighttime and do things like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3405.849s">That's</a>  what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3407.21s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3407.97s">Yeah,</a>  it's not a nine-to-five job.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3410.471s">Yeah,</a>  it isn't but uh, you know, well that'll be taken up another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3415.093s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3418.114s">Um,</a>  thank you Michael Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3420.595s">We</a>  really really appreciate having you on the the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3425.097s">It</a>  was it was actually it was great talking to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3429.139s">So</a>  uh with that <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3432.413s">Thank</a>  you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3433.353s">Thank</a>  you for the way you serve the city for all those years.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3436.556s">Well,</a>  let me ask you, the next time I come on, will I get a blue background?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3441.521s">We'll</a>  make sure you get a background. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3445.864s">We'll</a>  come to the house and bring you one, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3449.808s">Thank</a>  you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3450.749s">Have</a>  a great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3452.11s">Thanks,</a>  John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3453.311s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3453.851s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3454.112s">I</a>  just want to, once again, thank Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3458.802s">Bob</a>  Penter and Michael Marks, thank you guys for joining us on the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3463.806s">I</a>  also just got a couple of announcements we've been asked to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3469.951s">And</a>  one of them is we want to let the audience know that if you need a ride to your polling place in order to vote, you can call this number,
